WEBVTT

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:21.355
[chuckle] It seems that I've
found you at last.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.158
It took me a while... Lord
Toneri Otsutsuki.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.564
So you've finally arrived,
Celestial Being.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:35.302
Come, now. Why stand on
formality? We are from the same
clan!

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:39.940
I thought the Otsutsuki Clan's
fate was going to reach an end
with me.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:45.112
Quite the contrary... The main
family of the Otsutsuki Clan
doesn't feel that way.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:51.752
Main family...? If they really
exist, why did they forsake us
for a thousand years?

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:56.924
We saw everything. The incident
involving the woman with the
Byakugan was quite unfortunate.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:57.991
[grunt]

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.294
(URASHIKI) <i>You endured such</i>
<i>humiliation... And yet...</i>

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:06.133
you still continue to risk your
life for that planet. I really
<i>do have to hand it to you.</i>

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.837
However, this means that you're
betraying the clan.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.275
You may believe that you made
the very first move because of
what you did to that woman's

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.609
son...

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.011
<i>But that was hasty...</i>

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:21.949
You act like you know
everything... But you never came
until today.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.017
What would you know
about that planet?!

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.387
You're right. We don't know.

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:28.989
[gasp]

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.527
And that is exactly the reason
why we were dispatched here.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.395
"We" were...? You mean...?

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.000
Well, let's leave it at that.
Now, about this fight... I'm up
for it...

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.936
[pained gasps]

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.373
[gasp] A... Time Freeze?!

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.275
[gasps]

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.511
[chuckles]

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:54.515
I don't have the authorization
to actually kill a member of the
clan.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:55.449
So don't worry.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.687
Just enjoy your stay at the
Palace of the Dragon King for
the next ten thousand years.

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:02.122
Well. Now, then...

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:05.592
I hope I get to reel in a big
catch! [laughing]

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.393
No!

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.262
Stop!

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.571
Boruto isn't strong enough just
<i>yet!</i>

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:20.574
<i>Boruto...</i>

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.978
Huh? [grunt]

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:29.616
Hmmm...

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.988
[chattering]

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:21.028
When you look back on the events
of the Fourth Great Ninja War...

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.064
do you have any thoughts that
you'd like to share?

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.599
Hey, look! It's Lord Hokage!

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.436
I don't think there are a lot
of....

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:30.370
What's he doin'?

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:31.305
But anyway...

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.676
What's most important is to
communicate so people know
everything that happened...

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:36.243
you know?

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:37.711
Yes, you're right.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.551
As Seventh Hokage Naruto Uzumaki
just said, our current peace was
reached after many wars.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:48.956
But we must never forget that
this peace was made possible by
<i>the sacrifice of...</i>

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:50.757
many, many shinobi.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.793
So to preserve this hard-won
<i>peace...</i>

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:57.364
...we must make sure to teach
this history to the youth, to
<i>the next generation.</i>

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:58.432
[chattering]

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.937
Yeah, we got all of that
already! I've heard it so often
that it's become a real drag...

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.373
I know! It's even in our text
books.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.343
(NEWSCASTER) Now, we turn our
attention to the Chunin Exams...

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:13.514
<i>which the five villages have</i>
<i>agreed to sponsor jointly for</i>
<i>the first time...</i>

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.249
So tell me...

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:21.054
do you have any advice to give
to all the genin who are going
to be participating this year?

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.523
Hmmm.... Well, uh...

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:24.525
Remember these three things!

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:25.792
Three things?

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.528
Teamwork and perseverance...

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.529
And...

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:29.763
Uh...

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.732
That's it! Good luck to you all!

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.636
[chuckle] Uh... that was only
two things...

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.940
Anyway, thanks so much for those
inspiring words.

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:45.445
And a big thanks to all of you
out there for joining us live
for our discussion today!

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.415
And thanks again for coming
on the show, Lord Hokage.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:48.849
Sure thing!

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:49.249
[gasp]

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:54.655
Well, it seems that Lord Hokage
is just as busy as ever!

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:58.358
I can't believe he had his
Shadow Clone do the interview!
Man...

00:05:58.392 --> 00:06:00.327
Lord Hokage is just so amazing!

00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:06.099
<i>At this rate...</i>

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.369
...I won't be able to change a
<i>thing.</i>

00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:10.637
[excited gasp]

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.542
For practically forever, I never
even thought about becoming a
ninja. But here I am...

00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:17.077
about to become a chunin!

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:21.181
Look, don't get ahead of
yourself. You can celebrate
after you actually pass.

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:25.385
Oh, yeah... we still have the
Exams to get through...

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.957
Hey Boruto... Don't do anything
stupid until we get our
recommendation letters, alright?

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.793
No pranks for the time being,
huh?

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:36.797
Yeah, about all that...
Honestly, I couldn't care less
about any of it.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.098
Huh?

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.568
Becoming chunin or jonin... It's
kinda like having a license,
right?

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:47.241
Why should we get so hung up on
rules that people from a long
time ago came up with?

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:51.011
I mean, we oughta just go for it
and become even greater ninja!

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:53.380
Huh? What do you mean "even
greater?"

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.081
Well, you know...

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:58.018
Kinda like Sasuke.

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:02.022
Huh? You talking about
Sarada's dad?

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:06.527
He doesn't take orders from
anyone. He battles powerful
enemies on his own terms.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.196
Now I know there are ninja like
that.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.765
They say he's real mysterious,
too!

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.034
There's a lot that's cool about
him!

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:17.070
It's way cooler than going on TV
<i>and rambling on.</i>

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:19.139
[sighs]

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.612
Look, Boruto... why do you gotta
go making things complicated
now?

00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:27.781
Oh, come on! I'm not at all!

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:32.486
I got into the Academy and
decided to become a ninja with
all you guys, didn't I?

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.721
That's totally for real. You
can't deny that.

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:36.323
It's just that...

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:41.228
...I've been doing a little
thinking lately about some other
ways that I can become even

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:44.298
cooler. I just wanna do things
my own way, that's all.

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:49.436
[sigh] You do know... the guys
who wanna show off are the only
ones who say things like that...

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.103
don't you?

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.805
No. that isn't it!

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:53.440
Oh? Then what is it?

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.143
Like I said, I wanna do things
my way.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.711
Well, later!

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:02.716
Ugh, damn it. Sometimes he's
such a drag.

00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:10.257
(MOEGI) <i>Well, here are the</i>
<i>application forms for the</i>
<i>upcoming Chunin Exams!</i>

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.394
So, this means that you're
officially recommending us,
right?

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:14.761
Well, yeah.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.700
All of your hard work has
already been acknowledged which
means I can breathe a little

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:20.033
easier.

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.070
Well... there were some times
when things got chaotic...

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:26.540
Boy, I'll say... They sure do
work us genin to the bone.

00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:31.044
Oh, come on! If you don't want
it, I can take the
recommendation back!

00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:34.381
No! I never said we didn't want
to take the Exams!

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:35.015
Right, Cho-Cho?

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.852
Huh? Did you just say you didn't
want to chew on eggs n'ham?

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:43.056
(INOJIN) <i>No, we're talking about</i>
taking the Chunin Exams! Go get
<i>your ears checked!</i>

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.194
(CHO-CHO) <i>Ohhh! Next time we go</i>
<i>to BBQ you'll pick up the</i>
<i>check?!</i>

00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:49.630
(INOJIN) <i>Ugh, you're not even</i>
<i>listening!</i>

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:53.800
...the thing about pawns,
anything is possible.

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:59.206
So, it's "to be or not to be",
huh? In the end, it's all up to
you...

00:08:59.239 --> 00:08:59.506
Huh?

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:04.344
Oh, it's nothing. Anyway, let's
get this over with and become
chunin.

00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:07.181
Taking exams over and over again
is such a drag.

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:08.682
Yeah, I agree! I mean...

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:14.188
having to take exams all of the
time is only gonna cut into the
prime of my youth!

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:16.356
[chuckle] This is the prime? How
sad!

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:16.690
[sigh]

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:19.993
(CHO-CHO) Huh?! What did you
just say to me?! You know what?

00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:22.329
<i>Maybe you need to go and get</i>
<i>your eyes checked!</i>

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:29.002
I'm sorry... You've been so busy
sending out clones for this
Zetsu thing.

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:32.039
[chuckle] I'm okay; don't worry
about it.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.309
The Chunin Exams are coming up
soon. I'll manage somehow.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.710
Huh?

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:40.714
(NARUTO) <i>Oh! Katasuke!</i>

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:42.516
What do you need?

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:45.052
Well, you see...

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.622
As the Head of the Scientific
Ninja Tool Team, I have a
request to make, Lord Seventh.

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:50.023
Oh? What is it?

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.894
For the upcoming Chunin Exams,
we'd like your authorization to
use...

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.829
...the ninja tool our team made!

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:56.730
Huh?

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.167
Oh, that's right! I read the
report a while ago.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.536
It seems that they've made
considerable progress lately.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.706
We have! And they're now...
battle-ready!

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.042
Ohhh!

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:13.013
That was a Wind Style jutsu...
You know, that's actually pretty
interesting...

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.848
[nervous laughing]

00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:17.184
Isn't it?

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:20.354
You just have to change the
cartridge, and you can use any
jutsu you want!

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:21.321
Oh, I see...

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:25.192
Then the genin won't have to go
through such harsh training...

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.327
and they'd have more ninjutsu to
use!

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:29.296
<i>What do you think?</i>

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:32.566
Their performances would be more
<i>elaborate as well!</i>

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:37.337
Hmmm... Thanks for showing us,
Katasuke. But I can't approve
it.

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.239
Huh?

00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:43.243
The Chunin Exams are not a
"performance". Their purpose is
to nurture shinobi.

00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:46.446
All the more reason to use this
Scientific Ninja Tool then!

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.849
It was invented for the modern
shinobi.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:54.221
Taking the easy way out on a
test to measure their skills
will only end up shortchanging

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:54.321
them.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:55.355
Yeah, that's true.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:56.256
I get it!

00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:00.494
But there's also a school of
thought that says masterfully
using copied jutsu...

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:04.231
just like the Sixth Hokage,
is the mark of an outstanding
ninja, too.

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:06.700
Yes, you're right-if that power
comes from inside.

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:09.303
But...

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.506
the whole purpose of the Chunin
Exams is to measure the strength
that each individual genin's

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:13.407
managed to cultivate.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.510
Oh, I see...

00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:18.178
Excuse me...

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:18.712
[sigh]

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:25.719
Do you think I was too rude
to him?

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:29.356
Don't worry about that. You're
absolutely right about this one.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.725
Hmmm... Okay...

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:37.731
[sigh]

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:42.536
When will Lord Seventh
understand? Will he ever get it?

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.073
[chuckling]

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:49.309
Technology must be used to make
<i>things efficient!</i>

00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:51.512
What's wrong with that?

00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:56.316
The Young Lord understands it
much more clearly.

00:11:57.518 --> 00:11:59.520
[gasp] No, I mustn't...

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:04.858
No, I should know better! I'm a
scientist. I have to remain
optimistic!

00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:09.096
Oh, that's right. The Young Lord
asked me for some data for that
game...

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.364
Hm?

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:11.732
[gasp]

00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:17.271
Aw, yeah!

00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:19.606
I stopped that boss's attack
with one shot!

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.710
What?! How?! Your character got
super strong all of a sudden...

00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:24.478
He-he!

00:12:26.547 --> 00:12:29.550
I'm ready now, Boruto. I'm just
waiting on you.

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:31.318
(BORUTO) <i>Kay! Sorry!</i>

00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.958
Hold on... How'd your stats get
so high?

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.861
Awwww... You used something,
didn't you, Boruto?

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:42.963
Yeah, so what if I did?

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:46.133
If I use it, it's really easy to
defeat the boss.

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.535
Here. I can give you my data,
too.

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:49.703
Hm?

00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:53.941
Seriously, Boruto? This is a
cheat...

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:56.243
Although your level is
impressive...

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.111
Alright... I think I'm done.

00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:03.483
This game is really only fun
because I have to sneak away
from Mom to play it.

00:13:03.517 --> 00:13:07.254
Oh, come on, Shikadai! Don't be
so boring! Isn't it a real drag?

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.157
I mean... why play if it's not
to win?

00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:11.325
Hm?

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.263
So you're an expert at video
games, too, huh?

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.799
I brought an application for
you. Here!

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:20.467
Look, what do you want, Mitsuki?

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:23.770
I already told you I'm not
interested in doing that.

00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:25.038
Oh? Are you serious?

00:13:25.072 --> 00:13:26.273
Yes, I understand that...

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:29.543
Damn it. What is going on with
you, Boruto?

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:33.947
If that's truly the way you
feel, then fine. I don't really
care either way.

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.349
<i>But are you sure?</i>

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:36.383
Hmph.

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:38.619
(SARADA) <i>Of course it's not</i>
<i>okay!</i>

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:42.589
I was worried, so I came down
here, and this is what you have
to say?!

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:44.625
And Mitsuki's being
totally useless, too!

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.026
My dream's to become Hokage.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:50.097
Are you really telling me that
you're going to destroy my
dream?!

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.965
[grunt] Just give me a break!

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:56.403
I can't just keep wasting all of
my time being stuck as a genin,
you know!

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.273
I've got to pass the Exams! And
soon!

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:01.008
You make it sound like it'll be
easy!

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:01.642
Yeah! Right?

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.779
So what's it gonna be? Are you
gonna help me or get in my
way?

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:10.117
Look, I'm not gonna get in your
way. You can go ahead and do
whatever you want to do!

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.720
What?! Were you even listening
to the teachers earlier?!

00:14:13.754 --> 00:14:17.424
You've gotta have a full
three-man team to be allowed to
enter the Chunin Exams.

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:19.226
I'm sure you can find someone
else.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:23.964
[grunt] But it's too late now!
There's no way I can find
someone that easily!

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:25.332
She's got a good point.

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:29.269
It's not as if our teamwork just
came together overnight or
something like that.

00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:29.436
That's true.

00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:31.305
Yeah, so what? I don't care!

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:35.542
You have been acting so weird
lately. Why are you being so
stubborn?

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:36.710
Whatever.

00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:37.311
Hmmm...

00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:39.546
Hey, Boruto.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.113
Hm?

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:44.952
Know what? I think what you
want is for your father to
praise you, right?

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:45.719
Oh...!

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.388
And just what would you know
about me, anyway?

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:52.226
I know quite a lot. Because you
are the sun in my sky.

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:52.326
Ehhh....

00:14:53.293 --> 00:14:55.095
[exasperated sigh] So that's it,
huh, Boruto?

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:57.464
You can be such a brat
sometimes...

00:14:57.497 --> 00:14:58.465
I can hear you...

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:02.703
Listen to me, Boruto. The way
you're acting is really uncool.

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.974
Is this really the person you
wanna be?

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.378
Come on, Boruto!

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:11.612
[grunt]

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:17.084
In the Chunin Exams, we can show
Lord Seventh what we've got! So
what do you say?

00:15:17.117 --> 00:15:18.218
What's that...?

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:19.853
This is our big chance!

00:15:19.887 --> 00:15:20.454
Do this...

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.458
and you'll be able to show your
dad and everybody else out
there in the audience just how

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:25.259
amazing you are!

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.294
And I'll be able to pass the
Exams!

00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:28.161
I will, too!

00:15:29.997 --> 00:15:31.131
[sigh]

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.602
Hmmm... Guess there's no
choice...

00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:35.903
[chuckle]

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:36.470
[gasp]

00:15:36.503 --> 00:15:36.904
[chuckles]

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:38.739
[chattering]

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.107
Okay, already...

00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:42.809
[chuckle]

00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:45.078
Guess you guys just can't do
anything without me! Three-man
team, whatever...

00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:46.713
just leave it to me.

00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:47.881
Heh! So easy!

00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:49.850
You really know how to
manipulate him!

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:51.285
I can hear you...

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:54.388
[chuckle] A man doesn't go back
on his word, right?

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:55.322
Well, yeah...

00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:00.160
Look, I really couldn't care
less about being a chunin, but
I'll just ace the exam...

00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:02.296
wow everyone, and make them
all see...

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:04.097
...that Boruto Uzumaki has
finally arrived!

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:05.299
(HIMAWARI) <i>Big Brother!</i>

00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:05.499
Huh?

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.435
(SARADA) <i>Hi, Hima!</i>

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.571
Oh! Hey, Himawari!

00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:14.708
But before all off that, there's
something I have to go take care
of...

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:15.943
Hmmm?

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:18.312
I gotta check on an important
promise...

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.715
We're back! Big Brother is home!

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:26.486
Hi. Welcome home.

00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:29.022
Uhhh... Huh?

00:16:29.323 --> 00:16:30.324
Hm.

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:32.559
(HIMAWARI) <i>Daddy!</i>

00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:33.160
(NARUTO) <i>Hey!</i>

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:34.928
We're back, we're back, we're
back!

00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:36.463
<i>So you actually made it...</i>

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.832
(NARUTO) <i>Welcome home,</i>
<i>welcome home, welcome home!</i>

00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:39.733
(HIMAWARI) [giggle]

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.101
You remembered, huh...?

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:47.307
[chuckles]

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.313
[chuckle]

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:00.787
[awed gasp]

00:17:00.821 --> 00:17:02.322
[chuckle]

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:08.328
Your promise... you actually
kept it...

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:11.131
Well, uh, yeah!

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:12.733
Then, we're even.

00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:13.567
Hm?

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:18.238
The thing is, I can put up with
it. Because I'm a man.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.477
But, still...

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.180
...if you didn't follow through
on your promise and made
Himawari cry...

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:28.182
...I would a let you have it.

00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:31.785
We're even now. I'll forgive you
today.

00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:34.221
[chuckle] Well, thanks for
that...

00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:36.423
S'fine. As long as you
understand...

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:38.292
[chuckle]

00:17:48.502 --> 00:17:49.770
(HIMAWARI) <i>Daddy!</i>

00:17:49.803 --> 00:17:51.138
(BORUTO) <i>Dad! Food's ready!</i>

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.474
Hm... Okay!

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:56.476
(BORUTO) <i>Alright!</i>

00:17:57.244 --> 00:17:58.712
Everything's in place!

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.047
[chuckles]

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.115
Okay...! And here comes your
cake!

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.950
(BORUTO) <i>Whoa!</i>

00:18:02.983 --> 00:18:04.117
(HIMAWARI) <i>It's huge!</i>

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:08.121
Himawari's birthday party is
just about to get started for
real now!

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:11.024
Awe! [giddy squeal]

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:23.570
A Shadow Clone...

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:24.705
[groan]

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:26.473
[worried sigh]

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:31.011
[grunt and quivered breaths]

00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:34.114
[worried groan] Big Brother...

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:36.016
It's alright...

00:18:36.984 --> 00:18:38.085
[grunt]

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.623
That damn... It's Himawari's
birthday! What the hell does he
think this is?!

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:43.624
[gasp]

00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:44.892
Boruto! Boruto!

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:46.426
Just let me go, Mom!

00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:51.031
I've had enough of this! I'm
gonna go beat that loser up for
what he just did!

00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:54.134
Boruto! Your father has to work
very hard for the people of the
village.

00:18:54.168 --> 00:18:57.604
And what about us, huh?! Aren't
we part of the village too?!

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:00.707
[grunt] When you're Hokage...
it's okay to ignore your
family?!

00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:04.978
Look, I understand. But it
doesn't mean he's forgotten
about you two!

00:19:05.012 --> 00:19:09.082
I've heard that lame excuse so
many times that I've lost count!
Enough, already!

00:19:09.116 --> 00:19:11.885
I'm just so sick and tired of
it!

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:12.719
(HINATA) <i>Boruto...</i>

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:18.225
(BORUTO) <i>When Dad was a kid,</i>
<i>Grandpa Hokage wasn't even</i>
<i>alive!</i>

00:19:18.258 --> 00:19:24.131
So I guess Dad's just lucky that
he never had to experience the
"joy" of having a parent around!

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.300
It's no wonder he doesn't care!

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:26.767
Boruto!

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.541
Why does my dad have to be the
Hokage?!

00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:40.214
He just sits there at his desk
all day, acting bossy!

00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:43.116
Literally anybody at all could
do that job!

00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:44.718
I know...

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.323
...that it's really hard not
having your father around on
important days.

00:19:51.425 --> 00:19:54.228
But still, it's different with
you.

00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:57.331
You still have a father who's
actually here.

00:19:58.732 --> 00:19:59.499
Boruto...

00:20:05.906 --> 00:20:07.908
Mommy...

00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:11.311
Oh, Himawari... I'm so sorry...

00:20:42.676 --> 00:20:45.112
[grunt] Huh?

00:20:55.022 --> 00:20:58.325
It's so dirty... and it's torn
to shreds.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.396
(HINATA) <i>But still, it's</i>
<i>different with you.</i>

00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:06.500
You still have a father who's
<i>actually here.</i>

00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:08.702
[quivered grunt]

00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:11.638
[grunt] This is so uncool!

00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:16.710
Dad is... [sigh] and so am I...

00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:19.112
[gasp]

00:21:19.146 --> 00:21:21.715
Oh, now you show up, you stupid
old man?!

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:23.116
[grunt]

00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:31.792
[gasp] Ah!

00:21:31.825 --> 00:21:33.727
Sorry, I thought you were my
dad...

00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:36.330
So, you're Naruto's son.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.497
Your name?

00:21:38.532 --> 00:21:39.333
It's Boruto...

00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:41.101
...Uzumaki...

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.636
(HINATA) <i>What's going on,</i>
<i>Boruto?!</i>

00:21:44.204 --> 00:21:47.107
Is that really-? Sasuke!

00:21:47.574 --> 00:21:48.475
It is!

00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:51.278
Is Naruto here?

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:54.248
I think he's still at the
Hokage's office...

00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:55.315
[gasp]

00:21:55.816 --> 00:21:56.717
I see.

00:21:57.784 --> 00:21:59.119
Sorry to intrude.

00:22:01.922 --> 00:22:04.324
<i>He's the one who was Dad's</i>
<i>rival...</i>

00:22:05.526 --> 00:22:07.394
<i>...Sasuke Uchiha!</i>

00:23:42.122 --> 00:23:47.127
(BORUTO) <i>Sasuke! Please make me</i>
<i>your student! I just have to</i>
<i>bring down my Dad!</i>

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.430
(SASUKE) <i>Why go so far to rebel</i>
<i>against your father?</i>

00:23:50.464 --> 00:23:54.067
(BORUTO) <i>He broke a sacred</i>
<i>promise between us. And</i>
<i>besides...</i>

00:23:54.101 --> 00:23:56.203
<i>he keeps treating me</i>
<i>like a kid.</i>

00:23:56.236 --> 00:23:59.573
(SASUKE) <i>Tell me this: can you</i>
<i>perform the Rasengan?</i>

00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:04.811
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: "Sasuke
<i>and Boruto."</i>

00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:09.349
That'll be a piece of cake, ya
<i>know! I'll go and master it</i>
<i>right away!</i>
