[powerful yell]

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.419

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.486
[collective gasp]

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:21.955
[panicked yell]

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.690
Oof! [sigh]

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:24.791
[collective sigh]

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.292
Ahh. He couldn't do it...

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.129
It really looked like he would
make it this time.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.731
Ow ow ow...

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.866
Hey there Denki.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.335
It's not just
about how much you focus.
The thing is...

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.705
It also needs to feel like it's
kind of a drag

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.774
Um, what do you mean, "a drag"?

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.510
When you're working with
chakra...

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.579
...you've gotta use your
physical and spiritual
energy...you know?

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.815
Infuse the two of them together.
Like that!

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.985
Then let it all flow
delicately to the soles of your
feet.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:56.923
After you make that happen, it's
all about how stable you can
keep it. Understand?

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.192
Huh? Hmm...

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.427
It's important to be aware of
Chakra Points...

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:05.431
...and also of the
Chakra network that connects
them all together.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.432
Uh, what?

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.935
And to put it simply, you have
to be stylish.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.606
You'll never
succeed unless you do it with
style, like me.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.007
Uh...

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.809
But you're not really all that
stylish...

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.078
I'm talking about the inside.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:18.812
What's...

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:19.379
in...

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:19.580
side.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.549
If you're stylish on the
inside...then...

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.885
...you'll smoothly infuse
chakra.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.119
Hmm...

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.554
So like I said before...

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.157
Just make it stable.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.960
It'll seem easy. Once you get
the knack.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:35.529
Remember to be stylish!

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.864
You can't do it if you're
nervous.

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.900
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.536
I don't understand a word any of
you are saying to me!

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.507
[throwing a tantrum]

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.410
Hey... Don't you think you're
being just a little impatient?

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.213
I'm not used to being a failure.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.816
I've never flunked a test
before.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.051
I've always been a
great student.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.386
You're certainly straightforward
about it.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.390
If...if I fail ninjutsu, I'll
get held back a year.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.027
I'll be a repeater like Iwabe
is.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.762
I can't let that happen, I just
can't!

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.264
Oh, hey it's Iwabe!

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.733
[embarrassed gasp]

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.303
Um... Well, um...

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:21.341
Well. Talking about it isn't
gonna help you climb the
wall.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.612
(Shino) <i>You keep obsessing about</i>
<i>tests.</i>

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.114
But that's not the only thing
that's important...

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:33.019
<i>...Tests cannot determine a</i>
<i>person's quality. It's because</i>
<i>that's not‐‐</i>

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.956
Oh wow, Denki. That was totally
uncool.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.325
Yeah it was. You really
shouldn't have said that about
Iwabe.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.994
As I was saying‐‐

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.529
I'd hate having to
repeat a grade.

00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:44.164
[mortified
gasps]
I'd be so
embarrassed!

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.331
[mortified
gasps]
Right?

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.168
[laughing]
[laughing]

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.640
I have to pass.

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:35.776
I have to pass!

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.281
[powerful yell]

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:42.482
Ah!

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:43.517
[grunt]

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:44.751
[gasp]

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:46.987
(Metal) I have been observing
you for a while.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.422
Your technique looks like it
could be dangerous.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.158
I will practice wall‐climbing
with you!

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:53.326
Metal...

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.964
We cannot have you getting
hurt‐‐especially before the
test!

00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:59.766
[sigh]

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:01.602
Hm?

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.072
Why does wall‐climbing have to
be a part of the ninjutsu exam?

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:09.710
[chuckle] It is funny Denki, you
have no problems with written
tests.

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:11.945
Yet wall climbing
presents a challenge.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.915
It won't matter how well I do
on the written tests.

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:19.152
If I fail ninjutsu, I probably
won't be able to graduate.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.855
Perhaps I'm not ready to
graduate.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:23.990
[grunt]
Ah!

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:24.925
No weakness!

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.492
At times like these...

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:30.931
you must continue to practice
relentlessly until you finally
get it right!

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:40.406
(Metal) I must train harder as
<i>well, so that I do not get</i>
<i>nervous during the real test!</i>

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.209
[struggling grunts]

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:46.179
Is this how you normally train??

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.614
Absolutely!

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:52.118
I start my day with rock
climbing each and every morning.
And then I go to the Academy!

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.154
<i>(Denki) H‐He's too much...</i>

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:58.825
<i>No! Unless I put in this much</i>
<i>work, I'll end up having to</i>
<i>repeat a grade!</i>

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.128
[scared yelling]

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:03.063
Denki, no!

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.465
[terrified scream]

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.401
(Rock Lee) [landing grunt]

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:11.104
Thank you so‐‐ Huh?!

00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:13.039
[chuckle]

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:15.509
(Denki) <i>What bold features!</i>

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:17.944
Poppa!

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:19.379
P‐Poppa?!

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:21.347
[emotional wailing]

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.384
Uh... Excuse me what's going
on?!

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.087
Putting in extra training to
improve your ninjutsu...

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.957
You are absolutely in the throes
of youth! [laugh]

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:31.925
[pained whimpering]

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.261
Oh, sorry, sorry. I am just so
happy!

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:36.462
O...kay.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.634
If that is the situation, then
practice as much as you want!

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.003
Who cares about whether you fall
sometimes?

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.539
I will stay right here to watch
over you!

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.174
[stunned]

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:54.214
What's the point? I don't know
if this is ever gonna stick...

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.617
Hey...are you taking this
seriously?

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.821
Shut up! This stuff isn't easy.
Explain it again!

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.956
This isn't looking good.

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:06.359
Yeah. Looks like he's beyond our
help.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.393
Like I said...

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.762
Imagine
this...

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.064
Boruto isn't the best choice for
<i>a teacher either.</i>

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.833
and then you slam in the formula
right in there...

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.167
[frustrated growl]

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.171
You know Denki would be better.
He'd be the best choice for a
teacher.

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:23.944
But after the comment Denki
made, why would Iwabe want Denki
to teach him anything at all?

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.045
That idiot.

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:26.613
Hm?

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.481
Yeah, well.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.484
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Hmmm.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:39.125
[deep breaths]

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:42.929
You fell many times today. I
think we should continue
tomorrow.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.464
Yeah!

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.498
Excuse me...

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:48.735
Do you have any more tips or
instructions for me?

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:51.171
Please, I'll take every bit of
your advice!

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:55.341
<i>(Denki) It's just...it's just</i>
<i>that I absolutely have to pass</i>
<i>the test!</i>

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.077
That spirit...

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.780
That is what youth is about.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.283
However... One's youth is not
merely for that alone.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:07.153
You must keep that in mind, too,
as you move forward in life.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.689
Sure...?

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.660
All right! Because you are such
a hard worker, I have a special
gift for you!

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.095
Huh?

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:19.600

You're back at it again today,
huh?

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.038
I was able to climb a little bit
higher.

00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:03.043
But let's face it. I have a long
way to go. At this rate, I'll
have to repeat‐‐

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:06.079
Uh‐‐I'm so sorry!

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.782
The way you've been doing it is
never going to work.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:10.551
Huh?

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:21.595
Listen, the most important thing
is to calm down first and focus.

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:26.366
It should feel like you're just
trying to relax.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.301
Okay. I think I get it.

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:32.706

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.513

Iwabe!

[landing grunt]

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.717
Save your celebrating until
after you can climb higher.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.285
[chuckle]

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:49.455
You were a little wobbly, but
you didn't exert any unnecessary
strength.

00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:51.725
Just remember what
that felt like.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:55.929
That was amazing. You explained
it much better than everyone
else did!

00:09:55.962 --> 00:10:01.367
Of course, I did. When
it comes to ninjutsu, I'm the
one at the top of the class.

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.769
[sighs in awe]

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:11.244
Thanks to you, I finally got the
knack! I'm really grateful.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.314
But uh...why did you decide to
help me all of a sudden?

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:18.752
Truth is...it was horrible of me
to call you a repeater the other
day.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.755
[excited chatter and laughter]

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.591
(Iwabe) When you repeat a grade,
<i>you lose all your friends.</i>

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:27.828
Nobody should have to go through
that.

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:29.830
Uh...

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:35.368
[running breaths] Iwabe...How's
your school work coming?

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:41.107
I could...you know, help
you if you wanted me to, that
is...

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:48.381
Oh, don't worry about me. I hit
the books every chance I get.
I'm doing just great at school.

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.315
[chuckle]

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:50.751
Huh?

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.691
Is this...

00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:01.327
Uh, well...that does happen
sometimes.

00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:05.866
Why would you need to lie to me?
I can help you study!

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:07.300
Oh...

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.869
You probably don't want my help.

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:11.805
Don't be so stupid.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.675
Look, I just don't want you
taking any time away from your
own training

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.777
simply to help me out.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.280
If anyone's gonna repeat a
grade, it'll be me.

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:24.618
Anyway, don't worry about it!
Believe it or not, I don't give
up easily.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.653
I'll figure it out by myself‐‐

00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:29.556
You're okay with repeating?!

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.360
You know...after I met Boruto, I
realized that ninjutsu was
amazing.

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:38.565
And I didn't want to run away
anymore from my dad or anything
else.

00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:41.702
That's why I chose Ninjutsu
Studies.

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:45.371
Because I want to be a shinobi
with Boruto.

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:48.809
(Denki) No... I don't mean just
<i>with Boruto.</i>

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.477
I mean our whole class.

00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:55.048
And I want the two of us to be
shinobi together, Iwabe!

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:55.816
[small gasp]

00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:01.888
So you just have to let me tutor
you! And in exchange, you'll
teach me ninjutsu.

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:03.456
Denki...

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.762
Let's work together! Let's show
everyone we're good enough to
pass our tests!

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.497
Alright already!

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:13.867
I guess...you leave me no
choice.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.705
Let's do this!

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:21.642
I'll give this studying thing
another shot...

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:24.077
[happy sigh] That's great,
Iwabe!

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:40.661
Damn it! All this stuff just
isn't sticking!! Damn it!

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:44.898
Come on. You've only been
working in that textbook for
five minutes!

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:47.801
<i>What should we do?</i>

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:49.503
Oh!

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.406
I know!

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.443
[confused reactions]

00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:59.913
[strained groaning]

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.715
Woah.

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.383
I think this actually gonna
work!

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.252
You've been studying for thirty
minutes already!

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.621
[chuckles]

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:08.855
'K next!

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.025
Your concentration is always
amazing when you infuse it with
chakra.

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.961
So I thought this
technique might be just
perfect for you.

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:19.766
Wow... You're right! So that's
how a switch box is wired!

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.467
Can I ask you something else?

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:25.205
Of course, you can! As long as
it's about electricity.

00:13:29.843 --> 00:13:32.813
(Iwabe) How do you do this one?

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:36.149
You solve problems like that
with the simultaneous equations
we just learned in class!

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.217
Of course!

00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:39.953
I see. I got it!

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.955
(Mitsuki) Huh? What's going on?

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.156
(Shikadai) Don't ask me...

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:46.860
Hey!

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:49.963
You workin' hard?! I brought
everybody some snacks!

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.000
And no worries; this is my
treat.

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.369
Did you spend all of your
allowance?

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.404
Uh! Who cares about that?

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:01.642
I'm just here to offer you guys
some moral support.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:02.809
[chuckle] Oh, really?

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:03.844
Thanks, Boruto.

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:05.746
Yeah, man.

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:07.681
Come on now! Just eat up!

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:10.951
(Everyone) Thanks for the
burger! [chomp]

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.757
It's hot!

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.160
So spicy! What the hell did you
bring us?

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.862
Huh?

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:23.229
(Boruto) It's the new Ghost
Pepper Burger.

00:14:24.565 --> 00:14:28.168
[laugh] I wanted to try it
because it's supposed to be
hotter

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.336
than their old Habanero Burger.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.938
[chomp]

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:34.875
Hot!!!

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:38.111
[morning chatter]

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.881
Today's our test.

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.517
Yeah.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.952
We were able to push each other
to do really good work.

00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:48.221
Thanks, Iwabe, I meant it!

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.727
Hey now, that's my line... But I
think we should save it until
we finish taking the test.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.231
We put in so much effort and
hard work, i'm sure we're gonna
pass this time!

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.934
You're right.

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:04.037
Finally. It's finally gonna
happen today.

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:06.840
(laugh)

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:07.440
(Villager) Fire!

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:08.775
Huh?

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:12.846
(Fire Alarm)

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.114
That's a huge fire...

00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:15.916
We have to do something to help.

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:19.319
But Iwabe... We'll be late for
the test!

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:21.755
But...

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:24.891
It'll be okay. I'm sure the
firefighters will get here real
soon.

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:27.127
We just need to go
take our test.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.930
yeah, you're right.

00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:31.732
My children are still inside
that building!

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:36.169
Ma'am, please calm down!
I've got to go get them! Let go
of me! Let go! Let go!

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:40.841
Iwabe, come back!

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:42.208
(Iwabe) You stay right there!

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.280
Where are they?!

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:48.381
Ohh!

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.651
(Children Crying)

00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:56.489
It's gonna be okay. Don't
panic... Is this all of you?

00:15:56.523 --> 00:15:58.124
Uh‐huh.

00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:05.398
This isn't an old building. The
sprinkler system should have
activated already.

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.168
Could it be broken?

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.304
where's Iwabe?

00:16:13.874 --> 00:16:15.241
Begin!

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:22.215
You pass!

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:25.118
Those guys should've been here
by now.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:29.956
Those pepper burgers you
bought yesterday probably got to
them. Maybe they're sick...?

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.324
Uhhhh!?!

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:34.127
My stomach's been messed up,
too, come to think of it.

00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:36.530
Uhhhh...

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:42.736
You're all gonna be okay!

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:47.140
(Iwabe Thinking) Three of
them... There's no way I can
carry them all.

00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:49.442
(Flames Roaring)

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:53.580
Earth Style...

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:54.615
Mud Wall!

00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:56.182
(Children Screaming)

00:16:58.284 --> 00:17:01.254
Not good! We can't get around
it!

00:17:01.287 --> 00:17:05.125
There has to be... something I
can do!

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:09.162
Hmm!...

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.266
(Crowd Murmuring)

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:15.368
Iwabe's not coming out.

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.037
Hmm!

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:32.052
haaaaaa!!!

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:39.526
Ugh! With heat this intense I...

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:47.133
It's just...it's just that I
absolutely have to pass the
test!

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.069
That spirit...

00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:50.937
That is what youth is about.

00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:56.442
However, one's youth is not
merely for that alone. You must
keep that in mind, too.

00:17:57.678 --> 00:17:59.245
Iwabe!

00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:07.453
A Mud Wall!

00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:10.724
Uhhh!

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.594
(Kids Coughing)

00:18:13.627 --> 00:18:14.761
Iwabe!

00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:15.729
Denki?!

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:17.263
Do you need help with that?

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:21.535
No need. It's all right! I just
finished!

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:22.302
(Switch Click)

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:33.814
(Water Spraying)

00:18:33.847 --> 00:18:35.281
Can you carry one of the,?

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:37.250
Yeah, sure thing!

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.322
(Crowd Gasping)

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:47.828
Oh you're safe!

00:18:47.861 --> 00:18:49.863
Dammit! Why did you follow me?!

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:54.535
My friend jumped into a building
on fire! There's no way I'd
leave him behind!

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:55.368
Oh!?!

00:18:56.169 --> 00:18:59.405
I swear... That was reckless.

00:18:59.439 --> 00:18:59.973
Huh?

00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:03.744
I mean...

00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:06.079
Thank you.

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:09.315
Hey you know what?

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:13.386
You figured it out! The
sprinklers only came on because
you repaired the wiring!

00:19:13.419 --> 00:19:17.624
Huh... And you were able to
cling up the wall.

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:20.026
We're totally gonna ace that
test!

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.129
yeah sure...if we're able to
take it.

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.365
Oh, well...

00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:31.271
How strange.. Neither of the two
showed up.

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:36.142
Okay! The test is officially
over.

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.678
Uh wait a sec Shino Sensei.

00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:38.411
Hmm?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.185
Uh, well,,, The reason they're
not here is because of me. I'm
the one to blame...

00:19:45.218 --> 00:19:47.888
I think it's because of the
hamburgers I gave them.

00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:50.924
What are you trying to say?

00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:53.193
Just wait for them, okay?

00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:55.228
They were dead set on taking
this test!

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:58.331
Please... Sensei!

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.767
Hmm?

00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:01.467
Uh?

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.040
Uh... I guess we didn't make it
in time...huh?

00:20:07.073 --> 00:20:09.109
Yeah, it looks that way,

00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:12.513
You're both late. What in the
world happened?

00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:18.652
i understand now. It's
unfortunate you weren't able to
take the test.

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:21.121
Yep. Guess I'll have to try
harder next year!

00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:25.559
We both put in a lot of good
work and I know all our efforts
weren't in vain.

00:20:25.592 --> 00:20:28.829
You're not making any sense. Not
at all.

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:30.363
Huh?
Huh?

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.232
You won't be taking the test
next year.

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:33.634
Huh?
Huh?

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:35.368
Ahhhhh!!!!

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:39.472
We don't want to leave the
Academy. Please let us come back
and study next year Sensei!

00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:42.475
Please let us take the test
again!

00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:45.445
Heh. The point of the test i
simply to make sure

00:20:45.478 --> 00:20:48.014
you're prepared to use the
knowledge you studied in school.

00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:53.019
You just took the lessons you
learned and applied them in a
real‐life situation.

00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:55.488
What else is there to test you
on?

00:20:55.522 --> 00:20:56.489
Ahhh!?!

00:20:57.858 --> 00:21:01.528
You're decision to place hunan
lives above a test was
exemplary!

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:06.833
That choice will sever to
benefit you when you two become
shinobi.

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:10.904
You both did quite well. You
both pass!

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:13.039
We passed?!

00:21:13.073 --> 00:21:15.542
We really did it, Iwabe!

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:17.043
Yeah!

00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:20.847
Thank you so much, Shino Sensei!

00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:23.449
Hmmm!

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.359
Ahhh!

00:21:33.393 --> 00:21:35.261
<i>Metal:</i>
<i>Congratulations!</i>

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:36.597
Thanks guys!

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.364
I didn't think you'd pass.

00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:41.434
Anyway, you both did a good job
guys.

00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:44.705
You had me super worried
for no reason at all.

00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:46.272
But congrats!

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.474
Here's a gift!

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:49.976
Ahh thanks you guys!

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:54.214
Damn, had all of us really
going. We were starting to
panic!

00:21:54.247 --> 00:21:57.283
Uh, Boruto, that kind of
hurts...

00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:00.020
Sorry! I'm just happy, you
know?!

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:07.227
Maybe we'll be shinobi together,
Denki. What ya think?!

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.861
Yep. You're right. We'll all do
it...together!

00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:10.396
Yeah!

00:23:49.495 --> 00:23:54.034
So I just need to deliver this
teddy bear to the girl at the
hospital, right?

00:23:54.067 --> 00:23:58.639
It's such an easy task. Mom
always worries too much!

00:23:58.672 --> 00:24:01.775
Okay, which way was the hospital
again?

00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:06.346
Wait, what? Where's the teddy
bear?! I left it on the train!

00:24:06.379 --> 00:24:09.149
What do I do? What do I do? What
do I do?

00:24:09.182 --> 00:24:14.420
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
Generations... "Run, Sarada!"

00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:17.023
Agh! i've gotta hurry and catch
up!
