[SARADA] <i>I wonder why Mitsuki's</i>
<i>not here yet...</i>

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:23.410
He's probably still
crashed out over at his house.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:27.147
(CHUCKLE) Even so, it's still
unusual for him to be this late.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.149
All right, then...

00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:32.986
How 'bout we go to his house and
see what's keeping him?

You're so late!

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.769
What's the matter?

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:52.005
It's nothing. I just feel like I
woke up from a bad dream.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.974

anything about it.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:07.754

actually attacked Boruto?

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:09.289
Yeah. I still can't believe it.

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:13.660
Damn it. And we were so close
to finishing this!

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:15.662
(WORRIED)

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.268
Going along with those guys was
truly his "will."

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.604
That's what Mitsuki said, right?

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:26.139
Yeah. He was clear about that.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:30.878

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.814

You know, Boruto's the one who's
been leading us all this way...

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:40.320

still unconscious, then...

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:42.256
Where're Cho-Cho and Inojin?

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.057

be around.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.728
We've left the Land of Fire...

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:52.132

ambushed at any time, right?

You've gotta try to keep it
together, here, okay?!

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.003
Look, I can't help it!

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:32.105

Yeah, you got that right!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.350
Even the Jonin from the Leaf
were no match for them.

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.653
So how are we ever going to be
able to take them on, then?

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:49.556

hightail it out of there!

Hey... what is that?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.999
I've got a really bad feeling
about this...

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.902
You think it could be one of
those Akuta...

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:03.971
that Shikadai and the others
fought against?

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:06.073
Well, go on, Inojin! Go check it
out!

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:08.609
Huh?! Why's it have to be me?!

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.143
Duh! Because you're a guy!

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:12.479
You're really gonna make a cute
lady go?

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.115
Damn it! That's the best excuse
you've got?!

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:21.088
Hey, Sarada... what do you
think we should do now?

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:24.591
I mean, should we keep on going
or turn back?

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:28.262
I'm not sure... Based on what we
saw in the snake's thoughts...

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:30.531
...Mitsuki really was trying to
save the life...

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:32.232
of that gate guard, right?

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:35.035
Yeah... That's just what made me
start to believe...

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:37.304
that Mitsuki truly might be
innocent.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.108
After all, that gate guard did
end up surviving the attack.

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.977
But then again, we both heard
Mitsuki himself say...

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:46.480
that he was going to join the
enemy shinobi.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.149
(CONFLICTED)

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:51.418
(DECISIVE SIGH) I think
that...

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:54.988
...maybe it would be best if we
return to the village, then.

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:57.157
But to do what? Just report in?

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:59.826
And risk being punished for
deserting the village?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.395
But if we do keep going...

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:04.831
is there really anything more
that we can do here?

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.366
I guess you're right...

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.103
Since we're genin, going back is
probably the right thing to do.

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:14.741
Although...I actually think we
should keep going...

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.109
to the Land of Earth instead.

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:18.812
What do you mean?

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.248
From what I saw of those
Akuta...

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:23.984
it definitely seems that those
guys from the Land of Earth...

00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:25.118
are up to something.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:29.590
That's true, but Jonin from
the Hidden Leaf were taken down!

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:32.125
This is already way beyond what
we can handle...

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.728
They strong-armed us...

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.031
with no regard for the fact that
we're at peace right now.

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:40.801
I may not know exactly what
they're up to yet...

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.135
But right now, we're the
ones...

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.471
that're closest to finding
out some answers.

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:46.273

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:52.145

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.274
Right!

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.343
Where's Inojin?

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:24.344
He's over there!

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:25.112

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.448
I just hope we're in time!

me!

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:55.275
Actually... I don't think that
guy's trying to attack you.

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:02.783
This isn't... quite... how I
remember Akuta being.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.852
I'm just glad it finally let go!

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.387
Now let's hurry up and get rid
of it!

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:10.157
I don't feel safe with this
weird thing around.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.192
But just look at the little guy!

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.928
I'm starting to feel like
its face is actually kind of...

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:16.230
endearing!
Are you kidding me?!

00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:17.664
[INOJIN] <i>There's absolutely</i>
<i>nothing loveable...</i>

00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:21.401
in that empty face! Nothing at
<i>all! I mean, honestly!</i>

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:24.071
I was thinking of having it join
us, too.

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:28.275
Not you, too, Shikadai! Come
on! This guy is one of "them!"

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:29.109
Yeah, exactly!

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.513
This one's pretty small, but the
other ones we saw earlier...

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:33.514
are really big.

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:37.184
And those ones are even better
fighters than most shinobi are.

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:40.187
You're right, they were really
formidable opponents.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.322
[SHIKADAI] <i>If more of those</i>
<i>things are being made...</i>

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:45.492
<i>then we're gonna have a huge</i>
<i>problem.</i>

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:49.096
We have to gather as much intel
as we can.

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:51.498
But even if it isn't being
aggressive right now...

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:53.700
there's no guarantee it won't
suddenly...

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:55.469
go on a rampage later on.

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:57.538
With Boruto injured, maybe we
should be cautious.

00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.140
What if one of us watches it for
a while...

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:02.576
and if it stays friendly, we'll
bring it?

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:05.078
If you say so, Shikadai.

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:07.447
Yeah, but... who's gonna be
the one to watch it?

Are you serious?!

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.921
Well, you were the one who found
it, after all!

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:16.123
And besides, it kinda seems to
like you...

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.592

but sharing potato chips is a

turn you back into dirt now!

take care of this thing?

[SHIKADAI] <i>Hey! You guys just</i>

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.994
Yeah. We actually finished
early...

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:55.929
considering Mitsuki showed
up late.

00:09:55.963 --> 00:09:58.765
Mitsuki? You sure that
wasn't you Boruto?

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:01.101
It would make more sense if it
went down that way!

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:03.604
What's that mean?! Mind your
own business, you guys!

Why does it hurt?

If you can't remember it...

You said that you were going to
bring Mitsuki back!

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:59.259
Yeah! That's right, I did!

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.272
[GARAGA] <i>Huh?! You still don't</i>
<i>get it, do you?!</i>

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:15.075
What are you talking about?!

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:18.846
Eh, whatever. I would much
rather eat you...

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.881
when you're at
your best, but...

00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.015
(FRIGHTENED)

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:25.819
Nevermind! I'm hungry, c'mere!

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.187
Run, Boruto!

00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:28.455
Right!

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:29.289
Slow down, Mitsuki!

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.660
What a stupid brat!

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:44.838
(CURIOUS)

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:46.974
(THROWING EFFORT)

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:48.609
Ow, that hurts!

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:50.444
Just go away, would ya?!

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:53.146
(STUNNED AND SAD)

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:56.183
Ugh, that thing...

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:00.153
(GASP)

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.357
Hey, why did you do that, huh?!

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:05.158
(PLAYFUL)

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:09.363
(SIGH) All right, I give up...

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:11.698
(CURIOUS)

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:14.168
Okay... Here, go fetch.

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:18.005
(CONFUSED)

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.176
Go on! Go and fetch the stick!

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:26.180
What would really be great is if
<i>it never came back...</i>

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.183
(CURIOUS) Hm?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.684
(OFFERING)

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.019
(SHOCKED)

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.488
Hey, that's my scroll! Just -
when did you take that?!

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:36.490
(THROWING)

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:39.159
Not cool! Don't do that!

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.694
(CURIOUS)

00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:41.662
Stop copying me!

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:46.366
(SIGH) I really wish I'd
never found you, you know that?

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:53.273
(UNCERTAIN)

00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:55.309
That's enough! Stop following
me!

00:12:55.676 --> 00:12:56.677
(UNCERTAIN)

00:12:58.512 --> 00:12:59.313
(CONSIDERING)

00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:05.352
Here... How bout you play with
these.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.021
(CURIOUS)

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:11.124
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:14.628
(PLEASANTLY SURPRISED)

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:18.165
(HAPPY PLAYING)

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:21.668
Actually... It is kinda cute,
<i>isn't it?</i>

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:25.472
(PLAYFUL)

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.008
Hey, uh... you okay?

00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:31.178
So what's the matter?

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.847
(ANGRY GROWL)

00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:35.015
(SHOCKED DODGING)

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:39.152
Oh, wow! You're like a
super-accurate hunter!

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:42.189
(ANGRY GROWL)

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:47.494
(DETERMINED)

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.163
(SWIPING WITH ARMS)

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.032
Awesome! Good job!

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:54.134
(DETERMINED GROWL)

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:56.036
No, not that!

00:13:58.472 --> 00:13:59.473
Wait! Stop!

00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:03.110
(SHOCKED)

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:04.311
That really stings...

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.347
I wonder if that rabbit's
okay...

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:15.489
(CURIOUS)

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.360
(CURIOUS)

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.597
I don't really know if you're
gonna understand this or not...

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.032
but...

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:26.500
<i>...life is precious.</i>

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.335
(CURIOUS)

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.005
You don't get it at all, do you?

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.173
(CONSIDERING)

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.313
(STRUGGLING)

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:42.182
Wait, Mitsuki! Just hold up!

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:45.018
We can't keep running from
Garaga like this!

00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:47.154
(DISCOMFORT)

00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:50.324
Damn it!

00:14:50.858 --> 00:14:52.292
Why am I...?

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:54.528
There's no reason I should be in
pain...

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.330
You okay, Boruto?

00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:59.032
Listen... I think that we
should go back to Garaga and-

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.501
But Boruto, we don't
have to.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:03.237
Huh?!

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.672
Listen to me, all you have to
do now is stay somewhere safe.

00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:09.610
What are you talking
about, Mitsuki?

00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:13.180
Right now all you have
to do is keep on running away...

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:16.149
...so no one can hurt
or betray you.

00:15:17.818 --> 00:15:19.553
Wait, are you...?

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.487
...are you really Mitsuki?

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:30.163
Where am I?

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:37.471
Was that... just a
dream?

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:40.140
Oh, right...

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:43.177
Mitsuki's gone.

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.047
(SHOCKED)

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:52.286
I guess this means that you're
finally ready to be my food!

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:56.356
What?! No, just wait! No way
am I gonna die here! Not yet!

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.692
[GARAGA] <i>You finally realized,</i>
<i>huh, brat?</i>

00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:02.796
So... what were you saying about
Mitsuki?

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:05.566
Just what are you planning to
do?!

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:06.400
(FRUSTRATED)

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.203
[GARAGA] <i>Even if you make it out</i>
<i>of here alive...</i>

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:12.239
the only thing waiting for you
is betrayal by your friends.

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:16.476
Deep down,... you know
that's true better than anyone.

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:18.312
(FRUSTRATED)

00:16:19.847 --> 00:16:22.449
(SCOFFING CHUCKLE) How
pathetic...

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.952
[GARAGA] You created imaginary
<i>friends...</i>

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:28.021
in order to try and protect your
<i>soul.</i>

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.923
You don't know a single thing
about me!

00:16:29.957 --> 00:16:33.393
Don't talk like you do!
(DISCOMFORT)

00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:34.161
Not again!

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.698
[GARAGA] (scoffing harrumph)
Don't think you're the only one!

00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:39.299
(TAKEN BACK)

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.235
When my friends betrayed me...

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:45.405
I tried to run away from the
awful reality of it, too.

00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:46.840
(SYMPATHETIC)

00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:49.843
But this eye I lost never lets
me forget...

00:16:49.877 --> 00:16:53.680
those terrible memories.

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:54.648
Garaga...

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.018
[GARAGA] <i>But all you ever did</i>
<i>was run away...</i>

00:16:58.051 --> 00:17:00.587
...without learning anything.

00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:05.292
And not only that, you tried to
avoid the pain you were feeling.

00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:10.197
So in the end... you didn't even
try to learn anything!

00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:11.665
(LEAPING)

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:15.335
(DISCOMFORT)

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:20.307
(HITTING THE GROUND)

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:26.446
(STRUGGLING) Mitsuki...

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.082
You don't need that old thing
anymore!

00:17:29.116 --> 00:17:35.189
Just throw it away and be done
with it!

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:36.356
You must already know...

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.860
what's causing all the pain
you're feeling.

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:41.028
(TAKEN BACK)

00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:44.531
Well, it doesn't matter...

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:51.839
'Cause either way, I'm going to
eat you. It's game over, brat!

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:53.040
Wow, how pathetic...

00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:55.042
Huh?!

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.346
I never thought you'd be the one
who'd make me realize.

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:00.314
What?

00:18:03.984 --> 00:18:06.153
But now... thanks to you, I'm
over it.

00:18:08.021 --> 00:18:10.023
So thank you, Garaga.

00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:16.163
(ANNOYED) You brat...

00:18:18.832 --> 00:18:19.867
(WAKING)

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.869
(HAPPY INHALE) Thank
goodness...

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:25.005
I was starting to get worried
that you wouldn't wake up!

00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:26.974
(GROGGY) Where are we?

00:18:27.007 --> 00:18:29.142
[SHIKADAI] <i>We retreated here</i>
<i>after the fight.</i>

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.211
Oh, I see.

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:37.050
We got away, but...

00:18:37.084 --> 00:18:39.586
we're still really close to the
Land of Earth.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.089
There's no telling when we might
have to fight again.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.123
(CONSIDERING)

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:44.691
[SHIKADAI] <i>I know you just woke</i>
<i>up, but...</i>

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:48.128
Boruto... I wanna hear what
your opinion is.

00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:50.731
Do we turn back and go to the
Leaf?

00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:56.837
Or keep going after Mitsuki?

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.505
You know my mind's already made
up.

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.110
I'm gonna...

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.445
...go after Mitsuki.
(DISCOMFORT)

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:07.181
(CONCERNED) Boruto!

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.216
(STRUGGLING) Oh
man...

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.286
Hey, are you sure you're all
right?

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.154
(WORRIED) You really wanna go?

00:19:15.522 --> 00:19:16.657
Sarada...

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.992
I don't wanna believe it-

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:21.128
But after what Mitsuki did to
you...

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:24.031
I feel the exact same way as you
do.

00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:25.265
I can't stand the thought...

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:28.569
of Mitsuki going to the Land
of Earth.

00:19:28.602 --> 00:19:31.905
Although... I mean, if joining
up with those shinobi...

00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:34.341
is truly what he wants to do,
then...

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:37.477
...I don't know, maybe we should
just let him do it.

00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:39.313
I know just how much this
hurts...

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.782
...but still...

00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:46.019
that's all the more reason why
we have to face up to the facts.

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:47.020
But, Boruto!

00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:48.322
You saw with your own eyes!

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:52.860
You saw what those guys did to
those Leaf Shinobi.

00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:54.027
(SHOCKED)

00:19:55.162 --> 00:19:57.431
After seeing all that, can you
really allow Mitsuki...

00:19:57.464 --> 00:19:59.933
to go off to the Land of Earth
with them?

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:01.635
I know, but...

00:20:01.668 --> 00:20:03.170
I don't want Mitsuki...

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.772
...to join up with people who
didn't hesitate...

00:20:05.806 --> 00:20:08.342
even when they took down our
comrades.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.611
Even if that's what Mitsuki
wants to do?

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:11.812
That doesn't matter.

00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:13.046
(SHOCKED)

00:20:14.147 --> 00:20:15.883
If Mitsuki didn't go there of
his own free will...

00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:19.019
then we have to rescue him and
bring him back!

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:20.854
If Mitsuki's going down
the wrong path...

00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:24.157
I'm gonna drag him back even if
I have to kick his ass to do it!

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:26.193
(DETERMINED)

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:29.162
Because that's what real friends
do.

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:34.334
No matter what, I'm gonna
return this headband to him...

00:20:35.502 --> 00:20:37.171
...to my friend.

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:46.046
You mean "our" friend, don't
you?

00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:50.350
(CHUCKLE) Yeah. Thank you,
Sarada.

00:20:58.158 --> 00:21:00.427
So what're you going to do with
that guy?

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.263
I'd like to bring it back as
proof the Akuta exist...

00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:05.866
but if it's risky, we should...

00:21:05.899 --> 00:21:07.000
(CURIOUS)

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:12.239
If it's for proof, then do we
really have a choice?

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.541
It's quite a rascal, though...

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:15.442
(CONFUSED)

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:17.177
I see...

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.150
We'll be in the Land of Earth,
once we cross this, huh?

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:24.952
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:27.354
We're gonna be walking right
into the lion's den.

00:21:27.387 --> 00:21:29.857
I guess we'll have to be extra
cautious, then?

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.627
Well, Boruto, from here on
out, we're all in this together.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.396
We've decided to follow you,
wherever that leads.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.297
(AFFIRMATIVE)

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:39.600
However, there's no telling
what's going to be waiting

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:41.201
for us up ahead.

00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:43.237
You have a plan to increase our
odds?

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.106
Yeah. It's old man Ohnoki of
the Stone.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:49.276
I'm sure he'll lend us a
hand.

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.645
That's right! The Third
Tsuchikage...!

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:56.783
If you ever find yourselves in
the Land of Earth...

00:21:56.817 --> 00:21:59.453
I hope you'll pay me a visit.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:02.022
Wait for me, Mitsuki. This
time...

00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:04.157
I'm coming to bring you
back home for sure!

[SARADA] <i>So that's the Hidden</i>
<i>Stone, huh?</i>

00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:47.361
<i>I can't believe that we're</i>
<i>finally here!</i>

00:23:47.394 --> 00:23:49.363
[SHIKADAI] <i>Back when we left the</i>
<i>Leaf...</i>

00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:52.199
I never imagined that we'd
end up going to another village.

00:23:52.232 --> 00:23:53.934
[SHIKADAI] <i>But I guess we're</i>
<i>fully committed...</i>

00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:55.502
<i>to this plan now, Boruto!</i>

00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:59.106
[BORUTO] <i>Yeah! Now, first we've</i>
<i>gotta find Old Man Ohnoki!</i>

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:01.942
[BORUTO] <i>I'm sure he'll be able</i>
<i>to help us out!</i>

00:24:01.975 --> 00:24:04.945
Next time on "Boruto: Naruto
Next Generations..."

00:24:04.978 --> 00:24:07.181
"Infiltrating the Hidden Stone
Village"

00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:09.183
[BORUTO] <i>Come on! Let's get</i>
<i>going!</i>
