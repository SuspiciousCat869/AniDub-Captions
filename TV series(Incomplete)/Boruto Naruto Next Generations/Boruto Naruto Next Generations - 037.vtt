00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.009
[grunt]

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.677
[pained grunt]

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:13.580
Ow, ow, owww!

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:23.957
Well, Boruto... Do you want me
to tell you how you can get
yourself out of this situation?

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.892
<i>You'll have to break your own</i>
<i>arm...</i>

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:26.392
[grunt]

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.864
It's probably impossible for
you, because you don't have the
drive to become a ninja.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:34.968
Don't have the drive?! What the
hell is that supposed to mean?

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.971
I'm talking about having
resolve.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:42.876
Whether it's for money, for
praise, or for the sake of your
parents‐‐that doesn't matter.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.982
But if you don't have it, you'll
never be able to do what needs
to be done to change.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:52.185
Come on, even I have... [pained
groan]

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.221
You thought you'd just become a
ninja with all your friends

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.758
and then figure out what
to do, right?

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:02.796
You call that resolve? Then what
about right now, when you still
<i>haven't figured it out?</i>

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.001
Can you take down those same
friends... in order to become a
ninja?

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:14.808
It's a hard question to answer,
isn't it? But still these
situations happen all the time.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:21.815
And that's when what ultimately
sustains a ninja is born.
Resolve comes from motivation.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:26.720
Sure, you're willing, and you do
have the talent. But that just
isn't enough.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.824
That's even more true if you
don't have the resolve that it
takes.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:34.494
That's not true! How would you
even know anything about me?!

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:39.132
Oh, I know plenty. Because I got
a good look at you up close.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.272
Huh?!

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:30.577
[gasp]

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:32.378
You're‐‐!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.722
All I did was take a page from
your book. I just pranked you!

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:44.490
But regardless, this year's
Academy students...

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:48.595
...are completely horrible.
There's just no other way to put
it.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:50.597
What?

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.569
Seems there are a few among you
who have at least some resolve,
but still...

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:58.471
<i>...they underestimate what a</i>
<i>ninja is.</i>

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:02.242
<i>I can only assume</i>
that's because of your influence
<i>on them.</i>

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.712
The severity of being a ninja...

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.247
Ahhh! [pained grunt]

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.417
(KAKASHI) <i>The unfairness that</i>
<i>awaits you... You can't even</i>
<i>begin to imagine it.</i>

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.257
There's no way that I can
acknowledge a group like that as
ninja!

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.629
Because once you go on a real
mission, you'll end up being
slaughtered.

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:29.135
I'll ask you again: can you find
a reason to become a ninja, a
reason to sacrifice your arm?

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.003
Ah! [pained groan]

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.840
(KAKASHI) Well... I guess no
one's going to pass this year...

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:34.440
[pained breaths]

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:38.512
And there's no need for any of
you to return to the Academy
either.

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.847
You'll just have to find another
<i>path.</i>

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:50.356
Think of it as part of the
severity of becoming a ninja...

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.758
[pained grunt and breaths]

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.328
[pained groan]

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.064
(MITSUKI) <i>Lightning Style!</i>

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.299
Snake Lightning!

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.408
[grunt]

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:10.977
[grunt]

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:13.514
[grunts]

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.428
They got me...

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:34.400
Well, what are you going to do
now? What's your next move,
Boruto?

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:50.416
(SAMIRE KAKEI) I don't detect
the Sensei nearby.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.319
(IWABE) I guess we got away for
now.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.621
Are you okay?

00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:58.358
Uh, yeah, I'm okay. Just go take
care of Mitsuki.

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:07.634
Don't worry about him! Wasabi is
really good at Medical Ninjutsu.

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.871
Although they tell me I'm not
cut out for it.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.507
Hey. Thanks, Wasabi.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.811
So... is this what they mean by
the severity of being a ninja?

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:18.545
[sighs]

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:25.418
Let's just wrap this up so we
can get on with becoming
ninja, together!

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.989
You guys... I'm sorry.

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:31.291
All of this is my fault.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.527
What are you talking about?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.129
I thought that we could all
become ninja together...

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:40.333
...and then I could figure out
what I wanted to do afterward.

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:43.904
But I guess... that's just not
good enough...

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:48.542
Is that why you froze up back
there when you were with Lord
Sixth?

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:52.278
I just couldn't do it. I
couldn't break my own arm.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:53.580
Your arm?!

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:58.451
(BORUTO) <i>Old Man Kakashi said</i>
<i>our class was horrible... and</i>
<i>that it was all because of me.</i>

00:06:58.484 --> 00:06:59.419
[seething]

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:00.687
[grunts]

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:01.254
[gasps]

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.122
Damn it!

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.223
Stop, Iwabe!

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.291
Please! Please don't fight each
other!

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.327
What‐‐ What the hell is your
problem?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.595
[grunt]

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:13.133
Turning on each other is exactly
what the Sensei want us to do!

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.335
Shut up! I'm not picking a
fight!

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:20.273
What the hell are you talking
about, Boruto?! You're saying
that we're weak because of you?!

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:25.078
Quit looking down on us! And
that goes for you and for Lord
Sixth!

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.949
The truth is that if it weren't
for you, Boruto...

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:32.318
<i>...I'd still be sitting in the</i>
<i>corner of the classroom...</i>

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:35.455
...expecting not to
graduate...and sulking!

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.490
It's 'cause of you I got this
far!

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:41.327
After all we've done, you're
still looking down on me?

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:45.966
I've made up my mind now! And
I'm gonna become a ninja, no
matter what!

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:50.904
You helped me get as far as I
have, and I won't let you give
up now!

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:51.638
Am I right?

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:52.639
Mm!

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.476
If it weren't for you, I
probably wouldn't even be here.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.314
(SAMIRE KAKEI) <i>Me, too.</i>

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.283
Huh...?

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:08.421
Because if you hadn't been
there for me, I wouldn't be
alive right now.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:11.992
That's why I want to repay you
and all the others who helped
me...

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:14.460
...with my life and with my
power.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.631
That's why... I'm gonna become a
ninja!

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.667
(IWABE) <i>Our entire class is full</i>
<i>of good people.</i>

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:26.072
<i>You may have a big mouth, but</i>
<i>you always put us first...</i>

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:30.243
and did everything you could to
<i>help us escape.</i>

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:34.147
You're the heart of this class,
<i>Boruto. That's the truth,</i>

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.082
<i>even though I kinda hate to</i>
<i>admit it...</i>

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.520
All of us have come to admire
you, to look up to you.

00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:42.589
Do you really think that that's
a bad thing?!

00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:45.458
But, I... You guys, I...

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:46.292
(MITSUKI) [gasping]

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:47.093
[gasp]

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:51.464
Mitsuki! You okay?!

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:53.033
I think that I'll manage...

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:55.702
I'm so sorry Mitsuki.

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:57.604
(MITSUKI) <i>But why?</i>

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.773
Huh?

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:02.943
I did this because I wanted to.
It was my choice.

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:09.315
I actually tried to do something
for someone else...

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:12.953
If I hadn't observed you, it
never would've crossed my mind.

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:16.322
And now that I have, I can see
that it's pretty fun!

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:19.960
So what if I got hurt? I don't
really care either way.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:21.928
Mitsuki...

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:23.564
[chuckle]

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.869
You're really strong, you know
that?

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:30.737
You think so?

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:38.712
I've made up my mind!

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:40.146
And I...

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.017
...am gonna become a ninja so
that we can all stay together!

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.821
Yeah, all right, let's do it!
Let's make Lord Sixth take back
everything!

00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:53.459
But how can we do that? Didn't
all of us get taken out of the
test already?

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:54.427
Actually, about that...

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.161
Huh...?

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:58.264
(DENKI) I thought it was
strange...

00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:01.935
<i>I don't understand why there</i>
would be a twenty‐four‐hour time
<i>limit.</i>

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:04.838
<i>I mean... as long as we still</i>
<i>have our bandanas...</i>

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:08.474
<i>Then we should be able to keep</i>
<i>trying, shouldn't we?</i>

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:13.547
And come to think of it, our
bandanas weren't taken when they
got us before.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.282
Yeah! Not even when we got
knocked unconscious!

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:20.186
And even though we were injured,
they didn't come after us
anymore.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.890
So maybe everyone's still
allowed to take part in the
exam, then!

00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:26.960
Yeah. I'm positive. that we're
all okay.

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.629
How do you know!

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:31.031
'Cause this exam is testing our
"resolve".

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:35.435
Well, all the Sensei did tell us
that this is not just an
ordinary exam...

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.271
(BORUTO) <i>I didn't realize</i>
<i>it, cause it's the pratical</i>
<i>exam,</i>

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.741
<i>but a trick question like this</i>
<i>is typical.</i>

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:44.010
You can't focus on the question.
<i>The answer's in how you solve</i>
<i>the problem.</i>

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.813
This isn't an ordinary exam.

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:49.583
This is for all of our sakes...

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.652
The early bird gets the worm...

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:52.819
Also...

00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:55.155
There's only one bell to get.

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:56.657
Then that means...!

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.826
Yeah! We're all gonna pass this
test together!

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:02.829
[determined grunt]

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:09.269
(KONOHAMARU) You think Boruto
and the others will find us?

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:13.239
Well we are making it really
easy for them to figure it
out...

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:17.110
<i>If they don't come to rescue</i>
<i>their comrades, then everyone</i>
<i>fails.</i>

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:20.280
(KONOHAMARU) Yeah... Well we'll
stand guard over these students.

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:24.384
Lord Sixth, please just go relax
and read "Make‐Out Paradise" or
something like that.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:27.988
I've read it so many times, I've
practically memorized it...

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:43.870
Probably a trap. But since Anko
<i>Sensei's here too, why not</i>
<i>indulge them?</i>

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:47.874
Heh, they're here...

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:55.281
Nue?!

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:56.883
Nue...

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:05.892
Okay first off, we'll rescue
everyone else. That gives us
more fighting strength!

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:08.729
Mm!

Metal and Wasabi, you're the
fastest ones in our whole class!

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:30.651
So it's up to you to distract
them with your speed!

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:32.919

00:12:59.112 --> 00:12:59.946
Uh?!

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:07.954
A clone! I knew it!

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:13.459
(BORUTO) <i>Namida, your jutsu will</i>
<i>be our secret weapon. I know</i>
<i>it'll work great!</i>

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:17.664
Oh, what am I going to do now?!
I just don't have that kind of
power! [gasp]

00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:18.632
[hissing]

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:19.800
Well, well...

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.035
And just what are you doing,
sneaking around?

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:25.872
I, uh...

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.040
Nue!

00:13:27.073 --> 00:13:32.478
Ahhh!

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.782
[woozy groans]

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.618
[gasps]

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:40.554
Wasabi! Oh, I was so scared!

00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:44.424
That was close! I barely
avoided getting hit by that!

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:45.692
[chuckle]

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:47.528
Thanks so much for saving us,
you guys!

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:50.463
Of course! Why would we not? It
is just what you do!

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:54.200
So, hey... Do you know how
Sarada and the others are doing?

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:56.202
Oh, uh... I'm sure they're
okay...

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:01.875
[pained grunts]

00:14:02.543 --> 00:14:03.409
[grunt]

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.479
There are two of you, and that's
all you've got?

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.215
[grunt]

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:14.020
[grunts]

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:15.889
Really Boruto? That's it?

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:17.090
[struggling]

00:14:17.123 --> 00:14:17.390
[gasp]

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.192
A sealing jutsu?!

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.426
[attack yell]

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.261
Cha!

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:22.428
[grunts]

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.398
[catching breath]

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:25.966
[grunt]

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.604
[attacking yell and grunt]

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:34.440
I'm sorry to say, Denki... But
your true opponent is now
Boruto's‐‐

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:35.441
[gasp]

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:37.844
When did that happen?!

00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:39.479
(SARADA) You were too
careless...

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:39.980
[grunt]

00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:42.048
...y'know Big Brother
Konohamaru!

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:48.188
The Transformation Jutsu... But
my target! Just how did it...?!

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:52.058
Hm?!

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:53.794
Genjutsu?!

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:54.895
(SARADA) <i>Yep.</i>

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:59.232
But I really wasn't sure it
was gonna work on you,
Konohamaru Sensei.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:02.969
(BORUTO) <i>But it did, 'cuz you</i>
<i>kept focusing on me.</i>

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:05.572
[chuckling] You sure got me!

00:15:05.606 --> 00:15:09.810
Leave it to the Sharingan and to
the craftiness you inherited
from Lord Seventh!

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:11.477
Hey!

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.716
I guess the guys were able to
pull it off, since you made it
back here, Tsuru.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:20.153
Mhm! Everyone's out there
looking for Lord Sixth now.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:23.223
Great! All right! Let's all go
get 'em together!

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:33.867
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting, Old</i>
<i>Man Kakashi!</i>

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.637
Look, I told you to call me Lord
Sixth!

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.841
So, what is it this time? I see
you've got our shadow Clones
ready...

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:43.243
So I can do this. Come on!

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.546
Ahhh!

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:46.947
Good grief...

00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:51.317
Whoa!

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.285
Ah!

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:52.953
[pained grunt]

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:54.955
I believe four's your limit,
right?

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.124
[grunts]

00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:00.126
Hold on... what is this?!

00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:02.529
It's now or never!

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:03.530
[grunt]

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.164
Oh!

00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:07.634
Whoa! [grunt]

00:16:08.234 --> 00:16:10.403
Transformation Jutsu?!

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:14.708
Ahhh! Ahhh!

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:15.809
Interesting.

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:16.342
Ah!

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.813
[pained grunts and groans]

00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:23.717
You did surprise me a little,
but it's still a childish trick.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.718
Ahhh!

00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:26.987
It's just unexpected, that's
all.

00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:31.224
[pained grunts]

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.862
You guys are still completely
hopeless.

00:16:35.896 --> 00:16:37.163
We're not done yet!

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:42.335
[pained groans]

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:45.138
Didn't you guys listen to
anything I said?!

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.773
Look we get it!

00:16:46.807 --> 00:16:50.944
No, you don't! Not even one bit!

00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:55.949
As it stands, you're not
compensating for the differences
in your individual strengths.

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:57.383
You're still scattered.

00:16:58.819 --> 00:17:02.122
Did you think all you had to do
to defeat me was to attack at
once?

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:03.990
Don't underestimate shinobi.

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:05.759
You're the one underestimating
us!

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:09.596
I guess a crushing defeat is the
only way that you're going to
learn...

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.398
Do it now!

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:18.238
[strainingÃ·]}

00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:20.273
A Sealing Barrier?!

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:23.376
It's called Multi‐Coordinated
light Formation

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:28.281
I see... You lured me to this
location as we fought.

00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:29.883
Yeah! You got that right!

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:34.287
What do you think? It's a pretty
powerful Sealing Jutsu, isn't
it?

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.221
Hmmm...

00:17:35.756 --> 00:17:44.330
[straining]

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.299
C'mon! Hurry up! Get the bell!

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:48.502
It won't hold much longer!

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:50.403
Boruto! Hurry it up!

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.106
Yeah! I know! [straining] Ya
know!

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:54.107
[straining]

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.076
Uh‐oh. Not good...

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.078
Purple Lightning!

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:00.781
Ahhh!

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:04.651
Maybe I overdid it a little...

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:05.919
Huh?!

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:11.291
[straining]

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:16.362
There's no way I'm gonna sit
back while you talk trash about
all of my friends!

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:19.199
I'm gonna become a ninja, no
matter what!

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.535
And me too!

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.036
Yeah, same here!

00:18:23.069 --> 00:18:23.970
(WASABI IZUNO) I'm in too!

00:18:24.004 --> 00:18:25.038
(HOUKI TAKETORI) That's right!

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:25.906
(RENGA KOKUBO) Me, too!

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:26.807
(TSURU ITOI) No doubt!

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.874
(NAMIDA SUZUMENO) Count me in!

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:28.975
(METAL LEE) Me, as well!

00:18:29.009 --> 00:18:29.910
(HAKO KUROI) And me!

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.177
I'm definitely in this
time!

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:32.145
Yeah, for sure!

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:33.980
Even though it is a drag!

00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:35.816
I'm going to become Hokage
one day!

00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:38.585
And I want to keep on staying
here in the Leaf.

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:46.226
[straining]

00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:53.133
That's it. It's over...

00:18:53.166 --> 00:19:03.209
[heavy breathing]

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:10.350
[pained groans]

00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:20.927
All right, that's the end! The
exams are finished!

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:22.162
And you all pass!

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:26.099
Huh?!

00:19:26.132 --> 00:19:29.169
What? I said, you all pass!

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.170
[gasp]

00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:31.471
Huh...?!

00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:33.540
Hey, what's with all the looks?!

00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:38.512
Well, it's just... we didn't
actually get the bell...

00:19:38.545 --> 00:19:40.113
Oh, this thing?

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:42.516
It's okay, just forget about the
bell.

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:46.052
You never would've gotten
it anyway, not even if hell
froze over.

00:19:46.086 --> 00:19:47.921
[speechless]

00:19:47.954 --> 00:19:51.357
Then,, what was the point of
having that rule at all?

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.760
The ninja world is harsh.

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:57.263
There are many rules and laws
out there in the real world.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:20:00.567
And those who break the rules
are regarded as scum.

00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:06.139
But if you don't value and stand
by your comrades, then you're
even worse than scum.

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:09.943
This year's students seem to
understand that idea very well.

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:14.881
The moment you joined together
and challenged me as one, you
passed.

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:17.918
But then why did you not just
say so right when we did that?

00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:21.988
Well... You did a really good
job with that Sealing Jutsu,

00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:25.526
and I was just so impressed
that I didn't want to stop you.

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:26.593
[chuckle]

00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:31.832
During this exam, you failed if
you abandoned your friends.

00:20:31.865 --> 00:20:35.001
But if you joined forces with
everyone, you passed.

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:39.973
the reason is because in a real
mission, you'll encounter many
difficulties.

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:44.545
<i>And to overcome them, you must</i>
<i>never let your bond with your</i>
<i>comrades waver...</i>

00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:45.245
[yawn]

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.582
(SHINO) <i>That resolve is</i>
<i>absolutely essential... but...</i>

00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:49.415
Hm?

00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:54.588
What's wrong? Listen, I'm almost
done, all right?

00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:57.423
No it's okay, Sensei. Keep going
with your speech.

00:20:57.457 --> 00:21:00.493
We're just too tired to even try
to talk.

00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:03.597
Of course, you guys, I guess I
should've realized...

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.633
Anyway, you all did really well
out there today!

00:21:07.634 --> 00:21:08.434
Release!

00:21:09.836 --> 00:21:10.470
Huh?!

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:12.305
(SHINO) <i>You're now genin!</i>

00:21:12.338 --> 00:21:13.874
[giggles and cheers]

00:21:13.907 --> 00:21:15.876
[sobbing]

00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:22.448
[giggles and chattering]

00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:25.752
It's a little early to
celebrate, isn't it...?

00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:29.222
So, what do you think? Just how
were this year's graduates?

00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:34.394
(KAKASHI) <i>Well, they definitely</i>
have potential. They may not be
<i>entirely polished just yet,</i>

00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:37.831
<i>but they seem to be nicely</i>
<i>gutsy.</i>

00:21:37.864 --> 00:21:39.700
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:41.835
But by the way...

00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:45.171
...you really got carried away
fighting against students like
that!

00:21:45.205 --> 00:21:45.672
Huh?!

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.710
You're always acting like this,
you know! You've no clue what
moderation is!

00:21:49.743 --> 00:21:50.310
Oh. Sorry?

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:53.246
You could try being considerate
to the students for once!

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:54.948
(KAKASHI) <i>Look, I said I'm</i>
<i>sorry!</i>

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:58.819
(IRUKA) <i>I mean, in the first</i>
<i>place, you put them in danger!</i>

00:21:58.852 --> 00:22:00.621
(KAKASHI) <i>Didn't you hear me say</i>
<i>sorry?</i>

00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:09.329
[chuckle]

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.661
(SHINO) <i>Sumire, what is a</i>
<i>three‐man squad?</i>

00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:52.766
(SUMIRE) <i>It's a three‐man team</i>
that's been put together so its
<i>shinobi can fulfill missions!</i>

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.568
(SHINO) <i>That's close, but you're</i>
<i>only half right.</i>

00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:58.772
It's three comrades who all hold
<i>each other's lives in their</i>
<i>hands.</i>

00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:00.507
The reason is because it's your
<i>teamwork that's the factor</i>

00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:03.677
which distinguishes between life
<i>and death.</i>

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.880
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations:</i>

00:24:06.913 --> 00:24:09.049
<i>"Formation of the</i>
<i>Three‐Man Squad?"</i>

00:24:09.082 --> 00:24:11.685
(SHINO) <i>And now, I'll read the</i>
<i>match ups...</i>
