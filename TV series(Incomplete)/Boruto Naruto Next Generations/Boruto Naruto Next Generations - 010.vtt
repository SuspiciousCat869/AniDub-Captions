[groaning]

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.647
<i>(Mitsuki)</i>
<i>See anything?</i>

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.982
No... nothing yet.

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:33.685
Maybe you're trying too hard.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.387
Listen, this eye of mine
is the star of hope!

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.558
There's no way that I'm gonna
let myself miss anything!

00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:43.161
<i>[eagle cry]</i>

00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:49.935
Although... we've been on the
lookout all day. So shouldn't we
have spotted the ghost at least
once by now?

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.804
What's all this "ghost" stuff
you've been talking about?

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:54.573
It's something I came up with.

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:56.542
It's my name for
that weird shadow!

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:00.712
Seriously? You couldn't come up
with a better name than that?

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:01.913
What was that?!

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:03.114
No, what was that ?!

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.083
Huh? What? Where?

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:09.588
Even if there's none today,
there were seven cases this week
of this... Ghost Incident.

00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.923
Wow, Boruto! So
brilliant and creative!

00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:13.525
[groan]

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:16.828
Till recently, it was limited
to the Academy grounds...

00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:20.599
...but lately, there have
been way more incidents
and locations.

00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:22.768
Is there something
contagious spreading?

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:26.237
Or could there be some other
cause behind all of this...?

00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:30.208
I think our dads have started to
investigate this whole thing,
too.

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:31.442
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>That's why...</i>

00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:32.477
[gasp]

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.113
...we have to solve
this before my Dad does.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:38.083
Do you really think that
we can pull that off?

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:41.820
Shikadai!

00:01:41.853 --> 00:01:43.254
Did you find something?!

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:46.457
I've got dry eye!

Aw, man! I missed out on the
chance at becoming a hero today!

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.236
It was the first day!
Don't be so impatient.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.305
We're on for
tomorrow, right?

00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:43.341
You know... you seem to
be enjoying this a lot.

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:47.813
Of course. That's because
things are never boring
when you're with Boruto.

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:50.215
How can you say that without
any embarrassment on your face?

00:03:50.248 --> 00:03:52.584
Sensei doesn't know what
we're doing, does he?

00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:55.521
Because my mom can
be scary, y'know.

00:03:55.554 --> 00:04:00.091
You gave him the note... the
one excusing our absence, right?

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:02.193
I filled it out fully!

00:04:02.227 --> 00:04:06.297
All right, awesome job! Then
that means our cover should
be all good!

00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:09.501
I'm home!

00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:11.236
Huh?

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.640
I got an interesting
call from school today.

00:04:14.673 --> 00:04:17.943
What's this excused
absence note for?

00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:22.247
<i>I, the claimant, shall be</i>
<i>absent by virtue of plague.</i>

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.416
Mitsuki!!

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.686
<i>[hammering]</i>

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:33.124
Ditching school along with your
friends. Just what could've
been going through your head,
Boruto?!

00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:38.597
Uh... It's just that, we have
an important duty that we've
just gotta fulfill right now!

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.899
This is something that you
wouldn't understand, Sensei!

00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:44.335
Still, this and that
are two separate things.

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:46.738
All that you should be doing
right now is studying.

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:50.576
Every single one of you
grown‐ups is the same.

00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:54.445
You'll end up in after school
tutoring sessions every day.
You okay with that?

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.315
Whatever! You're gonna do
what you want either way!

00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:58.550
Boruto!

00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:02.287
Don't be so impatient.
One day, you'll‐‐?!

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.455
[gasps]
[sighs]

00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:11.129
Parents seem to
be quite a pain.

00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:12.598
Yeah, kinda.

00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:14.900
(Shikadai)
But compared to my mom,...
yours is a dream...

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:17.503
[groan]

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.205
[giggle]

00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:23.441
But isn't it strange? How'd
they find out the truth?

00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:25.076
Seriously?!

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.245
We're never putting you in
charge of notes ever again.

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:31.416
<i>(Hinata)</i>
<i>He does these things because</i>
<i>he's trying to get Naruto's</i>
<i>attention.</i>

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.555
He grew up always hearing
stories about his father's
heroic deeds.

00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:39.691
So I think he's trying to
rush his own progress.

00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:42.393
I understand just how he feels.

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:45.063
The reason is because
I was the same way.

00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:49.134
But you've always acted so
mature, even back then, Shino.

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:53.371
Did you tell Naruto about this?

00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:58.409
Naruto's so busy with
work, he hardly sleeps,

00:05:58.443 --> 00:06:02.514
so I don't want to worry
him with more problems...

00:06:02.548 --> 00:06:06.718
Hmm... Even so, you
should tell him.

00:06:06.752 --> 00:06:09.621
The reason is because Naruto
is Boruto's father...

00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:13.491
...that comes before
being Hokage.

00:06:14.492 --> 00:06:17.095
You're right.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.632
Please, don't look so sad.

00:06:23.802 --> 00:06:26.638
Well, it seems that
everyone's in class today!

00:06:26.672 --> 00:06:30.108
All right! I'm going to
explain today's lesson.

00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.044
Isn't there some way for
us to cut out of class?

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:36.815
'Cause at this rate,
we're gonna end up letting
the ghost get away!

00:06:36.848 --> 00:06:41.119
Yeah... but we can't fake
any more absences.

00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:44.523
Workplace experience?

00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:50.328
People in many occupations
provide support to our daily
life here in the village.

00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:54.733
For this lesson, you'll
be learning hands‐on
about their jobs.

00:06:54.766 --> 00:06:58.436
You'll be working in teams of
three and visiting a workplace.

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.639
It's up to you to
choose an occupation.

00:07:00.672 --> 00:07:04.275
<i>(Shino)</i>
<i>Choose carefully!</i>

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:08.514
Oh! Hey, I know! How about
we go and visit a
fireworks factory?

00:07:08.547 --> 00:07:11.316
I don't know about that.
It seems pretty dangerous.

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:16.421
Come with me to a fire station
where we can learn about how
fire fighters work, Inojin!

00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:18.590
Huh? What?! Why me?!

00:07:18.624 --> 00:07:23.995
Ooh, a nail salon would be
awesome! But it'd be hard to
pass up a meat bun factory.

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.064
Tough choice, huh?

00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:27.298
Where should we go?

00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:29.434
[freaked out] Oh, um...
Well, we, uh...

00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:31.402
I want to go someplace
really fun.

00:07:31.436 --> 00:07:37.442
Shikadai, how about you dye
your hair the same color as mine
and then you pretend to be me.

00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:39.477
Are you kidding me? No!

00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:45.483
Boruto! Shikadai! Remember,
your group can choose <i>whatever</i>
<i>job they want to observe.</i>

00:07:45.517 --> 00:07:47.786
[gasp]

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:50.188
Do you understand...?

00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:55.293
‐Oh! Yeah, I get it!
‐Oh! Yeah, I get it!

00:07:55.326 --> 00:08:01.366
If we just choose a job where
you have to walk around the
village, we can still hunt for
the ghost while we do it!

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:06.171
That's right! Which means that
delivering the mail is a perfect
fit.

00:08:06.204 --> 00:08:07.773
That is true.

00:08:07.806 --> 00:08:14.613
Hey! My name's Tayori Kuroyagi.
I'll be in charge of you. Nice
to meet you all!

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:17.082
Please... go easy
on us, ya know!

00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:20.786
First, let me explain
what this job entails.

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:25.757
Right here is where we receive
all the deliveries for the day.

00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:28.159
So, we just have to get these
where they need to go, right?

00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:30.929
That sounds like a really easy
assignment, if you ask me!

00:08:30.962 --> 00:08:35.934
No, no, no! Please, don't do
that! Every parcel is precious,
so please handle them with
care!

00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:40.772
You do realize that your
arm bands are crooked.

00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:41.673
Huh?

00:08:41.707 --> 00:08:45.043
Oh! Good morning,
Bureau Chief Komame!

00:08:46.978 --> 00:08:47.445
Short...!

00:08:47.478 --> 00:08:48.246
Huh?

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.414
N‐ Nothing!

00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:51.082
Arm bands!

00:08:51.116 --> 00:08:54.920
You're also going to be handing
precious parcels out to our
customers.

00:08:54.953 --> 00:08:57.789
So why do you have
such ragged nails?!

00:08:57.823 --> 00:08:58.990
Hm?

00:08:59.024 --> 00:09:01.893
Take a good look. The spirit of
organization and neatness!

00:09:01.927 --> 00:09:04.730
This is what defines the
village's postal service.

00:09:04.763 --> 00:09:11.469
Um... Actually, the thing
is, we're just here from
the Academy to observe.

00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:13.705
Yes, I know that.

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:19.611
But as a matter of fact, I'll
have you know that, like you, I
also have some knowledge of
ninjutsu.

00:09:19.645 --> 00:09:22.648
Hiya! Hoo‐ahh!

00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.015
What's that guy doing?

00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:25.684
I have no idea.

00:09:27.385 --> 00:09:32.958
The Bureau Chief isn't a bad
guy. He's just very meticulous
about everything he does.

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:35.527
That seems like kind
of a drag...

00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:40.699
I guess that it can be a little
rough at first, but once you
get used to it, it's not bad at
all!

00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:44.102
[doorbell]

00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:56.447
[panting]

00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:57.916
Postal Service!

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:01.953
Hi there! Thanks for coming so
far out of the way every day.

00:10:01.987 --> 00:10:03.955
This package is for you ma'am!

00:10:03.989 --> 00:10:06.958
Oh, great! I've been
waiting for this!

00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:15.300
Hm. When you see somebody
getting so happy like that,

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:18.670
it really makes doing this
job completely worthwhile.

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:24.042
Delivering the mail to everyone
takes a whole lot of energy,
doesn't it?

00:10:24.075 --> 00:10:26.578
It may look like an easy
job on the surface, but...

00:10:26.612 --> 00:10:31.482
I think it's the simple tasks
where you can't cut corners
that make it challenging.

00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:34.886
And by the way, what's Boruto
been doing over there?

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.258
[nervous laugh] Oh, please don't
pay any attention to him.

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:44.530
Man, where could that ghost
be? It's hard to find!

00:10:44.563 --> 00:10:48.600
<i>(Announcer)</i>
<i>And now, it's time for the</i>
<i>ribbon‐cutting ceremony.</i>

00:10:48.634 --> 00:10:51.069
<i>[cheering]</i>

00:10:51.102 --> 00:10:52.871
Dad?!

<i>(Announcer)</i>
<i>Let's all thank the Seventh</i>
<i>Hokage, Lord Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:05.083
So you saw me, after all...

00:11:05.116 --> 00:11:08.419
You know, that postal bag you're
carrying looks good on you.

00:11:08.453 --> 00:11:12.257
And you look like you're busy
protecting the peace of the
village as usual, Dad.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.860
Well, this is a part
of the job, too.

00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:19.130
A workplace experience field
trip, huh? Your mom told me
about it.

00:11:19.164 --> 00:11:21.800
It's not like I chose it because
I like the job or anything.

00:11:21.833 --> 00:11:24.102
Listen, Boruto.

00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:29.508
Being able to get a letter
delivered with just a single
stamp to anywhere in the world
is just amazing.

00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:32.611
Whatever! You probably heard
someone else say that!

00:11:32.644 --> 00:11:34.713
You could tell, huh?

00:11:34.746 --> 00:11:37.916
Uh... um... L‐Lord Hokage!

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:39.918
Hi! I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:43.254
My son's a handful, but please,
take good care of him!

00:11:43.288 --> 00:11:44.956
Yes, of course!

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.459
Okay, do your best!

00:11:48.493 --> 00:11:52.230
Wow, how cool! So your
dad's the Hokage, huh?

00:11:52.263 --> 00:11:54.432
It's the first time I've
ever spoken to him.

00:11:54.465 --> 00:11:55.200
Oh please.

00:11:55.233 --> 00:11:56.668
What's wrong?

00:11:56.702 --> 00:12:00.371
Listen, guys, let's just split
these up and deliver these
quickly.

00:12:00.405 --> 00:12:03.474
At this rate, the sun'll
set before we start!

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:05.644
Shikadai! Mitsuki, let's go!

00:12:05.677 --> 00:12:07.378
‐All right!
‐Okay!

00:12:07.412 --> 00:12:10.516
Uh, wait, Boruto! Please!
Be careful with those!

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:26.998
Delivering the mail is
a lot more fun than I
thought it would be.

00:12:28.934 --> 00:12:31.402
Hey, it's okay!
Just calm down!

00:12:31.436 --> 00:12:33.972
I'm so nervous, Argh!

00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:38.510
Wow... Epic fail...

00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:43.582
Now, be very careful
with that gun powder.

00:12:43.615 --> 00:12:47.786
Ha, no big deal. This is just
like a smoke bomb, right?!

00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:49.855
[freaked out]

00:12:53.925 --> 00:12:56.027
<i>(Sarada)</i>
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

00:12:56.795 --> 00:12:58.964
Huh? That was Boruto.

00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:00.932
Why do you think he's in
such a hurry right now?

00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:05.837
I don't know, but we just cannot
lose to him! Let's hurry
over to the meat bun factory!

00:13:05.871 --> 00:13:08.173
Come on! Ugh!

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:16.915
Postal service delivery!

00:13:16.948 --> 00:13:18.817
Hey, it's Boruto!

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.887
Hm? You guys chose a water
purification plant?

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.656
Isn't that kinda boring?

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.694
The water purification plant
is the lifeline of the Leaf
Village!

00:13:28.727 --> 00:13:31.863
Well, in all honesty, this place
is kinda boring, though...

00:13:31.897 --> 00:13:33.665
[gasp] Really?

00:13:33.699 --> 00:13:36.067
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:37.969
No, it's okay. I'm
having lots of fun here!

00:13:38.003 --> 00:13:41.807
Don't worry! It's just a
workplace field trip! It's
probably boring everywhere!

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.309
Well, see you later!

00:13:44.342 --> 00:13:45.544
Oh, Boruto! Wait!

00:13:45.577 --> 00:13:48.213
Sorry, I'm kinda in
a big hurry, ya know?

00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:51.850
I'll be on my way!

00:13:51.883 --> 00:13:56.755
We finished delivering all the
packages and letters that we
had.

00:13:56.788 --> 00:13:58.857
Oh, wow! That was fast!

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.058
Want us to take yours?

00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:02.694
Oh, no, thanks, but I
can take care of this.

00:14:02.728 --> 00:14:05.864
Why don't you guys just go and
take a little break now?

00:14:05.897 --> 00:14:07.432
This job's too easy!

00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:08.834
<i>(Mitsuki)</i>
<i>Boruto.</i>

00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:11.236
Huh? What's up, Mitsuki?

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:14.906
Listen, I overheard someone
from the Police Force.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.644
Seems there's been a
sighting at Senju Park.

00:14:18.677 --> 00:14:22.614
Senju Park's far away, on the
other side of the village.

00:14:22.648 --> 00:14:23.982
Think we make it in time?

00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:25.917
We're just gonna
have to make it!

00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:28.987
Hey, take care of
the rest, will ya?

00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:32.157
[gasp]

00:14:37.195 --> 00:14:39.565
<i>(Medical Ninja)</i>
<i>Be careful there.</i>

00:14:50.075 --> 00:14:54.045
(Medical Ninja)
Most of his chakra was drained.
He's in critical condition now.

00:14:57.949 --> 00:15:06.057
He was just sitting quietly on
this bench, but then he
screamed and went on a rampage!

00:15:21.907 --> 00:15:23.542
Hurry! Hurry!

00:15:27.178 --> 00:15:30.381
[chuckle] It looks like
we got here too late.

00:15:30.415 --> 00:15:32.450
We must've just
missed it all.

00:15:32.483 --> 00:15:33.819
Damn it!

00:15:33.852 --> 00:15:37.789
I swear that we're gonna catch
you the next time that you
appear!

00:15:43.028 --> 00:15:45.096
That makes... what, eight
incidents this week?

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:50.435
There doesn't seem to be a
common thread linking the
incidents that've occurred so
far.

00:15:50.468 --> 00:15:55.406
At first, it was limited to the
<i>area around the Academy.</i>

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.043
<i>Now it's occurring at random</i>
<i>times and places.</i>

00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:05.751
Unfortunately, as of right now,
we have no concrete data on who
or what might be behind these
incidents.

00:16:05.784 --> 00:16:07.452
(Sai)
<i>Only...</i>

00:16:07.485 --> 00:16:09.287
Only...?

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.491
I did find one clue during the
investigation this afternoon.

00:16:13.525 --> 00:16:17.328
Seems somehow, Forbidden
Technology is involved.

00:16:17.362 --> 00:16:20.632
Hold on... are you
saying that‐‐!

00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:23.168
The Hashirama Cell.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.608
The Hashirama Cell isn't
something that just anyone
can get their hands on.

00:16:29.641 --> 00:16:34.713
You were part of the ANBU Black
Ops, so you should know that
well.

00:16:34.746 --> 00:16:36.114
ANBU, the Leaf's
covert agency...

00:16:36.147 --> 00:16:39.785
And within it, the even more
top‐secret Foundation.

00:16:39.818 --> 00:16:43.822
I've heard it had a team
conducting research on the
Hashirama Cell.

00:16:43.855 --> 00:16:50.361
What you're saying may be true,
but the Foundation was disbanded
after Danzo's death.

00:16:50.395 --> 00:16:52.998
I didn't believe it at
first, either, but...

00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:55.133
...then I saw this...

00:16:56.067 --> 00:16:59.104
But that is the result
of using Wood Style!

00:16:59.137 --> 00:17:01.807
Yes. Not many can
use Wood Style.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.876
Search the Land of Fire,
and you'd only find a few.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:10.849
Furthermore, the man from
today's incident doesn't
have that power.

00:17:10.882 --> 00:17:12.117
But there's one exception...

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.686
What you're talking about
is the Hashirama Cell...

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:23.795
The top‐secret team in the
Foundation used the Hashirama
Cell to research a device that
could extract someone's chakra.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.064
But still, what could
one achieve by stealing
someone's chakra?

00:17:26.097 --> 00:17:31.302
If killing someone was their
goal, that's a very roundabout
way to do it.

00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:36.307
Murder isn't the purpose.
They're gathering up chakra.

00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:38.544
What? They're gathering chakra?

00:17:38.577 --> 00:17:40.378
But why? What do
they use it for?

00:17:40.411 --> 00:17:44.783
I don't know that answer yet.
The Foundation was a very
secretive organization.

00:17:44.816 --> 00:17:50.889
Although... I know that the
team's field of research was
...military weaponry.

00:17:50.922 --> 00:17:55.861
Well, this whole situation got
really sketchy all of a sudden.

00:17:55.894 --> 00:17:59.264
Yeah, you're right. So we have
to do something immediately.

00:17:59.297 --> 00:18:03.334
Former members of the Foundation
could be hiding out almost
anywhere.

00:18:03.368 --> 00:18:06.838
Whatever you're planning on
doing next, be extremely
careful.

00:18:06.872 --> 00:18:10.008
I'll go comb through the
Foundation's data once more.

00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:12.010
I'll come give you a hand.

00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:18.183
Oh, man. I guess that I'm gonna
have to spend the whole night
here yet again.

00:18:29.928 --> 00:18:33.665
Sorry. Guess I
woke you up, huh?

00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:35.734
I didn't have a change
of clothes, so...

00:18:35.767 --> 00:18:39.304
Here, hand that to me.

00:18:41.306 --> 00:18:44.375
You know, earlier I
ran into Boruto in town.

00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:48.947
Seriously ... Why does that kid
always seem so irritated all of
the time?

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.484
He's just really eager to
come into his own and be
acknowledged.

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:56.021
You should be familiar
with that, right?

00:18:56.054 --> 00:19:00.826
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>I wish he could stay a</i>
<i>kid a little longer.</i>

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:03.061
<i>But I guess that's just</i>
<i>me being selfish...</i>

00:19:03.094 --> 00:19:08.433
Every single day... he grows a
little bit more. That's what
kids do!

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:13.772
[sigh] Growing up, I
didn't even have a dad...

00:19:13.805 --> 00:19:19.110
<i>To be honest, I, I don't even</i>
know how to connect with Boruto
<i>sometimes.</i>

00:19:19.144 --> 00:19:20.979
<i>And I'm sure that</i>
<i>he can sense that.</i>

00:19:21.012 --> 00:19:28.253
That isn't true. I think he
understands completely, in his
own way, at least.

00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:30.889
I hope so...

00:19:30.922 --> 00:19:39.998
You know... It's funny...
sometimes, like when he laughs,
he looks exactly like you.

00:19:43.969 --> 00:19:47.138
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>I'm not gonna let that</i>
<i>ghost get away anymore.</i>

00:19:47.172 --> 00:19:50.742
Let's go even faster than
yesterday and get this mail
delivered!

00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:54.145
Don't you think that we should
confirm the delivery route
first?

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:56.114
Meh. Forget that!

00:19:56.147 --> 00:19:59.250
Come on! We can just wing it!

00:19:59.284 --> 00:20:01.920
I think today's going to
be a lot of fun again.

00:20:01.953 --> 00:20:05.290
Seriously, aren't you even
a little embarrassed saying
stuff like that?

00:20:05.323 --> 00:20:09.394
Like I explained, we're
looking for it right now!

00:20:09.427 --> 00:20:12.263
Too bad! That explanation
just isn't gonna cut it!

00:20:12.297 --> 00:20:14.666
This is an emergency!

00:20:24.309 --> 00:20:26.211

00:20:26.244 --> 00:20:30.649

00:20:30.682 --> 00:20:33.018
No. Seems normal to me.
Gah!

00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:38.924
My limited‐edition potato chips
were supposed to be delivered
yesterday, but they weren't!
What's the deal?!

00:20:38.957 --> 00:20:42.928
I‐ I don't know! We delivered
everything, didn't we?

00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:46.031
What are you gonna do when
I die of hunger, huh?!

00:20:46.064 --> 00:20:48.700
We've been getting complaints
like this all morning!

00:20:48.734 --> 00:20:50.969
Just how did you three deliver
the mail yesterday?!

00:20:51.002 --> 00:20:52.838
Wait, where's Tayori?

00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:55.707
He's out re‐delivering
everything that you messed up!

00:20:55.741 --> 00:20:58.176
Wow, this really did
not turn out well...

00:20:58.209 --> 00:21:01.713
Anyway, look. Should
we go help too?

00:21:01.747 --> 00:21:03.048
Good idea.

00:21:03.081 --> 00:21:05.116
Are you guys kidding me?!

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.086
There's no way that I'd let you
to go out there and make yet
another mess!

00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:11.389
You can stay in here and take
inventory of the stamps!

00:21:11.422 --> 00:21:14.292
Come on! Are you kidding?!

two sheets of stamps...

Stop messing around and
count them quickly.

00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:24.803
Otherwise, we'll never be able
to get out of here and go ghost
hunting.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:29.007

star of hope! Damn it!

being so irresponsible!
