WEBVTT

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.576
(clothes rustling)

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.047
(dramatic music)

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.250
He can still stand?

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.520
It's fine. 'Cause
you're done, Urashiki!

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.056
Done, you say?

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.629
Don't underestimate
me, you little brat!

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.698
What, are you looking to
get beat up some more?

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.100
He's not bluffing.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.103
He still has something
dangerous hidden up his sleeve.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.976
(ravenous slurping)

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.379
It's not enough.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.450
(gentle dramatic music)

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:52.986
(laughing maniacally)

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.223
(eyeball crunching)

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.399
Did he just eat his own eye?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.634
What is he doing?

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.105
(chuckling maniacally)

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:19.513
(crunching loudly)

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:23.684
(giggling maniacally)

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:27.187
(gentle dramatic music)

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.048
(explosion booming)

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.388
(dramatic music)

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.599
(gasping)

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.568
He's changed his form?

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.104
I don't think that's the
only thing that's happened.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.539
This is really bad.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.208
I can feel evil chakra
pouring off of him.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:24.611
(chuckling maniacally)

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.350
You fools, I'm gonna
beat all of you,

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.987
'til you die!

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.723
(opening theme music)

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:40.627
(singing in Japanese)

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:19.459
(tense music)

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:23.497
Big Bro and those
guys are gonna die.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.966
Just what in the
world is he, anyway?

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.335
This whole situation
seems really bad.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:31.071
What do you think we
should do, Konohamaru?

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.807
We should probably get someone.

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:37.044
Right! We need to go
and notify the village.

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:40.714
Not good!

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:45.185
(explosion booming)

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.089
What did he just do?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.824
I didn't even see anything.

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:52.826
It seems as if his
powers have increased

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.561
and gone off the charts.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.331
(dramatic music)

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:03.504
I'm gonna crush every last
one of you, all of you.

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:07.274
Well, except for Naruto
Uzumaki, that is.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.242
What?

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:10.377
You're special, I
want you to suffer,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.713
and then I'll drag
Nine Tails out of you.

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:14.114
Sound good?

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.350
There's no way I'm
gonna let you do that.

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:19.219
Yeah, and I'm not gonna
lose to you, either!

00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:22.089
This time we gotta
stop him for good.

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:25.526
(grunting)

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.463
-(blades clanging)
-(punches thudding)

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.565
(grunting)

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:32.966
(yelling)

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.036
(blows thudding)

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:45.112
Damn it, I had no
idea our power levels

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:46.547
would be so different.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.948
What are we supposed to do?

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.817
He isn't an opponent you
can approach carelessly.

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.953
For now, I'll take
the lead on this.

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.222
I'll do it!

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:58.358
Naruto, don't let your
emotions get the best of you.

00:05:58.392 --> 00:06:00.594
You're the main one
that he's after here.

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.435
(explosion rumbling)

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.304
No way, what was that?

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:14.975
(groaning)

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:16.476
Oh, good, you're awake.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.215
Sakura?

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.188
You fools are simply
no match for me!

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.693
Fire Style: Flame Bomb!

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.729
(flame roaring)

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:39.433
(explosion rumbling)

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:40.734
Did it work?

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:43.704
(inhaling raspily)

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.939
No way!

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:47.107
He ate it!

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.076
It seems like he
can't use any type

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:50.944
of Transportation
Technique in this state,

00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:53.380
but in exchange he can tap into

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.083
some kind of enormous
reserve of power.

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:57.951
If only he were here now,

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:00.787
at least the playing
field would be level.

00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:03.991
Come on, isn't there a jutsu
that could stop Urashiki?

00:07:04.024 --> 00:07:05.359
Huh, old man?

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:08.762
Hmm, I'm gonna try to
stop his movement somehow.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.865
You guys focus on keeping
him distracted for right now.

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.967
Okay, leave it to us!

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.802
(grunting)

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:18.238
-(blows thudding)
-(screaming)

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:21.041
Anything you might
try is futile!

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:26.213
Art of the Raging Lion's Mane!

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:28.482
You're really
underestimating me.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.951
(screaming)

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:33.587
(rocks rumbling)

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.788
-(gasping)
-Pervy Sage!

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.958
There's just no way that
something as pathetic as that

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.294
is going to stop me, you fool!

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:42.229
(growling)

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:44.231
Earth Style: Dark Swamp!

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:47.167
This'll make sure you
aren't able to move anymore.

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:51.038
(soft dramatic music)

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:56.310
(explosion booming)

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:59.713
Is that really all you've got?

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:02.583
(growling)

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:03.984
Ah!

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.853
But, we're telling
you the truth!

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.288
Big Bro Naruto and his
friends are in trouble.

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:09.489
Believe us!

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:11.825
Please, at this rate, Big
Brother Naruto and them

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:13.093
are gonna be killed!

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:14.728
What's going on, guys?

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.466
A bad guy's attacking
Naruto and the others?

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.202
What should we do, Shikamaru?

00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:24.805
You know exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.840
We're going to go help them.

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.109
Mm-hmm, yeah, you're right.

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:31.044
Let's go and save Naruto.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:35.649
Last time, we let Sasuke
get away. Not this time.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.086
We can't afford to lose
any more of our friends.

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:42.589
(chakra buzzing softly)

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:45.692
(grunting)

00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:47.594
You've done enough for now.

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:51.865
If you use up any more chakra,

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:54.234
you won't be able to move.

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:57.337
I'll be just fine. Don't worry.

00:08:57.371 --> 00:09:01.341
And the same goes for you.
You're in no condition to move.

00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:06.079
(grunting)

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.182
Your wound isn't healed yet.

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:13.320
I'll be fine. You
stay here and rest.

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.521
Please wait!

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:19.326
There's just something that
I really want to ask you.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:27.301
It seems all I do is
cause you trouble.

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:41.582
(dramatic music)

00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:46.520
(chuckling maniacally)

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:48.121
-(punch thudding)
-(grunting painfully)

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:50.324
Damn it. Take this!

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:58.999
-(face thudding)
-(grunting)

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.367
Doesn't it didn't make you angry

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.469
that your friends
have to protect you?

00:10:02.503 --> 00:10:05.205
Well I'll keep destroying
everything you hold dear

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:08.675
until you get angry enough
to give me what I'm after.

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.978
(grunting)

00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.446
Just shut up!

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.817
(laughing maniacally)

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.253
His chakra's overflowing.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.822
At this rate the Nine
Tails is going to emerge.

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:24.458
(clogs clacking)

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:26.393
You insects!

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:28.462
-(bodies thudding)
-(both grunting)

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:30.731
(groaning)

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:37.971
(tense dramatic music)

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:41.308
Stop, Urashiki. Don't
you dare touch him.

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.445
(clones popping)

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:48.582
(footsteps clopping)

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.785
(grunting)

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.554
I don't care if
you're the vessel

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:55.455
or anything anymore, brat.

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:56.857
Die!

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.726
(swords clanging)

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:07.434
(growling menacingly)

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:08.936
(metal clanging)

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:11.705
Don't get ahead of
yourself, Urashiki.

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:15.175
(tense dramatic music)

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:21.281
(wind howling)

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.319
I'm glad you're okay.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:28.889
Well, well. I totally forgot
that you were even here.

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:31.291
(chuckles derisively)

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:33.427
So one troublemaker
gets taken down

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.629
and another one just
takes his place?

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.297
Oh well, it's all the same.

00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:39.833
I'll just defeat you
like the last weakling.

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.301
By weakling?

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:44.671
I'm absolutely certain that
you can't possibly mean me.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.006
Am I right?

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.041
(blows thudding)

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:49.409
Pervy Sage!

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.280
(dramatic music)

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:56.149
From the North to the South

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.719
to the East and to
the West as well!

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:01.922
Not even the gods can beat
this Legendary Sannin!

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:04.658
I am the White-Maned
Toad Charmer!

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.560
Red-hot ninja!

00:12:06.593 --> 00:12:08.795
'Tis I, Master Jiraiya!

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:11.098
(dramatic music)

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:14.568
The numbskull's teacher's
also a numbskull.

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:17.538
So far you've been
doing whatever you want.

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:21.408
We're not letting you get
away with that anymore.

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:24.144
It doesn't matter how many
of you there are facing me!

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:28.415
Because ultimately weaklings
are all merely weaklings!

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:29.883
This'll end it.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:32.085
(grunting)

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:34.888
(explosion banging)

00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.356
No way!

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.793
Not to brag, but my Rasengan's
a cut above the rest.

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:41.828
I say that should
have done the trick.

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:44.665
(dramatic music)

00:12:51.205 --> 00:12:54.041
That one actually stung
at least a little bit.

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:55.475
You may be garbage insects

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:58.178
but you do such
interesting things.

00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:02.182
Your pitiful desperation really
does make me laugh though.

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.818
In the end, you're only mortals.

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:06.086
You're nothing but buffoons

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.122
playing a game of
monkey see monkey do!

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.225
How did he?

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:13.727
What's his deal? Is he immortal?

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:16.496
Stay focused.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.533
Fire Style: Fierce
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.237
(flames roaring)

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:28.108
Ameno Subaruboshinomikoto:
Gyokkou!

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.045
Now die all you
annoying insects!

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:34.414
(laughing maniacally)

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:35.949
(harrumphs)

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.017
Just be gone!

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.185
(grunting)

00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:40.687
-No! Stop it!
-(grunting painfully)

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:42.189
Urashiki!

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:44.625
Goodbye, trash.

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.360
(panting)

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:47.895
Get it together!

00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:49.329
Oh, don't be so worried.

00:13:49.363 --> 00:13:51.965
I'm going to kill
you last of all.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.367
Quit messing around!

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.436
Just shut up and keep a
close watch as this unfolds.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.772
After all you don't
want to miss the moment

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:01.141
when your precious
friends get annihilated!

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:04.511
(laughing maniacally)

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.381
Amaterasu!

00:14:07.414 --> 00:14:10.083
(dramatic music)

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:14.221
-(swords clanging)
-(both grunting)

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:17.824
-(blows thudding)
-(grunting)

00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:20.427
-(grunting)
-(attack thudding)

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.962
(groaning)

00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:23.197
Bastard!

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:27.334
(kick thudding)

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.902
(yelling)

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:31.371
(groaning)

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.079
(growling)

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:42.115
(dramatic music)

00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:52.326
(grunting painfully)

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.162
Pervy Sage.

00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:58.565
(soft dramatic music)

00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:01.301
(body thudding)

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:06.273
(heart thumping)

00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:07.474
(grunting)

00:15:07.508 --> 00:15:09.643
(roaring)

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:15.382
(foreboding music)

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.354
Ah, at long last
the Fox awakens.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.756
Don't let Nine
Tails overwhelm you.

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:25.225
Just calm yourself down.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:29.496
Right now, Naruto's being
entirely controlled by his rage.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.566
So he can't tell
friend or foe apart.

00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:36.036
How interesting all of this is.

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:39.239
Show me some more
rage, Naruto Uzumaki,

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:41.175
and soon, now, I'm
going to be taking

00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:43.644
all of your Nine Tails' chakra.

00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:46.113
(groaning)

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:50.050
(roaring)

00:15:50.918 --> 00:15:53.954
(explosion booming)

00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:56.557
Whoa. They're so powerful.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.127
Not good. At this rate,
Naruto won't make it.

00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:03.096
What do you mean by that?

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.498
The Nine Tails' chakra

00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:07.301
that's leaking out of Naruto
is a double-edged sword.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:10.304
It may give him great
power, but on the other hand

00:16:10.337 --> 00:16:14.007
it'll start rapidly eating
away at his body as well.

00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.610
No way!

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:19.746
On top of that, this is like
a lavish feast of chakra.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.884
Naruto will probably continue
fighting until he dies.

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:26.420
Then we've gotta stop
all this somehow.

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:28.622
He's now lost his
whole identity.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.625
It won't be like the last
time that this happened.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:34.828
And we'll need to find a
way to deal with Urashiki.

00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:36.797
This'll be far from easy.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.498
(tense foreboding music)

00:16:38.532 --> 00:16:39.533
Dad!

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:42.336
What are you doing?

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:46.473
I won't let him die. I
know I could save him!

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.275
Hold on. What'd you say?

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:55.749
Don't tell me that he's going
to go for Naruto's Rasengan.

00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:58.352
Is he going to try to catch it?

00:16:58.385 --> 00:17:02.256
For crying out loud, having
gigantic idiots for students

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:04.424
sure is a lot of work, isn't it?

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.493
(gentle brooding music)

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:09.296
He's only got one shot at
this reckless scheme of his.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.832
I guess the two of us
should save our strength

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.700
for the moment when he needs it.

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:16.203
(groaning)

00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:17.004
Hey.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:20.741
-(roaring)
-(blow thudding)

00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:22.209
How interesting.

00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:25.345
Go on, have a death
match between friends.

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:26.146
(somber music)

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.682
Yeah, right. This is nothing.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.385
(somber music)

00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:37.758
Naruto, don't worry
about all this. Okay?

00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:41.762
After all I know you better
than anyone else. Don't I?

00:17:41.795 --> 00:17:44.198
(growling)

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:46.934
I know you're way too strong

00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:49.870
to allow yourself to be
consumed by your rage.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.239
(roaring)

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:55.509
Come here.

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:58.579
(growling)

00:18:01.648 --> 00:18:06.253
I accept it all completely.
Do you hear me, dad?

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:09.556
Boruto, no!

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.525
Just be gone!

00:18:11.558 --> 00:18:13.994
(growling)

00:18:16.597 --> 00:18:19.700
(soft dramatic music)

00:18:36.984 --> 00:18:39.920
That was a really
nice throw, you know?

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:42.990
(dramatic music)

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:48.228
Guess I don't feel
like losing today.

00:18:48.262 --> 00:18:50.097
[Both] Now we're gonna blast you

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.633
into a bunch of
tiny little pieces.

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:55.435
(dramatic music)

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.674
Fine then, whatever! I'll
just kill both of you!

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:03.510
Ameno Subaruboshinomikoto:
Ryugu!

00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:08.048
(attack screeching)

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:15.289
(dramatic music)

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:20.427
(explosion booming)

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.130
(both roaring)

00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:28.035
(laughing maniacally)

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:32.806
(blow thudding)

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.942
And that was one for the road.

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:36.410
(dramatic music)

00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:37.611
You bastards!

00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:40.380
Here's one from me. Kirin!

00:19:40.414 --> 00:19:41.915
(attack crackling)

00:19:41.949 --> 00:19:44.518
(attack roaring)

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.688
(attack crackling)

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:50.657
[Both] All this ends right now!

00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:52.826
(roaring)

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.596
(dramatic music)

00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:59.499
(screaming)

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:02.236
(dramatic music)

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:07.007
(screeching)

00:20:11.111 --> 00:20:14.114
(dramatic music)

00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:27.327
(explosion booming)

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:44.244
(exhaling tiredly)

00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:47.080
Hey, are you all right?

00:20:47.114 --> 00:20:50.017
The Nine Tails' chakra probably
drained him quite a bit

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.719
but he oughta be
okay after some rest.

00:20:55.722 --> 00:20:58.458
Were we able to stop Urashiki?

00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:02.062
That Rasengan just now
eliminated him completely.

00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:06.633
So there's nothing to
worry about anymore.

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.135
We defeated him, you know?

00:21:08.168 --> 00:21:10.037
Just like I said we would.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.605
(body thumping)

00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:14.875
(bright gentle music)

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:18.745
Having idiots for
students is a lot of work.

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:20.948
Boy, that's for sure, huh?

00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:24.318
(bright gentle music)

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:34.127
We did it. Huh, dad?

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:43.504
(closing theme music)

00:21:52.846 --> 00:21:56.717
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:14.228
(upbeat music)

00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:17.464
So, now that you're done with
this adventure, what's next?

00:23:18.332 --> 00:23:20.934
We're going back
home where we belong.

00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:23.737
[Boruto] Mom and dad are
probably worried, so.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.541
Okay, well, you're welcome
to come back and visit again

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:28.942
anytime you want.

00:23:28.976 --> 00:23:32.346
Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations.

00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:33.614
Crossing Time.

00:23:33.647 --> 00:23:37.184
All right, let's get back
home to our Leaf Village.

00:23:41.255 --> 00:23:45.325
(closing theme music)
