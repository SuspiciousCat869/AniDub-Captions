00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.992
Well? Explain
yourself. Go on.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.963
Boruto Uzumaki has
used a Scientific
Ninja Tool... which

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:33.233
is prohibited in the
Chunin Exams.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.870
It defeats the Exams'
purpose of showing
your true strength.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.440
Lee, Boruto Uzumaki
is disqualified.

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.610
We'll have to figure
out how to revise the
results...

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:47.281
Boruto Uzumaki has
been disqualified for
using an illegal

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:48.315
ninja tool!

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:52.085
<i>[crowd roaring]</i>

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.321
You're no longer a
ninja either.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.295
What've I...

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:05.599

It seems I've
finally found you.

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:15.542
Hey, look! What is
that up there?!

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.658
Get behind me, now.
Stay put.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.072
So that man is one of
them, as well, huh?

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.180
Wh- What are they?

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.082
[gasping]
Impossible!

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.190
<i>Those eyes...!</i>
<i>Byakugan?!</i>

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:07.327
So, it's you... Are
you related to Kaguya
Otsutsuki?!

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:11.665
Hm. There are too
many vulgar creatures
in the way right now.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.434
Shall we cleanse the
area first?

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.903
Perhaps so.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.938
All right, who are
you?!

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.440
I'm using this arena
to show off my
invention--

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.542
No, stop!

<i>W-What's happening?!</i>
<i>What's happening?</i>

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.500

Wait, those two...
it can't be!

happen with the

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.785
This is no time to
worry about the
Exams!

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.753
Hurry up and
evacuate everyone!

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:17.751
Father!

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.521
What is this?

Uh?

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:31.932
Don't misjudge your
battle strength.

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:34.301
You're no match for
this enemy.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.004
Prioritize evacuating
everyone.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.708
Yes, Father.

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:51.552
<i>[screaming and panicking]</i>

Denki, where to next?

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:55.656
The southern exit
collapsed. No one can
get out that way!

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.124
Okay, leave it to me!

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.326
Metal, you need to go
to the central
stairway!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.527
Got it!

Whoa! Dad?!

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:18.645
Don't touch my
daughter. Or you want
me to shorten that

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:23.283

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:37.331
It's too dangerous!
Go on! Go with
the others!

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:37.965

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.487
If I use this power
in front of everyone,

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.656
then I won't be
able to stay here.

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.059
But, then, at
this point...

00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:15.429
It doesn't really
matter anyway.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:23.103

Otsutsuki!

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:46.126
That is a dangerous
power. And so, I
won't let you use it.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.998
[groaning]

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.133
Boruto...

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:58.572
Wow, this is amazing!
The techniques we
have don't possess

00:08:58.605 --> 00:08:59.740
this kind of power...

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:02.276
[chuckling]
You creatures...

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:04.711

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:15.355
Oh, so it's you
again, is it?

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:19.059
It seems that you're
good at surprising
people, but not very

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:21.328
good at being taken
by surprise.

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.530
Big words coming
from you!

Are you done?

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:37.978
You won't escape.

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:41.882

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:45.352
Hm. Both of you
with your children...

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.420
Ridiculous.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.158
Uh?

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:52.025
Hmm.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.464
[grunting]

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.100
That was too close!

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.803
We won't let you do
whatever you want!

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:05.272
Boruto! Are
you all right?

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:06.807
Yeah. Glad you're
safe.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.242
How trivial.

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:15.282
He absorbed that?!

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:17.451
Kinshiki.

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:18.752
Right!

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.088
They're the ones,
Naruto.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:25.058
That scroll of
Kaguya's had an entry
about their arrival.

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:28.996
So they're the guys
she created the White
Zetsu to prepare for?

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:32.432
Yeah. Their objective
is the Chakra Fruit.

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:36.370
They want the Tailed
Beast Chakra in you.
They want Kurama.

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:37.671
Hmm?

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:40.741
Heh. You know
that much, do you?

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:43.143
I am Momoshiki
Otsutsuki.

00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:46.647
I belong to the same
clan as Kaguya.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.751
And I am his
guardian,... Kinshiki
Otsutsuki.

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:52.386
Just what do
you want here?!

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:55.889
Why, you, of course!
You're the one who
has the strongest

00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:58.559
chakra in this entire
seedbed.

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:02.162
If we harvest it from
you, we can replant
the Divine Tree.

00:11:02.196 --> 00:11:04.464
[grunting]
The Divine
Tree?!

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:08.302
Yes, of course. Our
mission is to restart
Kaguya's work, and

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:09.937
to do so, we're
going to collect the
chakra scattered from

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.473
the Chakra Fruit and
revive the Divine
Tree!

00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:21.648
The Divine Tree. That
legendary tree that
was the source of

00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:23.784
power for Kaguya
Otsutsuki,

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:25.686
the founder of
all shinobi.

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:30.090
Kaguya got the Chakra
Fruit from the Divine
Tree and created shinobi.

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:33.093
But then that tree
was lost for all
eternity.

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:35.362
Or so I've heard...

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:38.832
That's right. And
what do you hope to
do by resurrecting

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:40.367
that legend,
Otsutsuki?

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.737
Well, isn't it
obvious? We shall
create pills from all

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.672
the chakra that we
gather.

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:50.077
As long as we have
the pills... we
remain young,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.246
immortal, and
invincible!

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.481
So, it's kinda like
medicine, then.

00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:59.686
You catch on quickly.
Well, then, you
understand just how

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.255
remarkable these are.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:05.025
As long as we have
these pills we're
able to acquire true

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.195
power instantly, with
no effort whatsoever!

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:11.365
You mean... you're
just cowards who rely
on doping?!

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.034
You're only using
tools and drugs as
a crutch!

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.336
That isn't
true power at all!

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:26.146
How is he able to see
right through our
attacks so easily?!

00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:31.919
[chuckling] I
already know...

00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:35.522
<i>...you're currently</i>
<i>busy using your</i>
<i>weapon, your sand, for</i>

00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:39.193
<i>search and rescue</i>
<i>efforts, and as for</i>
<i>you, you left your</i>

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:40.861
<i>real weapon</i>
<i>at home.</i>

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:42.529
So what's your point?

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:45.432
Investigation's my
specialty. If you
were at full

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:48.001
strength... then that
would be another
matter.

00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:49.636
But as you are now...

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:55.042
You see? That happens
when you don't have
enough sand!

00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:56.977
Uh!

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.146
I won't fall for the
same trick twice!

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.547
[grunting]

00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:02.916
Now it's my turn!
Ha!

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.518
That's the
Kazekage's!

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:07.354
[grunting]

00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:10.357
[grunting]

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:15.863
You see? Your real
weapon wouldn't have
broken, but with that

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:18.098
pathetic sword you
have now...

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.667
He has underestimated
us.

00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:21.702
Yeah...

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:32.312
What is this, now...?

00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:36.250
You consider power as
a mere tool. You
wouldn't understand

00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:38.252
with your borrowed
weapons.

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:40.521
It's about strength
that's been honed
through extensive

00:13:40.554 --> 00:13:44.291
training and effort,
and it's always dependable,
at any time.

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:47.494
Oh? Then I guess
that I'll just have
to teach you that

00:13:47.528 --> 00:13:51.164
your assumptions are
completely incorrect!

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:58.038
Did you just say
that it's not real
power?

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:01.675
Hmph. You truly
are vulgar creatures.

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:04.845
Nothing more than
fodder for us
Otsutsuki.

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.680
Come, Kinshiki!

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:08.382
Sir.

00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:13.253
[swallowing]

00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:16.690
I'll rearrange this
seedbed and make it
beautiful despite

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:18.892
these annoyances.

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:21.528
And there's no better
time than now.

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:27.501
[gasping]

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:29.469
[gasping]

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.772
<i>All the jutsu he</i>
<i>absorbed from me!</i>

00:14:31.805 --> 00:14:34.474
Takami Musubinokami!

00:14:34.508 --> 00:14:36.577
This allows me to
amplify all of the

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.179
jutsu I've absorbed
for a counterattack.

00:14:41.648 --> 00:14:43.483
[lightly gasping]

00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:46.220
[grunting]

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:49.189
Boruto!

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.625
It's all my fault.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:52.693
That's why--

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.695
I gotta--

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.033
It's meaningless.

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:06.273
Hmm?

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.712
The Hidden Leaf
Village is my home!

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.847
Everyone here's
my family!

00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:15.816
I won't let you do
this to us!

00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:20.354
[people panicking]

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:21.488
Lord Seventh!

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:27.995
No way. So much
power!

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:30.297
Whoa, what is all of
this?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.367
<i>I didn't know Dad had</i>
<i>this kind of power!</i>

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.135
[grunting]

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.671
Have this!

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:39.206
And this!

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:43.143
[grunting]

00:15:43.177 --> 00:15:45.212
Use my chakra, too!

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.948
If you go down, then
it's gonna be all
over anyway.

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.183
Thank you.

00:15:56.523 --> 00:16:00.294
[laughing]

00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:03.363
Just how long can you
hold out, huh?!

00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:04.598
[grunting]

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.867
Boy, you're so
stubborn, you know
that?

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.902
[yelling]

00:16:08.936 --> 00:16:10.971
And you're so na ïve!

00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:15.375
[screaming]

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:16.376
[grunting]

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:22.082
That was the jutsu
that I took off of that
boy from earlier.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:23.217
Uh!

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:27.855
I can see through
your moves!

00:16:27.888 --> 00:16:30.224
Your jutsu won't work
on me anymore!

00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:39.233
Didn't I already say
that you're naive?

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:42.169
Are you at your wit's
end yet?

00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:46.206
Why don't I just end
this right now,
then?!

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:50.143
Ameno
Subaruboshinomikoto!

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:53.146
[grunting]

00:16:57.551 --> 00:17:01.188
Can you guess why I
dug into the earth
with my sand?

00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:05.392
What's this?? An
underground reservoir
of water?!

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:08.662
I know that you can
see through all our
moves with your

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.063
Byakugan.

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:13.166
So I turned what
seemed like a
meaningless act into

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.434
a saturation attack.

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:17.471
Water Style: Giant
Vortex Jutsu!

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:22.176
[struggling]

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:30.517
[struggling]

00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:35.689
Seems you're the
na ïve one now.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:39.059
[struggling]

00:18:02.883 --> 00:18:04.685
He got away.

00:18:04.718 --> 00:18:08.288
<i>I'll admit... that</i>
<i>was a regrettable</i>
<i>mistake.</i>

00:18:08.322 --> 00:18:11.592
<i>But no matter. It</i>
<i>bought us some time.</i>

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:14.962
I believe my
superiors are about
to finish up...

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:17.164
So I shall take my
leave of you, now.

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:22.736
The Rinnegan, huh?

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.471
Lord Kazekage, look!

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:27.741
<i>What is that?! What's</i>
<i>happening? Let's go!</i>

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:28.375
Yes!

00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:32.446
[laughing]

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:40.454
[grunting]

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.063
I'm amazed that you
endured this long!

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:14.021
[laughing]
After this,
it's over!

00:19:14.054 --> 00:19:16.557
But, you must not
die, Fox.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.161
Sasuke...

00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:22.729
...take care of the
kids.

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.536
Understood.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.071
Dad, what are you-?!

00:19:32.806 --> 00:19:36.343
Let's do it, Kurama!
You'd better not be
out of shape now!

00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:39.713
Ha! Don't be foolish!
I'm always ready to
go!

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.281
Right!

00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:44.852
[yelling]

00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:48.322
[yelling]

00:19:51.558 --> 00:19:56.230
[yelling and roaring]

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:03.971
[growling]

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:20.053
[roaring]

00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:23.290
Wait, why isn't Dad
attacking?

00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:26.360
Naruto could easily
obliterate that thing
if he wanted to.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.496
But it would take out
everything around him
in the process.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.531
[lightly gasping]

00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:33.166
<i>To protect</i>
<i>everyone...</i>

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.513
<i>This is... Dad's</i>
<i>chakra.</i>

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.515
No, Lord Seventh,
don't!

00:21:21.548 --> 00:21:23.684
Lord Hokage, please!

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:26.520
<i>[worried chatting]</i>

00:21:26.553 --> 00:21:27.888
Lord Seventh!

00:21:27.921 --> 00:21:30.023
You've done enough!
Please get to safety!

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:35.062
[worried chatting]

00:21:38.532 --> 00:21:41.468
[panicking]

00:22:06.527 --> 00:22:08.161
Dad, no!

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:45.325
<i>You were stripped of</i>
<i>your headband, and on</i>
<i>top of that, your</i>

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:48.762
<i>father's gone. It's</i>
<i>just like how Naruto</i>
<i>used to be back then.</i>

00:23:49.363 --> 00:23:50.931
So, my Dad...

00:23:50.964 --> 00:23:52.966
Can you tell me what
he would've done?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.970
<i>It seems it's not just</i>
<i>his weaknesses you're</i>
<i>interested in now.</i>

00:23:57.004 --> 00:23:57.704
But, I'm...

00:23:59.006 --> 00:24:01.508
<i>You're actually quite</i>
<i>a strong shinobi.</i>

00:24:01.542 --> 00:24:05.145
<i>Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations:</i>

00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:06.480
<i>Sasuke's Secret</i>
<i>Weapon</i>

00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:11.018
<i>If you put your mind</i>
<i>to it, you might be</i>
<i>able to surpass him.</i>
