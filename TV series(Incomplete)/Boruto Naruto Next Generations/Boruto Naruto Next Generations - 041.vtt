WEBVTT

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.312
[concerned murmuring]

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.350
How is it?
Does it feel too tight?

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:20.220
It doesn't hurt,
it's just a scratch.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:23.089
Oh really? I know
you like to act tough,

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.357
but you should be
more careful.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.626
Owww! I mean,

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.861
I told you it doesn't
really hurt all that much!

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.596
But it does hurt a lot,
doesn't it?

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.098
How many times do I gotta
say it doesn't hurt!

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.399
We were attacked
by shinobi hired

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.169
by the Pale Blue Valley.
That's a fact.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.705
We know because they left
this message behind for us.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.277
"You've ignored repeated
warnings and left us no option.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.113
"So, we demand the deed
to the bridge.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.049
"In exchange
we'll spare Kiri's life."

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.350
The deed to the bridge?!

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.854
What do they mean
repeated warnings?

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.522
What are they talking about?

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.658
The village head seemed
to know all about it.

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.458
Huh?

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.593
Think about it.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.928
The continuous attacks
on your storehouse

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.530
were meant to be warnings.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.532
I thought something
felt weird.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.669
And then, she put in
a request for your protection.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:12.305
But still, why didn't
she discuss it with us?

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.473
I get it.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.475
I think I understand
what she was feeling.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.142
Oh?

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.244
Yeah well! I mean...

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.180
She wanted to handle
the problem alone.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.748
And be strong
like her father.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.924
All you had to do was turn
over the deed to the bridge.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.694
How long have you been tangled
up with those people?

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.063
I got involved with them just
before I killed your father.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:18.732
[shocked inhale]
You killed him?!

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:19.633
That's right.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:21.735
'Cause in these parts,

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.203
the deed to the bridge
is worth a bar of gold

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:24.805
if you know who to talk to.

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:25.806
[angry grunt]

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.140
(Iori) The Pale Blue Valley

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:29.843
offered to buy it for
a very high price.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.244
[grunts]

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.447
After that, I acquired poison
from the shinobi.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.983
All I had to do was have
your father drink it.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:39.152
[grunts] Damn you!

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.787
When you succeeded
your father,

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.489
I figured you'd keep
the problem to yourself.

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:45.626
I know how you hate to lose.

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.661
I assumed you'd try to outdo
your father

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.797
and solve it on your own
and then, you'd fail.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:51.565
Or so I thought.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.069
Instead you went and
requested help from the Leaf.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.971
I didn't see that move coming!

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.906
[furious breathing]

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.343
Our previous village head
was a great man.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.778
And part of his greatness
was that

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.648
he never tried to resolve
problems by himself.

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.450
He listened to
everyone's opinion.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:11.852
(Matsuba) Lady Kiri is young,

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.521
but strong‐willed and
mature for her age.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:16.657
We all know that what
she desires most

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.293
is to protect the Green Banks
and its villagers.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.461
We would have helped.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.363
She didn't need
to act alone.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.965
Our previous leader wouldn't
have tried

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.200
to handle this by himself.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.802
What would've happened then?

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.805
Would things have
turned out differently?

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:32.539
Boruto.

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:35.976
So now, will you rescue
the village head?

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.578
Please, we beg you.

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:39.713
I understand.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:40.781
Alright.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:42.516
So, is getting
the village head back

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.618
gonna be our new mission then?

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.485
Um...

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.722
Take this.
Please take it with you.

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:52.626
Is this scroll the deed to
the bridge?

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.960
Are you sure?

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.262
The village head tried to do
everything in her power

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.965
to make sure
this wouldn't happen!

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.933
This scroll is nothing.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.004
It can't take the place
of Lady Kiri's life.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.305
That's how we all feel.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.975
Yes. Understood.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.877
We're heading out. Let's go!

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:11.745
(Sarada/Mitsuki)
Yes, sir!

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.382
(Konohamaru) Listen up.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.919
Rescuing the village head is
our top priority.

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:20.386
She's somewhere over here.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.122
Judging from
the recent attacks,

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.057
the enemy is very violent.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.127
We don't know their strengths,
so I'll approach them.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.895
Meanwhile, you three
find an opening,

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.397
rescue the village head
and return here.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:32.933
(Sarada) But that will
leave you vulnerable, Sensei!

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.367
(Boruto) She's right.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.637
It'll be better if
I lend you a hand, Big Bro.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.939
(Konohamaru) Boruto. Considering
what we're up against,

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.975
this plan has the best shot
to succeed.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.176
Don't worry about me.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.879
I'm not a total wimp,
you know.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.080
Okay, got it.

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.284
(Kono) Well, I certainly
didn't expect your first mission

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.887
to turn into something
this tough.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.723
From now on, you all need to
expect the unexpected,

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:58.559
and avoid taking
any chances.

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:01.795
Hear me, Boruto?
Do you understand me?

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:02.863
Mhm.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.066
<i>I already told you</i>
<i>I'd handle this!</i>

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.903
<i>But still, why didn't</i>
<i>she discuss it with us?</i>

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.171
Yeah, I get it already.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.372
(Mitsuki) Sensei.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.941
I'm sensing some kind of
movement nearby.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.443
Huh?!

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.746
Hey! You're late,
ya know!

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.147
Bringing her here
is one thing.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:22.616
But if anybody finds me,

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:25.451
they're gonna figure out
I'm the one after the deed!

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.653
Is everything okay?

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:30.090
Yeah, everything is
going just fine.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.457
Well I hope so.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.826
I hired you shinobi

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.895
because I heard that
you were trustworthy.

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:35.696
[gasps]

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.363
I'll be satisfied as soon as

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.965
I get the deed to
that bridge!

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:40.801
A big fiasco is not what...

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.068
Shut up.

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:43.870
[groans]

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:49.075
Yes. You certainly can
trust shinobi.

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:52.412
[groans]

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.048
Iori!

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.618
[gasping]

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.420
We must have forgotten
to tell him somehow.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:04.658
But we're not your
standard shinobi anymore.

00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:05.091
Hidari.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:10.463
[smirk] Yeah.
I know you're there.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:13.600
Shall we make a deal,
Leaf shinobi?

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:16.036
Doesn't seem like you're
in a deal‐making mood.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.370
No need to worry,

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:20.006
not as long as we both
get what we want.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.474
Then there's no problem.

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:26.947
[gasps] That's the deed!
Why did you bring it?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.149
I told you just how precious
it is.

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.717
What do you think
you're doing?!

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.159
[gasps]

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:47.167
Sorry it took so long.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.072
Forget about saving me!
The deed is what matters!

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:53.039
[smirks]

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.479
[gasps]

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.249
I missed getting them,
huh?

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:04.084
[grunts]

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:05.051
[gasps]

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:09.723
[gasps]

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.625
Boruto!

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.860
I got it,
I got it!

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.096
Let's retreat!

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.230
Yeah.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:17.898
[grunts]

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.302
She was probably injured in
the earlier attack.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.269
Are you all right?

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.811
Konohamaru Sensei!

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:31.878
I'm okay.

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.515
Take the village head
with you and go.

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:35.749
He's not leaving.

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.651
I'm going to
kill all of you here.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.753
We already gave you
the deed to the bridge.

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:42.355
(Hidari) [heavy sigh]
Having that girl around

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.457
is going to cause trouble
for us.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.459
You guys'll
cause trouble, too.

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.662
Don't underestimate us just
'cuz we're kids.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:49.996
(Konohamaru) Boruto!

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.599
Calm down. You need to stick
to our strategy.

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:53.967
Oh, come on!

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.637
You've already seen the way
they operate.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.706
I can't fight them and
protect you at the same time.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.177
Don't worry.
I'll catch up right away.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.411
Listen to me.

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:06.613
The three of you
are going to complete

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.582
your first mission
successfully.

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.684
I'm counting on you.
You got that?

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:13.787
We won't let you down!

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.362
[gasps] Why did you bother to
come back for me?

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.464
And even worse,
you brought the deed.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.032
You still don't get it
do you?!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.034
The reason we came back is
'cause everyone

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.170
in the village
asked us to save you.

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:32.338
[gasps] They did?

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:39.713
[grunting]

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:43.784
[grunting]

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:45.886
Humph!

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.590
[gasps]

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:52.659
How do you like it?
I used my special Clone Trap.

00:09:52.693 --> 00:09:54.695
Can't move, huh?

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:57.397
Ashimaru, I'll handle
this guy.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.133
You take care of
those brats.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.301
I'll kill them.

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:04.605
[chuckles] So it's true.

00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:07.273
Hidden Leaf shinobi
are pushovers.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:09.175
[grunting]

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.014
Is your arm okay?

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:14.848
Yeah.

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:19.152
Boruto. I don't think
she's okay.

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:20.453
You are unbelievable!

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:21.187
Hmm.

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.898
I took all our traps
and set them.

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:34.000
That'll buy us a little time
at least.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:37.571
[restrained pain]

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:38.572
I'm almost done.

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.106
Mhm.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.442
How can we know you're in pain
if you won't tell us?

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.309
I'm sorry.

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:44.745
I just didn't want to be

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:47.514
any more of a burden to you
than I already am.

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:48.715
The trouble with you is,

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:50.717
you try to do everything
by yourself.

00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:51.818
Is that what you think
it takes

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:53.854
to fill your old man's shoes?

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:55.689
I have to protect our village.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:58.592
So I have to be
like my father.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.762
Yes. Because he was
a great man.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.599
<i>Tofu) That's right,</i>
<i>put your back into it!</i>

00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:08.802
<i>[grunts] Ah, too bad!</i>

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.870
<i>[happy giggle]</i>

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:14.207
<i>Okay! You're done! [chuckles]</i>

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.176
<i>Any other challengers?!</i>

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:18.011
<i>[grunts]</i>

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:19.546
<i>[grunts]</i>

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.446
<i>[happy breath]</i>

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.481
<i>[laughing]</i>

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.116
(Kiri) In strength nor wisdom.

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.285
No one could come close
to my father.

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:30.557
<i>I won't let you touch a hair</i>
<i>on their heads!</i>

00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:33.226
(Kiri) He confronted all
our enemies alone.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:36.462
And single‐handedly protected
the Green Banks,

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:37.931
and all of
the villagers.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:42.202
He oversaw many
important projects.

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:45.071
The incredible power my father
exuded was enough

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:49.075
to prevent the Green Banks
from being attacked.

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:49.876
Hmm?

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.911
Hmm.

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.913
But lineage determines
succession.

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:54.748
That's how the village head
is chosen here

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:56.216
at the Green Banks.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:57.618
I was next in line.

00:11:57.651 --> 00:12:01.487
As his only child,
I became the village head.

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:05.458
One reason I have to stand
firm is because I'm weak.

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:06.727
For the villagers
to feel secure,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.294
I must appear
as strong as possible.

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.563
All this time,

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:11.998
I thought my best
might be good enough.

00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:13.767
Every day, I was giving
the village

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.602
everything I had to give.

00:12:15.636 --> 00:12:18.705
And yet, it still ended up
like this.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.473
The villagers are family
to me.

00:12:20.507 --> 00:12:23.209
But I couldn't protect them
like my father had.

00:12:31.284 --> 00:12:32.485
(Sarada) Oh what?

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.087
Does this remind you
of something?

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.988
Huh?

00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:36.923
Lord Seventh and
the village head.

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:40.160
The obvious similarities between
your situation and Kiri's

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:42.028
must have gotten you
thinking, right?

00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:44.230
You're way off!
Not even close!

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.299
I think she hit the nail
right on the head.

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:49.169
You've gotta be kidding,
Mitsuki! [gasps]

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:01.114
I guess those traps didn't
stop them, after all.

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:03.049
Damn it.
We gotta get outta here.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:04.851
Boruto. Don't be an idiot.

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:06.720
Uh. What do you mean
by that?!

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:09.189
You just want us to
take Kiri and run for it.

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:11.157
What do we do
if they overtake us?

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:12.893
If that happens,
then we'll just...

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:14.327
Let me guess...

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.129
"We'll just figure it out."
Is that your plan?

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:16.697
Uh.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.131
We're outmatched.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:20.867
You realize that right?
You can't be that stupid.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.304
Hmm.

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:25.572
(Sarada) I have an idea.

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:26.807
We stay put.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.274
The three of us have
the advantage

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.512
if we engage them here,
but not if we run away.

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:32.779
[surprised]

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:34.480
(Mitsuki) I'd like to
try that out too.

00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:36.983
Like Konohamaru Sensei said,

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:39.586
let's come up with
a unified plan together.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.755
What?! You too now, Mitsuki?!

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:43.323
I didn't do it.

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:46.593
I didn't reach out,
not to anybody.

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:48.595
I carried the burden
by myself,

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:51.031
and this is where it
got me.

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.166
So I'd like to see it in
action.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:57.604
What is this teamwork
of yours? Will you show me?

00:13:57.638 --> 00:14:00.574
[sighs] I guess we have
no choice.

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:02.142
If you really wanna see it,

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.945
then I'll show you exactly
what teamwork is!

00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:07.548
We'll show you! Got it?

00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:12.753
Guys like us found ourselves
without a job

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:14.320
after the Great War ended.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.658
And yet, the Leaf gives
missions to brats like yours.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:20.126
The Leaf's become so soft
these days.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.964
If I were in your place
I wouldn't underestimate them.

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:28.034
[laughs] How can you seriously
say that in your position?

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.739
I'm going to put
an end to you!

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:33.039
[grunts]

00:14:34.508 --> 00:14:37.343
<i>There's a lot of talk about</i>
<i>turmoil in remote areas.</i>

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:40.180
<i>Where the villages sit along</i>
<i>national borders.</i>

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.549
<i>These places are perfect</i>
<i>for any Rogue Ninja</i>

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:44.184
<i>looking to stir up trouble.</i>

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.652
<i>So keep that in mind</i>
<i>'cause they can be violent.</i>

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:46.587
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.421
<i>(Naruto) And remember.</i>

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:52.392
<i>Young shinobi don't understand</i>
<i>how difficult missions can be.</i>

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:55.829
<i>So guide them with</i>
<i>a sure and steady grip, okay?</i>

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:57.430
<i>(Konohamaru) Yeah!</i>

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.999
I've got to get a grip!

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.067
[gasps]

00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:03.136
Rasengan!

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:06.439
[grunting]

00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:11.545
You used Wind Style to undo
the jutsu by force?!

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:14.347
Weren't you just telling me
that the Leaf was soft?

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.582
That right?

00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:16.617
[gasps]

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:19.986
[grunts]

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:22.956
[panicked]

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:28.228
You want to test that out?
Well, now's your big chance.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.362
[gasps]

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:38.672
[scared]

00:15:40.674 --> 00:15:41.642
[gasps]

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.981
[passes out]

00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:51.985
Time to go.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.265
Come on out now.

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:09.402
[grunting]

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:12.205
[grunts]

00:16:17.678 --> 00:16:18.612
[grunts]

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.254
So annoying!

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:30.791
I wanna get at least
one hit on this guy somehow.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.025
You shouldn't.

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:34.928
If you get too close,
you'll die.

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:36.396
Not yet, huh?

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.666
No backbone, after all.

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:45.739
Just as I thought.
A little late there, Sarada.

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:47.674
Yeah, I know.
I know, I'm sorry.

00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:49.142
And? What did you see?

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.044
Well, maybe it's because

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:52.445
he's got so much
self‐confidence.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.915
But he doesn't even dodge
most attacks.

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:57.350
He takes the hit,
then counters.

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.119
(Sarada) So, we'll look
for an opening,

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:01.087
and then we'll all
finish him at once!

00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:03.356
Which means...that.
Right?

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:04.390
Oh yeah!

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:08.294
So you have some backbone,
after all.

00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:09.062
Let's go!

00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:09.963
Right! Yeah!

00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:11.131
[grunts]

00:17:12.566 --> 00:17:14.701
We're counting on you.

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:16.537
Go, Sarada!

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.504
So fast!

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:22.375
But, this is over.

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.516
[gasps]

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.385
<i>(Boruto) I don't have</i>
<i>your eyes to read his attacks.</i>

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:33.920
<i>(Sarada) I don't have</i>
<i>your speed,</i>

00:17:33.954 --> 00:17:35.689
<i>so I can't toy with</i>
<i>an opponent.</i>

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.390
<i>(Mitsuki) I don't have</i>
<i>the frame of mind</i>

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:40.393
<i>to use the Wind Style as</i>
<i>creatively as you do.</i>

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:43.163
<i>(All three) But! Together,</i>
<i>we can beat him!</i>

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:44.598
[gasp of pain]

00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:46.667
Your time is up! Chaaaaa!

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:52.072
[gasps]

00:17:57.544 --> 00:18:00.747
What is up with
that monster strength?!

00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:02.248
It actually worked!

00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:04.851
She could kill me one day
if she wanted to.

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:06.920
[chuckle] You've got your
hands full

00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:09.022
with Himawari and Sarada.

00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:12.626
Hey! Don't just leave me
back here, Mitsuki!

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:14.194
They're amazing!

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.097
I'm sorry I'm late, guys.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.164
Here you go.

00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:21.568
(Kiri) [stunned breath]
Thank you.

00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:24.971
The mission you requested is
now complete.

00:18:25.005 --> 00:18:26.272
What do you think?

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:29.075
Wouldn't you say
those three are something?

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.877
Ugh! Shut up! You wanna go?!

00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:32.345
All right,
let's do this then!

00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:35.015
(Boruto) Uh, I meant
when we get back home!

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:36.182
Yes, they are.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.183
Let's settle it
when we get home!

00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:38.519
(Sarada) No, right here!

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:48.461
Alright, I'm back now.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:51.297
Yes. I'm glad you're unharmed.

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:58.972
Uh. Please forgive me.
I acted on my own.

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:01.307
And as a result all of
this happened.

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.443
I should have consulted you.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:06.046
(Kiri) I want you to know
I'm very sorry!

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:07.313
[relieved sigh]

00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:10.684
We understand.
Please, raise your head!

00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:12.152
I'm still inexperienced.

00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:14.755
But please, will you
give me your support?

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:18.959
Yes. And you can come to us
anytime you need help.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.961
You know, I'll never be

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.163
the kind of leader
my father was.

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:25.265
Actually, watching you
reminded me of your father

00:19:25.298 --> 00:19:26.466
when he was young.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.168
You give everything
you've got.

00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:29.369
[shocked inhale]

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:31.337
You'll keep
gaining experience.

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:32.906
And one day, you'll be
just like him.

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:34.307
More than that!

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.743
I think you'll be
an even greater village head!

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:37.711
Right?

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.179
[chuckles] Yes, of course!

00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:41.582
[chuckling]

00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:43.449
[emotional]

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:49.122
All right! It's time for us
to hit the road.

00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:50.591
(Kiri) Please wait!

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:54.628
Before you go I have to
thank you and your team.

00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:57.197
During my rescue I learned
a lot about them.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.932
And about
the importance of teamwork.

00:19:58.965 --> 00:20:00.133
Uh, you did?

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:02.168
Well! You just keep
doing your best!

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.770
So you're an expert now?

00:20:03.804 --> 00:20:05.539
Acting a little high
and mighty? [giggles]

00:20:05.572 --> 00:20:07.107
[chuckles] I agree with her!

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.709
(Boruto) Shut up you guys!

00:20:08.742 --> 00:20:09.810
[laughing]

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:25.025
We finally made it back home!

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.260
I am absolutely starving!

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:28.929
Well we should have known
it would be hard.

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:30.296
You did great!

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.899
Your first mission couldn't
have gone better.

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:33.800
Yeah!

00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:33.900
Hm!

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:37.738
Thanks for your hard work,
Konohamaru. Good job.

00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:39.339
Yes, sir!

00:20:39.372 --> 00:20:43.109
Looks like it turned out to be
quite a difficult mission.

00:20:43.143 --> 00:20:44.277
It was.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.646
But those kids,

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:48.281
the three of them did
a really great job.

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:49.950
So I heard! But I know

00:20:49.983 --> 00:20:53.353
it was only possible because
of your solid guidance.

00:20:53.386 --> 00:20:55.622
You keep up the good work
with Team 7.

00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:57.758
I'm counting on you,
okay, captain?

00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:58.825
[gasps]

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.861
Yes, sir!

00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:04.798
(Boruto) Well? How did
your first mission turn out?

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:05.799
Tell us about it.

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:07.000
(Shikadai) Don't ask.

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:09.135
Just thinking about
it's a drag.

00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:10.604
This thing was underground.

00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:13.173
It had dug itself so deep
into the earth

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.875
that we had to beat it
out of there.

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:18.378
For real?! Was it a monster?
Was it strong?

00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:20.246
Well, um...
Yeah, it was.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.148
We were able to pop it
right out.

00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:24.484
What? I gotta hear more
about it.

00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:27.220
Well, actually,
we didn't beat anything up.

00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:28.689
Think of it more like

00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:31.491
we had to help somebody
extract a giant turnip.

00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:33.727
A giant turnip?
That's so uncool!

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.161
Yeah?!

00:21:35.195 --> 00:21:38.164
Well, what kind of mission
did you get assigned to anyway?

00:21:38.198 --> 00:21:40.734
Huh? You wanna hear
about it?

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:43.369
I only had to fight off
some rogue shinobi.

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:45.672
[shocked]
Are you serious?

00:21:45.706 --> 00:21:48.509
Yeah, of course,
the enemy was pretty strong.

00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:50.711
But I brought
them down no problem.

00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:53.313
That's amazing, Boruto!
So tell us about it.

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:54.881
Don't hold anything back!

00:21:54.915 --> 00:21:58.519
Sure! So the enemy were
a bunch of super violent guys.

00:21:58.552 --> 00:22:00.854
They even had
Big Bro Konohamaru panicked!

00:22:00.887 --> 00:22:01.988
That's when I burst in

00:22:02.022 --> 00:22:03.990
with my jutsu and
saved the day!

00:22:04.024 --> 00:22:05.458
I fought and I fought!

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.628
And the incident was resolved
in a flash!

00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:10.496
That guy.
He's really too much.

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:48.061
(Sarada) Konohamaru Sensei
sent an emergency summons!

00:23:48.094 --> 00:23:49.663
(Boruto) It's probably just
another mission

00:23:49.696 --> 00:23:51.932
to look for somebody's
lost dog or cat.

00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:53.967
(Sarada) That's not
what it's about!

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.135
We're going after a robber

00:23:55.168 --> 00:23:57.103
who's barricaded himself
in a bank!

00:23:57.137 --> 00:24:00.340
(Boruto) Bank robber barricaded
inside an actual bank!?

00:24:00.373 --> 00:24:02.976
A mission worthy of
my attention!

00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:06.580
Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:08.314
"A Ninja's Job"

00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:11.184
My time to shine
has finally arrived!
