WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.308
(people chatter)

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.145
[Boruto] Yes,
these are the ones.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.680
They finally got
more X Cards in.

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.650
[Toy Store Employee] Thanks
so much for coming in.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.086
Awesome.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.021
I know, finally, right?

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.155
I just cannot wait.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.757
Let's crack 'em open quick.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.025
Yes, let us.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.760
I wonder what I'll get.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:30.898
[Boruto] (groans)
I'm so excited.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.199
What's that?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.201
Just cards?

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.469
Hm?

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.737
Oh, Sarada.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.673
Hey, listen, these aren't
just regular old cards.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.008
These are X Cards.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.676
[Sarada] X Cards?

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.279
[Boruto] Extreme Ninja Cards.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.247
They're called X
Cards for short.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.082
It's a trading card game

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:52.686
featuring famous shinobi
from throughout history.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.222
Everybody's hooked on it,
and every one of the stores,

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.157
no matter how big
or small they are,

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.226
sell out almost instantly.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.827
The game itself where you battle

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:02.162
with the cards is fun too.

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:03.964
It is an intense
game of strategy

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.232
that is really fun.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.100
-(whimsical music)
-(Sarada sighs)

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.469
I see you guys are
hooked on this stuff too.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:13.640
All right now, come on,
super special rare card.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:15.809
(packet tears)

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.611
-(Shikadai gasps)
-(Metal Lee chuckles)

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:22.683
Wow, it is a super special
rare card of Lord Seventh.

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.618
Oh, man, what the hell?

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.753
I got my dad again?

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:28.422
I have so many of these.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.159
I see my dad enough, I don't
wanna see him on a card too.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.895
You opened a Seventh Hokage
and you're bummed about it?

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.163
You're so spoiled.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.699
I'll just say, the card
that I was hoping for

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:40.033
sure isn't this one.

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.936
Hm, wasting money earned
on dangerous missions

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.072
to buy a bunch of playing cards?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.542
You guys can just be so
unbelievably childish.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.743
What's that?

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.812
[Chocho] Hey, Sarada.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:52.880
Hm?

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.081
Uh.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.083
Hurry up, let's go
try the new desserts

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.084
that just came out.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.318
(giggles) Coming.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.255
(giggles) Hold on.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.758
Huh, wasting money, childish?

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.126
Look who's talking.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:10.130
(Opening Theme Music)

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:27.381
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:40.120
(Opening Theme Music)

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.900
(people chatter)

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.002
So, what did you get, Shikadai?

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:56.737
A Lord Mizukage.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.607
Very nice, and I got a Mr. Kiba.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.609
Oh, hello there, all of you.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.144
What are you doing?

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:05.679
Oh, hey, Shino Sensei.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.614
We all just got some X Cards.

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:09.216
Oh, so that's the X Card thing

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.084
everyone's talking about.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.153
It's popular at the academy now.

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:14.655
I've heard about them.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.824
Is there a card of me too?

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:19.493
(all grunt)

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:20.961
(all grumble)

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.162
Now that you mention it,

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:24.164
I've never seen a
Shino Sensei card.

00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:25.899
Yeah, neither have I.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:27.201
I see.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.203
Well, I imagine that you'd
have to be pretty famous

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.071
to be put on your own card,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.273
so people like me or Kiba would-

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:36.143
Well, actual, Metal just
got a Kiba card today.

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:38.478
-Huh, what's that?
-(dramatic piano music)

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:39.479
I did.

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:42.616
Oh, well, there
are many shinobi,

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.484
I suppose these things happen.

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:45.485
Hey, look at this.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:46.486
(Akamaru barks)

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.422
Even Akamaru has a card.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.557
Did you say Akamaru?

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:53.360
And yet there's no card
of you, Shino Sensei.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.628
(Shino grunts)

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.231
[Shikadai] I've never
heard of anyone seeing one.

00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:59.633
[Metal] Yes, same here.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.701
(Shino Sensei grunts)

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:02.002
Well, it is what it is.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.136
[Boys] Hm?

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.507
(Shino Sensei laughs)

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:12.079
Wow, it's clear this is
really bothering him.

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:13.747
Pretending that he does not care

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.483
makes it even harder
to watch, right?

00:05:16.517 --> 00:05:18.685
(Boruto sighs)

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.420
Shino Sensei's actually strong.

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:23.891
Is he really so unmemorable
he can't get on a card?

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.893
I kinda feel sorry for him.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.294
All right, I've decided.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.295
[Metal and Shikadai] Huh?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.898
What have you decided, Boruto?

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.299
Let's do something to make sure

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.802
that Shino Sensei gets
put onto his own card.

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.804
-Huh?
-(Metal grunts)

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.274
You want to get him onto a card?

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:43.410
And how exactly are we
supposed to do that?

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.611
(Boruto chuckles)

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:49.616
Don't you guys realize what
company makes these X Cards?

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.986
(train whistle blows)

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:55.088
So please, we'd like you

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.191
to do something
about this, you know?

00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:59.626
Yes, I see.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.328
I understand the situation.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.664
Let's see now, hm.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:08.869
I never realized Denki's
father's company is the one

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:10.537
that makes the X Cards.

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:12.940
Yeah, but asking the
company president directly

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:14.608
is kinda shameless.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:19.613
Currently, Shino Aburame
does not appear on an X Card,

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:24.985
and also, this is the list for
the second series of cards.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.422
Hm, the list.

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:29.523
Let's see here.

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:31.458
Hm.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.427
[Shikadai] Shino Sensei's name

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.829
isn't in the second
series either.

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.064
[Boruto] Yeah.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.900
Oh, but please, look,

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:41.869
there is an open slot here.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.136
[Boruto] You're right.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.938
Yes, as you've just figured out,

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:46.273
the final person to be put

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:48.275
on a card hasn't
been picked yet.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.677
I have respect for
each and every shinobi,

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.680
and that's why I'm having
such a hard time deciding.

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:54.715
[All] Hm.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:57.885
(Metal gasps)

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.354
(water drips)

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.356
Okay then, our vote is for you

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.992
to put Shino Sensei's
name in that slot.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:07.761
He's definitely a
candidate, of course,

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.363
but still.

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:10.564
Oh, please, sir.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.900
I mean, sure, Shino Sensei
doesn't stand out much,

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.768
and he kinda rambles on, but...

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.671
Hey, come on, you're not
really making a great case.

00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:20.274
But, uh, he's a great teacher.

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:23.610
Like, back at the academy, he
really connected with us all,

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:24.878
and helped us to grow.

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.880
That's right, he did.

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:30.684
Oh, well, since you all feel
so strongly about it, then...

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:31.718
No!

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.521
Please, just wait a minute.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:39.393
Uh, Metal, what's
going on with you?

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:44.898
Please excuse me, but
for the final slot,

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.034
instead of Shino Sensei,

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:48.936
I would like to
nominate someone else,

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.672
someone I respect,
my father, Rock Lee.

00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:52.806
Uh, wait, what?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.807
(intense rock music)

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.275
(Denki grunts)

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.478
Wait, that's right, Metal's
dad isn't on a card either.

00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:00.280
(Metal whimpers)

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:01.815
Yes, I know.

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.318
I checked when we looked
at the list earlier,

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:08.222
but his name was
not on it anywhere.

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:10.757
In order to make my
father's greatness known

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.626
through X Cards, as his son,

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.695
and also as his student,

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:16.997
I cannot back down about this.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.468
Ah, the handsome devil
of the Hidden Leaf,

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:23.604
Rock Lee, of course.

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:24.872
Uh-huh.

00:08:24.905 --> 00:08:27.608
Yes, he's worth considering.

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:30.077
(grunts) We almost had
everything settled.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.212
Well, at this point, I
can't back down either.

00:08:32.246 --> 00:08:34.348
That spot belongs
to Shino Sensei.

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:37.251
No way, my father should
take precedence over him.

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:38.619
-(Ereki grumbles)
-I'm telling you,

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:39.753
it should be Shino Sensei.

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:41.154
[Metal] It must be my father.

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:43.490
Hey, hold on for just
one second, you guys.

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:44.892
[Boruto] What is it?

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:47.094
Look, I understand where
you're both coming from,

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:51.231
but the Karminarimon Company
has a stake in this too.

00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:53.767
Shouldn't we put out the
card that'll sell the best?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.968
(glasses glint)

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.471
(both grunt)

00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:59.406
As a company, we
have to make sure

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:02.676
that we offer products
our customers wanna buy.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.077
Isn't that right, Father?

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:09.616
Yes, but these X Cards are
kind of a hobby for me, and-

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:10.751
Then all the more reason

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.152
for us to pursue a profit.

00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:14.821
If the cards don't sell,
that'll make it harder

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.024
to continue releasing them.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:20.294
(Ereki grunts)

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:23.197
[Ereki Voiceover] That was
very well said, my boy.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:25.566
And besides, aren't
you always saying

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.301
that creating things
that make people happy

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.603
is what results in
truly good products?

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.871
(Ereki grunts)

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.072
Huh, huh?

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:35.008
Denki, you just got so intense.

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:38.245
Gotta hand it to the
future ninja-president.

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:40.447
Hm.

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.283
All right, anyway, to determine

00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:45.886
which of the two should
be given the final slot,

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.221
how about we choose the one

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:50.023
who's more in demand
among the public?

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:52.693
Hm, but how exactly
are you gonna determine

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.428
who's more in demand?

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:56.430
(both grunt)

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:57.464
Hmmm.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.002
We'll go to the people
who are playing the game.

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:04.605
We will take a survey
among X Card customers,

00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:05.806
and then let them vote

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:07.741
for who they think
we should pick.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:08.876
I like that plan.

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:10.077
Whoever gets more votes...

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.146
Will be the one chosen
to be on the X Card.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.682
Yes, I promise
that's what we'll do.

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:16.884
All right then.

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:19.286
I'm sorry, Metal, but
I don't intend to lose.

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:21.622
I'm not gonna let Shino
Sensei live the rest

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:22.890
of his life in obscurity,

00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:26.093
even if he is boring and
doesn't stand out much.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.896
That is supposed to
be my line, Boruto.

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:30.297
No longer will I allow

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.301
my somewhat lacking father
to remain unnoticed.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:37.471
Again, you guys really aren't
making a great case here.

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.072
I won't lose.

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:40.807
I will not lose.

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:43.377
(both grunt)

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:46.380
Meh.

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:54.588
[Boruto] So this is
the ballot box, huh?

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:56.823
Yeah, one of them.

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:58.091
Similar ones have been placed

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:01.094
at every single store
that carries X Cards.

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:02.829
All right, so
what's your big plan

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:05.832
to win people's votes
for Shino Sensei?

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.868
Actually, I thought
I'd just kinda rely

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.671
on your intellect for
that part, Shikadai.

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.206
Eh, just great.

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:14.875
So this entire thing is
resting on my shoulders?

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:15.909
What a drag.

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:17.711
Come on, don't you
have any ideas?

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.715
You know, I just
might have some.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:24.952
-Here you go.
-(upbeat electronic music)

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:26.687
Here you go.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.222
Here you go.

00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:30.290
-Come one, come all.
-Here, take one.

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:31.491
Gather around and listen.

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:32.492
Let me tell you

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:33.493
the heroic story

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:34.561
of Shino Aburame.

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:35.562
The Leaf's little known,

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:36.563
but strongest ninja.

00:11:36.597 --> 00:11:37.831
Here you go.

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.299
What is this?

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:42.069
When the Leaf Village was in
danger of total destruction,

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.470
just in the nick of time,

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.939
Shino, despite
only being a genin,

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:48.342
used his parasitic
insects and his intellect

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.878
to pull off a
truly amazing feat.

00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.079
(people laugh)

00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:53.814
[Woman] Wow.
[Man] Whoa.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.082
[Boy] Whoa.

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.818
And after that, he, uh,

00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.553
he, uh...

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.554
Hm?

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:03.624
Anyway, he continued
to do many great deeds.

00:12:03.657 --> 00:12:06.760
Oh, man, talk about
running out of steam.

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:08.362
Yet again, not a great case.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.365
Ha-ha, after that sales pitch,

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.634
a win's practically guaranteed.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.269
(train whistle blows)

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:16.537
Huh?

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.738
[Girl] Hey, look at that.

00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:18.739
(whistle blows)

00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:19.740
[Man] Whoa, amazing.

00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:22.576
(train screeches)

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:27.814
(train hisses)

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:29.616
[Boruto and Shikadai] What the?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.218
[Boruto] What is going on here?

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.620
[Woman] Handsome
devil of the Leaf.

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:34.688
[Boruto and Shikadai] Huh?

00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:36.490
-(intense rock music)
-Ha-ha-ha,

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:38.425
it seems using an
advertising wrap

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:41.361
on the Thunder Train
is catching their eye.

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:44.898
Metal, but how did you
manage to pull that off?

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:46.300
[Denki] It was me.

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:47.301
Huh?

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.003
Denki?

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:51.205
Why's he wearing that outfit?

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:52.873
What's going on here?

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.007
[Metal] A while back,

00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.076
Denki had a training
session from my father,

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.313
so he kindly agreed to
help out with this project.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.481
Hey, that's not fair.

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:04.284
Aren't you on the
company's side?

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:08.021
My dad is my dad,
and I am myself.

00:13:08.055 --> 00:13:09.489
This is also an opportunity

00:13:09.523 --> 00:13:12.359
to test an advertising
plan I came up with.

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:13.894
(Boruto grunts)

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:14.895
(train whistle blows)

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:17.497
(train whirs)

00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:20.501
Let me tell you about
a genius of persistence

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:21.502
named Rock Lee.

00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:23.604
Once, he fought the
Kazekage to a tie

00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:25.506
with just taijutsu.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.476
He is called the Hidden Leaf
Village's handsome devil.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.279
I ask you, could there
be anyone more suitable

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:33.614
to become the centerpiece

00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:35.616
of the X Cards' second series?

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:36.884
(people grunt)

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:38.819
There's just no way
that we can compete

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:41.488
with a budget as
big as theirs is.

00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:43.757
(Boruto grunts)

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.492
[Boy] Rock Lee, obvi.

00:13:45.526 --> 00:13:46.827
[Boy] Totally.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.428
[Boy] With a name like that.

00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:51.265
(people chatter)

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.951
All right, with voting halfway
done, here's the tally.

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:12.819
(keyboard clacks)

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:14.188
[Boruto] Mm.

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:17.558
(Denki chuckles)

00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:20.394
(Metal chuckles)

00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:24.965
Okay, who's in the lead now?

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:27.968
(computer beeps)

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:33.974
It looks like Rock Lee's
popularity is growing steadily.

00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:36.543
[Denki and Metal] Yes, awesome.

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:37.744
It is thanks to you, Denki.

00:14:37.778 --> 00:14:41.882
And your performance was
absolutely perfect too, Metal.

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:44.818
It seems that, on the
other side of things,

00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:47.187
Shino is being left in the dust.

00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:48.956
Seriously?

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:50.891
At this point, it's
gonna be really hard

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:52.960
for us to catch up with them.

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.228
A match is a match.

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.563
My father is definitely
going to win the right

00:14:56.597 --> 00:14:57.898
to be on an X Card.

00:14:57.931 --> 00:14:59.499
(Boruto grunts)

00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:00.501
The way this is going,

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:02.669
Shino Sensei won't
get on an X Card,

00:15:02.703 --> 00:15:05.539
and he'll spend the rest
of his life in obscurity.

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:06.740
(spring sproings)

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:09.309
Uh, Boruto, isn't that kind
of a terrible thing to say?

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:12.546
(Boruto grunts)

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.482
So, to win this, he just
has to stand out, right?

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:16.683
Huh?

00:15:16.717 --> 00:15:18.051
What are you gonna do?

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:22.189
-(Boruto chuckles)
-(heavy rock music)

00:15:25.392 --> 00:15:26.393
Hm?

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:28.595
Huh.

00:15:29.997 --> 00:15:31.832
Just a few more days to go.

00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:32.966
The way things stand now,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.268
we are sure to win.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:35.469
Yeah.

00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:38.539
But, knowing Boruto, he
isn't just going to give up

00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:40.073
as easily as that.

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.476
Even so, nothing could
possibly stand out more

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:45.612
than the advertisement we
wrapped around the trains.

00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.347
I know, but still.

00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:50.751
You are quite the
worrier, Denki.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.686
[Denki] Huh?

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:54.588
Uh, what, what's that?

00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:58.492
Shino Sensei?

00:15:58.525 --> 00:16:00.727
Uh, whoa, no way.

00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:06.500
All right, how's that?

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.068
(Boruto cackles)

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:09.269
It's just perfect,

00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:11.071
an earth style stone face

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:13.540
in the shape of Shino Sensei.

00:16:13.574 --> 00:16:16.577
Nothing else could possibly
stand out like this.

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:19.413
Hey, did you bring
what you promised?

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:20.881
Hm?

00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:22.015
Oh, yeah.

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:23.250
This, right?

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:27.354
Ah, yes, I finally got my hands

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:30.090
on Lord Seventh super
special rare card.

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:31.825
It's so perfect.

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:33.227
(whimpers)

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.029
I can't believe I
finally have you.

00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:38.031
Even unwanted
cards can be handy.

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:41.935
Mm, I didn't really think
that you'd go this far.

00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:42.936
[Metal] Boruto.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.872
-Mm?
-Huh?

00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:47.207
You think this
will win our match?

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:48.876
Look, I'm sorry, Metal,

00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:50.878
but we're gonna turn
the tide with this.

00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:52.679
I will not let you.

00:16:52.713 --> 00:16:54.815
(grunts)

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.416
Just watch this.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.285
Leaf Hurricane.

00:16:58.318 --> 00:16:59.086
The hell?

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:00.420
What are you doing?

00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:02.756
All I need to do
is whittle it down

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:04.625
into my father's face.

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:06.727
(grunts)

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:10.864
What, seriously?

00:17:10.898 --> 00:17:12.633
I want everyone in
the Hidden Leaf,

00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.234
no, in all the five villages

00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:16.336
to recognize my
father's greatness,

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.805
so I cannot let this
chance slip away.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.007
I'll stop you.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.009
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.944
(clones pop)

00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:25.646
Wind Style, Gale Palm.

00:17:27.581 --> 00:17:30.017
(clones grunt)

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.152
(Metal grunts)

00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:34.621
You will not get in my way.

00:17:34.655 --> 00:17:37.024
(shouts)

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:38.725
No, that's my line.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.495
(clones grunt)

00:17:41.528 --> 00:17:43.830
(Metal grunts)

00:17:43.864 --> 00:17:45.766
Oh boy, no matter
how you look at this,

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:49.469
all you can really see is
trouble looming on the horizon.

00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:51.004
That's it, I'm out.

00:17:51.038 --> 00:17:53.140
Huh? Shikadai.

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:54.575
Now is my chance.

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:57.244
(grunts)

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.113
Uh.

00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:04.818
You are facing a
different me today.

00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:06.053
Why, you little...

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:11.358
(palms slap)

00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:12.359
Papa?

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:13.393
Shino Sensei.

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:17.898
Damn it, I just knew
that something was up.

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:21.268
Stop this ridiculous
battle, both of you.

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.302
Uh.

00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:26.373
(Metal grunts)

00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:30.744
I am sorry, Papa.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:34.615
I just wanted you to be on
an X Card, Shino Sensei.

00:18:34.648 --> 00:18:36.483
(Shino Sensei sighs)

00:18:36.517 --> 00:18:40.621
Listen, Boruto, you seem to
be under the wrong impression.

00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:42.089
I just don't have any desire

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.491
to stand out like that.

00:18:44.525 --> 00:18:46.159
Same here, Metal.

00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:47.694
I do not remember teaching you

00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:51.064
that hard work is just so
you can become popular.

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:54.101
-Papa.
-Shino Sensei.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.003
(both chuckle)

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.805
Well, you may have
gone a bit overboard,

00:18:58.839 --> 00:18:59.940
but we're still grateful

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:02.142
that you tried so
hard on our behalf.

00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:05.512
The thought behind all of this
is more than enough for us.

00:19:06.647 --> 00:19:09.616
[Shino Sensei] Coming from
our precious students.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.951
(Boruto and Metal gasp)

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:12.886
(Boruto and Metal groan)

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.688
(girl cries)

00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:16.423
-Huh?
-What is...

00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:17.457
That's a...

00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:21.562
Help me, Mommy, please help me.

00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:22.963
There's a fire.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:23.964
How terrible.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.499
We have to go help them.

00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:28.535
We're too far away, we
won't make it in time.

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:29.670
Just leave this to us.

00:19:29.703 --> 00:19:30.671
We'll handle it.

00:19:30.704 --> 00:19:31.672
[Boruto and Metal] Huh?

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:32.940
But how can you?

00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:34.942
-There is a way.
-(intense percussive music)

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:36.810
The perfect solution.

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:37.811
(grunts)

00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:39.680
Leaf Hurricane.

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:40.814
(heavy rock music)

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:44.184
(Shino Sensei grunts)

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:47.354
(tank bangs)

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:50.023
(water sloshes)

00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:52.492
(girl cries)

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:53.527
Huh, huh?

00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:55.362
(people chatter)

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:59.066
-Thank you so very much.
-That was amazing.

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:03.203
They're both really amazing.

00:20:03.237 --> 00:20:06.673
Definitely outstanding shinobi.

00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:07.708
[Both] Hm.

00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:17.017
[Toy Store Employee] Thanks
so much for coming in.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.886
(packet crinkles)

00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:22.356
I was looking forward to the
second series release, but...

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.091
We haven't heard
anything from Denki

00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:26.293
since the day we spoke to him.

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:30.163
In the end, all we really
did was cause a big fuss.

00:20:30.197 --> 00:20:32.833
Yeah, and then somebody
chose to cut out.

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:35.135
Why don't we just
forget about all that,

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:37.404
crack our packs,
and see what we got?

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:38.338
Hm.

00:20:38.372 --> 00:20:41.408
-Mm-hm.
-(packets crinkle)

00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:42.409
(Metal gasps)

00:20:42.442 --> 00:20:43.410
What's wrong?

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:44.811
(Metal stutters)

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.246
This is my father.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.182
No way.

00:20:49.116 --> 00:20:50.717
Then maybe that means...

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:52.486
(gasps)

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.820
(shimmery music)

00:20:53.854 --> 00:20:55.722
There's a card of
Shino Sensei too.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.758
Whoa, really?

00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:59.626
Both of them made it?

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.395
But how is this possible?

00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:04.097
Well, actually, about that.

00:21:04.131 --> 00:21:06.567
The popularity of both
of them skyrocketed

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.168
at the very end of voting.

00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:10.204
Really? That's...

00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:12.539
Because of what
they did back there,

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.141
and so my father decided

00:21:14.174 --> 00:21:17.444
that he might as well open
up two spots for new cards.

00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:21.682
Oh, I am just so grateful.

00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:22.950
-(Metal sobs)
-Wow, that was

00:21:22.983 --> 00:21:26.353
a seriously cool thing
for your dad to do, Denki.

00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:28.422
[Sarada] Are you guys
buying more cards?

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:29.823
-Huh?
-Hm?

00:21:29.857 --> 00:21:31.892
The second series just came out.

00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:33.694
[Sarada] Oh.

00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:35.095
Mm.

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:38.432
Anyway, I wonder what
other cards I got in here.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:39.233
Huh?

00:21:39.266 --> 00:21:41.335
Another Shino Sensei card?

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:42.135
Huh?

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.004
Another card of Papa?

00:21:44.037 --> 00:21:45.873
[Boruto] Shino Sensei again?

00:21:45.906 --> 00:21:47.074
[Metal] Papa again?

00:21:47.107 --> 00:21:48.942
[Boruto] (groans)
More multiples?

00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:51.345
I think this is going
a little too far.

00:21:51.378 --> 00:21:52.579
Aw, man.

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.817
I don't need this many
Shino Sensei's in my life.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.285
(Sarada sighs)

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.954
They can be so
immature sometimes.

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:03.223
Hey, Sarada, let's
get a second round

00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:04.491
of those new desserts.

00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:05.759
Come on, quick.

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:06.994
Sure.

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:13.967
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:29.716 --> 00:22:34.054
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:42.389
(intense rock music)

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:44.157
[Sukea] The Hokage
asked me to see

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:46.426
how Team 25's doing
on their mission.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.296
Hey, aren't you that
journalist, Mr. Sukea?

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:51.298
You're Houki Taketori, right?

00:23:51.331 --> 00:23:53.700
Anyway, you know,
what you're wearing...

00:23:53.734 --> 00:23:55.202
[Houki] Ever since I was a kid,

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:57.271
I've been a big
fan of Lord Sixth.

00:23:57.304 --> 00:24:00.140
I wanna become a
ninja just like him.

00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:03.944
[Sukea] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations,"

00:24:03.977 --> 00:24:05.245
Team 25.

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:07.147
[Houki] But all we've been
getting assigned lately

00:24:07.181 --> 00:24:09.316
are D-rank missions.
