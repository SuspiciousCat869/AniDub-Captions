WEBVTT

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:10.043
(mellow piano music)

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:15.182
-(inmates chattering)
-(silverware dinging)

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.318
[Boruto] What do you
think about Kokuri?

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.054
[Mitsuki] Well, he was a
member of the Mujina Gang.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.090
I think he's still
hiding something.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.059
Agreed, I mean, we know
he's hidden the money

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.461
he stole from the Gang.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.097
Also, he pulled a robbery
that landed him here

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.832
in Hozuki Castle, right?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.134
We should just ask him flat out.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.938
[Boruto] Hey,
Kokuri, got a minute?

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.239
What's up?

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.342
Where did you put all of
the money that you stole?

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:46.547
I hid it someplace
that's completely safe.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.215
And you can't tell us where?

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.051
I'll tell you, but
once I get outta here.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.119
Kokuri, you know--

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.654
If you guys are
talking about cash,

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.189
you better let me in on it, too!

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.192
[Boruto] We're not
talking about that at all.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.360
-I'm finished.
-Leaving so soon?

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.663
I don't have much
of an appetite.

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.231
-(munching)
-I get ya!

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:08.669
Who can eat this
rotten slop here?

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:09.803
Hold on!

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.605
We're not done talking
about the money!

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.175
Hey, so since it's the gang's
money we're talking about,

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.944
it must be a lot, right?

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.478
How much is it, anyway?

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:21.782
-How should I know that?
-Aw, don't play dumb!

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.550
I mean, we're
friends now, right?

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.053
Come on, let's be buds!

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.355
-(scoffs)
-Those guys--

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:32.192
Our mission to protect Kokuri's
finally going smoothly.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.561
But still, he won't
tell us anything.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.963
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.831
We're still gonna
have to confirm

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:41.068
if Kokuri is someone
we can trust.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.504
(opening theme music)

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:47.307
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:14.595
(opening theme music)

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.439
(shoes thumping)

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.676
(knocking on door)

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.180
You make a decision about
getting rid of Kokuri?

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.949
[Benga] I already
told you, no murder.

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.417
[Tsukiyo] It's not murder.

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.954
All you have to do is send him
to Hozuki Castle Number Two

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:42.489
where my underlings are.

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.958
You just have to
authorize the transfer.

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.960
Nothing wrong with that, right?

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.363
My guys will take
care of the rest.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.566
Transferring a prisoner
isn't as easy as that.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.170
Kokuri stole a lot of our
money and ran off with it.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:04:00.174
He took a lot more than the
jewels I gave you were worth.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.477
What would you do if I said
you got to keep it all?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.078
(Benga gulping)

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:08.081
All I'm doing is spreading
the luck around a little.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:11.018
You've gotta be careful
who you say things to.

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.287
[Tsukiyo] You that
afraid of Mujo?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.756
Don't you underestimate me.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.558
I'm the warden around here.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.227
So, if Kokuri really
is up to something,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.996
then, I'll make sure that
he's punished for it.

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:27.935
(scoffing)

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:30.504
(soft music)

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:33.473
Hold it!

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:37.010
There's something really
fishy about you two.

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:39.313
[Boruto] We haven't
done anything wrong.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.916
[Benga] What's your
connection to Kokuri?

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.786
Nothing, we're just
friends, that's all.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.954
[Benga] Friends, huh?

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.156
Look, I don't know
what you're scheming,

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.358
but don't think that
you can fool me!

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.559
(Boruto giggles)

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:55.395
We really aren't scheming
anything at all, Warden Benga.

00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:58.232
(Benga scoffs)

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.968
Well, I've still got
other ways to find out

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.970
what their little secrets are.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.378
You seem to be friendly
with Boruto and Kokuri.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.379
Huh?

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.615
(munching)

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.383
What? No way!

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.151
Those guys are
pains in the neck!

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:20.354
You really get what
I'm talking about.

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.556
I don't wanna have
anything to do with them.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.959
In fact, I wish I could
be moved to another cell.

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:27.427
Oh, by the way,

00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.697
you made a lot on that bet
with Doragu, didn't you?

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.099
What do you mean?

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:34.902
-I didn't make anything!
-Don't lie.

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:37.604
I know you are, because
whenever you do,

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:39.806
your nostrils flare like that.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.807
Huh?

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.342
[Benga] Never mind that now.

00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:46.947
I just heard that your little
sister's sick and needs money.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.184
I'm sorry, Warden Benga!

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:53.420
[Benga] You are so thoughtful!

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.721
You want one?

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:58.525
-What, really?
-Don't hold back.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.661
(munching)

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:01.895
Tasty, huh?

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:03.897
I haven't had one in so long!

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:06.466
-Thank you!
-No need for thanks.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.636
I bought them with
your money, after all.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:14.241
You sure had a lot
squirreled away, didn't you?

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:18.612
Unauthorized savings are
prohibited at Hozuki Castle.

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:20.214
So, your money's been seized.

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.015
[Kamata] Please, wait!

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:25.052
Is your sister that
precious to you?

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.789
You wrote, "Your big
brother's traveling

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:30.490
"in the Land of Lightning now."

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:33.560
"Recently, I rescued a boy
attacked by Rogue Shinobi.

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:35.729
"Everyone showered
me with admiration."

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.097
"I was hurt in the battle,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.233
"but I consider it
my badge of courage.

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:41.368
"So, don't worry about me."

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.569
Really?

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:45.873
The guy who's known as the
coward of Hozuki Prison

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.808
fought against Rogue Shinobi.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.044
I doubt you're capable
of such bravery!

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:53.947
I wouldn't mind telling
your little sister

00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:55.749
that you're really a convict.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.385
Plus, if she learns that you
committed aggravated robbery

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.153
to get the money
for her surgery,

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:02.089
then your sister's
illness is bound

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:03.690
to become a whole lot worse.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:08.462
No, please, Warden Benga,
sir, don't let my sister know.

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.364
I hear she's recovering
in the hospital

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:13.967
after her surgery thanks to
the Medical Foundation's aid.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:14.935
Yes, sir.

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.204
And wouldn't you
like to see her?

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:19.139
But what do I have to do?

00:07:19.173 --> 00:07:22.242
Find out what Kokuri
and Boruto are up to.

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:24.378
If I become a rat,
then everyone in here

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:26.146
will hate me like
they do Kedama,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.748
I won't make it out alive.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.616
Don't worry.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.685
All of this is just between us.

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:35.889
Nobody else will find out, and
you'll get your money back.

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.090
[Kamata] But--

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:40.227
Who cares if all of the
other inmates hate you?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.529
Isn't your sister worth it?

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:45.098
You mean it?

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.234
You'll actually
let me visit her?

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:49.536
Of course, I'm no liar.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.872
(bright music)

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:54.675
(birds chirping)

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.579
I can't believe they did
something so horrible.

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:02.616
[Kedama] Everyone's bored
and has time on their hands.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.418
[Mitsuki] You like flowers?

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:08.021
[Kedama] It's not really
about liking or hating them.

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:10.324
Then, why do you
take care of them?

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.094
I've already forgotten.

00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:17.130
(birds chirping)

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:20.467
[Kokuri] What did
you want to show me?

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.637
Just come with me, you'll
find out soon enough.

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:27.407
(giggling)

00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:31.378
This is for my sister,
don't hold it against me.

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:34.515
It's in here?

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:36.717
Yeah, wait here a sec.

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.554
(book thudding)

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.632
Boruto?

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.501
(door thuds open)

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:58.338
Are you over there?

00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.339
(gasps)

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.641
(dramatic music)

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.009
Tsukiyo!

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:05.045
I thought you were in solitary!

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:09.216
Yeah, I was, but I
came out to kill you.

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:10.884
-(grunting)
-(knife whistling)

00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:11.952
(dramatic music)

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.387
Boruto!

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.688
Are you okay?

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.490
-(grunting)
-(knife whistling)

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.558
Hey, guard!

00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:19.092
We need help in here!

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:21.161
(dramatic music)

00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:24.031
Why isn't anyone
coming to help us out?

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.501
-(grunting)
-(thumping)

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:28.635
No, Boruto!

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:30.003
-(Boruto moaning)
-Just run!

00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:31.405
[Kokuri] But--!

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:33.941
Where did you hide all the
money that you stole from us?

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:35.175
[Kokuri] I don't know!

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:38.178
Do you want him to
die or something?

00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:40.547
-(Boruto moaning)
-No, stop!

00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:41.548
All right!

00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:43.350
All right, I'll talk!

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:45.385
The money is--

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.753
It's all gone!

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:48.222
You were the accountant.

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:50.357
we know you took the
money, there's no doubt.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.093
And there's no way you could
spend that much so quickly!

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.428
I'm not lying!

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:57.898
The day I ran away, I
donated all the money I took!

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.166
[Sarada] Release!

00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:04.171
-(buzzing)
-(Kokuri gasps)

00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:07.407
Tsukiyo?

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:08.609
Are you serious?

00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:11.478
I never even heard of
anyone donating the money

00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:12.813
that they stole before.

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:13.947
You'd wouldn't expect someone

00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:16.083
from a gang of
robbers to do that.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.018
What's going on here?

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:20.087
[Boruto] Sorry for
doing that to ya.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.322
But we used a genjutsu on you

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:25.058
so we could find out
what the truth is.

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.995
(book thudding)

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.736
(air whooshing)

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:38.739
(buzzing)

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.007
Ugh, damn it.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.142
I wonder if the Leaf
would even believe us

00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:44.745
if we reported that all
of the money was donated.

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:48.682
But still, I do believe you
are telling us the truth.

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:50.551
Thank you, Boruto.

00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:59.059
[Kamata] Boruto and that girl
are actually Leaf Shinobi?

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:07.868
[Mitsuki] It's hard to believe,
but it appears to be true.

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:09.636
Come on, now, Mitsuki!

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.372
I mean, you don't have to double
check everything, ya know!

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:14.341
But that's part of
our mission, right?

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:18.145
It's Kokuri's fault for
hiding it from us until now.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.614
She's right, I'm sorry.

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:23.250
So, I guess you are
a good guy after all!

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:26.987
-(paper tearing)
-Hey, what are you doing?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.290
Actually, I'm not
a good guy at all.

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:32.593
(soft music)

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:37.264
I was never that
good at ninjutsu,

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:39.766
so I got a job as an accountant.

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:43.403
Deposit this in the bank.

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:45.873
It's all of the money
from today's sales.

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:47.107
Okay.

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.245
Later, I found out
that it was money

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:53.447
that the Mujina Gang had stolen.

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:57.384
(paper thudding)

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.954
When I learned that the money

00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:03.090
was all from an
attack the day before,

00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:05.292
the one all the papers
were talking about,

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:09.463
my mind went blank, and I
ran away in desperation.

00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.967
(shoes thudding)

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:17.171
(suspenseful music)

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:25.846
Then, I realized that I
ran off holding the money.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.015
In the middle of my
panic and confusion,

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:30.184
a poster caught my eye.

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:37.090
This was dirty money.

00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:39.726
I wanted it to be used
to help sick kids.

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:43.897
And so, I donated all of it!

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:46.867
Honestly, I'm
amazed you survived.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.503
I didn't really feel
alive back then.

00:12:50.504 --> 00:12:54.007
-(steps knocking)
-(Kokuri panting)

00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.977
(air whooshing)

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.882
A Mujina Gang member spotted
me, so I ran like hell.

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:05.118
(waterfall gushing)

00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:07.855
(water splashing)

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:10.757
(water gushing)

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.492
(Kokuri panting)

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:15.829
Swimming's the one thing
I've always been good at.

00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:19.099
And this time, it saved my life.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:21.401
(shoes thudding)

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:24.338
I felt like I'd been
given a second chance,

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:27.074
and I swore that I'd
atone by helping people.

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:28.408
[Woman] What are you doing?

00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:29.610
Hand it over!

00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:31.378
Hey, just let go of it, lady!

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:33.947
One day, I was trying
to help a woman

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.482
whose wallet was stolen.

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:38.485
I punched the pickpocket
and returned it.

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:41.288
But it turned out she
was the pickpocket,

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.490
and the man I punched
was the victim!

00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:47.261
So, I ended up being charged
as the woman's accomplice.

00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:51.498
I was given a sentence
here at Hozuki Castle

00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:53.267
for aggravated robbery.

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.770
I could only accept it.

00:13:56.803 --> 00:14:00.073
I was guilty of being a
member of the gang, after all.

00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:02.476
-Yeah, I get it, ya' know.
-Boruto.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.078
[Boruto] Okay, no more
secrets from now on!

00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:07.748
But I'm serious, I
don't have the money!

00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:09.483
You'll still protect me, right?

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:12.419
Come on, is that really
what you're worried about?

00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:14.488
The money doesn't
matter to us at all.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.890
We're Leaf shinobi,
just trust us.

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:19.726
Don't worry, we'll
protect you for sure!

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.563
Okay, thank you, guys!

00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:25.632
(light switch clicking)

00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:28.669
(shoes knocking)

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.070
(snickering)

00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:32.806
He actually donated
all the money he took?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.209
Man, Kokuri is such an idiot!

00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:37.945
Oh, well, at least now
I know what's going on

00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:39.112
between the two of them.

00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:41.415
I'll be able to see my sister.

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:44.551
I'm just gonna take
this with me as proof.

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:46.587
(gasps)

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:49.623
What?

00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:51.625
The money that Kokuri donated.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:53.727
It helped my sister?

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:57.464
(sobbing)

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:01.568
(bird cooing)

00:15:01.602 --> 00:15:04.738
[Shikamaru] We've received
word from the Hidden Grass.

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:06.640
Kokuri's going to be paroled.

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:10.577
It seems that his prison term
had been unfairly lengthened.

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.679
Man, that's so irresponsible!

00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:16.350
I've always known Mr. Mujo to
be strict about regulations.

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:19.086
[Shikamaru] He may be the
Lord of Hozuki Castle,

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:21.822
but I guess it's hard
to oversee everything.

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:24.157
Anyway, once he's
released on parole,

00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:26.426
Boruto and the others'
mission to guard Kokuri

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.828
will be finished.

00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:30.030
Well, good, that'll
be a relief, then.

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:32.866
Please notify Boruto and
the others right away.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.602
I'll go ahead and
contact Mr. Mujo, then.

00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:36.770
[Naruto] Yes, please.

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.706
Then, all that's left is for
Kokuri to get to the Leaf

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.008
so we can question him.

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:43.810
And that means we're
finally gonna get some intel

00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:45.312
on the Mujina Gang!

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:48.015
(bludgeon thudding)

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:51.151
I hope you have something
interesting to tell me.

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:54.755
Yeah, about Boruto
and the others--

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.126
Well, they're--

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:04.264
Completely clean, there's
nothing going on between them!

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.569
[Benga] You dare lie to me?

00:16:09.837 --> 00:16:12.472
-(bludgeon thudding)
-Ah!

00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:15.342
Why, you little bastard!

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:16.410
But it's true!

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.812
I couldn't turn up
anything suspicious

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.013
about those guys at all!

00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:22.015
That isn't the truth, is it?

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:26.420
You want your sister to know
you're in Hozuki Castle?

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:27.621
(Kamata moaning)

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:32.993
[Kamata] Boruto and Kokuri
don't have any secrets.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.428
Why you--

00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:37.097
You realize what's going
to happen, don't you?

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:41.869
[Haie] Mr. Benga, Lord
Mujo has summoned you.

00:16:41.902 --> 00:16:44.538
What a pain in the neck!

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.739
Hey, Haie!

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:48.742
Extend this guy's sentence
and throw him into solitary.

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:49.977
[Haie] Yes, sir!

00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:53.881
You're trash.

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:56.483
(soft music)

00:16:56.517 --> 00:17:00.053
[Haie] You messed up
defying Mr. Benga like that.

00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:04.491
(Kamata sobbing)

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:08.161
Your brother fought
with that big jerk Benga

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:12.966
and he protected the
man who saved your life.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.402
It's a real badge of courage.

00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:18.238
Big bro is gonna
turn his life around.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.742
(clearing throat)

00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:25.312
Kokuri is going to be
released on parole shortly.

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:26.346
Parole?

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.281
But--

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:29.116
Is there some kind
of problem with that?

00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:32.152
No, but, I mean, the
man's a criminal!

00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:35.455
This decision was made by
the Hidden Grass Village.

00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:37.090
[Benga] I understand.

00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:39.293
By the way, I've received word

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:42.229
that you've been extending
prison sentences arbitrarily.

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:43.964
Is that truly what
you've been doing?

00:17:43.997 --> 00:17:45.632
I just did it

00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:48.235
to punish rebellious
behavior among the prisoners!

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:50.137
[Mujo] Whatever the reason was,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.539
I cannot overlook
such improper actions

00:17:52.573 --> 00:17:54.074
taken against the inmates.

00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:56.944
You mean you're siding
with criminals against me?

00:17:56.977 --> 00:17:58.979
No, that isn't what I'm doing.

00:17:59.012 --> 00:18:02.149
Benga, I'm going to
have to place you

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.084
on indefinite suspension.

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:06.687
Expect to receive
a harsh punishment

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.822
from the Hidden Grass Village.

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:11.091
There's no future for you here.

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:13.393
But, Lord Mujo!

00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:16.964
Think hard about what you've
done and repent your actions.

00:18:16.997 --> 00:18:17.965
But that's--

00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:19.600
Please, just wait!

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:21.001
I won't do it again!

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.970
I cannot bend the rules for you.

00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:25.472
Please, Lord Mujo,
I'm very sorry.

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:27.040
Forgive me!

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:29.176
Benga!

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.312
We're finished talking now.

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:33.547
You may leave.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.316
(Mujo grunting)

00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:42.956
-(Mujo thumping on floor)
-(Mujo moaning)

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.291
(dramatic music)

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:47.127
So, I ought to think
hard about what I've done

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.263
and repent my actions, you say?

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:52.766
Don't you dare act so
conceited in front of me.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.335
(suspenseful music)

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:56.970
(fire blasts)

00:18:57.004 --> 00:18:59.006
As long as this is gone,

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:03.343
then Hozuki Castle and Kokuri's
money will both be mine.

00:19:03.377 --> 00:19:05.879
(dramatic music)

00:19:05.913 --> 00:19:07.347
Mr. Mujo!

00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:08.482
-(Sarada panting)
-What's wrong?

00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:11.552
-What happened to him?
-Just stay back!

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:15.022
(dramatic music)

00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:16.256
Mr. Mujo!

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.992
(soft electric guitar music)

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:21.762
I wasn't sure you'd
be getting back to me.

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:25.232
I'll transfer Kokuri to
Hozuki Castle Number Two.

00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:27.668
Are you satisfied now?

00:19:27.701 --> 00:19:29.069
(Tsukiyo scoffs)

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:31.972
[Tsukiyo] It seems that luck
has smiled on you as well!

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.142
-Where's Kokuri's money?
-Look, don't be so hasty.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:38.111
Although I do have an
idea of where he hid it.

00:19:38.145 --> 00:19:40.113
If you end up betraying me,

00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:41.648
you know what'll happen, right?

00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:46.019
[Tsukiyo] Don't worry, I don't
stand for betrayal either.

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:47.888
Then, keep your word.

00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:49.156
(dramatic music)

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:52.259
It appears that luck is
well within our grasp.

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.161
(soft electric guitar notes)

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.363
Doesn't something feel off?

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:58.498
It's way past dinner time now,

00:19:58.532 --> 00:20:00.434
but we're still locked
up in our cells.

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:03.136
And not only that, but
old man Kamata's gone.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.205
[Mitsuki] I wonder if
something happened to him.

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:08.208
I haven't seen him since this
morning in the cafeteria.

00:20:08.242 --> 00:20:10.711
Maybe his stomach's
bothering him?

00:20:10.744 --> 00:20:12.613
Things just aren't
the same in here

00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:14.081
without that loudmouth around.

00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:16.016
(bell tolling)

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.484
Attention!

00:20:17.518 --> 00:20:19.086
(shoes knocking)

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:20.354
Starting today,

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.856
I'll be standing in as
the Lord of the Castle,

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.892
and looking after
all you inmates!

00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:26.093
[Mitsuki] Standing in?

00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:28.095
[Boruto] What
happened to Mr. Mujo?

00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:30.030
You should get smacked for that,

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:32.366
but it's a good question,
so I'll answer it.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.834
He's fallen ill.

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:35.269
What did you say?

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:38.205
I may not know exactly
what you're scheming,

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.541
but there's no one in here
to protect you anymore.

00:20:40.574 --> 00:20:42.809
[Boruto] And what happened
to old man Kamata?

00:20:42.843 --> 00:20:44.811
He's in solitary
confinement now.

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.380
[Boruto] What's going on?

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.715
[Benga] You're going
to be leaving soon.

00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:49.716
Really?

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.851
I am?

00:20:50.884 --> 00:20:53.420
Your transfer to Hozuki
Castle Number Two

00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:54.621
has been authorized.

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:58.892
By next week, you'll be
reunited with your old friends.

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:00.827
[Kokuri] No, you can't do this.

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:01.962
-Please, not there!
-(bludgeon hitting)

00:21:01.995 --> 00:21:04.231
-Ah!
-What are you doing?

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:08.001
Enjoy this time with your
friends, while you still can.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:11.038
(dramatic music)

00:21:14.241 --> 00:21:16.610
It's all over for me.

00:21:16.643 --> 00:21:18.278
I'm gonna be killed soon.

00:21:18.312 --> 00:21:21.548
Don't worry, Kokuri,
you still have us.

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:25.018
Although, why are they in
a rush to transfer you?

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:26.987
I don't know why!

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.089
Hozuki Castle Number Two

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:32.292
is where the members of the
Mujina Gang are kept locked up.

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:35.696
If I go, I'm gonna die for sure!

00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:38.131
The transfer's early next week.

00:21:38.165 --> 00:21:40.100
And without Lord Mujo,

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.202
we won't be able to
contact the Leaf.

00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:44.104
It's really all over for me!

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.973
I said you'll be
okay, all right?

00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:47.374
[Kokuri] But--

00:21:47.407 --> 00:21:50.611
This means we'll have to
do it before the transfer.

00:21:50.644 --> 00:21:51.612
Do what?

00:21:51.645 --> 00:21:54.615
Take Kokuri and break
him out of this prison.

00:21:54.648 --> 00:21:55.883
Break him out?

00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:57.718
(gasps)

00:21:57.751 --> 00:22:00.754
I promised him I'd get him out

00:22:00.787 --> 00:22:03.090
and take him to the Hidden Leaf,

00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:05.659
so, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:18.138
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.121 --> 00:23:43.190
(dramatic music)

00:23:43.223 --> 00:23:44.625
[Mitsuki] There's not much time

00:23:44.658 --> 00:23:47.060
before Kokuri's transferred
to Hozuki Prison Number Two.

00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:49.096
[Boruto] For us to break
out of here with him--

00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:50.631
[Sarada] We have to
find a safe route

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:53.200
and a way to release the
Celestial Prison Jutsu.

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:55.169
Lots of problems to solve, huh?

00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:56.537
[Mitsuki] We have
to proceed carefully

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.771
without any mistakes.

00:23:57.804 --> 00:23:59.106
It's going to be tricky.

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:02.209
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:04.044
"Breaking out of Hozuki Castle."

00:24:04.077 --> 00:24:05.445
We'll do it tomorrow morning.

00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:07.214
We gotta make sure
the prison break

00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:09.016
will be successful by then!

00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:16.056
(closing theme music)
