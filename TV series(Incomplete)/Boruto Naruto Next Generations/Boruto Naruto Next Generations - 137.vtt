WEBVTT

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.209
(gentle music)

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.412
So, Sumire's assignment

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.681
to the Scientific Ninja
Tools Team was finalized?

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.083
Yeah, it was.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.685
It was on hold until
just a little while ago.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.153
Wait, hold on a second.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.022
I thought the Scientific
Ninja Tools Team

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.357
had been shut down? (chomps)

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.093
Mr. Katasuke's been on
suspension since that incident.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.361
(buzzer buzzes)

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:30.163
-And the lab was closed down.
-(buzzer buzzes)

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.366
But I heard a new
facility's being built

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.234
under the Hokage's supervision.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.802
A new building? (chomps)

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:36.937
Yep!

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.605
I guess they're building
a larger facility

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.675
so they can increase research
into Scientific Ninja Tools.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.345
Yeah, it's located on the
outskirts of the Land of Fire.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.281
So we won't be
able to see Sumire

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.683
as often anymore, will we?

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.552
Come on, don't be so sad.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:52.986
That's right!

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:54.888
Ta-dah!

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:55.889
-[Girls] Hm?
-So?

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.157
I just slapped it together!

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.560
It's her farewell
party invitation!

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:02.996
Let's invite our classmates
from the Academy and celebrate!

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:04.631
Oh, wow!

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.099
How great!

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.802
Sumire'll be totally surprised!

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:10.804
-That's right!
-(footsteps tapping)

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.206
There's no point in gettin' sad.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.742
I mean, this is something
Sumire really wants to do.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.878
So let's give her
a proper sendoff!

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.012
Mhm.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:20.614
Okay, it's a plan!

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.082
Let's get going, Namida.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.884
We don't wanna keep
Hanabi Sensei waiting.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.619
-(gasps) That's right!
-(footsteps tapping)

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.554
-See ya!
-(footsteps tapping)

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:29.489
(air whooshing)

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:30.490
(Cho-Cho eating)

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:31.859
It must be really tough

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.760
when you lose a
member of your team,

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:34.828
don't you think?

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:36.196
Yeah, I know, right?

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.233
-(footsteps tapping)
-(village bustling)

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.968
I wonder what
Hanabi Sensei wanted

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.336
to talk to us about.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.604
Hm.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.939
I'm guessing it's about
finding a new team member.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:48.208
Yeah, you're probably right.

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:50.143
(exclaims) Wasabi, look out!

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:50.944
Hm?

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.246
-(air whooshing)
-Whoa!

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.951
-(Wasabi exclaims)
-(air whooshing)

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.152
(metallic clink)

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:00.287
-(air whooshing)
-(Wasabi exclaims)

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.822
-(Wasabi exclaims)
-(wooden thud)

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.624
Wasabi, you okay?

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:05.292
Ow, that really hurts!

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.860
That was dangerous, ya know!

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.562
Here I thought that
a shinobi like you

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.565
would be able to dodge
that quite surely.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.567
What?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.470
Are the shinobi of this
village blunt and mediocre?

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.272
(gasps) Why you!

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.474
Just what are you implying?

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:23.243
(air whooshing)

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.879
(Namida gasps)

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:26.880
(air whooshing)

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:28.482
Who the hell was that, anyway?

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.553
(opening theme music)

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:36.456
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:03.577
(opening theme music)

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.321
Regarding Sumire's replacement,

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.724
are you sure that this kid's
gonna be a good choice?

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:18.725
Of course.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.327
Don't be worried.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.796
A samurai from the
Land of Iron, huh?

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:25.599
Putting samurai and shinobi
together on the same team

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.302
is a new concept we
haven't tried before.

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.903
In this age, it doesn't matter

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.972
if you're a shinobi
or a samurai.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.975
Well, still, it's all
highly experimental.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:37.144
Only you'd come up with this.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.846
Oh?

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.347
Hm? What's up?

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.716
She was the last
student of Mifune,

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.551
the leader of the samurai?

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:45.719
Looks like we're gonna have

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.988
a troublesome one on our hands.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.624
(chuckles) I guess so.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:54.628
(air whooshing)

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.866
-(footsteps tapping)
-[Girls] Hanabi Sensei!

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:00.133
You're late!

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.535
-I know, sorry!
-I know, sorry!

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.837
[Tsubaki] As I thought,
blunt and mediocre.

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.172
Huh?

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:08.008
You're that girl from earlier!

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:11.512
Oh, you know each other?

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:12.312
That's great!

00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:13.981
That'll speed everything up!

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:15.249
-(air whooshing)
-(Wasabi exhales)

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:16.984
-(drums beating)
-(coat flaps)

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:22.222
-(heavy rock music)
-(feet landing)

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.124
This is Tsubaki Kurogane.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.126
She's going to be
joining our team.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.061
(gasps) What, her?

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.597
Meet Wasabi and
Namida of Team 15.

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:33.200
My name's Hanabi, and
I'm the team captain.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.103
I look forward to
working with you.

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:37.504
She's an exchange
student who's come

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:39.840
to the Leaf Village
from the Land of Iron.

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:41.775
It's her first time
in the Hidden Leaf.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.610
So please, make
her feel welcome.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.919
Wait, Tsubaki, are
you really a samurai?

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:53.120
Let me get this straight,

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:54.988
a non-shinobi's
joining our team?

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.190
That's right.

00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:58.859
It's a decision that was
made by the higher-ups.

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:01.795
Also, Tsubaki, now that
you've joined Team 15,

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.931
you'll need to abide
by Shinobi Rules.

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:05.199
Now, that being said,

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:07.134
since Tsubaki's just arrived,

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.936
Wasabi and Namida, it's your job

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.504
to show her around
the Hidden Leaf

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.840
and try to foster
some teamwork today.

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:13.974
Right!

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:15.242
Why do I have to?

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.211
-[Hanabi] Wasabi!
-Okay!

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.513
I'm sorry, but I'm going to need

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.648
to head out on a
mission very shortly.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:24.384
Are you gonna be investigating
dangerous criminals

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:25.519
in the Bingo Book?

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.387
Please be careful, okay?

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.756
[Hanabi] Thank you.
I'm counting on all of you.

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.793
Tsubaki, this okay?

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.127
Of course.

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:37.865
(village bustling)

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:41.134
So, uh, where do you
want to go, Tsubaki?

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.437
You haven't had
lunch yet, right?

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.505
I'm okay.

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:45.305
(Namida whimpers)

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.307
Allow me to just say one thing.

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:50.444
I'm only here under
my superior's orders.

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.779
I'll return home
once my term is up.

00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:54.047
So please rest assured.

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.749
-What?
-(Wasabi sighs)

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:59.253
That mean you don't
care about anything?

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:01.388
I just mean there is
nothing I can learn

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.056
from the shinobi
of this village.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.993
Hey, uh, listen you guys, uh...

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:06.994
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:08.462
-(groovy music)
-Oh, I get it.

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:11.532
Well, you certainly seem
to be very confident.

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.800
So let's test how
good your skills are,

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.836
right here and right now!

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:17.771
(air whooshing)

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:20.507
-Ninja Art: Cat Cloak!
-(hood flaps)

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.576
(metallic clink)

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.912
Hey, c'mon you two, please!

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.713
(Wasabi growling)

00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:30.317
-(foot slides)
-(chime ringing)

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.853
-(metallic clink)
-That'll be enough.

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.054
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:37.257
If I'd drawn my sword,
you'd already be dead.

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.193
The match was decided
as soon as you

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:41.528
positioned yourself
in front of me.

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:45.966
(scoffs) Seems you
samurai are just all talk.

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.334
Besides, what
business do you have

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.102
coming to a shinobi
village, anyway?

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.103
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.839
(panicking) Wasabi, wait!

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:55.075
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.313
The higher-ups just
don't realize it.

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:02.716
Shinobi lack the steadfast
conviction samurai have.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:04.585
And I will prove it to them.

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:07.621
(footsteps tapping)

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:12.659
[Boruto] Hm?

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:14.127
What's this?

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:16.864
[Sarada] It's an invitation
to Sumire's farewell party.

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:18.465
You're all gonna come, right?

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.666
[Shikadai] Oh, right!

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.703
Her Scientific Ninja Tools
Team assignment was finalized.

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:25.839
That's gonna leave Team
15 in a really tough spot!

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:27.441
What are those guys gonna do?

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:28.575
Oh, uh,

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:31.245
seems they've already
decided on a new team member.

00:08:31.278 --> 00:08:33.580
I heard rumors that
she's an exchange student

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:34.781
from the Land of Iron.

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:37.584
Hold on, you're saying
she's a samurai?

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:39.253
The Land of Iron?

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:40.654
Samurai?

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:41.655
What's that again?

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.056
We learned about them in class,

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.191
-remember?
-(traditional music)

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:45.926
They have their own
traditions and culture,

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.328
and they use kenjutsu,
the art of the sword.

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:49.129
Kenjutsu?

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.297
That's the one the guys

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.999
from the Hidden Mist
are good at, isn't it?

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.467
Yeah, but unlike shinobi,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.769
samurai are said to
be able to focus all

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:58.105
of their chakra
into their swords.

00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.706
Does that mean they're strong?

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.642
You know, I wonder about that.

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:04.444
Their land is situated
deep in the mountains,

00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:07.381
and they rarely interact with
anybody from other nations.

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:10.117
Their culture has remained
largely the same over the years,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.485
and some say they're
behind the times,

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:13.187
or the era for
samurai is over now-

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.755
[Tsubaki] That isn't true.

00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:16.723
Huh?

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:19.059
(drums rolling)

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:20.527
(Sarada exclaims)

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:22.529
Hm? Hold on, are you-

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.131
Yeah! This is Tsubaki!

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:26.733
She just joined up with Team 15!

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.368
Deep in the mountains, huh?

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.904
So, you're saying
samurai are outdated?

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:32.039
-(tense music)
-Wasabi!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.373
-How shallow.
-Huh?

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:35.576
Thanks to our land's
location in the mountains,

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:38.979
the Land of Iron is protected
by a natural fortress.

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:41.515
Guess that's too much
for you to figure out.

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:44.184
It appears that peace has
made shinobi complacent.

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:45.853
-(Tsubaki slams desk)
-What was that?

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:48.856
Hey, come on, let's
all calm down, okay?

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.591
Listen, are you hungry?

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:52.526
Here, try these!

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.628
They're called fries.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.264
No, thank you.

00:09:57.297 --> 00:09:58.398
Uh, what?

00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:00.400
Did you seriously just
refuse my friendship fries?

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:02.703
That's a very rude
thing to do, you know!

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:03.704
(nervously chuckles) Well, um-

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:04.972
-Huh?
-She just got here,

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:07.508
and she isn't used to the
way that we do things.

00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:09.443
How deplorable.

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:10.444
What?

00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:12.246
A spineless shinobi
desperately trying

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:15.249
to smooth over a situation
before things turn ugly.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:17.718
How different you
all are from samurai.

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.052
-(explosion booms)
-You know,

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.722
I'd watch what you
say if I were you.

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:23.390
You pickin' a fight?

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:25.859
(metallic clink)

00:10:25.893 --> 00:10:28.195
Uh, hold on, Sarada, calm down!

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:29.997
Let's not fight, okay?

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.132
That would be very wise.

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:34.268
Because the moment
I draw my sword,

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.069
you'll soon come to regret it.

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:40.040
(scoffs) Gimme a
break, whatever.

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:41.575
You're just all talk.

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:43.043
Let's go, Cho-Cho.

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.344
Hold on, Sarada!

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:46.914
Tsubaki!

00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:48.448
[Wasabi] You're unbelievable.

00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:49.650
Huh?

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.719
All you've done since you
got here is make enemies.

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:53.854
(footsteps tapping)

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:56.557
Wasabi! (whimpers)

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.861
-(birds cawing)
-(birds chirping)

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:04.598
(footsteps tapping)

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:05.399
You guys!

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.201
We're all on the
same team, here!

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:09.236
Can you please try to get along?

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:11.238
That's easier said than done.

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.574
But since she has no
desire to get along,

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:15.709
it's going to be impossible.

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:16.710
But-

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:18.245
About today,

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:21.315
I appreciate you showing
me around the Leaf Village.

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.784
Thanks to you, I got
to see that shinobi

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:26.520
lack the conviction
samurai possess.

00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:27.588
What?

00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:29.223
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.059
(footsteps tapping)

00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:34.194
You mean, that's what
you were thinking

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:36.463
while you were walking
around the village?

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:37.464
Yes.

00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:40.467
And it would appear that
I was right, after all.

00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:42.636
(footsteps tapping)

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:45.506
-(clothing ruffles)
-You haven't seen anything!

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:49.042
'Cause we shinobi have
lots of conviction!

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.978
Really, then where
are you hiding it?

00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:52.779
-(tense music)
-You probably can't see it

00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:54.581
because your
attitude's in the way!

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:55.983
Wasabi!

00:11:56.016 --> 00:11:57.718
(Wasabi grunts)

00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:58.719
(air whooshing)

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:01.788
(footsteps tapping)

00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:04.258
(Tsubaki exhales)

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:08.462
You, you said shinobi
lack conviction.

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:13.100
I don't think that's something
you can determine so easily.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:16.470
(air whooshing)

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.445
-(peaceful music)
-(village bustling)

00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:32.719
Uh, Wasabi.

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:36.657
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.493
It's just, I don't know if
it's actually even possible

00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:42.129
for shinobi and
samurai to get along.

00:12:42.162 --> 00:12:44.831
(sighs) But if we
don't find a way

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.133
to work this situation out,

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.602
then Sumire is
gonna be really sad.

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:53.540
(Wasabi sighs)

00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:55.809
(Namida sighs)

00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:57.711
There's lots of
people down there.

00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:00.681
And there are even
more people than that

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:02.316
in the rest of the world.

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:04.351
Out of all those people,

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.621
someone from far away has
come here to be with us.

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:11.091
It's understandable that we
wouldn't get along right away.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.726
Yeah, I guess so.

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:15.829
Ah, is that?

00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:17.731
-(Wasabi exhales)
-By that alley...

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:20.734
I've seen him somewhere before.

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.705
Wait, is he...

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:26.139
(chime rings)

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:29.776
-Oh, yeah!
-(ominous music)

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.777
Wasabi, what-

00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:32.246
It's the guy!

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:35.415
He's one of the ones that was
in Hanabi Sensei's Bingo Book!

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:36.383
(exclaims) Oh no!

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:38.952
We need to let Hanabi
Sensei know about this!

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:39.953
-No!
-(footsteps tapping)

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.622
(Namida gasps)

00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:44.391
By the time we go and get
backup, he'll be gone!

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:46.093
We need to handle
this ourselves!

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.528
Let's go get him!

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:50.264
(panicking) But we don't have
the authorization to fight!

00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:52.232
Maybe not, but we
can't risk anyone else

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:53.600
-becoming his victim!
-(footsteps tapping)

00:13:53.634 --> 00:13:55.068
(gasps) Hey, wait up!

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:02.309
(footsteps tapping)

00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:08.115
Listen well, Tsubaki.

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:10.584
In order to restore
the Land of Iron,

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.488
I'm sending you to go
study in another land.

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.458
Will you please go
to the Land of Fire?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.828
(footsteps tapping)

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.230
-(air whooshing)
-(Tsubaki exhales)

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:27.267
What are they doing?

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:28.535
-(Tsubaki grunts)
-(footsteps tapping)

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:30.804
(owl hooting)

00:14:30.838 --> 00:14:34.041
(footsteps tapping)

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:37.978
-(Wasabi exhales)
-(Namida whimpers)

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:41.215
(footsteps tapping)

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:45.185
(Wasabi gasps)

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:47.554
(footsteps tapping)

00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:48.722
He's gone.

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:50.324
Where could he have run off to?

00:14:50.357 --> 00:14:52.092
Come on, Wasabi,
let's just go back

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:53.227
and get someone to help!

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.262
-What's this?
-(girls exhale)

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:57.231
I thought it was
the Police Force,

00:14:57.264 --> 00:15:01.101
but it turns out I was just
followed by some lil' shinobi.

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:02.936
(exclaims) Wasabi!

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.204
Don't mess with us!

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.840
We can handle
someone like you...

00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:08.275
(fugitives chuckling)

00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:11.945
So, you weren't alone, huh?

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:13.480
I recognize those other two!

00:15:13.514 --> 00:15:15.682
They were in the
Bingo Book, as well!

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:16.950
I'm really very sorry,

00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:18.519
-but because you've seen us,
-(knuckles cracking)

00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:20.988
we're gonna have to
get rid of you two.

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:23.991
(scoffs) You won't
get us that easily!

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:26.593
We'll show you the
power of the shinobi

00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:27.961
of the Leaf Village!

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:31.365
-(scroll whips)
-(tense music)

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:33.433
-(palm slams)
-Cat Cloak Jutsu, Release!

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:34.935
(energy whooshing)

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:36.837
(toes cracking)

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.075
-(energy whooshing)
-(claws slicing)

00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:44.244
-(air whooshing)
-(Wasabi grunts)

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:45.712
-(fugitive exclaims)
-(Wasabi exclaims)

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:47.681
-(air whooshing)
-She's fast!

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:48.849
(air whooshing)

00:15:48.882 --> 00:15:49.850
-(Wasabi grunts)
-(fugitive grunts)

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:51.585
(snickers) Not bad!

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:52.386
(fugitive grunts)

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:53.453
-(air whooshing)
-(tail whipping)

00:15:53.487 --> 00:15:54.421
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.390
Namida, I'm gonna leave
the other guy to you!

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:57.958
-I got it!
-(metallic clink)

00:15:57.991 --> 00:15:58.959
(fugitive grunts)

00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:00.060
Here we go!

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:00.961
-(Wasabi grunting)
-(fugitive grunting)

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:04.097
(metal slicing)

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:05.232
-(Wasabi exclaims)
-(fugitive grunts)

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:06.433
-(feet dragging)
-(fugitive grunts)

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.435
Whoo! Pretty good!

00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:10.070
It's working!

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:12.206
Keep it up and end
it with one shot!

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:14.541
-(Wasabi exclaims)
-(footsteps tapping)

00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:15.475
(Wasabi growling)

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:18.579
-(Wasabi grunting)
-(metal slicing)

00:16:18.612 --> 00:16:19.513
(fugitive grunting)

00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:21.849
-(air whooshing)
-(fugitive laughing)

00:16:21.882 --> 00:16:23.083
(fugitive grunts)

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:24.952
-(Wasabi grunts)
-(explosion booms)

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:26.553
(exhales) It's a smokescreen!

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:27.521
(kunai whipping)

00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:28.856
-(kunai slicing)
-(Wasabi groans) Damn it!

00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:32.693
-(kunais whipping)
-(Wasabi exclaiming)

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:35.596
(Wasabi groaning)

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:40.601
Wasabi!

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:41.802
[Fugitive] Better pay attention!

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.036
(Namida exclaims)

00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:45.672
(fugitive grunts)

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:47.541
-(wooden thud)
-(Namida exclaims)

00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:49.109
(Namida groans)

00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:50.410
(footsteps tapping)

00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:51.445
Namida!

00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:54.081
-(Wasabi gasps)
-(hand squeezing)

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:55.249
-(fugitive grunts)
-(Wasabi grunts)

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:57.084
-(fugitive grunts)
-(Wasabi exclaims)

00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:58.218
What's wrong?

00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:00.354
Is your headband
just an accessory?

00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:01.722
-(metallic clink)
-(foot stomps)

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:03.490
(Wasabi groaning)

00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:06.093
-(hand squeezing)
-(Namida groans)

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:07.694
Why don't you leave your buddy

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:09.129
and just get on outta here?

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:13.467
-(Namida falls)
-(Wasabi gasps)

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.537
(Wasabi whimpering)

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.671
(hand squeezing)

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:18.972
(intense rock music)

00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:22.075
We shinobi don't leave
our friends behind

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.577
(inhales) and run away!

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:27.714
Shinobi protect our own!

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.585
That's my conviction!

00:17:31.618 --> 00:17:33.554
That's my nindo!

00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:35.722
And that's my Ninja Way!

00:17:35.756 --> 00:17:38.759
(fugitive cackling)

00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:41.094
Come on!

00:17:41.128 --> 00:17:43.597
Having conviction is pointless!

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.998
It's gonna get you killed!

00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:48.035
(metallic clang)

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:49.803
Huh?

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:52.306
-(air whooshing)
-(footsteps tap)

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:53.674
(Wasabi gasps)

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:54.675
Tsubaki!

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:56.276
But what are you doing here?

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.245
You don't give up.

00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:01.215
You fight to the end to
protect your friends.

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:04.818
My opinion of shinobi is
starting to improve a little.

00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:05.986
(Wasabi exhales)

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:07.020
Oh, look!

00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:09.223
Here comes another
little shinobi!

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:11.225
Wrong, I am not a shinobi!

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:12.693
-(air whooshing)
-(sword thuds)

00:18:12.726 --> 00:18:14.127
(fugitive grunting)

00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:15.963
-(fugitive exclaims)
-(air whooshing)

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:17.831
-(sword thudding)
-I am a samurai!

00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:18.832
(fugitive exclaims)

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:20.968
(groans) Damn it!

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:22.336
-(fugitive grunts)
-(explosion booms)

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.671
-(Wasabi exhales)
-(fugitive grunts)

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:25.672
Hey!

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:26.974
It's a smokescreen!

00:18:27.007 --> 00:18:29.209
Careful, Tsubaki!

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:31.712
Let me warn you,
once I draw my sword,

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:34.348
you'll soon come to regret it.

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.716
-Shut up!
-(fugitive grunts)

00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:36.750
-(kunai whipping)
-(kunai slicing)

00:18:37.718 --> 00:18:38.685
Take cover!

00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:39.720
(Wasabi grunts)

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:43.490
-(metallic clink)
-(energy whooshing)

00:18:43.524 --> 00:18:45.993
-Secret Sword: Snowstorm Slash!
-(sword slicing)

00:18:46.026 --> 00:18:48.095
(air whooshing)

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.732
-(explosion booms)
-(tornado whooshing)

00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:53.100
(Wasabi groaning)

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.303
(tornado whooshing)

00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:59.573
(trees falling)

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:02.342
(logs breaking)

00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:08.549
(Wasabi groans)

00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:09.550
(Wasabi exhales)

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.818
(groans) Wasabi!

00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:13.820
(Namida exclaims)

00:19:13.854 --> 00:19:15.189
What happened?

00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:20.227
(metallic clink)

00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:23.830
(ominous sound effect)

00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:25.799
Listen, do you guys
really understand?

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.167
Do you get it?

00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:28.936
This could've ended up worse
than you getting injured!

00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:30.070
What were you thinking?

00:19:30.103 --> 00:19:31.972
Use your brains before
you act next time!

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.273
(gentle music)

00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:35.242
I mean, you guys don't
even have the authorization

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:37.578
to fight in the first place!

00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:40.147
[Sumire] You must be Tsubaki.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.815
Nue!

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.051
Thank you for protecting
everyone today!

00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:46.687
You must be Miss Sumire.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.855
Is that right?

00:19:47.888 --> 00:19:49.256
Yes!

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:50.958
I'm leaving them in your hands.

00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:54.695
Wasabi, Namida, all of Team 15!

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:55.729
My pleasure.

00:19:57.264 --> 00:20:01.335
I was able to observe
Wasabi's Ninja Way in action.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.938
At first, I thought shinobi
were blunt and mediocre,

00:20:04.972 --> 00:20:07.574
that they were unpolished
and lacked conviction.

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:08.609
However...

00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:13.480
there's still quite a lot
that I don't know yet.

00:20:15.148 --> 00:20:18.318
And I hope to learn
more, moving forward.

00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:20.721
-You will!
-Nue!

00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:27.861
In any case, this is
quite a long scolding.

00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:29.096
(Sumire chuckles)

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.273
All right, is
everyone ready now?

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:40.073
Here we go!

00:20:40.107 --> 00:20:41.175
(confetti popping)

00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:43.677
[Students]
Congratulations, Class Rep!

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.445
Aw, thanks, you guys!

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:46.346
Nue!

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.548
-[Inojin] Here!
-(Sumire gasps)

00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:48.549
[Mitsuki] Do your best!

00:20:48.582 --> 00:20:49.816
(Sumire exhales)

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.951
[Shikadai] Here you go!

00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:52.085
-Oh, goodness!
-(students chatting)

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:53.987
[Sarada] (chuckles)
This is from all of us!

00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:56.390
We'll be best
friends till the end!

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:59.560
Do your best over
there, okay, Class Rep?

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.862
Thanks so much, Boruto!

00:21:01.895 --> 00:21:03.130
-(Namida sobbing)
-Hey, Namida,

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:05.465
come on, stop crying
so much, would you?

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:09.102
(Namida crying)

00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:12.172
Please come and visit us, okay?

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.807
Namida!

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:15.075
Wasabi!

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.376
-Sumire!
-Sumire!

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.645
-(Namida sobbing)
-(Sumire sobbing)

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:20.414
-[Namida] We'll miss you!
-[Wasabi] All right,

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:21.715
don't overdo it!

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:28.622
(closing theme music)

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:41.602
(singing in Japanese)

00:22:55.008 --> 00:22:58.045
(birds chirping)

00:23:03.584 --> 00:23:06.453
(packet rustling)

00:23:13.994 --> 00:23:15.596
(fries rustling)

00:23:15.629 --> 00:23:18.332
(gentle music)

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:21.969
(Tsubaki gasps)

00:23:22.002 --> 00:23:24.805
(Tsubaki chomping)

00:23:24.838 --> 00:23:26.673
-(chimes ringing)
-(Tsubaki moaning)

00:23:26.707 --> 00:23:28.008
Wow!

00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:29.943
I never knew this world
had something so delicious!

00:23:29.977 --> 00:23:30.944
(Tsubaki gasps)

00:23:30.978 --> 00:23:32.212
(air whooshing)

00:23:32.246 --> 00:23:34.348
-(Tsubaki chomping)
-(Tsubaki exhales)

00:23:34.381 --> 00:23:37.851
I mean, it's not bad
for shinobi cuisine.

00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:39.286
(Tsubaki chomping)

00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:43.123
(upbeat music)

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:45.225
[Boruto] (exclaims) I
don't know what to do!

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:46.593
[Sarada] What's wrong, Boruto?

00:23:46.627 --> 00:23:47.594
[Mitsuki] What happened?

00:23:47.628 --> 00:23:48.629
Why are you so flustered?

00:23:48.662 --> 00:23:50.964
[Boruto] I have no idea
what to get my grandpa

00:23:50.998 --> 00:23:52.266
for his birthday present!

00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:54.368
[Mitsuki] A present for
your grandfather, huh?

00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:56.436
[Boruto] Do you know
of something he'd like?

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.571
[Sarada] What?

00:23:57.604 --> 00:24:00.474
If his own grandson doesn't
know, then how would we?

00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:03.810
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations",

00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:05.212
"Hiashi's Birthday".

00:24:05.245 --> 00:24:06.813
A present for Grandpa...

00:24:06.847 --> 00:24:08.315
What would make him happy?

00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:16.356
(closing theme music)
