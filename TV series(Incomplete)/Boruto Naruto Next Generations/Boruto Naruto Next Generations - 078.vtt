WEBVTT

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.622
[taken back]

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.423
We made it out safely.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.459
Does this mean we're really
back?

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:29.296
Yeah. I wonder just how
far off course we've wandered.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.798
Anyway, I'm happy you're okay,
Cho-Cho!

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.634
Wait, what do you mean?

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:37.137
You know, come to think of it,
my shoulders do feel sort of
heavy.

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.540
And my memory is kinda
spotty here and there....

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:42.342
Well, it might be better if you
don't actually remember.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.945
What is it? Come on, tell me! I
wanna know, you guys!

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.013
[uncomfortable chuckle]

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.483
Uh, Boruto...?

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.454
Now we know. Mitsuki isn't a
traitor after all.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:57.991
We gotta meet up and talk to
him. As soon as we can!

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:49.603
Uh?

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.406
So is it true that he's regained
consciousness?

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.006
Yes.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.976
Can we... talk to him a bit?

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.345
Go ahead. Just don't take too
long.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.447
<i>(Naruto) Okay. Got it.</i>

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.649
[waking up]

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.685
So how are you feeling?

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.354
Well, I'm managing.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:12.192
I'm sorry. I know that it must
be hard to talk right now. But
please, we need to know...

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.362
Who was it that took Mitsuki?
Can you tell us?

00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:21.168
Thinking back, I can't say I
know their identities... But
they were...

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:22.669
...two shinobi...

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.339
...hailing from the Hidden
Stone.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:26.974
[gasps]

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.643
What were they talking about?

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.545
I'm pretty sure...

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:35.749
...they asked Mitsuki to
come to the Land of Earth with
them.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.918
[gasps]

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:42.689
Then after that, some other
person that seemed like a puppet
came...

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.191
And they took Mitsuki away.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.962
"Towards the setting
moon..."

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.164
So that must mean the Hidden
Stone.

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.967
It's imperative we notify the
Tracking Unit right now...

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.736
that they're headed for the
Land of Earth.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.271
You're right.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:58.505
And thank you.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.548
I was right all along. Mitsuki
isn't a traitor, and he never
was.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.016
M-hm.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.051
We can't really be sure about
that yet.

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:12.019
[gasps]

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:17.157
From my viewpoint, it's possible
Mitsuki could've gone with the
Hidden Stone shinobi willingly.

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.761
Even if he did, I'm sure
he had a reason to do it!

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:23.197
Or he wouldn't have left his
snake behind like that.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.604
And besides, in the snake's
memory, those guys said the
answer Mitsuki seeks...

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.105
is in the Land of Earth.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.975
I'm sure Mitsuki just went with
them to find that answer.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:38.912
And if that is the case, even
if I gotta enter the Land of
Earth...

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:41.348
I'm not gonna go back till I see
Mitsuki!

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:45.986
Aw, man, what a drag!

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:49.356
If that's the way it is, I have
a plan.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.526
Cho-Cho, Inojin... You'll go
back to the village for now.

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:54.862
Huh?!

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:58.498
But we've always stuck
together through all the tough
times, haven't we?! Right?!

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:01.635
I really don't get why we have
to do this!

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:05.439
That's right! I don't like
this! It feels like you're
ordering us off the battlefield!

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.907
You're wrong.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.508
Uh?

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.980
As things stand, we won't be
able to get to Mitsuki before he
crosses into the Land of Earth.

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:17.084
And that's why we have to let
the village know there's a
chance Mitsuki's innocent.

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:20.153
Hey, it's not a "chance!"
Mitsuki is innocent!

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:22.456
Look, just stay calm, all right?

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:26.260
Shouldn't we tell the village
before Mitsuki crosses into the
Land of Earth?

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:27.961
While he's thought to be a
criminal?

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:28.462
Yeah, but-!

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.666
Just hear me out. Moegi Sensei
should be back at the village by
now.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.137
Once our dads know what's going
on, they'll take action.
They'll come and get us.

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.140
And Mitsuki, too. It'll be easy
for 'em.

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:43.177
The fact that they haven't done
so already just means...

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.811
Hmm.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:48.849
You think that they're...
waiting to see what happens out
here?

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:54.354
Yeah, probably... That's exactly
the reason why we have to notify
the village about Mitsuki.

00:05:54.388 --> 00:05:57.658
And the two of you guys are the
perfect ones to handle that job!

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.527
Oh, I see now. I got it.

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.431
Well, okay! I am the type of
woman that just can't refuse
when...

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.767
someone is depending on me as
much as that.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.637
I'm sorry, Sarada. Guess I
won't be able to go with you
after all.

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.308
Don't be. It's okay. Besides,
I totally agree with Shikadai.

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.643
Now that's all decided, we'd
better hurry.

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:17.811
I'm counting on you.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.147
You guys be careful.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.116
That's supposed to be my line to
you, Sarada. [chuckles]

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:26.353
[chuckles]

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.889
Promise me you're gonna convince
them that Mitsuki's innocent.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:30.490
Just leave it to us!

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:31.325
Yeah, all right!

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:36.530
(Naruto) And how's Yurito doing?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.336
We were able to save his life,
<i>but...</i>

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.240
If only I'd realized sooner...

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:50.177
[sighs]

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:56.183
It seems the explosion occurred
right when the genjutsu Yurito
was under was released.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.185
What kind of jutsu was it?

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.020
Detonating Clay.

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:01.488
[gasps]

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.658
The Forbidden Jutsu of the
Hidden Stone.

00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:10.531
They must've used the genjutsu
to control Yurito and obtain
intel on Mitsuki...

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:14.334
They've probably been digging
for highly classified intel for
a long time now...

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.737
Seems so...

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.407
And it looks like because of
their efforts, they've managed
to dig really deep.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.643
But there's something bothering
me.

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:24.011
And what is that?

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.849
If they took this much time in
order to get Mitsuki away from
the village...

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:31.318
...just what exactly is their
end goal?

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:33.320
Would you like me
to look into it?

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:33.820
<i>(Naruto) No.</i>

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:34.521
Uh?

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.258
We know that the Hidden Stone
shinobi are our enemy.

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:41.028
So now we're gonna have to go
with a frontal attack.

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:51.638
Once we cross this wasteland,
we'll be in the Land of Earth.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.341
Hm?

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:05.519
Hey, look!

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.489
What's that a drawing of?

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:10.524
<i>It's my house!</i>

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:12.526
Hm.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.430
Hey...! Once you enter the Land
of Earth...

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:21.101
It'll mean that you've
officially betrayed the Hidden
Leaf, Mitsuki!

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:24.004
I wonder... what does betrayal
feel like?

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.506
[gasps]

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:30.677
Humans have all sorts of
feelings that I wouldn't
understand, right?

00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.146
It's all so
mysterious.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.749
Isn't it? Isn't it?

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.317
<i>(Kokuyou) How trivial...</i>

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:40.487
Huh? You don't agree, Kokuyou?

00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:44.157
It's time for you to shut up,
Sekiei...

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.526
<i>We're already late.</i>

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:48.195
Let's go.

00:08:57.171 --> 00:08:59.973
Did you mess up, Kirara?

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:04.344
Kokuyou and Sekiei are late,
after all. So is that... your
fault?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.684
Shut up! They're not all fools
over on that side, you know!

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:15.522
Anyway, I got rid of the Leaf
Trackers on the way, so that
evens it all out, right?

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:20.627
You don't need to make excuses
to me. It's up to Lord Ku to
make that judgment.

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:24.498
[grunts] Uh?

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:35.976
Lord Ku! How do you do? Um...

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:39.479
Don't be worried. We still have
time.

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:43.951
That's right. Once
Orochimaru's experiment finally
arrives...

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.353
everything will work out just
fine.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:59.032
Soon my long-cherished wish will
come true...

00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:02.636
Huh?!

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:03.570
Someone's there!

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:04.171
Wait what?!

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:09.142
Hey, those guys look like our
jonin.

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:11.011
But something's weird.

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:14.648
Hmph!

00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:17.184
Huh?

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:21.355
Wha- what happened to them?!

00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:24.925
So... what do we do?

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:25.692
Uhh.

00:10:32.533 --> 00:10:37.171
[heavy breathing]

00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:42.176
[heavy breathing]

00:10:43.577 --> 00:10:45.279
[grunts]

00:10:53.554 --> 00:10:58.692
It's better for you to die
here... than to struggle so
disgracefully to live.

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:00.827
[gasps]

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.597
You're so merciless, aren't you,
Kokuyou?

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.068
Well... he probably couldn't
return to the Land of Earth
anyway.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.137
But what was that creature?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.672
They're called Akuta.

00:11:12.372 --> 00:11:13.173
Akuta, huh?

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:17.411
They're created by a Forbidden
Jutsu from the Land of Earth.

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:21.281
That one just now had reached
the end of his life.

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:22.282
The end...?

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.687
I explained it before, didn't I?
That we were created by Lord Ku.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.024
We aren't able to live as long
<i>as humans do.</i>

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:32.526
Hm.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:40.701
But! There's one thing that
will allow us to live in just
the same way as humans!

00:11:42.336 --> 00:11:43.170
It's you!

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.638
Uh?

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:46.740
Yeah! Lord Ku thinks you're-

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:48.175
That's enough, Sekiei.

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.676
What now?!

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:52.646
Don't tell him anything else.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:55.682
What's the big deal? There's
nothing wrong with telling him!

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:58.685
Don't. We simply can't trust
him.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.157
Oh well, I'll tell you more some
other time.

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:06.360
Yes, I'd like to know. Please
do.

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:11.365
You know what? I've really
taken quite a liking to you!

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.033
[taken back]

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:17.504
This is what humans do when they
see eye-to-eye, right?

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:22.376
[taken back] Uh.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:23.510
[chuckles]

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:27.881
<i>(KOKUYOU) Let's go.</i>

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:29.016
Hm?

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.036
<i>(Boruto) What is this?</i>

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:52.039
Well it hasn't been
here long...

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.174
Was there a little kid out here
or something?

00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:57.010
Well, it definitely looks like a
kid drew it.

00:12:57.044 --> 00:13:00.380
[chuckles] Then again, your
drawings don't look that much
better...

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:02.783
Hey, c'mon! You know that isn't
true! My drawings are just-

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:03.550
<i>Enough.</i>

00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:05.352
Hm?

00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:07.621
We can't actually know for sure
who drew that.

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:11.625
But we do know that they passed
through here shortly before us.

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:13.727
Maybe we'll be able to find some
kind of clue...

00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:19.233
The border's up ahead. We have
to stop them before they cross
it.

00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:21.034
Yeah, you're right.

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:24.071
After all, we've come this far.

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:25.706
That's true.

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:28.375
I'm gonna see Mitsuki no matter
what!

00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:41.054
Huh?

00:13:42.256 --> 00:13:42.723
Mirai!

00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:46.026
I heard all about Mitsuki.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:50.697
Oh. Yeah. It seems the guards
at the gate were attacked by
Hidden Stone shinobi.

00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:53.200
No, I wasn't talking about that.

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.903
I meant Mitsuki being
Orochimaru's son.

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:56.770
Hm.

00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:58.372
I gotta say, I was shocked.

00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:02.209
I mean, Orochimaru's our
enemy, right?

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:05.546
(Mirai) He killed our grandpa...

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:15.389
I know it all happened before I
was born and I only heard it
from my mom...

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:19.359
But even so, Orochimaru tried to
destroy the Hidden Leaf
Village...

00:14:19.393 --> 00:14:24.097
That's right. But our
grandfather protected it, though
he had to give his life to do
so.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.008
Sealing Jutsu: Reaper Death
Seal!

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:38.545
[sinister chuckle]

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:45.986
Yours is an obsession... This
need to drown yourself in
Jutsu...

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:48.622
And for this transgression you
shall be punished!

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:51.859
I shall take away all the jutsu
you hold so dear!

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:55.562
Impossible... You wouldn't
dare!?!

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:07.541
(Konohamaru) The Third Hokage,
<i>Hiruzen Sarutobi...</i>

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:11.211
...respected by everyone in the
<i>village...</i>

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.081
An amazing shinobi...

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:18.218
So do you hate Mitsuki now?

00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:19.319
Hm.

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:23.624
Since he's the son of Orochimaru
who did that to our grandpa...

00:15:23.657 --> 00:15:28.195
I don't! I consider Mitsuki to
be a crucial member of Team
7...

00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:29.730
...just like Boruto and Sarada.

00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:31.665
But...

00:15:31.698 --> 00:15:32.399
Hm?

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:38.372
Being here, doing nothing at
all... puts useless thoughts
in my head.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.039
That's all.

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:46.213
Kurotsuchi...

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:50.384
What's up? It's unusual for
you to call me like this.

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:53.887
I'd like to ask you something.
As Hokage to Tsuchikage...

00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:55.355
(Kurotsuchi) So formal! What is
<i>it?</i>

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:56.089
Well...

00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:00.661
The day after the Five Kage
Summit, a guard at our gate
was attacked.

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:03.997
(Kurotsuchi) C'mon! First, the
incident during the Chunin Exams
<i>and now this!</i>

00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:05.232
What's going on in the Leaf?!

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:07.501
[chuckles] Please, don't go
there, all right?

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:08.535
<i>(Kurotsuchi) Go on...</i>

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:14.208
For quite a while somebody was
using genjutsu to control one of
our shinobi.

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:18.212
And not only that... Using the
intel they managed to obtain...

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:21.515
(Naruto) ...they took one of our
<i>genin and ran off with him.</i>

00:16:21.548 --> 00:16:26.620
Oh? Not that long ago, this kind
of thing was relatively
commonplace.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:33.961
But these days, it's quite rare.
All right, so, which village is
behind it?

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.028
You're not--!

00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:37.397
They were Hidden Stone shinobi.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.670
To make an accusation like that,
I presume you have some
pretty solid evidence?

00:16:43.704 --> 00:16:46.540
I do. The testimony of the guard
who was attacked.

00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:49.376
I find it really hard to
believe.

00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:52.212
Listen to me,

00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:55.449
The trackers we sent out are
just about to reach the border
of the Land of Earth.

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:58.218
I need a favor.

00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:01.855
Let our shinobi into your
territory so they can
investigate.

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:04.658
No. Sorry, but I can't allow
that.

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.460
(Naruto) (gasp) Hey look-!

00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:10.664
(Kurotsuchi) I can't arbitrarily
give you permission. You're
Hokage. You understand, right?

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:13.567
<i>(Naruto) (sigh) Yeah...</i>

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:19.473
If it's all as you say, once
the shinobi who did this
enter our land...

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:20.674
we'll capture them.

00:17:22.176 --> 00:17:25.179
Of course, we'll seize your
genin, too. And we'll notify
you right away.

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:28.382
(Naruto) Okay. Now... I have one
<i>more favor to ask.</i>

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:29.716
What's that?

00:17:31.552 --> 00:17:33.954
(Naruto) Well, you see... Boruto
<i>and Sarada are pursuing the</i>
<i>genin...</i>

00:17:33.987 --> 00:17:35.956
And they should be heading your
<i>way.</i>

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:37.858
Man, that kid's hopeless, isn't
he?

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.862
Yeah. Fine. If we find them,
we'll take them into custody,
too.

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.797
And then send them back to
the Leaf.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.199
I'm sorry to trouble you.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.169
(Kurotsuchi) First, we'll do our
own thorough investigation into
<i>these shinobi...</i>

00:17:49.203 --> 00:17:51.839
...and see if they truly are
from the Hidden Stone.

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:56.877
Depending on what we find,
we'll then consider authorizing
entry for your shinobi.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.846
(Naruto) I'm counting on you,
<i>Kurotsuchi.</i>

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:00.380
Well, I'll do all that I can...

00:18:01.048 --> 00:18:02.216
(Naruto) You're a lifesaver...

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:06.086
Lady Tsuchikage?

00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:07.554
[sigh]

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:13.227
[sigh]

00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:16.363
So, what's the story?

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:18.232
Officially, nothing happened at
all...

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:23.203
Well... it seems all we can do
is leave it in her hands for
now.

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:32.446
[groans]

00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:33.080
What's up?

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.381
I can't make contact.

00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:35.382
Again?

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.551
I wonder what could be going
on...

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:39.286
[gasps]

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:41.221
[gasps]

00:18:41.255 --> 00:18:42.055
Hey!

00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:46.026
Damn it! Keep your guard up!

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:46.560
Yes, sir!

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:48.862
[growls]

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:50.063
[grunts]

00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:55.369
[fighting]

00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:58.539
Huh? [gasps]

00:18:58.572 --> 00:18:59.506
What are these things?!

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.374
I have no idea!

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:04.344
[screams]

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:06.446
Stop! No!

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.714
<i>[screams]</i>

00:19:21.562 --> 00:19:22.229
[grunt]

00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:25.232
Wait!

00:19:29.203 --> 00:19:31.839
Uh! What is that weird thing?!

00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:33.106
This is--!

00:19:35.042 --> 00:19:36.376
<i>Hey, that's Mitsuki's-!</i>

00:19:37.044 --> 00:19:38.045
What's going on?!

00:19:41.882 --> 00:19:42.382
[gasp]

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:44.551
No way! I won't let you have it!

00:19:48.055 --> 00:19:50.290
I've seen it before. It's
like...

00:19:50.324 --> 00:19:53.293
the thing that attacked
Mitsuki's snake near the Aun
Gate.

00:19:53.327 --> 00:19:55.896
I don't completely understand
what's going on here...

00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:59.700
How can something like that even
<i>move?</i>

00:19:59.733 --> 00:20:03.670
Hold on... if you saw the same
thing in the Hidden Leaf
Village, then...

00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:07.040
Then this thing is connected to
Mitsuki and the Hidden Stone
shinobi.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.378
It means they passed
through this way.

00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:14.081
And if the one we just found was
all smashed up like that...

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:16.350
What...?

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.285
Maybe it fought with Mitsuki!

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.553
[gasps]

00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:20.053
Let's hurry!

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.731
Something wrong?

00:20:31.732 --> 00:20:32.633
Pursuers.

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:33.700
Huh?

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:37.538
Take him and go on ahead. I'll
manage with the Akuta.

00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:38.539
But...

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.544
Just remember: you can't trust
him.

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:45.479
It's fine, just go.

00:20:45.512 --> 00:20:46.046
[sighs]

00:21:02.396 --> 00:21:03.230

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:08.302
Hey! Let go of him!

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:12.105
[grunts]

00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:20.347
It appears that I'm not trusted,
after all.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.549
Kokuyou's just the suspicious
type.

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:26.220
But I'm...

00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:28.722
You're what?

00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:30.224
Nothing. Let's hurry.

00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:35.395
[gasps]

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:41.668
Mitsuki?!

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:43.837
Wait!

00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:44.705
Hold up, Boruto!

00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:49.209
This is...

00:21:51.044 --> 00:21:52.379
What happened here?!

00:21:54.214 --> 00:21:55.449
<i>(KOKUYOU) Children?</i>

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:56.049
[gasps]

00:21:58.051 --> 00:21:59.720
Are you trackers, too?

[grunts]

00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:49.696
<i>(SHIKADAI) Who is this guy?</i>
Did he seriously beat all those
<i>shinobi at their own game?</i>

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.367
(SARADA) Be careful, you two.
He's clearly a fierce enemy.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:59.373
(BORUTO) Yeah? Well, so what?
Mitsuki's just up ahead! I'm not
<i>gonna get held up here!</i>

00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:04.344
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "Reunion with</i>
<i>Mitsuki"</i>

00:24:04.378 --> 00:24:06.980
<i>(BORUTO) I'll tear through</i>
<i>anyone who gets in my way!</i>

00:24:07.014 --> 00:24:09.316
<i>I will get to Mitsuki, no</i>
