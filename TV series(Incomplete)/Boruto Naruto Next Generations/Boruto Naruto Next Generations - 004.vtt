(Kid)
Awesome!

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:28.729
Just leave it to Konohamaru!
That's a perfect Summoning
Jutsu.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.298
The reason is he's the grandson
of the Third Hokage...

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:36.269
...the genius ninja who was the
<i>pride of the Hidden Leaf.</i>

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.039
I'd go anywhere at all for you.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.007
Just call, and I'll be
there in a jiffy!

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.711
As always, thank you, Gamagoro!

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.781

Uh... Please! Take turns, okay?

00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:01.094
Don't let that flattery go to
your head, all right, Big
Bro Konohamaru?

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.129
Hey, don't mock your elders!

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.167
And don't call me "Big
Bro." When we're in
class, call me "Sensei!"

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.436
When you say it with a goofy
look like that, it's not super
convincing‐

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.038
Hey! Don't be so rude to Sensei!

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.175
Yeah, you're being way
too familiar with him!

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.543
N‐No! What I meant was‐‐

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:19.145
It's so embarrassing when a man
as an inferiority complex.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.014
Really, you've
got it all wrong!

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:25.285
Besides, you lose hands
down when it comes to
character and to looks.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:28.021
...I don't blame you
for being jealous.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.323
It was just a joke!

Huh...?

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:48.041
That jutsu won't work unless
you first sign your name in
the scroll and enter into a
contract with the animal.

You can't use the Summoning
Jutsu without a contract with a
Summoning Animal, a deal that
must be signed in blood.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:50.330
Once you've done that, you can
summon the animal at anytime,
anywhere, right to you!

Do you understand,
Boruto Uzumaki?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:57.237
So if I write my name down, I'll
be able to summon that giant
frog, too?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.905
You're still stuck on <i>that?</i>

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.374
<i>(Shino)</i>
<i>You can't make a</i>
<i>contract that easy.</i>

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:05.245
The hard part's getting a
Summoning Animal to listen to
you in the first place.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.447
Mutual trust is the most
important thing.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.053
If there's acceptance on both
sides of the deal, then an
animal can become a very
valuable partner!

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:18.058
All the same, it's still too
soon for you to try summoning
an animal.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.661
We'll begin summoning
Ninja Tools.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.332
(students)
Impressed gasps.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.969
[sigh] We're starting
with that?

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:32.773
What do you say, Namida?
Good thing we didn't
start with frogs, huh?

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:35.942
Mhm! I really can't stand
touching frogs at all!

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:39.345
Aren't Summoning Animals usually
slimy and seriously creepy?

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.082
Reptiles aren't the only
Summoning Animals around.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:46.086
There are monkeys, like Lord
Third's or dogs like Lord
Sixth's!

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:50.323
Hmm... Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that my mom summoned a weasel
once.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.958
I wouldn't mind a dog.

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:53.059
A cat'd be nice, too!

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:55.929
Yeah, any animal that's cute
would be better, right?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:05:00.000
Oh, come on! A Summoning Animal
isn't like some kind of a pet!

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.702
Who cares what it looks like?!

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:04.938
Yeah! If it's strong,
then it can be ugly.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:09.042
Oh, I know! How about a snake?
'Cause they're cool, and they
seem really strong, too!

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.545
What I want is a scorpion!

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.847
Nope! Pick a gorilla for power!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.484
If you want to creep out an
enemy based on looks, how
about a spider?

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.522
Come on, really?
Bugs and snakes?

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:24.424
Ugh, boys are just so
childish at this age...

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:28.094
Gimme a break. There's no point
in summoning an animal that's
weak.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:32.899
Maybe, but we're in an age where
looking stylish and cool counts,
too.

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:36.469
You should talk. No one's
further from stylish n'
cool than you, Chubs.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:42.308
Whatever! I may be a little bit
chubby, but my moves are totally
stylish and cool.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.345
All of you! Begin your Ninja
Tool summoning train‐‐

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:50.116
Oh, hey! Next time, all of us
should summon a giant animal
together. Huh?!

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.185
Hey, that sounds
pretty awesome!

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:53.386
You really think
we can do it?

<i>(Sarada)</i>
<i>Don't try anything stupid.</i>

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:59.660
Whenever you guys do stupid

lumped in along with you.

We don't do stupid things, ya
know! What's your deal?

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.998
Of course you do! You cause
trouble nearly every single
time!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:10.303
That's why all of the other
students are always saying that
our class is the one that's full
of problem kids.

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:12.038
Is that true?

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.907
I heard rumors...

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.077
<i>...One of us destroyed a</i>
<i>Hokage's Great Stone Face</i>
<i>on day one...</i>

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.780
... <i>and we had that incident</i>
<i>in the training hall...</i>

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:22.482
I gotta say our class
does stand out...

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.885
And you guys broke the
shuriken target, didn't you?

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:29.823
Plus, when it's time to clean
up, you're always playing, so
all of us end up having to do
most of the work!

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:33.459
Yeah, come to think of
it, you're always causing
trouble for us!

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:36.029
It's not like you girls
are totally innocent.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:40.934
You're always gossiping on about
something and wasting your lives
on silliness.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:46.640
Oh, please! Our "girl talk" is
different than the vulgar things
that you boys are always talking
about!

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:50.511
Man, what a drag! We say one
thing, you say another.

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:53.279
Okay, whatever. Just don't
do anything childish.

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:55.816
How are we childish?
What's that mean?!

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.885
Just like that! Getting all
riled up is childish!

00:06:58.919 --> 00:06:59.252
What was that?!

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:00.320
Humph!

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:02.022
All right! That's enough!

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:06.993
Now, listen, you guys... Don't
forget that we're still in
class right now!

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:08.328
‐Humph!
‐Humph!

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.169
[grunt]

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:19.673
Even in this era, there are so
many who're eager to become
ninja.

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:21.808
And they have so
much energy!

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:24.144
Almost too much energy,
if you ask me!

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:31.184
Well, from what I've heard‐ and
remember‐your generation was
full of rivalry and competition.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:36.957
<i>Sasuke, Sakura, Shikamaru</i>

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.626
And Lord Seventh, too. You all
left your mark for posterity

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.664
The determination of not wanting
to lose matures a person.

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:48.301
Yes, I see...

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:51.304
(Inojin)
Hey... you and Sarada were
childhood friends, right?

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.273
What?! Really?!

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.843
Our parents are just friends
from way back when. There's
nothing more to it than that.

00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:59.513
It's not like we actually like
each other, you know?

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.182
Your relationship with her sure
seems like a real drag.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:06.920
Look, forget about that, all
right?! Let's just go eat!

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:09.923
<i>(Boruto / Sarada)</i>
<i>A yakisoba bun please!</i>

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:11.792
[groans]

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.360
(Both)
Please, ma'am!
A yakisoba bun!

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:15.629
[groans]

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:19.533
Sorry! But I'm afraid that I
only have one left!

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:23.670
I always get a yakisoba bun from
here every time they have them,
ya know.

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:28.274
Yeah, I'm well aware of
that, believe me‐because
you always smell like them.

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.110
Well, since you know
that, this bun‐

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:31.678
is mine, and that's that.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:33.614
How does that make
any kind of sense?!

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:37.483
It's simple! Since you always
eat them, all the more reason
to try a different one.

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:41.988
Not gonna happen! Next to
hamburgers, the yakisoba bun
here is my favorite!

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.224
I just don't feel right
unless I eat one, you know?

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:49.162
To be honest, since you're
always causing trouble, maybe
it's better if you "don't feel
right" for a change.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:54.234
But besides all that, ever since
I heard this bun was good, I've
been dying to try it!

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:59.272
Um, ma'am? It seems like you
sold out of these buns really
quickly today. How come?

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:02.375
Yeah, you're right. There are
usually a lot more left.

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:07.180
Oh, earlier, a very hungry
customer came by and bought
most of them.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.215
Hold on. That means...

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:11.885
(Cho‐Cho)
Sarada...

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.955
What?! Aw, come on, did
you buy them all, Cho‐Cho?!

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:18.358
It's only fair that you share
a couple of those with us.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:22.763
I can't. I have to eat
this much after class or
I'm just not myself.

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.497
[munch]

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.633
Doesn't seem too efficient...

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.272

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.243
Look, that last yakisoba
bun is mine!

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:40.581
Normally, a gentleman would
agree to defer to a lady.

00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:42.549
Yeah, well, maybe if
you were a "Lady".

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:43.984
What is that
supposed to mean!?

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:45.451

don't fight, you guys!

00:09:56.229 --> 00:10:01.434
No! It's okay. We're all on
edge after what happened this
morning.

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:05.506
I say that we just let 'em have
it out. It'll clear the air.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:06.973
Right, Boruto?

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:19.385
[freaked out] Oh,
what should we do?

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.458
Stop right there!

Earth Style: Mud Wall!

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.561
[gasps]

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:36.229
Now! Go! Hurry!

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:39.165

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:46.507
Iwabe Yuino: He was a problem,
but lately his true
nature‐determined and
tenacious‐is coming through.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.641
<i>He's progressing well.</i>

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.375
Hey, thanks, Iwabe!

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:51.111
Sure!

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.550
<i>[crash]</i>

Aw man, I hate exerting myself
when I don't have to...

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:11.264
<i>(Shino)</i>
Cho‐Cho Akimichi. She's hard to
motivate, but she definitely has
<i>ability.</i>

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:14.267
<i>...Well... this'll be</i>
<i>interesting...</i>

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:16.837
Wait, hold on!

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.106
What a drag! Shadow
Paralysis Jutsu!

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.111
<i>(Shino)</i>
Shikadai Nara. He's mastered the
Shadow User Jutsu passed on by
<i>his father.</i>

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:27.213
I only did this because the
other asked...

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.616
<i>(Shino)</i>
<i>Now, can he sustain it?</i>

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.652
What's going on!?

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:34.688
[students coughing]

00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:40.126
Oh, and I forgot to mention.
I've laid a few traps throughout
the school grounds.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.361
What?!

00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:44.598
The reason is to heighten the
tension as much as possible.

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:50.904
Eventually, you'll all be
working in three‐man teams.
This training will come in handy

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.939
to teach you‐‐ Uh...

00:12:53.674 --> 00:12:57.277
[panting]

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.181
Damn it! What is Shino Sensei
thinking with all of this stuff,
anyway?!

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.984
At this rate, the school is
gonna get destroyed!

00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:06.820
A lot of the others have
already dropped out.

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:09.289
Looks like we're the only ones
left on the boys' team.

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:16.630
<i>(Shino)</i>
<i>Metal Lee. He always gives</i>
<i>everything his all.</i>

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:19.900
But regretfully, he's lacking.

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:23.537
I‐ I will r‐right here

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.771
Metal, are you okay?

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:27.140
Oh, uh... Of course!

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:59.472
[grunt]

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:02.342
It's a new electronic lock.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:04.044
Leave it to me.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.281
Can you do it?

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:11.785
Yup, With these models, I just
have to hack into the system,
and.

<i>Alright!</i>

We'd better hurry!

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:20.894
No! Hold on!

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:24.898
I just had a really good idea...

[grunt]

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:37.511

Is this another one
of Sensei's traps?!

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:38.779
So what do we do?!

00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:40.480
Ugh, dammit.

00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:43.950
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:50.557
[horrified screams]

00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:53.594
That's how you hurt opponents
without dirtying your hands, am
I right, Shikadai?

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:56.763
Say it like that, and people
will take it the wrong way...

00:14:56.797 --> 00:14:59.432

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:00.801

00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:13.079
Uh oh...

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.652
I still can't seem to get it to
work like my Dad's
does...

00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:21.522
Now's the time.

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:25.826
[gasps]

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:29.863
Did you guys seriously believe
that you could get away from us?

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:31.131
They split up!

00:15:31.164 --> 00:15:33.199
Leave it to the girls to think
of cutting us off.

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.401
C'mon, let's just charge them!

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.904

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.660
Watch out!

00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:04.330
I leave the rest... to you!

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:06.633
<i>(Shikadai)</i>
<i>There's no way we can</i>

<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>I won't let everyone's</i>
<i>deaths be in vain!</i>

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:12.739
But... no one's died...
So, what now!?

00:16:12.773 --> 00:16:16.910
We can't go through the
building. We can't defeat that
many girls.

00:16:16.943 --> 00:16:22.883
But if they're inside the
building... We'll reach the
rooftop from the outside.

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:24.751
Do you mean use the
emergency stairway?

00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:28.622
No, we can't open it from the
outside without Denki.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:32.058
Inojin, can you use your
Super Beast Scroll?

00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:33.727
Eh, I don't think so.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.796
I see..

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:42.903
Okay... Boruto. Inojin and I
will be decoys, while you get to
the rooftop from the outside.

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:44.538
Just leave it to me, ya know!

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:48.374
But even if he makes it
to the roof, how will he
fight off all the girls?

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:51.277
You think Shadow
Clones will be enough?

00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:53.814
All right, then... I'll use
Summoning Jutsu.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.717
<i>There should be some scrolls</i>
<i>inside this prep room...</i>

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.987
(Shikadai)
Summoning's impossible!
We can't summon anything
good at our level.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:03.524
But we still have to
try, don't we?

00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:08.394
Look, don't worry! Even I summon
a small frog, it'll still freak
them all out.

00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:11.798
[sigh] All right, let's
get this plan started.

00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:18.038

Well?

<i>beyond this gate!</i>

00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:23.877
[grunt]

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.445
Should we just blow it up?

00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:28.281
I don't think we should damage
the school any further...

00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:30.784
[sigh]

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.793

Boruto's outside! He'll
get the flag first!

Hey, whatever
happened to the flag?

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.152

<i>You guys... You sure are</i>

I'm really sorry, Cho‐Cho.
I didn't mean to put you in
danger.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:13.113
There wasn't a rule that said
Summonings were supposed to be
prohibited, so

00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:15.516
I guess it's okay, really...

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:19.152
I'm assuming that you have no
complaints that we won, right?

00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:23.724
No... we'll do whatever
you tell us to do...

00:20:23.757 --> 00:20:25.526
Well, we have no choice.

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.694

Since you saved me, we're just
gonna take a raincheck on the
prize from this competition.

You did manage to get Cho‐Cho
out of a bad situation.

Yeah, for real. You guys might
not be up to my standards yet...

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:46.246
...but I'll deem you guys
acceptable, just this one time.

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:49.015
You girls were really
strong competitors.

00:20:49.049 --> 00:20:53.086
Well, I guess... that our class
is pretty high‐level, huh?

<i>(Shino)</i>
<i>Boruto's right!</i>

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.589
Huh?

I believe that in time, you'll
all become yakisoba buns.

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:03.930
Yakisoba and bread...
They each taste good by
themselves...

00:21:03.964 --> 00:21:10.704
But then... when combined into
a yakisoba bun... they're even
better!

00:21:10.737 --> 00:21:12.539
In other words...

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:16.743
If you can learn to work
together... you can take on even
the strongest opponents, that
it??

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:18.545
Exactly.

00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:23.016
Seriously?! Why didn't you just
say that right from the start?
What a weird analogy, dude.

00:21:23.049 --> 00:21:27.087
But, hey! Great attempt at that
food metaphor. A for effort!

home.

Oh! How about we go try
the new hamburger that they're
introducing today?

00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:40.300
Sure, sounds good.

need to clean up...
