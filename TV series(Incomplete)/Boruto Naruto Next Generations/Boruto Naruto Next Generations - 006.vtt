00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.014
(Shino)
All right, then... our final
lesson begins right now!

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:19.052
Uhh... Sensei... Are you, like,
mad about something?

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.454
[freaked out sigh]

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:22.923
[grunt]

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:26.993
Listen... I don't know
what you did, but hurry up
and apologize, all right?!

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.295
Sensei's seriously lost it!

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.631
Ya think!?

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:34.635
We're so sorry, Sensei!
Whatever we did, we
really regret it!

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.937
<i>(Shikadai)</i>
<i>You apologize too, Mitsuki!</i>

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.039
<i>(Mitsuki)</i>
<i>Huh? Why am I involved?</i>

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.774
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>Why should I apologize?!</i>

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:45.278
Heh... No, there's no need for
anyone to apologize any more.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:51.985
And the reason why is... that
I'm going to kill all three
of you right now...

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.153
Huh?

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.289
What the‐‐ what did
you just say, Sensei?

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.925
Argh!

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.094
Is this really happening?!

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.068
Oh, wow. I didn't know you
could use them like that.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.970
Now's not the time
to be impressed!

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:14.107
Shino Sensei is coming
after us, for real!

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.579
You gotta to be kidding.

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:22.282
[gasp] Is that what
I think it is...?!

I've had enough of not being
taken seriously by my students
no matter what I do...

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:17.397
...and having all my
hard work backfire.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.266
I've had enough of everything!

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.804
[gasp]

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:27.541
[sinister chuckle] It seems like
everything I was worried about
<i>was a lie...</i>

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:31.211
...But now, I've been
liberated from all of that!

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:36.282
That's right! Just
like these insects!

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:44.257
Tell me how that old saying goes
‐ be careful of the quiet ones?!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.060
This again! Just like
what happened to Metal!

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:48.829
It's what?!

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:52.966
[sigh] We've got to stop him.
Even if it means roughing the
guy up a bit.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:59.239
Stop me? So that's your plan?
And you really think you're
capable?

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.775
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.113
It failed?!

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:08.749
[grunt]

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.483
[gasp]

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:18.158
Boruto! Damn... even if we stop
some of the insects, there's
still too many!

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.594
[freaked out gasps]

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:23.830
It's nothing but a waste of time
trying to teach you kids.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:27.934
<i>Troublemakers who always give</i>
<i>their teacher a hard time.</i>

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.972
<i>Lazy and indifferent ones who</i>
<i>don't want to listen.</i>

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.508
<i>And disruptive outsiders.</i>

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:38.411
So now, I've given up on
bothering to teach you
anything more.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:42.048
And instead... eliminate you!

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.652
Wind Style... Immense
Breakthrough.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.862
[gasp]

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:59.032
I had no idea you could
do something like that!

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:02.202
Where to now?

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:06.740
[insects munching]

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:10.711
Struggle all you want.
Try to do your best...

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:15.181
...But my insects will follow
you everywhere you go...

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:21.254
[panting] I never thought that
this could happen to Shino
Sensei, too.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:25.491
This situation with Shino Sensei
feels different than the others.

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:28.995
He said he was going to kill
us, right? Did he mean that?

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.599
<i>(Shikadai)</i>
<i>He was using his insects</i>
<i>to absorb chakra...</i>

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.035
<i>...He only fights</i>
<i>like that when he's serious.</i>

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:39.239
So, yeah, I think Sensei's
serious about killing us.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:45.245
But if all this is the same as
with Metal, we could try
knocking some sense back into
him.

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:47.080
Trying to do that
would be suicidal.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:52.385
According to my Dad, Shino
Sensei has jonin‐level skills.

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:55.756
Even the three of us
combined are no match.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.194
Well, all right, then... let's
ask another teacher for help.

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:03.029
I don't think
that'll work either.

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:07.200
The Parasitic Insects' chakra
is spreading at an alarming
rate through this forest.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.003
And we are deep in
the middle of it.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:14.040
It's quite likely that they will
locate us long before we will
ever make our way out.

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:19.079
Are you serious?! So, you're
saying we're completely trapped
in here?!

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:24.317
This is all your fault! 'Cause
you made Sensei snap in the
first place!

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.053
And even worse, you had
to get us involved!

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:30.691
Come on! I'm not the only one
who drove him to this point.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.259
Besides, who gets like that
just 'cause of what we did?!

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:39.165
[sigh] So, what exactly is this
shadow thing that only you're
able to see?

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.507
[slurp]
[sigh]

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.412
Oh, hey, Anko...
Where is Shino now?

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:59.052
Hm? According to his schedule...
He should be conducting
extracurricular lessons.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:03.156
I see... He seemed to be
feeling really depressed
yesterday.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.359
I hope that he hasn't been
brooding over things too much.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:08.629
Don't worry, I'm sure
he'll be fine! [munch]

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:15.802
Running around out there in the
woods with his students is bound
to help him to burn off a lot of
his stress.

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.571
I sure hope that's the case...

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:23.777
I'm worried that what I said to
him... might've caused him even
more anguish...

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:37.023
[panting]

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:43.897
[panting]

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.733
What? I'm surprised he hasn't
caught up to us yet...

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.368
I mean‐‐

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.773
Ohhh! Bugs! Bugs!
Bugs! Argh!

00:07:55.976 --> 00:08:00.647
[groan] Idiot. This isn't one
of Shino Sensei's insects.

00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.782
Huh?

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.118
It's so confusing! How
can you even tell?!

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.521
Hm?

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.592
Come on, let's go.

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:15.428
Well in that case, since we
haven't seen Sensei's insects,
it must mean that we've lost
him! Right?

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:18.599
Listen... don't let
your guard down.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:24.304
Yeah, but, come on! We haven't
seen any sign of him for a long
t‐time!

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.106
Huh?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.078
What's the matter now?!

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:34.147
I've found you!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.617
[screaming]

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.686
You shouldn't have
said anything!

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.191
[freaking out] This way!
Other, this way!

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.993
Boruto! A paper bomb!

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.529
Yeah, all right!

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:51.665
[grunt]

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.601
[explosion]

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.905
Did it work?

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:03.109
Even explosions don't
work against them?!

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:05.245
What do we do now?!

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:10.717
Face it, you don't have a
chance. Not if you're up against
my Parasitic Insects!

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:17.558
All you can do is run, just run.
<i>Run until you understand that</i>
<i>it's all in vain.</i>

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:23.697
[panting]

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.701
(Thinking)
<i>They avoided the water?</i>
<i>Does that mean...?</i>

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:31.437
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>Hey, Shikadai!</i>
<i>Hurry up! This way!</i>

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.607
Yeah, okay!

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:37.143
[freaked out]

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:44.384
<i>(Mitsuki)</i>
<i>To be honest, it's kind of a</i>
<i>letdown watching them...</i>

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.053
Let's see if I can
inspire them a bit.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.894
<i>[bird squawking]</i>

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:06.740
I'd forgotten about how it
feels, this sensation of being
in battle.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:12.979
I guess that I was never
actually meant to be an
instructor, after all[laugh]

00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:17.083
<i>[panting breaths]</i>

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.520
(Shikadai)
<i>So where have you been</i>
<i>all this time, then?</i>

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:23.223
I got lost.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:28.194
This is pointless, guys.
There's just no way we
can outrun him.

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:29.530
(Mitsuke)
Hey, Boruto...

00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:33.099
You said this happened to
someone other than Shino
Sensei, too?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.035
Huh...? Oh, yeah.

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:39.740
Before this, there were a couple
guys who started acting weird
like Shino Sensei is now.

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:43.544
<i>And I was able to see this</i>
<i>creepy shadow‐like thing</i>
<i>around them.</i>

00:10:43.577 --> 00:10:48.414
For some reason, I seem to be
the only one who can see it.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:51.451
Oh, I see.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.420
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>I can't pin down why, but I</i>
<i>think he knows something.</i>

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:57.591
Well, anyway, we all better get
outta here and keep moving.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:59.459
No, just stay put.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.395
If we don't have a plan, then
he's just gonna catch us again.

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:07.300
Plus, Boruto, you still haven't
recovered the chakra that was
taken from you earlier.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.369
So what are we
supposed to do?!

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:15.408
If we can't escape... then the
only other choice is... to kill
Shino Sensei.

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:21.982
What? Kill him!? What are you
talking about?! How could we
even do that?!

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.317
After all, that's
his goal, right?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.354
So why's it wrong if we try to
do the same thing to him?

00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:30.190
<i>(Shikadai Thinking)</i>
<i>What is up with this guy!</i>

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:34.494
If we don't do
anything... We're done for.

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:37.330
Yeah, but still, there's some
things that you just don't do!

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.332
Hang on, Boruto.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:44.170
Look, setting aside killing
Sensei. there may be a way to
win, depending on how we go
about it.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.206
Huh?

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:48.174
Haven't you noticed?

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:51.477
<i>Earlier, Sensei didn't</i>
<i>give a thought to how much</i>
<i>chakra he was using.</i>

00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:53.847
<i>He just let the</i>
<i>insects go wild.</i>

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.517
Hey... Yeah, you're right!

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.688
<i>In other words, since Sensei's</i>
<i>snapped, he's lost his usual</i>
<i>presence of mind.</i>

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.057
<i>We can use that to</i>
<i>our advantage.</i>

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:09.563
But if we can't get rid of those
insects, then I don't see how
we're ever gonna get close
enough to do that.

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:11.932
I have a plan in mind.

00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:13.499
What?

00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:20.173
But for it to work... I'm going
to need someone to take on a
dangerous role.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:28.448
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>So, what you're talking</i>
<i>about is a decoy strategy?</i>

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:34.054
That's right. And I think the
transfer student here might be
the perfect choice.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:37.624
Shouldn't the person who
suggests the idea be the decoy?

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:41.027
Unlike the two of us, there's
not a drop of sweat on you...

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:45.932
Considering that you just used
Wind Style, it seems that you
still have chakra left, too.

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:51.738
Oh, I see. I think that's a
good enough reason to send a
comrade to their death.

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:54.074
...But!?

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:59.780
Besides, after seeing how you
extended your arms before, I bet
you still have secret weapons up
your sleeve.

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:02.148
Well, then?

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:04.417
(Thinking)
<i>Boruto may trust you</i>
<i>but I don't.</i>

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.621
<i>And I don't know what</i>
<i>you might be plotting.</i>

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:09.790
<i>Time to me what you're hiding!</i>

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.224
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>Hold on...</i>

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.158
[gasp]

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:15.195
Let me do it. I'll be the decoy!

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:16.329
Huh?

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:19.866
You're right. I haven't
recovered my chakra yet.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.604
But I am still able to
create Shadow Clones!

00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:26.540
You idiot! It's way
too risky for you!

00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:28.542
You could die if
you're not careful!

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:32.513
Look, we drove Sensei to the
tipping point and pushed him
over the edge, right?

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:36.583
I think it's time for me to take
responsibility for my actions.

00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:41.221
And... I also want
to save everyone.

00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:43.590
Boruto...

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:47.661
Everyone...? Then all the more
reason that I'm the perfect
choice.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.696
'Cause if push comes to shove‐

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:56.036
That's not it. By "everyone" I
mean Shino Sensei, but I also
mean you, Mitsuki.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:14:01.141
I'm not gonna give up until the
end. I won't let anyone die!

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:08.481
I'll soon find out...
if he's my sun.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.383
[gasp]

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:15.255
I understand. But even so,
there's something that I
want you to let me do.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.292
<i>[waterfall crashing]</i>

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:31.738
[sinister chuckle] It seems
you've finally given up and are
prepared to meet your fate,
Boruto!

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:35.776
Yeah, right! I'm just done being
chased by you, so instead of
running...

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:39.713
...I'm gonna take you
down right

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:40.947
[grunt]

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.554
[shouting]

00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:52.526
That's the oldest trick in the
book. And this one's a shadow
clone too...

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.161
As is this one...

00:14:57.831 --> 00:15:00.000
[scream]

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.868
And the real one...

00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:03.169
[gasp]

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.972
Same trick again!
[gasp]

00:15:06.807 --> 00:15:10.911
[explosion]

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:13.747
[gasp] What!?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.551
No you don't! Not when
I'm this close!

00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:24.558
Looks like we failed.

00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:29.495
[grunts]

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:34.735
[sinister chuckle] At least
you're both keeping me
entertained!

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.170
But what's happened
to the other one?

00:15:37.203 --> 00:15:39.272
Huh?

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:44.144
What's wrong, transfer student?
Aren't you going to help them?

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:48.949
Well, whatever. I'll
leave you for later on.

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:54.120
Let's review, shall we? Your
Shadow Paralysis was to drag me
into the water.

00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:57.223
You figured the insects could be
<i>contained in water, right?</i>

00:15:57.257 --> 00:16:00.226
<i>I can see right through a</i>
<i>half‐baked plan like that.</i>

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.731
[chuckle] I guess we're gonna
find out if that's true, Sensei.

00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:08.735
It looks like you've lost most
of the insects that you can
control.

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:10.303
[gasp]

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.038
Mitsuki, now!

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:16.476
[grunts]

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:20.080
Should've focused more on him!

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.116
[grunts]

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:29.089
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Not a bad strategy. But...</i>

00:16:30.691 --> 00:16:34.127
<i>You didn't think I had any</i>
<i>insects that could be used</i>
<i>underwater, huh?</i>

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.965
<i>Don't underestimate my clan's</i>
<i>Parasitic Insects!</i>

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:41.568
Lightning Style: Snake
Lightning!

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:49.810
[grunt]

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:55.348
Lightning Style should be able
to penetrate his body while he's
sending out the insects.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:58.885
That's true even if he
is a jonin.

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:01.121
[gag]

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:09.195
(Thinking)
I didn't think there was any way
to stop him other than killing
<i>him...</i>

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:20.774
<i>I didn't know you</i>
<i>could fight this way.</i>

00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:27.213
Oh, It seems that I've used up
way more than I anticipated...

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:32.285
<i>Oh well, I don't really care</i>
<i>either way....</i>

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:43.630
<i>(Boruto thinking)</i>
<i>Don't give up!</i>

00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:48.569
Boruto... you're‐‐

00:17:48.602 --> 00:17:52.138
<i>No...! No, the</i>
<i>current's too strong!</i>

00:17:56.977 --> 00:17:58.879
What did I do...?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:03.383
[grunt] Oh no...!

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.722
[gasping]

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:14.160
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>My chakra is... but if i give</i>
<i>up now, those two will...</i>

00:18:17.063 --> 00:18:21.301
[struggling grunts]

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:23.804
Damnit! There's no choice‐‐!

00:18:23.837 --> 00:18:26.006
Wait! I'll go!

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.307
Sensei!

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:34.314
<i>Summoning Jutsu.</i>

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:37.483
Boruto!

00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:39.319
[grunt]

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.729
[gasp]

00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:55.736

00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:02.943
[sputter]

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.680
Shino Sensei!

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:11.484
<i>(Shino)</i>
<i>I'm very sorry, all of you.</i>

00:19:11.518 --> 00:19:14.054
Shino Sensei...

00:19:14.087 --> 00:19:16.923
Clearly, of course... I
wasn't exactly myself.

00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:21.127
To think I'd attack the very
students that I should be
protecting!

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.996
Like you said, you
really weren't yourself!

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:29.836
That's right. I only vaguely
remember it but it's like I had
no sense of reality...

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.539
<i>It felt as if I was possessed</i>
<i>by something...</i>

00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:34.875
[grunt]

00:19:34.908 --> 00:19:38.779
Even if I wasn't myself, what I
did to you is unforgivable.

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:42.115
I'll tell the administration
it was my fault.

00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:45.485
And once I do that I'll
resign from the Academy.

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.287
Uh! But, hold on a second!

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.991
Nobody really got hurt. You
don't have to be so dramatic
about it!

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:56.196
And besides, it's our fault for
getting you all worked up in
the first place...

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:57.598
Right, guys?

00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:59.365
Oh, yeah. Right.

00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:04.571
I don't think that any of us
realized just how much all of it
was weighing on your mind...

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:06.006
I'm sorry.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:09.810
(Boruto)
By the way, I had no idea you
were that strong, Shino Sensei!

00:20:09.843 --> 00:20:17.050
[sobbing] You guys, I...

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:18.051
Aw, what's wrong!?

00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:20.153
You're like an
open book, Sensei!

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:21.788
Quiet!

00:20:21.822 --> 00:20:22.856
[laughter]

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.291
Is there anything he can teach
us at this point?

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:32.032
Now I understand...
Maybe there still is...

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:35.268
Hm? Did you just say
something, Mitsuki?

00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:37.871
No, nothing.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.581
Shino... You might not have the
<i>best people skills I've ever</i>
<i>seen...</i>

00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:51.117
...But you never stop trying to
<i>reach out to people.</i>

00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:55.789
And that's the reason why you've
been blessed with such good
friends.

00:20:55.822 --> 00:21:04.264
<i>The spirit of never giving up,</i>
<i>no matter what. That's the</i>
<i>natural gift you have as a</i>
<i>teacher.</i>

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.401
I'm sorry.

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:14.575
...but as to where and when I
initially became psychologically
affected, I have no idea
whatsoever.

00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:19.112
Well, in a sense, I suppose that
it's a blessing in disguise that
you weren't entirely yourself.

00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:26.953
Yeah. If Shino had been normal
and attacked them for real,
Boruto and the others wouldn't
have stood a chance.

00:21:26.987 --> 00:21:28.822
[sigh]

00:21:28.855 --> 00:21:35.195
I gotta thank you, Shino, You're
always doing your very best,
looking out for them.

00:21:35.228 --> 00:21:38.064
It must be tough with a
bunch of difficult kids.

00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:44.605
Naruto! That's true. It's just a
pity that he took after you so
much, isn't it?

00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:48.642
Huh? Yeah, I can't really
argue with that!

00:21:48.675 --> 00:21:50.877
[laughs]

00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:59.119
In any case, we're dealing with
some kind of mysterious power
that can affect even jonin‐class
psyche.

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:04.390
You're right. Looks like
there's a situation brewing in
our village that we can't
ignore.

00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:08.929
I know that you're busy, but do
you think that you could help us
investigate, Shino?

00:22:08.962 --> 00:22:13.800
Absolutely, Lord Seventh.
