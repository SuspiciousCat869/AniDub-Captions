00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.831
Kagura...

00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:14.457
What each of us saw growing up
is completely different.

00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:15.992
[panting]

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:18.595
[grunts]

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:19.662
You can't see it...

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.332
You would never understand!

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.668
[grunting]

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:29.339
[grunts]

00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:31.141
[gasp]

00:00:31.174 --> 00:00:32.809
[grunt and yell]

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:33.042
[gasp]

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:35.212
[satisfied grunt]

00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:25.822
[grunt]

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.291
[grunts]

00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:33.596
[panting and grunt]

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.831
[grunt]

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.101

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:46.476
[grunts]

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:49.312
Ah! Omph!

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.282
Ahhh!

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:52.849
[worried grunt]

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.624
[grunts]

00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:04.261
Give it all you've got, Kagura!

00:03:04.294 --> 00:03:07.764
You haven't begun to tap the
Hiramekarei's power.

00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:09.766
Put more chakra into it.

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:10.833
[hesitant breath]

00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:14.437
Why're you doing what he wants
you to do, anyway?

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:17.840
Didn't you say you're the only
one who can decide how to live
your life, Kagura?

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:21.878
Kagura!

00:03:23.012 --> 00:03:26.083
Yeah... and this is what I've
decided.

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:26.849
[gasp]

00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:31.521
No matter how hard I tried to
reject it, no matter how hard I
resisted,

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:34.324
I could never escape
from the shadow!

00:03:34.357 --> 00:03:35.658
But Mr. Shizuma...

00:03:35.692 --> 00:03:37.660
(SHIZUMA) <i>You're the way you</i>
<i>should be.</i>

00:03:37.694 --> 00:03:38.361
[breath]

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:45.135
One day, very soon we will usher
in a new age. And we will need
warriors just like you.

00:03:45.168 --> 00:03:50.006
I'm here today only because...
he acknowledged me.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:54.311
Oh, give me a break! What he's
doing is declaring war!

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:57.447
And nobody in their right mind
would ever do such a thing!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.684
(KAGURA) Our village has been
warped and tossed around by
history...

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:05.155
It's been forced into...
unwanted situations.

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:09.226
We'll wage war for all those who
could not escape!

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.094
Oh, yeah?

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.497
Okay then, so why do you look
like you're suffering?

00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:17.467
You don't really believe a word
of any of that, do you?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.104
<i>You're not fooling anyone, not</i>
<i>with that expression on your</i>
<i>face!</i>

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:26.609
What happened to that guy who
played Shinobi Bout with us?

00:04:26.643 --> 00:04:29.546
You looked like you were really
enjoying yourself then.

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:34.917
[gasp and whimpering breath]...
Don't talk to me like you know
me!

00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:35.918
[grunt]

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.526
[grunts]

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.597
Three clones is his limit... So
<i>this... is it!</i>

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:56.038
[gasp and grunts]

00:04:56.072 --> 00:04:59.542
I'll never lose to you, not the
way you are now.

00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:03.713
And I am not afraid of a wimpy
sword like that!

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.948
[grunt] Shut up...!

00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:13.756
Ahhh!

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.357
[grunt]

00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:15.892
Ahhh!

00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:17.627
Stop it, you idiot!

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:25.568
[grunting]

00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:30.307
Like I said... That wimpy sword
doesn't scare me a bit!

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:33.310
[whimpered breath]

00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:35.178
[grunt]

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:37.013
[pained grunts]

00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:39.716
(BORUTO) <i>Kagura...</i>

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:40.016
[gasp]

00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:45.722
I don't know what nonsense this
lunatic has been feeding you...

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:50.427
...but all this talk of the
Hokage's son or... Yagura's
grandchild...

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.331
It has nothing to do with us!
We're our own selves!

00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:55.865
[pained grunt]

00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:56.766
(SHIZUMA) <i>Kagura!</i>

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:57.800
[gasp]

00:05:57.834 --> 00:05:58.668
[gasp]

00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:09.446
You are Yagura's grandson, and a
killer. This scar is proof of
that.

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.350
A destiny that's been written in
blood cannot be reversed!

00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:15.118
Mr. Shizuma...

00:06:15.152 --> 00:06:16.319
(BORUTO) <i>He's wrong!</i>

00:06:16.353 --> 00:06:17.053
Huh?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.055
You're not a killer, Kagura.

00:06:20.623 --> 00:06:24.161
Old Man Mizukage wouldn't have
entrusted you with the
Hiramekarei if you were!

00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:25.495
[breath]

00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:29.832
You mean Chojuro? You really
don't know him, do you?

00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:32.802
About all the things he's done
in secret...

00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:34.837
To tip the odds in their favor,

00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:39.842
<i>he and his friends have had</i>
<i>everyone who gets in their</i>
<i>way secretly assassinated.</i>

00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:41.411
<i>one after the other.</i>

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:44.847
No way, Old Man Mizukage would
never do that!

00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:47.884
Oh, trust me, it's the absolute
truth.

00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:50.487
If somebody starts to become an
inconvenience,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.356
they just quietly get rid of
them behind the scenes.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.992
That's how these people operate,
you see.

00:06:56.025 --> 00:06:57.760
But we don't do things that way.

00:06:57.794 --> 00:07:04.234
We'll expose everything and hide
nothing. And we'll create a just
and true future.

00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:06.068
[chuckle]

00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:09.572
[grunt]

00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:17.114
(MITSUKI) <i>A "just and true</i>

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:20.550
Mitsuki!

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:21.918
Hey, Boruto.

00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:23.620
Uh, what're you doing here?

00:07:23.653 --> 00:07:28.591
I have some business with that
man there... Know what this is?

00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:30.127
[groan]

00:07:31.628 --> 00:07:35.465
Someone very sneaky gave this to
me. He picked it up in the Land
of Water.

00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:38.034
It was ever so enlightening, I
must say.

00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:41.704
[murmuring]

00:07:41.738 --> 00:07:46.042
This is proof that you've been
in secret negotiations with the
Land of Waves.

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:48.645
[murmurs]

00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:52.082
And just what was it that you
were planning on doing?

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:55.585
There's a lot more that you're
hiding, now isn't there?

00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:57.554
[murmuring]

00:07:57.587 --> 00:08:03.025
Yes, all who were supporting you
have confessed. They admitted
everything.

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:07.230
Like how you assassinated
anyone who happened to get in
your way.

00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:08.665
W‐what did you say?

00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:09.632
[gasp]

00:08:12.102 --> 00:08:18.040
Anyone that got in your way, you
got rid of. Quietly so that no
one ever found out.

00:08:18.074 --> 00:08:20.343
Does the describe how you've
been doing things?

00:08:20.377 --> 00:08:23.646
So much for exposing everything
<i>and creating a just future.</i>

00:08:24.614 --> 00:08:28.251
Well, not that I really care
either way.

00:08:28.285 --> 00:08:30.320
Is it true, what he's saying?

00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:33.356
Say something!

00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:40.497
[chuckling]

00:08:41.164 --> 00:08:43.633
I need to know...

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:48.805
Don't fret over something so
trivial. It's all part of
preparing for war.

00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:50.207
No way...

00:08:51.474 --> 00:08:53.943
You said we would make right all
the injustices in the village!

00:08:53.976 --> 00:08:56.246
Who cares what the reasons are
behind it?

00:08:56.279 --> 00:09:00.917
All that matters is
that this village returns to
being the Bloody Mist again.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.988
[trembling breath]... Then you
were just going to... use me,
too?

00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:09.726
Well... you're a special case.

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:11.228
Huh?

00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:17.367
I never thought you'd actually
stick around. You see Kagura...

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.305
all I really wanted was to
experience the sword of
Yagura's grandson again.

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:27.043
[inhale] Oh, that sword of yours
hurt so much!

00:09:27.076 --> 00:09:30.147
Just remembering it gives me the
shivers!

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.250
I see, that's what it was...

00:09:33.883 --> 00:09:34.417
Huh?

00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:39.256
So... everything was a lie... Is
that it?!

00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:51.159
Now, now, why the sad face?

00:09:51.193 --> 00:09:55.563
Don't worry, I'll use you until
the very end.

00:09:55.597 --> 00:09:56.798
Unbelievable...

00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:02.237
Tell me, why would you want war
so badly? I just can't
understand that.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:07.842
[chuckle] Why? Because war is
fun! Why else?

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:12.647
Oh, come on, think about it.
Guys who were the best of
friends just yesterday...

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.852
all of a sudden turn on each
other and start killing! Isn't
that wonderful?

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:23.191
That's the kind of place the
Bloody Mist Village is! And it
will never change!

00:10:23.225 --> 00:10:24.159
(BORUTO) <i>Quit messing around!</i>

00:10:24.192 --> 00:10:25.092
[grunt]

00:10:25.127 --> 00:10:26.661
War? Yeah, whatever.

00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:28.863
All you wanna do is go on a
rampage.

00:10:28.896 --> 00:10:32.267
Well, go do it on your own!
Don't drag others into it!

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.802
It's too late, I'm afraid.

00:10:43.945 --> 00:10:50.084
War cannot be averted now! Look
around you! Bloody Mist that's
tinged red!

00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:51.886
[grunt]

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:55.890
You're wrong, this is just a
little scuffle on a field trip!

00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:58.526
I'm not gonna let you make it
any more than that!

00:10:58.993 --> 00:10:59.527
Ha!

00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:10.432
Yeah.

00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:14.001
My jutsu... doesn't work on that
sword.

00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:18.473
I know... the jutsu's getting
absorbed by it. [grunt]

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:24.312
Exactly right. And the chakra
absorbed by my Samehada becomes
mine.

00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:28.850
As long as I have this mist and
Samehada, I'm utterly
invincible.

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:34.856
So, while we're in this mist,
chakra will be absorbed from our
wounds?

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:41.429
[chuckle] What, that wasn't
enough chakra? My, my, you're
such a glutton!

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.631
Why you‐‐!

00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:45.933

00:13:10.425 --> 00:13:12.026
A Water Clone?!

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:15.463
You do know what mist is made
of, don't you?

00:13:17.265 --> 00:13:18.500
Water!

00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:32.480
I'm alright, Boruto.

00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:36.684
You avoided a fatal hit with
your Wind Style...

00:13:37.319 --> 00:13:38.853
[pained grunts and groans]

00:13:38.886 --> 00:13:43.925
But... you also just gave me a
lot more chakra.

00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.762
And now, it's your turn, my
friend!

00:13:47.795 --> 00:13:53.901
No, wait. Kagura. This seems
like the perfect opportunity for
you.

00:13:53.935 --> 00:13:54.536
[gasp]

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:57.772
Please... No more of this.

00:13:57.805 --> 00:14:03.311
[sigh] The blood you inherited
from Yagura is wasted on you.

00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:05.247
This is not
what Kagura wants.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.218
It doesn't matter whether he
wants it or not. He cannot
escape from Yagura's shadow...

00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:13.421
just like you can't escape from
being the son of the Hokage.

00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:14.722
It's called destiny.

00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:20.295
<i>Yagura's grandson will kill</i>
the son of the Hokage before the
<i>memorial stone...</i>

00:14:20.328 --> 00:14:22.430
<i>and light the fire of</i>
<i>revolution!</i>

00:14:22.464 --> 00:14:28.803
Then those who are watching from
within the shadows will rise!...
<i>Isn't that great?!</i>

00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:31.539
<i>Kagura was just a tool for</i>
<i>this purpose.</i>

00:14:32.207 --> 00:14:32.874
No way!

00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:38.846
Kagura's not only my friend,
he's admired by the Mizukage and
he, loves to play Shinobi Bout!

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.581
[gasp]

00:14:40.348 --> 00:14:41.015
(BORUTO) <i>He's not your tool!</i>

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:41.216
[gasp]

00:14:41.983 --> 00:14:43.285
Kagura belongs to me!

00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:47.555
And you can't do anything about
it, no matter how hard you try!

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:48.556
[sigh]

00:14:49.924 --> 00:14:52.560
Don't even attempt to take
what's mine, because you're too
weak!

00:14:54.362 --> 00:14:57.565
Alright... I admit you're
stronger.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:58.766
Huh?

00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:01.503
But still...

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:04.572
Besides, I wanna win in one big
sweep, anyway!

00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:08.075
I think you're right...

00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:10.245
Shinobi Bout!

00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:11.779
Huh?!

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.781
Damn it!

00:15:14.249 --> 00:15:15.250
Thanks so much.

00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:20.622
That was really gutsy... the way
you blocked all those red cards.
Nicely done.

00:15:23.258 --> 00:15:24.592
That's how I'll win.

00:15:27.262 --> 00:15:29.096
<i>Easily, like with the game.</i>

00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:31.799
I'm gonna beat you!

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:35.770
One big sweep, guys!

00:15:35.803 --> 00:15:36.638
Yeah!

00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:38.640
Come on then!

00:15:40.074 --> 00:15:43.111
<i>He knows his jutsu won't work,</i>
<i>so he's trying a diversion.</i>

00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:51.119
But as long as I have the
Samehada, I can sense his
chakra with absolute precision!

00:15:53.955 --> 00:15:55.657
[grunt] Huh?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.828
You're right, it really is a
glutton.

00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:03.631
Huh?! Where is he?!

00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:07.635
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:16:09.504 --> 00:16:10.838
Oh, that trick again?!

00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:15.310
No, not yet!

00:16:17.979 --> 00:16:18.646
Now!

00:16:19.614 --> 00:16:21.683
Huh?! He's fast!

00:16:25.153 --> 00:16:25.820
[pained grunt]

00:16:27.455 --> 00:16:28.656
[pained groan]

00:16:29.457 --> 00:16:31.693
[growing yell]

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:38.866
[gasp]

00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:42.870
We did it!

00:16:43.938 --> 00:16:46.040
A clone uses Wind Style to
launch the original...

00:16:46.073 --> 00:16:49.711
...then the original uses Wind
Style to increase the speed of
attack!

00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:51.879
That's what you call the Boruto
Stream!

00:16:51.913 --> 00:16:55.583
Hey, stop stealing my lines,
will ya?!... [grunt]

00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:58.186
You always come up with such fun
stuff.

00:16:58.853 --> 00:17:01.323
Hey, thanks a lot, Mitsuki.

00:17:01.356 --> 00:17:03.725
Oh, I'm just glad I could help.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.227
Huh?

00:17:07.362 --> 00:17:09.797
You have got
to be kidding...

00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:15.370
[pained breaths] Damn you all...
[breaths]

00:17:18.706 --> 00:17:20.908
I'm gonna kill all of you!

00:17:22.544 --> 00:17:22.910
[grunt]

00:17:24.212 --> 00:17:25.012
Kagura??

00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:25.747
[grunt]

00:17:26.814 --> 00:17:29.284
Can't you see we've lost?
Please, this must stop!

00:17:29.317 --> 00:17:34.489
Kagura... Don't disobey me!
You're nothing but a tool!

00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:37.292
I am grateful for all that
you've done...

00:17:37.325 --> 00:17:37.925
What?!

00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:42.397
But please, just look at
Boruto!... He's driven you into
a corner...

00:17:43.698 --> 00:17:46.468
He's called me his friend over
and over...

00:17:46.501 --> 00:17:52.507
He made me think... He made me
believe that... [begins crying]

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.179
That even a weakling like me
can change!... Even you can..!

00:17:57.212 --> 00:18:04.652
[grunt] Shut up! [grunt] You
dare to lecture me?!

00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:08.956
Do you really think you've
won?... Oh no, this isn't over
yet!

00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:11.793
[grunt]

00:18:12.594 --> 00:18:16.030
I'm still more‐‐ Huh?

00:18:16.063 --> 00:18:20.768
What is happening?...
Samehada... w‐what are you
doing?

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:23.438
<i>Stop!... Wha‐‐?</i>

00:18:24.572 --> 00:18:28.876
Samehada... are you‐‐ are you
eating me?

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:35.283
[laughs] Ah! What is happening
to me? [screams]

00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:37.985
What's going on?

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.787
It's out of control.

00:18:40.288 --> 00:18:41.289
Lord Chojuro!

00:18:42.457 --> 00:18:45.760
Forgive me. I was evacuating
everyone and got delayed.

00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:48.930
<i>Samehada is very fickle and</i>
<i>difficult to wield.</i>

00:18:48.963 --> 00:18:53.368
This wielder was inexperienced,
<i>so the sword absorbed him.</i>

00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:56.304
[grunts and snorts]

00:18:57.139 --> 00:18:58.806
[roar]

00:19:00.308 --> 00:19:01.309
[grunts and snarls]

00:19:02.477 --> 00:19:04.512
(CHOJURO) <i>This is a problem.</i>

00:19:04.546 --> 00:19:07.549
<i>At this rate, it won't be long</i>
<i>before that thing consumes all</i>
<i>of our chakra.</i>

00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:12.019
Give me the blade, Kagura... If
we release it, it can stop
Samehada.

00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:18.960
Lord Chojuro... Please. Let me
handle this.

00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:24.332
I can't change the past... but I
want to help create our future.

00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:25.833
[gasp]

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:32.840
Very well.

00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:34.142
(KAGURA) <i>Right!</i>

00:19:34.176 --> 00:19:34.876
[chuckle]

00:19:36.978 --> 00:19:40.182
[grunt and growing yell]

00:19:40.682 --> 00:19:43.618
[grunts and roars]

00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:46.521
[grunt and yell]

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:54.061
[grunts and dodges]

00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:57.632
One more time!... [pained grunt]

00:19:57.665 --> 00:20:00.635
[chuckle]

00:20:00.668 --> 00:20:03.371
It can consume so much
chakra...!

00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:05.540
[gasp]

00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:08.810
Don't try to do everything by
yourself.

00:20:08.843 --> 00:20:11.546
Lean on your friends a little.
[chuckle]

00:20:13.215 --> 00:20:14.081
Hm.

00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:16.684
[attack roar]

00:20:16.718 --> 00:20:17.619
Let's do it!

00:20:17.652 --> 00:20:18.453
Right!

00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:20.388
[roars]

00:20:26.728 --> 00:20:27.562
[grunt]

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:33.835
[growing yell]

00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:35.570
[growing yell]

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.945
[pained screams]

00:20:47.081 --> 00:20:47.915
[burp]

00:20:53.255 --> 00:20:54.122
Shizuma...

00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:57.692
[heavy breathing]

00:20:57.725 --> 00:20:58.960
It's over.

00:21:00.895 --> 00:21:02.830
[pained groans and heavy
breathing]

00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:06.534
Thank you, Boruto.

00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:10.572
Ah, it was just your run of the
mill scuffle, that's all.

00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:11.439
[chuckle]

00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:16.043
(SARADA) <i>Boruto!</i>

00:21:16.077 --> 00:21:16.111
Huh?

00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:16.611
[heavy breathing]

00:21:17.779 --> 00:21:18.813
(SARADA) Come on, we'll be late
for roll call!

00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:20.715
[chuckle] What happened to
you?

00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:23.685
Hey, I can't help it, okay? I
can't walk!

00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:24.752
I'm truly honored!

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:26.354
Listen you, just shut up!

00:21:26.388 --> 00:21:26.954
[embarrassed groan]

00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:29.224
Boruto, c'mon, we don't have any
time!

00:21:29.257 --> 00:21:32.627
Aw, man, at least gimme a minute
to catch my breath, will ya?

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.231
(SARADA) What?! Didn't you hear
what we just said? There's no
time!

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:38.533
(IWABE) You're hopeless. Climb
on... [grunt]

00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:39.301
[chuckle]

00:21:41.469 --> 00:21:43.004
We're going back now.

00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:44.739
Boruto...

00:21:44.772 --> 00:21:46.741
Hm?... Ahhh‐‐!

00:21:46.774 --> 00:21:47.642
Hurry up!

00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:49.744
(IWABE) <i>Why are you the one</i>
<i>giving orders?</i>

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:50.178
(HACHIYA) [scared chuckle]

00:21:51.213 --> 00:21:52.046
(SARADA) Skip it! Less talking
and more running!

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:52.980
(HACHIYA) Yes, Miss Sarada!

00:21:54.048 --> 00:21:54.749
(BORUTO) Hey, take it easy, I'm
hurtin' all over!

00:21:54.782 --> 00:21:55.717
(SARADA) Run! Run!

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.551
(BORUTO) Not so fast‐‐!

00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:57.185
Shut up, you!

00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:58.186
(BORUTO) <i>Ow! Slow down...!</i>

00:21:59.954 --> 00:22:02.657
So it's that easy to change
colors, huh?

00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:09.497
Might be something only you can
do so effortlessly...

00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:49.397
(BORUTO) <i>...And this guy Kagura</i>
<i>got totally hooked on Shinobi</i>
<i>Bout.</i>

00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:53.067
I mean, like addicted to
it! It was ridiculous![chuckle]

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.903
<i>What is it, Hima? Something on</i>
<i>your mind?</i>

00:23:55.937 --> 00:23:56.771
(HIMA) <i>It's nothing...</i>

00:23:58.973 --> 00:24:01.109
(BORUTO) <i>Did something happen,</i>
<i>Mom? Himawari's been acting</i>
<i>weird since I got back.</i>

00:24:01.143 --> 00:24:05.713
(HINATA) <i>Don't you remember? You</i>
<i>promised to bring back a</i>
<i>souvenir for Himawari.</i>

00:24:05.747 --> 00:24:10.752
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
