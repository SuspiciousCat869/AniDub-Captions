WEBVTT

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:11.211
(geese honking)

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.516
Looks like the migration
is about to start.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.319
I've heard that they'll fly
off as soon as dawn breaks.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.288
There are still
some infected birds

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.056
among the rest of them right?

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.761
So the curse mark will
spread throughout the world.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.700
(grunting) Boruto
get away from me.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.002
Mr. Jugo.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.505
(grunting and yelling)

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.709
Come on hurry up.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.012
Let me see your
true self already.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.348
Tosaka, what have you done?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.053
(Opening theme music)

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.103
(Opening theme music)

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.354
(grunting in pain)

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.857
What are you trying to do?

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.860
All that I really want
to do is fight Jugo

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.762
to test how strong
my curse mark is.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.631
But what's the point if he's
still in his weakened state

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.433
am I right?

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.969
Is that why you used
that injection on him?

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.472
(grunting and yelling)

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.979
You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.214
Mr. Jugo.

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.016
Oh dear.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.957
How are we gonna
deal with this many?

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.792
Don't just stand there.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.662
Don't you wanna protect the
birds Jugo cares about so much?

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.333
The red eyes.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.769
We have to isolate the
birds with red eyes.

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.304
Red eyes, got it.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:30.310
Found one.

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:31.345
Over there.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:33.914
Which one?

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.349
The one on the right.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:42.055
Sarada.

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:45.392
Sarada what are you doing?

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:49.663
Thank goodness,
you guys are okay.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.665
Yeah somehow.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.835
What were you guys doing
over there in the water?

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.103
It's an emergency.

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:58.972
Help us find all the
geese that have red eyes.

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:08.849
I still feel numb all over.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.552
(evil laughing)

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:16.223
No.

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.693
(grunting)

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.967
(gasps)

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:33.607
(yelling)

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.842
Mr. Jugo.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.710
Damn it, where the
heck is Suigetsu?

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.315
(geese honking)

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:45.552
(grunting)

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:53.627
No matter; keep doing what
we can 'til the very end.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.661
[All] Right.

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:58.398
You're really
stubborn aren't you?

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.769
(grunting and yelling)

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.571
The dawn is almost here.

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:07.241
If the wild geese can
spread the curse mark

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:10.143
around the world, I'll be
able to obtain much more

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:11.612
interesting samples.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:12.679
Not gonna happen.

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:18.485
(arrows exploding)

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.089
(grunting)

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:28.795
Just what are you?

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.831
(laughing manically)

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:33.000
Don't you think
that I'm so strong?

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:34.201
You're mine.

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.437
What?

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.706
(grunting)

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:46.680
I'm gonna make sure that
you have a front row seat

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.649
to this excellent finale.

00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:50.651
Stop.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.986
(grunting)

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:59.826
Although I have to admit that
even I'm getting irritated.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.062
(grunting)

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.800
Quit wasting time and just
show me what you really are.

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:10.637
Come on, hurry up and release
your true strength already.

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:15.309
That's enough; just stop.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.811
Mr. Jugo doesn't
wanna hurt anyone.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.914
You really do say
the strangest things.

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:23.450
That's the same as
telling a tiger not to act

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.319
like a wild beast.

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:27.654
(grunting)

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.927
You see?

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.829
It looks to me like
Jugo actually

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:38.131
wants to go on a rampage.

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:40.334
That's his destiny.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.971
Finally the real
performance begins.

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:48.509
(yelling and growling)

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:51.545
(suspenseful music)

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.048
Jugo no.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.451
(laughing)

00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:59.152
I was getting impatient.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:01.421
We're going to fight
each other now.

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:04.992
And I'm going to defeat you
to prove that my curse mark

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.728
is the best in the entire world.

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:12.966
Orochimaru can't
hold a candle to me.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.335
(yelling)

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.471
Bye bye Jugo.

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.477
(gasps)

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:29.550
(yelling in pain)

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:51.705
(yelling)

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:56.210
No way.

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.487
The curse mark; he absorbed it?

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:22.135
Mr. Jugo?

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.975
(growling)

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.947
Boruto?

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.650
(geese honking)

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:40.487
(grunting)

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.056
That was a close one.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:46.960
There are just too many of them.

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.662
There's no ends to this.

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:50.564
Don't quit.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:54.535
(geese honking)

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.974
It's only a matter of time
before the birds begin

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:02.309
to fly away.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.580
Look Sarada, I hate
to say this but,

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:09.316
to make sure the
infection doesn't spread,

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:13.086
shouldn't we gather them all
up and torch them or something?

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:19.092
[Sarada] We can't do that.

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:26.433
(geese honking)

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.839
It's all over now.

00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:34.474
Nobody is gonna to
hurt you anymore.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:37.077
(yelling)

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.881
Stop it, I don't
wanna fight you.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:44.151
(grunting and yelling)

00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:50.324
Boruto no.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.831
Damn it Jugo.

00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:59.733
If you're gonna go on a rampage

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.602
then at least do it close by.

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:06.573
Just when did I get
a conscience anyway?

00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:15.482
Give up, Jugo can no longer
be stopped so easily.

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:18.685
Shut up.

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:23.757
He'll probably just keep
on rampaging until he dies.

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.860
No I'm not gonna
let that happen.

00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:28.729
(grunting)

00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:29.763
I'll kill you.

00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.499
I'll kill you!

00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:36.470
(grunting)

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.978
Boruto, are you all right?

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:46.747
I think so.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:51.552
(grunting and growling)

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:52.653
Nue, stay back.

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:56.723
(grunting and growling)

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.032
Nue, get away.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.239
No.

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:14.908
We'll just get caught
up in it if we rush in.

00:11:14.942 --> 00:11:16.877
We have to think
of a better way.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.913
Yes, Jugo, go wild.

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:24.718
Total and complete
destruction is your destiny.

00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.253
Just shut up.

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:30.557
(laughs) it's pointless
to try to deny the truth.

00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:34.928
Every living creature is
born connected to a fate

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:37.231
that can't be change.

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:39.433
No, to hell with fate.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:43.237
Is that one more of
your empty musings?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.406
Listen genetics this
or destiny that,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.842
I'm not gonna be held
back by that stuff.

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.578
Say what you like,
but any moment

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:54.681
the geese will take flight
and then the curse mark

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:59.152
that I created will spread
throughout the entire world.

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:02.122
And I can't wait.

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:07.094
(geese honking)

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.099
Please Mrs. Karin wait.

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:14.535
If we let even
one bird take off,

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:16.336
the risk of the
curse mark spreading

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.505
to other birds
elsewhere increases.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:22.009
We'll end up having to destroy
all the other birds too.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.418
Sarada give it back.

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.787
I know this is
hard for you, but--

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.988
No.

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:38.425
If we're gonna use this
I have to do it myself.

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:42.996
After all, this mission
was assigned to us.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.569
(growling)

00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:49.503
Nue.

00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:51.839
We're gonna have to
stop Jugo ourselves.

00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:53.974
But, how can we?

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:56.710
The four.

00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:00.714
Big brother Konohamaru
stopped Jugo by using

00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:01.748
his rasengan.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.392
Do you think if he
sustains enough damage

00:13:12.426 --> 00:13:15.429
then he might revert back
to his original state?

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:16.797
Yeah.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.799
But still.

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:20.901
No matter how I look
at it, my Rasengan

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:23.537
just isn't powerful enough.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.007
(grunting and yelling)

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:35.616
That's it.

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:36.650
Huh?

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:40.087
My Rasengan may not
have enough force,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.223
but if I add in the speed
that he'll come at me with,

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:45.492
it'll multiply it's
force exponentially.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.562
You're gonna go
after him head on?

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.431
But Boruto if you do
that, then you might be--

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:54.868
That's right; one wrong
move and I'm a goner.

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:57.004
But I have to do this.

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:01.475
(grunting and yelling)

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:07.614
Nue.

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:10.250
Nue, that's enough.

00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:14.721
Jugo.

00:14:16.557 --> 00:14:19.993
All right, come on
let's settle this.

00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:23.597
(growling)

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.566
There's some things
that may never come true

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:28.202
no matter how hard you
wish for them to happen.

00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:31.805
But the one wish you
could never give up on

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:34.575
is becoming the
person you wanna be.

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:37.611
Boruto you.

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:40.314
(geese honking)

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:43.450
Shadow clone jutsu.

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:45.853
(upbeat music)

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:47.087
Go!

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:57.030
Rasengan!

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:04.438
(yelling)

00:15:04.471 --> 00:15:06.306
Come on Jugo, wake up.

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:10.143
(grunting)

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:18.752
(upbeat music continues)

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:25.092
No way.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.998
Damn, can't move.

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:34.268
(growling)

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:38.305
I really thought
it was a good idea.

00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:50.484
That guy's trying so hard.

00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:57.991
(growling)

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:00.994
Mr. Jugo, you're--
I have...

00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:06.300
(grunting)

00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:16.977
Boruto.

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:20.414
Mr. Jugo.

00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:30.557
Can't be.

00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:31.592
That's.

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:43.270
Sunrise.

00:16:44.037 --> 00:16:46.707
(geese honking)

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:51.078
The migration.

00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:52.846
It's gonna start.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.749
(geese honking)

00:17:00.254 --> 00:17:04.124
With all these paper bombs
and my fireball jutsu,

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:11.331
sorry Boruto and Mr. Jugo.

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:15.169
Mitsuki.

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.771
Why don't you leave this to us?

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:19.072
What, to us?

00:17:23.443 --> 00:17:24.411
Wait that's--

00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:26.413
We took this from
their base camp.

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:30.918
It's a serum; it neutralizes
the effects of the curse mark.

00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:32.653
Suigetsu, you ready?

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.757
I'm only doing this
for Jugo, you got that?

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:42.162
(calm dramatic music)

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:59.313
(water splashing)

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:08.488
(geese honking)

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:19.733
Seems like we made it in time.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:20.767
We did.

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:22.703
-Look.
-Yeah.

00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:27.274
(geese honking)

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:32.579
(calm dramatic music)

00:18:40.087 --> 00:18:42.756
(geese honking)

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.999
Come on, you got this.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.736
(geese honking)

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:06.013
Yeah.

00:19:14.922 --> 00:19:16.123
That's it.

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:23.130
We seriously have to
clean all this up?

00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:25.332
Well they say leave a place

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:27.234
the way you found it,
don't they?

00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:33.407
The scientific ninja
tools department?

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.710
Please don't tell Boruto
and the others just yet.

00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:38.712
I wanna tell them myself later.

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:40.414
You're really gonna leave us?

00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:42.716
They actually tried
to recruit me earlier.

00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:47.020
I need to figure out how to
synergize better with Nue

00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:50.057
and I wanna find a way to
do that through science.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.259
Are you really serious?

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.061
But I thought
after that incident

00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:56.897
the scientific ninja tools
department was suspended.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.398
Isn't that right?

00:19:58.432 --> 00:20:01.568
Yes but there are plans to
restart it from scratch.

00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:06.006
At first, I was gonna
turn them down, but.

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:14.581
Boruto said that we
can't just give up

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:17.317
on trying to become
the person we wanna be.

00:20:19.086 --> 00:20:21.421
You like bossing
people around huh?

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:24.725
This is just a part
of the mission.

00:20:24.758 --> 00:20:27.928
So sensei do you think we can
call this mission a success?

00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.898
Yes; right now, all that's left

00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:33.433
is to return home and
get Tosaka to confess

00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:36.870
everything he knows
about the curse mark.

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:39.606
But sensei, Suigetsu
and Karin took him

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.674
and left a while ago.

00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:43.710
They what, they left?

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:48.315
I mean come on, I'm not gonna
forget about this, you know.

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:50.851
We helped him out after all.

00:20:50.884 --> 00:20:53.253
This is the least
they can give us.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.522
[Tosaka] I'm not
kidding around here.

00:20:55.556 --> 00:20:58.392
Are you gonna be sad to
say goodbye to Sarada?

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.193
No, no way.

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:01.528
It's nothing like that.

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:04.598
Oh really because you
seemed awfully kind to her.

00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:07.034
You may have assisted in
her birth, but come on.

00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:08.535
You're not getting
all maternal are you?

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:12.973
Oh drop it; I already told
you it's nothing like that.

00:21:15.776 --> 00:21:18.245
What are you giggling about?

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:22.282
His rasengan actually worked.

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:28.355
Honestly Boruto you
are way too reckless.

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:30.624
You could've died
taking him on you know.

00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:34.895
Well I stopped him so
it's all good right?

00:21:34.928 --> 00:21:38.632
I wonder what Jugo's
gonna do from here on.

00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.400
Who knows,

00:21:40.434 --> 00:21:44.271
but Mr. Jugo has to
decide that for himself.

00:21:46.807 --> 00:21:50.010
(upbeat rock music)

00:21:52.913 --> 00:21:54.448
Is it possible?

00:21:57.784 --> 00:21:59.753
One day, I'll fly.

00:22:00.787 --> 00:22:04.424
(upbeat rock music ends)

00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:19.640
(Ending theme music)

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:46.193
Boruto, Mitsuki look
I found a kitten.

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:47.861
Such a tiny little thing.

00:23:47.895 --> 00:23:48.996
Is it lost?

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:50.898
I don't know, but it
won't stop shaking.

00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:53.333
I'm worried and I wanna
take it home with me,

00:23:53.367 --> 00:23:55.302
but we can't have
pets at our house.

00:23:55.335 --> 00:23:57.204
[Boruto] I'd have
to ask my mom first.

00:23:57.237 --> 00:23:59.173
So Mitsuki, you think
you could take care

00:23:59.206 --> 00:24:00.507
of it for a little bit?

00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:04.578
Next time on Boruto,
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:06.079
The little roommate.

00:24:06.113 --> 00:24:08.615
Got it, just leave
the kitten to me.

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:17.624
