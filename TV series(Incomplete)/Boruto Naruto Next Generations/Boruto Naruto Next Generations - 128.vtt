WEBVTT

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:10.177
(Mirai pants)

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.078
Why you!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.080
Those are my friends.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:16.049
(weapons clang)

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.188
Where are you, damn it!

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.694
(Mirai whimpers)

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.029
(Urashiki laughs)

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.965
The Hokage has hidden the
Tailed Beasts, hasn't he?

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.434
I doubt that I'll learn
anything useful from you

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:35.936
but I'll ask anyway.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.404
You have anything to say?

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.205
(Mirai chuckles)

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.940
I guess it's too bad for you.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.441
I don't know anything.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.312
And even if I did
I'd never tell you.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.214
(Mirai whimpers)

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.082
But I asked you so politely,

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.585
you're really very
rude, aren't you?

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.260
Chakra from a
genjutsu user, huh?

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:03.330
Interesting, this could
come in very handy.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.066
[Jonin] Come in, Mirai!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.935
Hey Mirai!

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.203
My, what interesting devices

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.205
-you humans use!
-[Jonin] Mirai, Are you okay?

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.673
That thing's just given me

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.441
-an idea.
-[Jonin] Answer me!

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.978
(opening theme music)

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:22.082
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.946
Don't you think
you're overdoing it

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.714
with security just a bit?

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:02.950
Not really!

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:05.619
If anything I'd say that
we're being too lax!

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:08.088
That Otsutsuki guy has
already drained the chakra

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.090
from several people.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:13.126
But still, it's not like
we're in a war here.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.963
You're gonna make the whole
village feel really uneasy

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.130
because of all this.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.867
Listen, the guy's able
to teleport, right?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.935
Since Sasuke's here right now,

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.837
the Otsutsuki probably won't try

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.506
and come barging
into the village.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.841
But still we can't
be too much careful.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.944
Sasuke, how are you feeling now?

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:32.312
You haven't been in top form

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.115
since your chakra was drained
in that last encounter,

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.383
isn't that right?

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:40.220
Yeah, but I can't
let that bother me.

00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:41.989
Not when the Nine Tail's Chakra

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.324
that's inside of you
as being targeted.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.660
Yeah, I know that.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:50.831
It's just, I wish that bastard
would come straight for me

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:52.733
so I could fight back.

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.834
Well yeah.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.669
But I don't really
think he's stupid enough

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.671
to come at you, head on.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.474
(dramatic music)

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:06.947
With as many people
as there are now,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.616
who knows just how much
time I'm going to need.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.486
It seems that I made a
little too much noise.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.622
So now the Fox is
surrounded by obstacles.

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:19.226
I guess I really have no choice.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.529
I hate to use up all of
that chakra I've gathered.

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:25.265
But since that thing's
conveniently turned up,

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.901
I guess I'll just use it.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:31.839
If I'm able to get my hands on
all the Fox Spirit's chakra,

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.473
then it'll all even out.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.578
Well I've got good
news and bad news.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.247
So first the good news.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.983
We're finally working together
with the other villages,

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.219
which means we should
be able to narrow down

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:46.854
where the Otsutsuki is.

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:47.855
(Naruto scoffs)

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.289
What's the bad news?

00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:53.827
A tuning on patrol, has been
recently reported as missing.

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.729
We're looking into it further.

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:57.564
So who was it?

00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:58.632
Who's gone missing?

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.301
Mirai Sarutobi.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.471
Is he responsible?

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:08.308
We don't know for sure but
it's certainly a possibility.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.179
I know Otsutsuki's name
is Urashiki, right?

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.114
Yeah.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.083
I'll leave it to
you to find Mirai,

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.418
and I'm gonna send
out one of my clones

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:19.653
to find Urashiki.

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:24.758
Calm down Naruto, that guy is
after your chakra, remember?

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.093
Yeah, I know but--

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:28.829
Now about Urashiki's objective,

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:31.098
I doubt he's gathering
up all this chakra

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:34.134
as part of a plot to
get you personally.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.803
Most likely, his goal
is just to collect

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.173
all of the chakra
that he possibly can.

00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:42.075
Hey! Wait! Boruto!

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:43.277
I'm not waiting!

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.711
(door opens)

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.346
I figured he'd show up.

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:51.451
You're gonna send genin out
to go and search for Urashiki,

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:52.553
isn't that right?

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.087
So why am I the only one

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.557
who has to stay in the
village on standby?

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.125
Calm down Boruto!

00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:59.693
This is an executive decision.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.094
I Wanna know why!

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:03.964
Boruto, Urashiki has
a vendetta against you

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:06.099
because of your fight before.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:08.802
It's also risky for you
to be out in the open.

00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:11.071
Just let it go this time, okay.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.073
I don't wanna be the only
one just sitting around.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.275
This is as an order.

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:16.076
But let's--

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.078
Act like an adult Boruto!

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.482
Back when I was around your age,

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:25.319
even I was more
reasonable than this.

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.954
Yeah, Whatever,

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:29.723
I wish I could see how
you really were back then.

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:31.425
All right.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:33.961
If you insist on
defying my orders,

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:37.331
for the time being, I'll
have to confine you.

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:38.265
No way!

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:40.267
Can I say something here?

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.669
Go on, please talk
some sense into him.

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:44.938
Sasuke, it isn't your place to--

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.808
What if Boruto and I
form a two man team?

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.042
How does that sound?

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:52.546
The two of you on a team?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.680
If he's with me,

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:56.316
then I don't think he'll
get attacked out of a blue.

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:01.255
But still, we need to have
you remain inside the village,

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:03.390
in case Urashiki
does show up here

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.826
and we need your help
fighting him off.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:08.595
If we restrict our
actions to the village,

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.430
there shouldn't be a problem.

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:11.632
Please, dad,

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.301
I mean Lord Seventh!

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:17.204
(upbeat music)

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:19.740
Permission granted to
form a two man team.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.543
However, you're forbidden
from leaving the village.

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:23.544
Got it?

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:26.346
Sasuke, I'm counting on you.

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:28.348
Yes!

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:30.651
The ancient relic,

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:32.819
that was recently discovered
on the ocean floor,

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:34.121
is currently being analyzed

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:37.491
by The Leaf's Archeological
Research Institute.

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:39.893
Officials there say the
pattern etched into the relic

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:43.096
indicates that it may be that
it may be a sealing device,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.097
but they caution that--

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.666
Man I really got to tell you,

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:49.536
this patrolling the village
thing's super boring you know?

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.971
Deal with it Boruto.

00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:51.972
(Boruto sighs)

00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:53.340
I know how you're feeling,

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:56.677
but we're doing all this
to ensure your safety.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.946
So please try to
understand that.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.714
I get it loud and clear.

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:03.050
Oh Boruto!

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:07.955
Hey guys, you
going on a mission?

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.224
Well, it's part mission
and part testing.

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:11.758
The more people
testing the new tech,

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:14.461
the better we can make sure
it works the way it should.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.430
So we were recruiting.

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:17.698
New tech?

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:18.999
That's right,

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.435
Denki's company developed
some new technology.

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:23.370
Yep, here it is Boruto.

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:26.106
But we've had radios
for a while, right?

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.942
Our engineer, Mr. Haguruma
came up with this idea,

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.178
and I added a few features too.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.349
This display shows
everyone's current position.

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:38.085
For right now, we're only
able to collect tracking data

00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:39.520
from a pretty limited area,

00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:41.955
but in time I hope that
we'll be able to cover

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:43.757
the entire Land of Fire.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.993
This device ought to make
our missions a lot safer,

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.561
don't you think?

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.696
This is amazing.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.498
So you babysitting Boruto dad?

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:54.001
Yeah, I guess you
could call it that.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.236
Well, don't just protect
other people, all right?

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.071
Make sure you cherish
your own family

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.274
once in a while, you know?

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:01.308
I know that.

00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:03.210
Hey Boruto, be good

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:04.978
and keep an eye on things here,

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:07.848
don't give my dad too
much trouble, all right.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:08.949
What was that?

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.250
Okay, should we get going?

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:11.685
Roger! Let's go Shikadai!

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:12.953
I mean Captain!

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.589
Boruto, behave yourself, okay.

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.124
(Boruto laughs sarcastically)

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.960
Sometimes you just got
to grin and bear it.

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:22.229
You're always in the
limelight Boruto,

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:24.231
and we rarely get
a chance to shine.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:27.634
So Boruto, please take
care of everything here.

00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:30.704
It's nice to take a break
every now and again, isn't it?

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:31.705
Yo shut up!

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.307
Just get out of here.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.980
(tracker beeps)

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.215
[Tenten] Everything okay?

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.716
Give me a status report.

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:45.219
[Korogi] We've
spotted the target!

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:46.820
We're in pursuit as we speak!

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:48.555
He's currently moving
toward the south!

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:49.556
The target?

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.824
(keyboard taps)

00:09:50.858 --> 00:09:51.859
[Korogi] I repeat!

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:53.594
The Target's been spotted.

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:54.995
There's no mistake.

00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:56.363
He's the Otsutsuki.

00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:58.332
No way!

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:01.034
He's heading south.

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:05.072
It looks like they're moving
away from the village.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.943
The enemy uses
time-space Ninjutsu.

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:11.178
So keep your distance.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.280
[Korogi] Got it!

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.982
I'll try to get him into
position to corner him!

00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:18.218
Roger! I'll send in
reinforcements now.

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:20.988
All other teams leave
the pursuit to Korogi.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:23.457
Break off, and head
south of the village

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.626
towards sector 1-HA.

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:27.794
[Tenten] Shikadai's team is
already on the south side.

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:31.465
Rendezvous with them and close
in using a pincer formation.

00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:32.966
[All] Roger!

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.235
All right, we'll join
up with Tenten's team

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:37.404
and head for the
ravine up ahead.

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:38.438
[All] Roger!

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.077
(Sasuke scoffs)

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:49.716
I see, keep advancing
and they'll reach

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.084
the narrow ravine.

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:54.321
(suspenseful music)

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:04.097
Choji, are you in position?

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.066
I'm ready any time?

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:08.468
Oh, I understand,

00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:10.737
they're going to corner
him in that Ravine.

00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:19.413
I've reached the ravine.

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:20.948
[Korogi] Roger!

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:23.116
They cornered Urashiki.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.852
Will we make it in time?

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:27.354
We have to, so we will.

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:29.089
We'll use every
shinobi in the village

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:30.257
to corner that bastard

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.125
before he could even
cross the border.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.461
Things are getting
pretty nasty, Sasuke.

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.065
Sasuke?

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.336
I might be over
thinking this but

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.506
Urashiki is able
to copy the jutsu

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:48.275
of the people that he
steals chakra from.

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:49.676
Really?

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.844
Yesterday a shinobi

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:53.080
from the Hidden Leaf
Village went missing.

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:54.481
We suspect that occurred

00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:57.451
because they got into a
confrontation with Urashiki.

00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:00.420
Do you know who it was?

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:02.089
Mirai Sarutobi.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.992
No way.

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:06.827
Something bothered
me when we saw them

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.662
testing the new tech.

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:12.566
You know what kind of
jutsu Mirai specializes in?

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:14.268
She's good with Wind Style,

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:17.437
but I'm pretty sure
that it's genjutsu.

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:23.410
Urashiki may have
just tricked us.

00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:25.412
(dramatic music)

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.214
He's using genjutsu?

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.850
It's possible the
shinobi at the front

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:31.218
are seeing an illusion,

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:34.621
the Urashiki they're seeing
running away right now.

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:37.224
I've almost caught him cornered.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.626
[Tenten] Don't let
this chance slip away!

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.730
[Sasuke] Is probably
a diversion.

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:45.332
[Boruto] But why?

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.971
You're trapped now, Otsutsuki!

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:53.207
[Tenten] He's coming, get ready!

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.342
Your time's up, Otsutsuki!

00:12:57.845 --> 00:12:58.979
(Tenten and Shikadai gasp)

00:12:59.012 --> 00:13:00.447
Korogi no!

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.481
No, stop!

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:06.420
You got to snap out of it!

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.454
What are you doing?

00:13:08.522 --> 00:13:10.457
The enemy's right
in front of me.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.458
Release!

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:14.194
(Korogi gasps)

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.464
Mirai!

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.200
Release!

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:26.039
But I was just
fighting the Otsutsuki.

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:28.809
Was I?

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:31.612
The both of you were
under a genjutsu.

00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:36.049
Hey Mirai, are you doing okay?

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:38.252
This is bad.

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:40.621
All the village's defenses,

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:43.457
have been seriously thinned
down and spread out.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.226
(dramatic music)

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:54.268
And just like that the village
is totally open to attack.

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:56.069
They fall for such simple tricks

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:58.238
thanks to group psychology.

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:01.575
Humans truly are
nothing but fools!

00:14:03.277 --> 00:14:07.080
All right, Naruto Uzumaki!

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:08.982
Now I'll just take my sweet time

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.618
stealing the Nine Tail's Chakra.

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:18.458
(upbeat dramatic music)

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.030
. Damn it! Even the street
patrols were sent out.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.766
Even with the subversion of his,

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:29.169
there's still shinobi stationed
at the Hokage's office.

00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:30.938
Why would Urashiki?

00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.907
Urashiki's after the
Nine Tail's chakra,

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:35.142
let's hurry.

00:14:36.844 --> 00:14:39.646
(dramatic music)

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.758
What's up with Urashiki?

00:14:51.792 --> 00:14:53.527
We haven't received
a report yet.

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:57.431
(dramatic music)

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.945
What are you doing?

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:13.180
We're wrong.

00:15:16.517 --> 00:15:19.052
The Hokage's office
is completely secure.

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:21.688
Maybe you both should try
to relax a little bit.

00:15:21.722 --> 00:15:24.391
(Naruto sighs)

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:28.195
What's wrong.

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:32.099
Even if security in the
village has been weakened

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:35.903
Urashiki knows that dad will
still have strong shinobi

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:38.472
stationed all around him, right?

00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:41.475
And also, that you're
in the village.

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:44.811
So if Urashiki were to
confront dad directly,

00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:46.547
could he really win?

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.016
So he's not after the
Nine Tail's chakra?

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:50.450
In scientific news today,

00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:51.818
-a team of archeologists
-That's it.

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:53.287
I'm sure I'm right.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.922
Managed to recover an artifact--

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:57.191
When we fought the White
Zetsu at that ruin,

00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.027
I saw the same symbol
they showed on the news!

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:03.230
That ancient relic that
was found in the ocean,

00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:06.900
it's at the Leaf's Archeological
Research Institute.

00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:09.503
Seems like it's connected
to the Otsutsuki.

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:10.771
But I'm not sure.

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.673
The Archeological
Research Institute huh?

00:16:12.706 --> 00:16:15.008
Well, I think so but--

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:17.477
A relic that's more
precious than Nine Tails.

00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:19.813
The Hokage office
is locked down.

00:16:19.847 --> 00:16:21.281
So if there's
another possibility

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:23.283
we should go and check it out.

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:27.287
(suspenseful music)

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:33.060
Sasuke! Look!

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:39.666
His chakras been extracted.

00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:42.536
Could this place
really be his target?

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:49.243
It seems that your
hunch was correct.

00:16:50.544 --> 00:16:53.146
(eerie music)

00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:07.127
Ah! Here it is!

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.168
How lucky that humans found
it since they can't open it.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.638
Only the Otsutsuki can
activate this device.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.309
(relic gleams)

00:17:27.648 --> 00:17:29.583
Now awaken Karasuki.

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:39.026
Activation authenticated.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.228
I'm Karasuki, the noble device.

00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:45.065
Allow me to advise you on the
procedure of my operation.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.670
Confirming procedure
as requested.

00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:51.905
My operation will be hindered,

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:54.508
if any steps are
made out of order.

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:58.178
Master Urashiki Otsutsuki,

00:17:58.212 --> 00:18:01.615
I must first be charged
with chakra to operate.

00:18:01.648 --> 00:18:03.183
Once charging is completed,

00:18:03.217 --> 00:18:05.385
please configure
transfer settings.

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:07.087
Uh it's so slow.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.322
Why make it a turtle?

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:10.657
They're so plodding
and irritating.

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:13.393
(Relic chimes)

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:18.065
Listen, could you
hurry this up a bit?

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:19.766
(door bangs open)

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.767
Found you!

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:22.436
Stop right there Urashiki.

00:18:23.504 --> 00:18:26.206
What are you gonna do with
that after you steal it.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.076
Such a typical human accusation.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:32.045
This originally belonged
to the Otsutsuki,

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.381
I'm not stealing,
I'm taking it back.

00:18:36.717 --> 00:18:38.519
You're not getting away.

00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:40.954
Oh my! How scary you are.

00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:43.223
But should you really
be saying that?

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:46.326
You certainly don't look
like you're at full strength.

00:18:47.261 --> 00:18:49.429
I'd like to pay you
back from my horns

00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:52.199
but I don't have the
time to waste on you.

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:56.670
Anyway I'm off to harvest
the Fox's chakra now.

00:18:56.703 --> 00:18:57.871
You're what?

00:18:57.905 --> 00:19:00.641
It's already too late
for you to stop me.

00:19:00.674 --> 00:19:03.076
There's nothing you can do.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.413
(Otsutsuki whooshes)

00:19:19.693 --> 00:19:20.694
Where are we?

00:19:21.695 --> 00:19:22.696
Stay alert.

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:27.401
That turtle,

00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:31.672
that's the thing Urashiki
was holding earlier.

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.941
What in the world's going on?

00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:36.410
You followed me here?

00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:39.980
I really can't stand your
persistence, you know!

00:19:45.052 --> 00:19:47.020
Just what are you up to?

00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:50.123
(Urashiki scoffs)

00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.533
It's still too soon.

00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:05.572
What the hell is all this?

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.541
Boruto!

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:16.517
Well I guess they left the
gate a little too soon.

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:22.589
Boruto!

00:20:26.593 --> 00:20:28.562
(portal opens)

00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:31.398
(Boruto screams)

00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:40.674
Ow!

00:20:41.975 --> 00:20:43.443
Sasuke, what's wrong?

00:20:45.312 --> 00:20:48.048
My chakra, I used all of it up.

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:52.653
I don't sense Urashiki's
presence anywhere but

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.758
so where are we?

00:20:57.791 --> 00:21:00.127
We ought to check
the area nearby.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.033
Damn it!

00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:08.001
This thing's not doing anything.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:10.604
You think this guy's
the reason we're here?

00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:11.972
Probably yeah.

00:21:20.914 --> 00:21:22.382
Hey, it's a town.

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:27.454
Oh, wait a minute, it's
just the Leaf Village.

00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.656
Guess I got worked
up for nothing.

00:21:31.592 --> 00:21:32.593
(Sasuke gasps)

00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:35.095
What?

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:37.064
The Great Stone Faces?

00:21:37.097 --> 00:21:38.999
But my dad's face isn't.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.435
No way.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.972
Hold up!

00:21:48.175 --> 00:21:50.310
Why did you run off like that?

00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:53.514
Sasuke?

00:21:55.349 --> 00:22:00.521
Boruto, this is The Leaf
Village in the past.

00:22:10.264 --> 00:22:13.166
(closing theme music)

00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:26.647
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:43.223 --> 00:23:45.058
The New City is gone!

00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:47.094
This place doesn't feel
like the Leaf Village!

00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:49.029
Where are we, you know?

00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:51.498
Warning, we have
deviated a great amount

00:23:51.532 --> 00:23:54.034
from our target to
temporal transfer.

00:23:54.067 --> 00:23:56.270
You said temporal
transfer, right?

00:23:56.303 --> 00:23:59.006
This village is The
Leaf in the past.

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.274
The past?

00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:03.443
Next time Boruto Naruto
Next Generations:

00:24:03.477 --> 00:24:05.779
"The Village Hidden
in the Leaves"

00:24:05.812 --> 00:24:06.947
Are you telling me

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.449
I'll probably get to
meet my dad as a kid?

00:24:10.984 --> 00:24:13.554
(closing theme music)

00:24:13.587 --> 00:24:17.457
(singing in Japanese)
