00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.443
(birds chirping)

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.679
-(grunting)
-(shurikens clanking)

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:14.147
Ha, I did it!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.683
I hit the target again!

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:19.319
(laughing)

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.487
[Boruto] And even with practice,

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.322
you won't always
hit the bullseye.

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:25.926
But still, if you
just keep at it,

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.594
I bet it'll lead to something.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.063
Something you can't
buy with a black card.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.366
Something you can only
earn with your hands.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.202
I swear, I'm gonna become
a full fledged ninja

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.638
and get Papa to notice me!

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:38.639
[Yamaoka] Milord!

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:39.806
Huh?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.676
(panting)

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.946
Yamaoka, have you finished
packing up our stuff yet?

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.348
We're leaving the Leaf
later on, you know?

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.784
Yes, I know, but
just a moment ago,

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.486
I happened to see a
man near the hotel

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.821
who was pretending
to be a body guard.

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.089
What, seriously?

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:57.724
Transformation Jutsu?

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.494
That's right. I believe it's
possible he could be here

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.564
in order to make an attempt
on Lord Ikkyu's life.

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.566
We must notify him at once.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.234
Wait, hold on.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.336
If I can find out
who that man is,

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.272
then it would be really
helpful info for my father.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:13.307
But Milord!

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.443
Such a task is much too
difficult for you alone!

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.680
After undergoing Boruto's
super rigorous training,

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.515
I'm different than I was before!

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.683
You have matured!

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.651
You're a splendid young man!

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.053
If that's what you've decided,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.689
then I, Yamaoka, shall
assist you any way I can!

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:29.690
All right, great!

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:31.925
Take me to where you saw him!

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.160
Of course!

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:36.430
(ominous laughing)

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:37.731
(footsteps tapping)

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.834
(opening theme music)

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:44.671
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:12.159
(opening theme music)

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.836
[Sarada] So Boruto, how'd
that bodyguard gig go?

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.439
[Boruto] Well you see, it was
for the Feudal Lord's son Tento.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.674
He's a super-spoiled
bratty rich kid.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.042
Real hard to get along with.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:31.044
I thought I couldn't
do it at first.

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.145
-(laughing)
-Oh?

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.480
But once I talked to him

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:35.782
and got to know
him, he wasn't bad!

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.951
And we even became
friends in the end!

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:39.820
(chuckling)

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.522
That's so like you.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:44.191
(playful music)

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.962
(door creaking)

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.565
(gasping)

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:52.799
[Sarada] What's going on?

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.201
Oh, you're here.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.937
Come on in, you guys, but
watch your step, okay?

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.673
Wow, when did you
become such a slob?

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.041
You know, since you're a jonin,

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.943
you should really
get it together.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.778
(groaning)

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.846
Wait a second.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.080
Don't tell me you
called us in here

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:09.416
just to clean all
this stuff up for you.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.218
Don't be ridiculous!

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.353
I mean, don't you
guys want to find out

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.322
what's on this
scroll I'm holding?

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.957
Yeah, yeah, okay, we get it.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.192
It's a new mission, right?

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:20.694
This isn't just any old mission.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:22.196
This one is B-rank.

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.530
[All] What, B-rank?

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:24.932
Awesome, finally!

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:28.068
Big Bro, I totally
love you right now!

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.038
Hey, I keep telling you,
you need to call me Sensei!

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.472
Finally, a mission
where we'll really

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.274
get to show off
our full abilities.

00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:37.411
Although, why was our
team chosen for this?

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:38.212
Yeah, he's right.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:39.479
B-rank is normally something

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.915
only higher rank ninja
like chunin take on

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.951
because of the level
of difficulty, right?

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:45.352
That's correct.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.956
However, it was decided
that you guys can handle it.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:50.791
All of your
accomplishments before now

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:52.259
haven't gone unnoticed.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.227
(laughing)

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.295
But don't let your guard down.

00:04:56.563 --> 00:04:58.198
As I'm sure you know...

00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:02.135
A B-rank mission can be
very dangerous, right?

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.103
Yes.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.938
It's possible you could
end up fighting people

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:06.940
that are right out
of the Bingo Book.

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.176
Yeah, but if we can
complete this mission,

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.411
then it'll prove how
awesome we are, right?

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:12.479
Sounds just perfect

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:14.615
for somebody whose goal
is to become the Hokage!

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.917
At the same time, the
bigger the expectations

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.619
that people have for
the three of you,

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.687
the greater the criticism
you could receive

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:22.489
if you guys end up failing.

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.559
You willing to take
that risk or what?

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:26.827
Yeah, sure.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.795
I mean, we are Team
Seven, aren't we?

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.831
All right, let's do this!

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.966
I'm excited as well!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.201
Well, okay then!

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.203
Since you're all on
board, you leave tonight.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.338
Go show them what
you're made of.

00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:39.406
[All] Yes, sir!

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:43.343
(birds chirping)

00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:48.549
-(sliding door whirring)
-(footsteps tapping)

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.553
-Oh?
-Is Tento behind this again?

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.720
Yes, sir.

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:56.089
It seems that he's purchased
a large amount of X Cards.

00:05:56.123 --> 00:05:58.225
What in the world
could he be thinking?

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:00.060
Just get rid of them
all immediately.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:02.496
-Right.
-(footsteps tapping)

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.066
What could be going through
that boy's head anyway?

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.202
I couldn't pay very
much attention to him,

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:11.805
so he grew up to be spoiled and
a little bit out of control.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.040
(chuckling)

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:15.576
I think that's just how
every kid is, you know?

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:17.678
[Ikkyu] Wait, hold on.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.812
Oh?

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.281
I'll talk to Tento
myself about all this.

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:22.482
Sir!

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.818
Might be nice to soak
in the hot springs

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:26.787
and discuss it there.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.590
(birds chirping)

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.027
Right this way.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:38.432
(tense music)

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.937
(footsteps tapping)

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:45.339
Uh, Yamaoka?

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:47.641
Are you sure this
is the right place?

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:48.942
Yes, of course, Milord.

00:06:48.976 --> 00:06:51.345
I'm sure it was around
here, although...

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:53.146
Hey, come on, get it together!

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.148
Or else this guy might get away!

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.251
(air whooshing)

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:59.152
[Gang Member] That
took a while, sir.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:06:59.953
Huh?

00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:00.954
(grunting)

00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:02.923
(chuckling)

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:05.559
(tense music)

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.228
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.097
He's nowhere to be found, sir!

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.966
Is it possible that he went
somewhere with Yamaoka?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.101
No, sir.

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:15.636
Yamaoka didn't
mention anything to us

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:16.803
about taking him on an outing.

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:19.740
But I can confirm that Tento
was in the garden earlier

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.041
doing shuriken training.

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:23.076
Go and get in contact
with Yamaoka now!

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.778
And find Tento right away!

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.013
Yes, sir!

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:30.417
Oh, Tento...

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.353
[Boruto] A B-rank
mission at last!

00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:35.222
[Mitsuki] Your wish
finally came true.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.325
(chuckling) I'm gonna make
sure we totally crush it!

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:42.095
And that means the next one
is gonna be an S-rank mission!

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:43.330
-(chuckling)
-Yes.

00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:46.800
Hey, what's this?

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:48.035
Wait, this is...

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:50.170
Is there something
wrong with that X Card?

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:52.306
Well, no, it's just
a super rare card

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:54.541
I've been wanting
for a while now.

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.176
But what's it doing in my...

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.545
Tento!

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.180
(humming)

00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:02.382
So uh, you want it?

00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:03.550
No, thanks.

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:05.219
Huh, why not?

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:07.187
I'm the type of guy
who gets what he wants

00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.689
by using his own strengths,

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:10.557
no matter how hard it might be.

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:11.792
Get it?

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:12.960
Tento did this.

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:14.928
He snuck it in 'cause
I wouldn't take it?

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:17.297
Weirdly considerate for a brat.

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.099
(groaning)

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.834
(mischievous music)

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:22.536
[Mitsuki] Boruto?

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:24.037
Damn it, I want it,

00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:26.373
but I really can't take it.

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:27.174
I'll see ya.

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.809
There's something I have to do.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.911
And don't be late
for our rendezvous.

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:32.079
I've got it.

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:33.680
(mischievous music)

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:35.682
(humming)

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:38.519
(guards muttering)

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:41.555
(footsteps tapping)

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:47.561
What's going on?

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.563
There are so many
guards around here.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.967
(air whooshing)

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:56.069
Either way, I
can't believe Tento

00:08:56.103 --> 00:08:59.473
managed to sneak something
into the pocket of a ninja.

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:02.075
It's almost insulting how
he keeps on surprising me.

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.243
Now it's my turn.

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:05.212
I'm just gonna gallantly
sneak inside his room

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:07.314
from the balcony all ninja like.

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:14.955
But uh, which one's his room?

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:16.823
[Ikkyu] Damn it!
Who's behind this?

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:18.625
Shoot, was I spotted?

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:21.461
I should've just gone in
through the front door.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.464
How dare they kidnap Tento!

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:26.800
I will not let them
get away with this!

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.802
He was kidnapped?

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:30.771
They say if we go
public with this,

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:32.639
Young Lord Tento will die.

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:33.674
(gasping)

00:09:33.707 --> 00:09:35.075
Oh, Tento...

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:37.211
Just what were his
bodyguards doing?

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.812
I'm afraid that no one even saw

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:41.381
Young Lord Tento
leave the hotel, sir.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:43.350
Damn it!

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:47.054
And also sir, the Mujina Gang
is claiming responsibility.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.056
That band of thieves?

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.357
And what do they want?

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.694
500 million in cash, and also...

00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:54.695
Well, what is it?

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:56.797
The release of all the detainees

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.966
being held in Hozuki castle.

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.033
Ridiculous!

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:01.368
There's no way that
the Land of Fire

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:04.171
can agree to arbitrarily
do something like that!

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:06.173
And besides, that
place is administered

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.342
by the Hidden Grass!

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.177
[Guard] As for the Mujina Gang
and their leader, Shojoji,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.479
the Hidden Leaf should
already be searching for them.

00:10:12.513 --> 00:10:15.649
Shall we ask Leaf shinobi
for assistance or?

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:17.050
No! No way!

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:18.886
They made it past the
Hidden Leaf security

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:22.789
and secretly bided their time
just waiting for this chance!

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.358
And then they managed
to kidnap Tento

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.226
without any witnesses
seeing them.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.663
So the Mujina are most likely
monitoring our movements.

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.231
But how can they be?

00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:32.533
I think we have to assume

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:34.368
that they must have a spy
inside the Hidden Leaf,

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:37.271
if not among my very own staff!

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:38.505
Impossible!

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:40.040
That must be the reason

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:42.943
why they were able to
pull this off at all.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.678
[Guard] I can't believe
the Mujina Gang's

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.313
aware of our actions...

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:50.250
If we make a stupid move
now, Tento's life is forfeit.

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:51.185
(gasping)

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.453
Go find out where
Yamaoka is immediately.

00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:55.289
And until we can find
out who the spy is,

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.824
do not let the Hidden
Leaf get wind of this.

00:10:57.858 --> 00:10:59.927
[Guard] Yes, sir!

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.362
What is the location
of the ransom handoff?

00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:05.465
It's at Point C66 in
one hour, but Milord...

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.601
There's little time, but
I'll get the money somehow.

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:11.071
However, I absolutely cannot
release any of the prisoners.

00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:13.207
We'll negotiate a compromise.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.075
But sir, will the Mujina Gang

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:16.777
actually honor any
of their promises

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.345
once they get
ahold of the money?

00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:20.914
I mean, they aren't
the type to negotiate.

00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:22.482
All I can do is try.

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:25.085
I'm the Land of
Fire's Feudal Lord.

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:27.721
But more, I am Tento's father!

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:31.792
(air whooshing)

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:32.793
Damn it!

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:34.094
I've got to find him.

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.096
They won't get away with this!

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:39.032
(tense music)

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:40.767
Please, Tento...

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.270
I hope that you stay safe.

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:49.643
(cicadas chirping)

00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:52.012
(shurikens clanking)

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.982
(clock ticking)

00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:05.526
-(air whooshing)
-(shurikens clanking)

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.027
Ha, perfect form!

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.530
B-rank or whatever, bring it on!

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:10.631
(knocking)

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:11.665
Huh?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.868
[Boruto] Sarada, you there?

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.170
Boruto?

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:18.572
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:19.973
Do you got a minute?

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.276
Yeah, what's up?

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:27.147
That new mission, I can't do it.

00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:33.487
(cicadas chirping)

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.355
(groaning)

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:38.325
It's something more important
than a B-rank mission?

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:40.460
That's right.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:43.697
(sighing)

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.465
Something you can't talk about?

00:12:46.667 --> 00:12:47.634
Yeah.

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:51.972
(sighing) Mitsuki and I will
take care of everything here.

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:53.974
Go do what you need to do.

00:12:57.578 --> 00:12:58.946
Sarada?

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.180
Uh, yeah?

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:02.749
[Boruto] Thank you.

00:13:02.783 --> 00:13:05.519
(air whooshing)

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.560
(scoffing)

00:13:13.594 --> 00:13:16.463
Oh man, he really
is a piece of work.

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:20.400
(footsteps tapping)

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:25.739
If there is a spy, then I
can't tell the Leaf about this.

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:27.941
I'll just have to
handle it myself.

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:29.409
(air whooshing)

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:32.045
(tense music)

00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:41.655
(whimpering)

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:45.792
(gasping)

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:47.127
[Yamaoka] Hey, Milord.

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:49.129
Huh?

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.965
Tell me, how are you
feeling right now?

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:54.568
(tense music)

00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:58.405
Yamaoka!

00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:02.876
Where are we?

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.912
Quickly, hurry up and untie me!

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:07.381
(grunting)

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:10.417
(groaning)

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.752
Yamaoka, why?

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:14.321
Oh no, please forgive me!

00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:18.559
I haven't introduced
myself to you yet, have I?

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:21.662
(cracking)

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:22.696
Huh?

00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:28.635
-(tense music)
-(loud humming)

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:37.311
(buttons clicking)

00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:43.183
(growling)

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:46.653
(whimpering)

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:53.060
-(groaning)
-(sighing)

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:55.562
Is that you, Yamaoka?

00:14:57.464 --> 00:15:00.968
The real Yamaoka's been
dead for a while now.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:04.338
Hold on, Yamaoka is dead?

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:09.376
Well, it's actually more
like I ate him all up.

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:12.779
(whimpering)

00:15:12.813 --> 00:15:14.748
The Corpse Clone Jutsu.

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:16.016
It's a forbidden Jutsu

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:17.751
through which I can
take on the appearance,

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:21.021
memories, and abilities
of the victims that I eat.

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:23.156
(whimpering)

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.026
Along with their lives.

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:27.594
But just who are you?

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.532
My name is Shojoji.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.702
And I'm one of those ninjas
that you like so much.

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:39.006
Really, you're a ninja?

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.274
What, that's it?

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:42.676
Not the reception I hoped for.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:47.481
I've never seen or heard of
anyone named Shojoji before.

00:15:47.514 --> 00:15:48.282
Hold on.

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:50.017
Are you trying to tell me

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.086
I'm not on one of those
ninja cards of yours?

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.557
But that bastard
Orochimaru's got one, right?

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.126
(whimpering)

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.496
Oh, come on now,
don't be so scared.

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:05.499
We merely have a little business
to conduct with your papa.

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:07.467
We're right in the
middle of negotiating

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.336
some pretty crazy
demands with him.

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:12.206
Naturally, they come with
some strings attached.

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:14.775
You're the reward
for giving in to us.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.677
(whimpering)

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.313
(tense music)

00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:24.318
Point C66 is completely clear.

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.921
Leaf Ninja, haven't
made a move, have they?

00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:30.324
Report back if you
see anything unusual.

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:34.962
-Roger.
-(shuriken clanking)

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:37.931
All right, now lead me
to where your hideout is.

00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:41.134
(crickets chirping)

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:45.639
(air whooshing)

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.140
[Mitsuki] Where's Boruto?

00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:48.675
He's unbelievable!

00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:50.043
He had urgent business

00:16:50.077 --> 00:16:52.412
and can't do the B-rank
mission we waited so long for.

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:55.215
He's just as reckless
and unreliable as ever.

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:57.150
Just what was so urgent?

00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:59.486
He said he couldn't tell me.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.390
But still, I know that
something big is up.

00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:05.325
So what now?

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.395
It's too late to back out of
the B-rank mission, right?

00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:11.365
(sighing)

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.600
(groaning)

00:17:19.907 --> 00:17:21.008
(grunting)

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.543
You were out playing
with shuriken,

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:25.879
pointlessly pretending to be
a real ninja, weren't you?

00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:27.080
(grunting)

00:17:27.114 --> 00:17:28.649
I was training.

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:29.883
(laughing)

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:31.618
You call that training?

00:17:31.652 --> 00:17:32.786
Just face it, kid.

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:34.888
No matter how much
someone like you trains,

00:17:34.922 --> 00:17:37.691
you're still never
gonna be useful at all.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:41.562
But the Feudal Lord of the
Land of Fire will be useful.

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:46.166
After all, money and power
are always at his fingertips.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.334
If you only want money,

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.670
my dad will pay you
whatever you want.

00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:51.471
If it's not enough, look!

00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:52.806
The ultimate black card!

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.341
It'll buy you anything you want!

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.710
So please just take
it and let me go.

00:17:57.945 --> 00:18:00.280
(humming)

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:03.517
(whimpering)

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.019
(crunching)

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:09.890
(whimpering)

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.325
-(spitting)
-(grunting)

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:14.394
Don't make me laugh,
you little brat!

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:16.063
(groaning)

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.599
Your dream is to
become an amazing ninja

00:18:18.632 --> 00:18:21.635
who's worthy enough to be
put on an X Card, right?

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:24.204
But the truth is
everything that you have,

00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:26.673
you only got because
of the money and power

00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:28.208
that your father possesses.

00:18:28.242 --> 00:18:30.444
That's why you'll
never be a real ninja.

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:33.347
All you are and the best
you can ever hope to be

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.484
is a bargaining chip to use
against the Feudal Lord.

00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:38.652
That's it.

00:18:38.685 --> 00:18:40.287
Nothing more.

00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:44.024
On the other hand, I
have my forbidden Jutsu.

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:46.627
I can simply devour
whatever I want.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.797
Once I do, I can make everything
and everyone my pawns.

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:53.534
I'll be able to control
the entire world!

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:56.470
What are you even talking about?

00:18:56.503 --> 00:19:00.874
First, I'll devour
you and become you.

00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:03.143
I'm sure that because
of our demands,

00:19:03.177 --> 00:19:05.812
the Land of Fire
must be in chaos now.

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:07.214
After I finish with you,

00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:09.550
I'll then return to
the Feudal Lord as you,

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:12.186
and act as though
everything's been resolved.

00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:15.689
And after a touching reunion
between father and son,

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:17.191
I'll devour the Feudal Lord

00:19:17.224 --> 00:19:20.427
and seize the reins of
power over the Land of Fire.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.897
But don't worry, I'll
turn it into a nice place

00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:26.767
where evil people
can live peacefully.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.271
-(whimpering)
-(tense music)

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:32.472
-(thudding)
-(grunting)

00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:33.473
(laughing)

00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:34.441
Oh well.

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:36.310
You'll never make it
onto your own X Card,

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.847
but you'll always be a good
little bargaining chip.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.683
I guess you can consider
your dream fulfilled.

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:43.684
(laughing)

00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:46.253
(whimpering)

00:19:51.325 --> 00:19:52.626
I just...

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:54.595
I may not be much right now,

00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:57.564
but one day I want to
be an amazing ninja

00:19:57.598 --> 00:19:59.299
who supports the Hokage.

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:01.635
(whimpering)

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.472
There any word from
the Feudal Lord yet?

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:07.474
Nope, nothing so far.

00:20:07.508 --> 00:20:08.475
(growling)

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:11.345
Doesn't he care what
happens to his son?

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:12.145
Huh?

00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:15.616
-(growling)
-(tense music)

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.050
What's this?

00:20:17.084 --> 00:20:20.087
Don't you dare underestimate me!

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.255
I am kinda curious

00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:23.223
what you plan to do
with a toy like that,

00:20:23.257 --> 00:20:24.758
but just forget it, kid.

00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:28.095
It'll be a pain if you get
hurt before the handoff.

00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:29.730
[Tento] You are no ninja!

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.367
Nobody's ever going to
acknowledge scum like you

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.269
as a true ninja, and that's why

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:37.604
you'll never be on
an X Card either!

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:39.540
What?

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:44.077
I know I may not be as
strong as a real ninja is,

00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:46.747
but I won't be anyone's
bargaining chip!

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.814
(growling)

00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:49.883
If I do this, then
at the very least

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:52.019
I can be helpful to my dad!

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:53.153
No you don't, brat!

00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:57.691
-(explosion booming)
-(tense music)

00:20:57.724 --> 00:21:00.894
(whimpering)

00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:02.896
Quite an admirable move.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.097
I could have never imagined

00:21:04.131 --> 00:21:06.233
you'd have an ace up
your sleeve like that.

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.268
I just, I just
don't want to cause

00:21:08.302 --> 00:21:10.137
any more trouble for my dad!

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.738
Hey, come on, now.

00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:15.809
We can't have you wasting
your precious life like that,

00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:17.878
especially since I'm
still going to need

00:21:17.911 --> 00:21:19.413
to eat your living brain

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:22.649
in order to take your face
for my Corpse Clone Jutsu.

00:21:24.318 --> 00:21:26.520
(growling)

00:21:26.553 --> 00:21:29.156
(tense music)

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:32.759
(whimpering)

00:21:32.793 --> 00:21:35.295
(screaming)

00:21:35.329 --> 00:21:36.296
(grunting)

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.097
(gasping)

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.067
(energetic music)

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:48.675
[Boruto] Tento, you
got some guts, kid.

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:49.977
I'm impressed.

00:21:51.278 --> 00:21:52.412
(gasping)

00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:54.047
Boruto, you came!

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:55.582
You're kinda late!

00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:59.820
(growling)

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:01.154
(spitting)

00:22:01.188 --> 00:22:03.357
Leave the rest of this to me

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.127
because this is a
job for a ninja.

00:22:12.232 --> 00:22:17.404
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.822 --> 00:23:43.357
[Boruto] I should
be asking you that.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.425
What exactly do you
want with my friend?

00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:47.794
You unworthy bastard,
you're no ninja.

00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:49.162
[Shojoji] First the
Feudal Lord's son

00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:50.597
and now the Hokage's?

00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:53.767
Well it seems that I've been
dealt a pretty nice hand here.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.935
[Tento] Why, Boruto?

00:23:54.968 --> 00:23:56.904
Your bodyguard
mission is over now!

00:23:56.937 --> 00:23:58.338
[Boruto] Sorry I'm so late.

00:23:58.372 --> 00:24:01.074
Tento, get back so
you don't get hurt.

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:04.811
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:06.213
Boruto and Tento.

00:24:06.246 --> 00:24:09.383
You hurt my friend, and I
won't let you get away it!

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:16.690
(closing theme music)
