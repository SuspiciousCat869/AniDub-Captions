00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.709
Opening Theme Music)

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.393
(singing in Japanese)

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:50.844
(bright music)

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:51.845
(groans)

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.580
[Cho-Cho] I'm so hungry.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:54.615
(sighs)

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.950
Don't tell me you're
really gonna eat all that.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:59.086
Tomorrow's my first
day off in a long time,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.555
so I've gotta build
up my energy, right?

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:02.689
(giggles)

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:04.491
Hey, go easy there, all right.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:07.861
I won't help you on our trip
if you drop from overeating.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:09.763
You won't have to
worry about that.

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:12.566
Are you guys going
away together?

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.700
[Cho-Cho] Yup.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.537
A four day, three night
gourmet crab extravaganza tour.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.538
(giggles)

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.338
[Sarada] And you?

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.107
My dad got some time off too,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.142
so our family's going fishing.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:23.076
Wow.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.545
That sounds like fun.

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:25.546
(yawns)

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.580
Shikadai?

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:28.081
Aw man.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.216
Listen to this.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.984
I've gotta go to my
mom's family's house

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.686
in the Land of Wind.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.121
It's like me.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:37.424
I'm supposed to go out on a
camping trip with my grandpa.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.325
(giggles)

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.294
-I'm so happy to see you!
-Grandpa!

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.295
Grandpa!

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.095
Come on!

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.331
Yes, it's me, your grandpa!

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.966
(boys sigh)

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.435
Honestly, I'd rather just
be sent on a mission.

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:51.538
My condolences, guys.

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:52.673
Aw man.

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:56.643
I wish that I could be
training with Sasuke instead.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.213
[Shikadai] You mean that you
still haven't heard from him?

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:02.082
You did ask him to
train you, right?

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.150
Yeah, of course,

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.985
but Sasuke told me
that he was gonna

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.087
get in touch with
me via his hawk,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.090
so I've just been here
waiting and waiting.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.826
You really think my dad
is gonna keep his promise?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.595
We don't even know where he is

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.096
or what he could be doing.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.232
I wonder what he's
up to right now.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:21.235
It's like he's out there
camping alone all year round.

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:23.337
There's no way we can
know what he's doing.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.073
That's what's so great about it.

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.208
He's not just tied
down to the village.

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.843
He could still travel the world,

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:32.579
supporting the Hokage
from the shadows.

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:34.548
And that is seriously cool.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.682
Yeah, true.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.385
The job that dad does is
very important, but even so,

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.521
I think that there's
still a lot to learn

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.090
right here in the
Hidden Leaf Village.

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:45.325
Look, textbook honor
student answer.

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.094
Could you please
not put a damper

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.296
on my spirit of adventure?

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.964
(sighs)

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.567
(birds chirp)

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.535
(gasps)

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.337
(hawk screeches)

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.541
Hey!

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.808
I'm over here!

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:03.477
I said I'm over here!

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.484
(bell rings)

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:16.089
Is that a message from Sasuke?

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:17.257
That's right.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.459
I'll have the Cipher
Corps look at it.

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:24.998
(mysterious music)

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:28.101
I gotta say, as Sasuke's
number one student,

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:31.305
I have a right to know what's
inside that scroll, don't I?

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:41.348
Looks like Sasuke's facing
an uphill battle as usual.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.984
The area he's investigating
is way too big.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.220
I mean, that Otsutsuki
guy can teleport through

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.121
other dimensions,
isn't that right?

00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:50.357
But it's just because
he's so elusive

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.860
that Sasuke's our
only real hope.

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:55.229
Look, it says here that
he might be right on

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:58.265
Urashiki Otsutsuki's trail.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.235
It looks like Sasuke's
heading south right now.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.071
We can't communicate
with him for four days.

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:07.941
In the 37th district,
west of the Land of Sand.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:09.943
[Shikamaru] What's there?

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.745
[Yurito] The three
stone pillars.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:13.814
[Clerk] Hey!

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:14.815
Stop!

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:15.983
Come back here!

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:17.551
What's the deal?

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:18.685
What's all this?

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:19.686
Huh?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.821
Sorry.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:22.256
The messenger
hawk's gotten loose.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.092
Man, I could've sworn that
we locked up its tethers.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.960
(hawk screeches)

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.195
Damn it.

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:32.499
(light electronic music)

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.906
All right, I got
Sasuke's location.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.240
And I'm pretty sure that there's

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:42.209
a train to the Land of Wind that

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:43.977
I can catch tomorrow morning.

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:44.978
(chuckles)

00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:46.413
Talk about a great start.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.214
[Sarada] Hey.

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:48.815
What are you all excited about?

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:49.816
Hey Sarada.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.718
I have some really amazing news.

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:52.719
You ready?

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:53.787
What now?

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.122
It's another one
of your fantasies

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.324
about traveling the
world or something?

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.561
It's okay.
Nevermind.

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:02.563
All right.
What's up?

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:03.830
It's nothing, really.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:04.998
All right.

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:07.000
Have fun on your
gourmet food tour!

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.904
Sorry, but this time,
I'm gonna go it alone.

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.673
Being with Team
Seven all the time

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.541
can get kind of boring.

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:15.709
Good grief.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.544
You are so wrapped
up in yourself.

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:20.581
(birds chirp)

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:22.449
A training camp?

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:23.483
Team Seven?

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.419
Yeah.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:26.386
Didn't I tell you?

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.223
I could've sworn that I
told dad all about it.

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:32.092
So, you can't come
with us, big brother?

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.361
Hima, making sure
to train every day

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.697
is very important for a shinobi.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.965
Don't forget.

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.133
Grandpa's gonna be sad.

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.503
Yeah and I feel bad, but still,

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:45.105
I know that grandpa
will understand.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.574
But where will you
stay for a whole week?

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:50.344
At Mitsuki's house, you know?

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:53.680
Well, if he's going
to take care of you,

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:55.449
I have to thank you.

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:56.950
It's no big deal.

00:06:56.984 --> 00:06:59.119
I mean, he lives alone.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.955
But anyway, you guys have
to get going soon, right?

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:03.690
Well, if Sarada's with you,

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:05.459
I guess I don't have to worry.

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:06.827
Yeah. That's right.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.228
You can always count on her.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.364
[Boruto] If I don't
get a move on soon,

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.766
I'm gonna be late to
catch the Thunder Train.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.805
(train hisses)

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.842
Dad gets to stay home, huh?

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.944
You're Gaara's only nephew.

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:27.548
It'll be nice to stop
by on your day off.

00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:28.682
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:30.184
All right, I know.

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:33.086
Give grandpa my best!

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.222
I wish that you
were coming with us!

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.724
Maybe next time, okay?

00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:42.329
(upbeat music)

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:46.834
Aw man, this is really not good.

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.303
(rock music)

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.210
The next one's in three days?

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.312
Would you like to
buy a ticket, sir?

00:07:58.345 --> 00:07:59.613
No, I can't!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.983
Sasuke's gonna be somewhere
entirely different by then!

00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:05.085
I wish that I could help, but...

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.822
(train brakes squeak)

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:09.957
What's that?

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.826
That one is bound
for the Land of Wind,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.828
but it's a freight train.

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:16.430
No passengers.

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:19.066
(rock music)

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.050
Grandpa, Hima, mom, sorry.

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:40.454
(rock music)

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:02.409
So cold.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:03.343
I'm toast!

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:06.747
I should've learned
Fire Style from Sarada.

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:11.084
(train hisses)

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.322
[Inspector A] All clear!

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:17.858
[Inspector B]
Okay! Proceed!

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:21.128
(train horn honks)

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:23.630
[Boruto Voiceover] Land
of Wind, here I come.

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:34.541
Whoa.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:35.475
Close one.

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:37.611
I almost missed the
station for my transfer.

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:46.053
Wait, is this the right place?

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:49.423
(growls)

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:50.224
Damn it!

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:52.459
It's the station after this!

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:55.062
(groans)

00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:59.867
It's only one station.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.035
How far could it be anyway?

00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:05.706
(groans)

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.219
(sighs)

00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:26.593
(breathing heavily)

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:29.496
Need to...find Sasuke.

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:38.605
-(groans)
-(wind howling)

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:53.487
Water.

00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:03.230
Oh wow.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.066
Finding someone out
here is super rare.

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:20.147
(groans)

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:23.884
Hold up.

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:25.185
Where am I?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.888
Oh great.

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:29.056
Thank goodness!

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:31.692
I was afraid you weren't
going to wake up.

00:11:31.725 --> 00:11:34.761
Are you the person who saved me?

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:35.762
Yeah.

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:37.231
My name is Isago.

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:39.466
This house is my dad's and mine.

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:42.169
My name is Boruto.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.004
Hey, wait.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.405
How long was I out?

00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:48.575
It's been a whole day now.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.447
Then that means...Sasuke
is coming tomorrow!

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:55.916
Ow, ow!

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:58.652
The heat got to you and
you collapsed out there.

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.521
You still need to rest a bit.

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.224
(gulps)

00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:06.760
So, how long does it
take to get to the

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:08.328
Thunder Train station?

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.897
[Isago] Even if you leave now,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.698
you won't get
there 'til evening.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:12.933
[Boruto] It's that far?

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:14.067
[Isago] Yeah.

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:16.236
We're in a pretty
isolated area out here.

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:19.873
Man, this sucks.

00:12:19.907 --> 00:12:21.808
No matter what, somehow
I've gotta get on

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:23.477
tomorrow's Thunder Train.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.412
Why don't you stay
here one more night?

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:28.182
You can make it if
you go in the morning.

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:29.883
Okay?

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:30.884
Will you do that?

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:31.885
You should!

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.287
You should definitely do that.

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:36.190
He's up?

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.195
Then you can leave.

00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:47.334
Please don't be mad
at my dad, okay?

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:48.535
Please?

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:50.137
He just doesn't like ninja.

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.581
(mysterious music)

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.651
[Boruto] Have animals
been damaging your garden?

00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:06.286
[Gojyo] More or less.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.655
Please, let me help
you out with that.

00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:10.490
No thanks.

00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:12.559
I want nothing to
do with shinobi!

00:13:14.862 --> 00:13:17.497
Why do you live in
such an isolated place?

00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:21.502
Isago doesn't have any friends
and she seems pretty bored.

00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:22.703
You're young.

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:26.440
You don't know what the Fourth
Great Ninja War was like.

00:13:28.242 --> 00:13:30.210
It was a horrible war.

00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:32.713
My whole village was
burned to the ground

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:37.551
and not by our enemies,
by our own side.

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:38.752
But why?

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:43.524
Destroy any and all areas where
the enemy could be hiding.

00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:46.293
That's what the shinobi who
burned down my village said.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.428
To protect the headquarters,

00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:51.064
it was a sacrifice
that needed to be made.

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.301
They allowed these
small sacrifices

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.503
so that bigger goals
could be attained.

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:59.473
Typical shinobi thinking.

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.407
Hold on.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.643
Look, I would never
think like that.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.077
Well, who knows.

00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:06.380
Hard times make people change.

00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:12.219
I don't want Isago to face that.

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:14.121
That's why I live out here.

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:19.259
(groans)

00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:21.628
(yells)

00:14:21.662 --> 00:14:23.297
Not this one again!

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.999
(giggles)

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:30.871
-(alarm rings)
-(gasps)

00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:32.372
Isago, stay here!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:35.342
Who's there?

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.376
Come out!

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:38.545
What's this?

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:43.851
I don't believe
animals did this.

00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:45.419
There are some
people who want to

00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:48.288
turn this area
into a power plant.

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:50.791
They keep harassing
us to make us move.

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:52.226
What? Really?

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:54.161
But you own the land
here, don't you?

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:57.764
I do, but building a
power plant would improve

00:14:57.798 --> 00:14:59.933
the lives of a lot of people.

00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:02.603
Apparently, it's just
a small sacrifice.

00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:04.371
But that's...

00:15:05.806 --> 00:15:07.174
I won't leave!

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:09.409
I've worked hard
for the life I have!

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:11.645
Dad.

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:13.013
I told you to stay inside.

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:14.515
It's dangerous out here.

00:15:23.824 --> 00:15:25.225
I really think you oughta stay

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:27.294
for at least one more night.

00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:28.262
I can't.

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:30.964
I better get going or I
won't make it in time.

00:15:30.998 --> 00:15:32.232
You're mean, Boruto!

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:33.233
Hey!

00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:34.234
Come on!

00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:36.970
Thank you too, mister!

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:40.941
-(growls)
-Wow.

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.176
What the hell?

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.045
Take care, Isago.

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.916
I don't care if
you collapse again!

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:49.917
Damn it!

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.885
I'm cutting this really close!

00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:52.986
Oh please.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.255
I really hope that
Sasuke will wait for me.

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:59.259
(hawk screeches)

00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:03.830
Don't tell me they're the ones.

00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:06.400
(rock music)

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.036
(laughs)

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:11.772
Now that's what I call
potent weed killer.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.073
Nice, bro.

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.809
That dad and his kid will
move out for sure now.

00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:17.244
Of course they will.

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:21.481
After what they did last time,
they'll pay 100 times over.

00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:24.051
(rock music)

00:16:25.686 --> 00:16:26.753
(groans)

00:16:26.787 --> 00:16:28.388
They're gonna be in danger.

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:31.825
Today's the day!

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:34.027
You're gonna leave this place!

00:16:34.061 --> 00:16:35.796
You wanna get beat up again?

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.364
Come on, don't be that way.

00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:40.567
This is just what you
call a small sacrifice.

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:41.835
No way.

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:45.472
Hey, listen, we're only
trying to be nice to you here.

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:47.641
(screams)

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.276
Isago!

00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:51.612
(trembles)

00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:52.946
Hands off my daughter!

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.147
First things first,

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:55.883
how 'bout you give me
something in writing,

00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:58.418
that you agree to hand
over all of your land

00:16:58.452 --> 00:16:59.953
completely to us?

00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:00.954
No, dad!

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:02.256
Please don't!

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:09.296
Yeah, okay.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.297
I'll do it.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:11.164
All right.

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:12.432
To celebrate our agreement,

00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:15.169
stay spraying the
weed killer, boys!

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.037
But we haven't
harvested the crops yet.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.472
Well that's just too bad because

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:21.208
all of this is in the
way of the power plant.

00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:23.443
I can't believe he
bought our story.

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:26.413
Man, just how pathetic
are these backwater hicks?

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:29.816
You mean, all of that was made
up from the very beginning?

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.351
Huh?

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:32.352
Ow!

00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:33.520
Man, that hurts!

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:34.521
[Isago] Boruto!

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:35.556
You came back!

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:36.957
Who the hell is this kid?

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.759
Stay out of this!

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.160
Take some advice.

00:17:40.194 --> 00:17:42.996
Study your foe before
opening your mouth.

00:17:43.997 --> 00:17:45.199
Rasengan!

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.936
(men tremble)

00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:50.337
I've been thinking,

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.873
maybe I oughta tell my good
friend Gaara about all of this.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.541
Come on kid, quit lying.

00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:55.676
You don't know him.

00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:57.778
You wanna take that chance?

00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:00.080
[Thug] This isn't
over, you hear me?

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:03.016
Get lost and don't ever
come back you idiots!

00:18:04.318 --> 00:18:07.621
Boruto, why did you
decide to come back here?

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:10.891
I just happened to run into
those thugs, that's all.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.694
But are you guys
okay, Mr. Gojyo?

00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:14.895
Really?

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.030
You're friends with
Lord Gaara, Boruto?

00:18:17.064 --> 00:18:19.733
Well, more like he's
a friend of a friend.

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:21.869
Oh no!

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:22.903
The Thunder Train!

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:23.904
(giggles)

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:24.905
Oh well.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.673
I doubt that I'll make it now.

00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:27.908
(growls)

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.410
It's for someone you
rarely see, right?

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:33.180
You gave that up just to
come back and help us?

00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:35.148
Well, I couldn't ignore it.

00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:37.818
Not after seeing what was
going on with you guys.

00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:40.387
Thank you for
coming back, Boruto!

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.889
Thanks so much!

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:44.057
Boruto, come with me.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.168
I built this trolley
so Isago could escape

00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:57.070
in case we ever got
involved in another fight.

00:18:57.104 --> 00:19:00.073
Boruto, take it to the station.

00:19:00.107 --> 00:19:02.376
Mr. Gojyo, thank you so much!

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:04.278
(rock music)

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:05.078
See you!

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:07.314
Good luck, Boruto!

00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:09.516
I'll come back to
visit before too long!

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.052
(rock music)

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:16.490
I think I need to speed
this thing up a bit.

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:19.059
(rock music)

00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:24.231
Wow!

00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:25.365
Amazing!

00:19:25.399 --> 00:19:27.701
(rock music)

00:19:30.804 --> 00:19:31.939
[Gojyo Voiceover]
These tracks will

00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:33.507
take you to the
Thunder Train's tracks.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.843
From there, you can hop
on the Thunder Train

00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:37.244
and get to your destination.

00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:44.284
(train horn blows)

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.089
(bell rings)

00:19:49.122 --> 00:19:52.025
(train hisses)

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:54.595
(rock music)

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.740
This is it.

00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:08.575
Sasuke's supposed
to be around here.

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:14.948
Looks like he hasn't
even arrived yet.

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:16.183
(chuckles)

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.552
I just can't wait
for him to train me.

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:22.656
Wait a sec.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.691
Sasuke's...

00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:27.261
Is he fighting with someone?

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:36.870
Gaara, go!

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:37.938
Don't worry.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:39.540
I'll hold them off.

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:40.807
You really think so?

00:20:40.841 --> 00:20:42.442
Not so fast!

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.913
(rumbles)

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:47.481
Before the main event begins,

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:51.118
I'll be taking some chakra
from the both of you guys.

00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:54.555
Hey, Sasuke!

00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:55.556
Boruto?

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:56.924
What are you doing out here?

00:20:56.957 --> 00:20:58.192
Well, well.

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:03.430
It would appear that even
more prey has arrived.

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:05.365
You're one of them.

00:21:05.399 --> 00:21:08.669
I'm Urashiki Otsutsuki
and I'm pleased

00:21:08.702 --> 00:21:10.304
to make your acquaintance!

00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:15.442
Boruto, get out of here!

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:21.548
Get going!

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:22.950
You're no match for him!

00:21:22.983 --> 00:21:25.419
Come on! You know I
can't just run away!

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.388
Just listen to me!

00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:30.691
(gasps)

00:21:35.796 --> 00:21:37.197
I really must say,

00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:40.701
these puppets Toneri gave me
sure have come in very handy.

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:43.704
(laughs evilly)

00:21:44.805 --> 00:21:46.006
Oh no. Sasuke.

00:21:48.842 --> 00:21:51.612
[Urashiki] My, what nice chakra.

00:21:51.645 --> 00:21:53.280
Don't underestimate me!

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:01.655
So weak, you don't
stand a chance.

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:06.059
Sasuke, no!

00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:14.168
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:30.117 --> 00:22:34.188
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:43.857 --> 00:23:46.560
If this continues,
Shukaku'll be captured!

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:49.029
Shinki, Boruto, take
Shukaku to the Leaf!

00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:51.565
[Shinki] Why do I have
to do this with him?

00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:52.566
[Boruto] Leave it to me!

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:55.035
If it's a request from
you Gaara, I'm on it!

00:23:55.068 --> 00:23:56.203
[Shinki] I object,

00:23:56.236 --> 00:23:58.605
but just don't fall
behind, Boruto Uzumaki.

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:01.008
[Boruto] Quit using my
full name all the time.

00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:04.411
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:08.081
"The Entrusted Mission:
Protect the One Tails!"

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:10.717
I'll make sure this mission's
a success, you know?
