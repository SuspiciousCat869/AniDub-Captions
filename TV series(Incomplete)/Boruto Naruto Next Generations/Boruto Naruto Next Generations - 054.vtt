00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.877
So, you're
Naruto's son.
Your name?

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.881
It's Boruto...
Uzumaki.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.415
<i>(Hinata)</i>
<i>What's going on,</i>
<i>Boruto?</i>

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.318
Is that really...

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.853
Sasuke!

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.388
It is!

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.358
Is Naruto here?

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.693
I think he's still
at the Hokage's office.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.629
[gasp]

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:33.600
I see. Sorry
to intrude.

<i>...Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.509
But never mind all
that now...

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.478
I've gotta go beat up that
stupid old man!

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.079
Boruto, please! Wait!

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:49.983
[grunt] Hey! What
the hell do you think
you're doing!?

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:52.719
Your mother told
you to wait, didn't
she?

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.154
Mind your own
business, would ya?!

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:58.625
You said "stupid old man." Let
me guess: you meant Naruto?

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.061
Yeah, you got
that right.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.699

Lord Seventh, I'm coming in!

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.795
Hey, what happened?!

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:19.099
Oh, uh... Well guess I messed
up Himawari's birthday just now

Oh... You sent a Shadow
Clone to the house?

I told you that you should
just go on home today.

preparations for the

Also... there's White
Zetsu and those ruins...

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.291
It's been ten years since the
Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.426
For them to show up now...
It's troubling.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.262
Yeah.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:49.763
Huh?

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.299
A gift from Kaguya's Palace.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.567
[gasps]

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.635

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.745
I see...

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:05.946
What is it?
What does it say?

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.715
Hm. I dunno!

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.250
[sigh]

00:04:10.284 --> 00:04:12.753
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this.

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.888
I can't even read it
with my Rinnegan.

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:18.292
Let's get this over to the
Cipher Corps and see what
they say.

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:22.095
Sasuke, you said,
"Kaguya's Palace?"

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.498
Yeah, I finally
located it.

00:04:58.332 --> 00:05:00.501
<i>(Sasuke)</i>
<i>Kaguya Otsutsuki...</i>

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:05.906
<i>With her warped hunger for</i>
power, she tried to enslave the
<i>entire world...</i>

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.878
During the Fourth Great Ninja
War, we were able to seal her
<i>away...</i>

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:14.648
<i>after so many sacrificed</i>
<i>their lives...</i>

Six Paths Planetary Devastation!

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:23.223
<i>However... she wasn't acting</i>
<i>merely out of a longing for</i>
<i>power.</i>

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:28.128
As to what the true reason for
<i>her vigilance was,</i>

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.932
...I've been searching for the
<i>answer to that ever since...</i>

besides us could enter this
place.

On guard!

he switched places!?

[low chuckle]

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:56.683
How careless, Kinshiki.

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:06.360
Oh? The Rinnegan?

00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:09.897
Tell me, just what is it that
you're searching for here?

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.101
And where is Kaguya Otsutsuki?

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:18.572
You mean you don't know?
Kaguya's not here anymore.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.474
Huh?

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:21.808
[low growl]

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:25.746
You're going to tell us
everything you know about
all of this.

[attack cry]

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:32.519

I'll be at a disadvantage.

You won't get away!

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:55.776
Otsutsuki?

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.878
Yeah. That's what he
called himself.

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:03.617
There's no doubt that he
belongs to the exact same
Otsutsuki Clan as Kaguya.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.252
This is a real crisis!

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:07.421
Is this gonna be the
start of another war?

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.122
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>that yet.</i>

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:12.593
But we do have to
make sure that
we're very careful.

00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:15.229
[sigh]

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:19.366
We can't allow a war
like that to happen
ever again.

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:27.107
Hm? Oh, my jacket.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.243
Why do you have that?

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:31.311
I found it on
the way here.

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:32.412
Hm?

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:34.748
It was on the ground
by your house.

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.917
[gasp]

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.652
Oh, I see.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.121
And I also met
your kid.

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:43.824
He seems just like you
back when you were young.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.260
No, you're wrong.
He's nothing like I was.

00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:49.630
He's a lot more... like
you when you were young.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:58.872
No. Actually, I take that
back. He's different than
you were then, too.

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.807
All the clothes that he wears
are always crisp and clean,

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.743
like they're still brand
new or something.

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:08.115
I guess... you and I
are just behind the
times, huh?

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:13.754
No way. You're wrong,
you know that?

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:14.821
Huh?

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.591
The soul of a
shinobi never changes.

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:20.561
Even if the times do.

00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:23.263
[chuckle] I doubt that.

00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:26.934
Trust me, I think the
winner of this contest
is me.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:31.171
You're one to talk,
loser.

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:38.245
Huh?

00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:44.017
[gasp]

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.154
Sasuke...?

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:50.290
Were you in there
talking to my dad?

00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:51.425
We're done.

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:53.160
Oh, okay.

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:55.429
You said you wanted to beat up
your dad, right?

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:57.331
Yeah.

00:09:57.364 --> 00:10:00.734
and if you try to interfere with
that... I'm not gonna hold back!

00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:05.839
Hey! What the hell?

00:10:05.873 --> 00:10:09.376
At your strength, you really
think you're ready to take him
on?

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:11.778
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>I never saw him coming.</i>

00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:13.247
[low growl]

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.315
Listen, here's some
advice for you.

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:19.253
The way you are right now,
you're never even gonna get
close to him.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.622
Just go home before
you get hurt, okay?

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:24.758
Forget that! Let's
do this!

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.327
[clone grunts]

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:32.933
He's so strong!

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.568
Are you satisfied?

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:38.405
There. Now you know
just how strong you are.

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:41.742
Amazing!

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:42.943
Huh?

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.445
I guess the rumors
were true after all!

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:48.582
You used to be
Dad's rival, didn't you?

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:54.888
So, uh, could you...
please make me your student!

00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:56.290
Student?

00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:02.596
Please, I... I just have to
bring down my dad no matter
what it takes.

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:06.767
But, why? Why go so far to rebel
against your father?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.905
Because, he only sent a Shadow
Clone to my little sister's
birthday party!

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:17.578
He broke a sacred promise
between us! I won't
forgive him!

00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:20.080
Being Hokage's a difficult job.

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:22.115
Some things are beyond
his control.

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.451
I'm so tired of
hearing that!

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:29.089
And besides, since I became
a genin, he keeps treating
me like a kid...

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:31.091
He hardly even notices me...

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:37.931
<i>(Sasuke)</i>
<i>I get it now... looks</i>
<i>brand new.</i>

00:11:37.965 --> 00:11:39.166
Hm?

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:45.606
Are you even able to
perform the Rasengan?

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.608
Huh? The Rasengan?

00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:52.713
Rasengan's the one where you do
<i>a Change in Chakra Form or</i>
<i>whatever, isn't it...?</i>

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:55.148
<i>(Sasuke)</i>
<i>You want to get back</i>

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:55.649
Huh?

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.088
Look, at this stage if you
can't even pull that off,
then...

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.258
Without that, you can't
be a student of mine.

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.593
Hey!

00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:11.698

you'll make me your student?
Is that right?

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:18.438
That'll be a piece of cake, ya
know! I'll go and master it
right away!

Huh? What's all this about?

00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:35.722
Please, you just gotta teach me
how to do the Rasengan!

00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:37.925
Right now! I have to master it!
There's no time to waste!

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.795
I see...!

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:46.333
It's for the Chunin Exams, huh?
To shock the Seventh Hokage!
Is that correct?

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:49.703
All right! At last you're
talking like a real shinobi!

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.405
Uh, yeah... sure.

who gets to pass on this jutsu
<i>to the Hokage's son!</i>

Oh, Lord Fourth, Lord Seventh!
I will not fail to fulfill this

Where did your enthusiasm go?!
Come on, just try again.

Watch me, then do
it, like this!

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.567
I know, I know! But "like this"
isn't working "like that" at
all!

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.403
Hey, don't mock me by
repeating my words!

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:26.907
No, I'm not! it's just "this"
isn't acting "like this!"

"This" means this thing in
this hand here...
