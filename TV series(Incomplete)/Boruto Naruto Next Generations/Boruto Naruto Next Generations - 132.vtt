WEBVTT

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.942
(yawns)

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.745
I can't believe he
called us out this early.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.213
Not cool, Pervy Sage!

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.883
Probably because he wants
us to get way stronger

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.218
before Urashiki
attacks us again.

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.554
We don't have any choice here.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.622
(grumbles)

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.358
First of all, is there
really even time to train?

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.960
I think so. The
guy's super cautious.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.262
If he messes up once,

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.898
then he won't come back at
us right away, you know?

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.899
Oh yeah?

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.634
You sure know a lot about him.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:34.635
Yeah. Kinda.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.071
But I'm just repeating
what Sasuke told me.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.207
Well, anyway, if you're a Ninja,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.010
then you should have told me
that right from the beginning.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.012
A traveling performer, my butt!

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.613
Oh, sorry.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:48.148
You may know who I am now

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:50.083
but this is still
a secret mission.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.819
So I couldn't just blab
my identity to everyone.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.721
I have good reasons for that.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.425
Well, guess it can't be helped.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.295
Now, you said that
Urashiki guy wants

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:04.464
to take the Nine Tails' Chakra
that's inside of me, right?

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.567
Yeah.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.669
And preventing that from
happening is the mission

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:09.703
we're on.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.211
Well that doesn't change that

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.946
we're training to
bring him down.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:19.947
All right.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.948
I'll trust you.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.182
Okay.

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:24.952
Ah, ha!

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.087
So you guys are finally here.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.324
All right, then, shall we
get started on your training?

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:36.463
(opening theme music)

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.728
"Jiraiya's Assignment"

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.129
Now, listen up.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:18.832
That guy who calls himself
Urashiki is enigmatic

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:20.367
and he's very strong.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.569
We know that his
target is Naruto.

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.171
And since he knows who you are,

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.341
we're gonna have to work out a
countermeasure to thwart him.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.444
That's why we're training, huh?

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:31.345
Okay.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.580
But why do I have to
train with Boruto?

00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:34.615
Well, for some reason,

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:38.585
your chakra natures
are extremely similar.

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:39.820
What, they are?

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.555
(grumbles)

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:42.823
I wonder why that is.

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:44.658
I noticed that in
battle earlier,

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:48.095
Naruto's chakra was somehow
synchronized with yours.

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:49.963
Usually synchronizing chakra

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.299
with someone else
is very difficult.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.802
Let's just get the
hell out of here.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.037
Okay?

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:00.407
(struggles)

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.747
Therefore, I'm gonna have
the two of you guys train

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.116
so that you'll be able to
consciously synchronize

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.951
your chakra with each other.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.587
Our chakra will be synchronized?

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.521
Yeah.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:16.857
If we can get both
of you to synchronize

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.092
then we might get a
Collaboration Jutsu

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:20.827
that's never been seen before.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.963
Something like that
might catch Urashiki

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.432
totally off guard, right?

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.834
Oh yeah.
Oh man.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.001
That sounds great.

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:29.937
So what kind of jutsu
are we talking about?

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.105
Is it way stronger
than the Rasengan?

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.941
I have no idea at all.

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:35.342
-What?!
-What?!

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:39.179
But it might become clearer
as you train to synchronize.

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:43.183
So first of all, let's get
your bodies moving together.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:48.589
Let's do this.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:49.623
Yeah.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:02.669
Hard. Isn't it?

00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:04.404
Come on.
Let's try it again.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:12.913
What the hell?

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:14.248
We can't do it at all.

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:16.583
Hey, are you even
trying to do this right?

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:17.818
What did you say?

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.821
Maybe you're the one who can't
even infuse Chakra properly.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:22.489
Hey, no fighting.

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.259
Look, there aren't even
many jonin who are able

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.828
to synchronize their
chakra effectively.

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:30.430
So what are we
supposed to do then?

00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:31.632
To synchronize,

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.134
picture aligning your chakra
wavelength to your partner's

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.904
as you infuse your own chakra.

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:39.339
Of course that's
easier said than done.

00:05:39.373 --> 00:05:41.909
You got to sense your
partner's chakra.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:45.312
Breathe in unison, match
it's flow and power.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.182
And then on top of all that,
change it's chakra nature.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.750
It's very difficult.

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.654
So the main thing we
have to do is figure out

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.422
how to match our flow and power.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:56.390
Right?

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:58.792
Unlike Naruto, you're
quick to catch on.

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.994
That's exactly what you do.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.462
Hey, I knew that.

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:03.463
Come on.

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:05.165
Even I worked that out.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.968
Anyway. Flow and power.

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.636
If you can't breathe in unison /\Ã©

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.073
you won't be able to
synchronize your chakra either.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.608
Since this is
something intuitive

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:18.345
there's no other way to learn it
except by just doing it.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.948
So we just have to
breathe in unison?

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.650
Okay then. That'll
be a piece of cake.

00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:25.519
Hey, let's try it again.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:26.553
Okay.

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.330
What's wrong?

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:37.364
It's nothing.

00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.072
Damn it!

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:47.174
Again.

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.046
It's not working.

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:56.216
(snorring)

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.219
Huh? Oh that wasn't
just a little catnap.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.488
Man, I was out like a light.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.824
Oh.

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.292
Were you able to synchronize?

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:06.326
Huh?

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:11.832
Come on.

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:14.234
Just give us a hint at least.

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:15.235
Let's see.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:16.470
All right.

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:20.240
When you to infuse chakra,
what are you visualizing?

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:22.943
Huh? What am I visualizing?

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:26.280
I picture a
gathering in my palm.

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:27.981
Ah, I see.

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:30.050
You're able to do the Rasengan.

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:31.251
Yeah, but...

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.854
Huh? Wait, you can do it too?

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:34.855
How can you?

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:36.256
Where did you learn it?

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.457
Huh?

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:38.592
Well...

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.993
All right, come on now.

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:41.728
There's no need to pry.

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:43.063
You probably have some secret

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:45.732
that you don't want
to tell us, right?

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.167
Yeah.

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.168
Huh?

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.336
Wait.

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.706
But how is the Rasengan related
to the rest of this stuff?

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:56.243
Of course, if we're trying
to synchronize our chakra

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:58.212
we should concentrate
on a single point.

00:07:58.245 --> 00:07:59.513
Like with the Rasengan.

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.082
It'll be easier to match
our flow and power.

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:03.617
That's right.

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:07.487
Okay. What does
that mean exactly?

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.256
It means that up
until this point,

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:10.791
we've just been blindly trying

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.492
to get our chakra to synchronize

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:15.796
but that only makes it easier
for our strength to scatter

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.130
instead of combining.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.867
With the Rasengan, you
gather highly dense chakra

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.468
at a single point in your palm.

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:24.738
So that should be an easier
way for you to approach this.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.074
I get it.

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:29.443
And that means...

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:31.411
Not that again.

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:33.213
A ball?

00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:36.316
You got to go back to the
basics to make this work.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.217
Hold on.

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:39.086
Isn't Rasengan training
supposed to begin

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:40.821
with a water balloon?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.523
Yeah, but we can
already do the Rasengan.

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:45.092
So all we really need to
do is practice getting

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.861
our rotation and
powering unison.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:50.264
Unlike Naruto, you're
quick to catch on.

00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:51.798
That's sure to be a big help.

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:55.702
Actually, I was just about
to say the very same thing.

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:57.104
Oh, really?

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:59.072
Step one is to create flow.

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:00.974
That is, you two
want to have rotation

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:02.910
and power at the same time.

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:05.312
Just like you did in
Rasengan training.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:08.649
So if you can break that
ball, you've done it.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:09.983
Just leave it to me.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.052
Yeah, let's do this.

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:23.964
Damn it.
Come on.

00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:25.933
At least now we know
what to visualize.

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.668
So I'm sure we can do it.

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:28.669
All right.

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:29.970
I've taught you the technique.

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:32.039
Now your job is to practice
getting your breathing

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.807
into harmony with each other.

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:34.975
That'll be key.

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:37.277
Huh? Where do you
think you're going?

00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.580
I've got an errand to run.

00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:41.448
Just keep at it, okay?

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:45.085
He's probably going to peep.

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.854
Anyway. Let's keep going.

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:48.088
Yeah.

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:53.460
Breathing in unison

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.762
is easier said than done.

00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:58.198
I wonder what'll happen.

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:03.604
(intense music)

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.145
(ball streaching)

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:14.715
Again.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:28.729
Come on.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.732
Hey. Get in sync with me.

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:32.933
You're all over the place.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.701
That's why we can't do it.

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.436
Come on, again.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.473
(ball streaching)

00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:44.545
(Naruto growling)

00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:55.422
Let's just take a
little break, okay?

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:56.423
No way.

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:57.724
Not yet.

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:59.793
I'm not just gonna give up.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:00.961
Not for this.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.264
I got to get stronger
to bring my friend back.

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:06.066
I can't afford to stop now.

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:13.140
I get it.

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:20.480
My bad.

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:27.855
I'm out of chakra.

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:29.423
Listen, are you all right?

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.192
(gasp)

00:11:38.332 --> 00:11:39.333
Sorry.

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:41.568
No.

00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:48.342
Sorry.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.744
Listen. Can we take a
little break please?

00:11:57.718 --> 00:11:58.719
Damn it.

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:00.454
Why'd I do that?

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.323
Why am I such a horrible person?

00:12:11.298 --> 00:12:16.069
And now, I don't have anyone
I can talk to about this.

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:19.072
(attack yells)

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:21.742
That voice.

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:25.712
Not even close.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.552
Mom and

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:32.686
Uncle Neji?

00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:42.429
You've really improved,

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:43.430
Lady Hinata.

00:12:43.463 --> 00:12:45.699
And it's all thanks to
you training with me,

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:47.034
Big brother Neji.

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:50.337
But despite that I
have a long way to go.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.138
Not so.

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:53.006
You've grown much stronger.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.075
Your spirit was
already quite strong

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.044
and your body's catching up.

00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:59.613
Thanks so much for saying that.

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.014
Well, let's call it a day.

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:04.017
Please stay and at
least have some tea.

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:06.220
You're from the
Hyuga main family.

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:08.121
I'm from the branch family.

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:09.489
For appearances sake,

00:13:09.523 --> 00:13:12.693
you really shouldn't
treat me as an equal.

00:13:12.726 --> 00:13:13.727
I'm sorry.

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:18.632
Perhaps we can have tea
after my next mission.

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.501
Okay, brother Neji.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.171
Uh oh!

00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:27.241
Why have you been
loitering here?

00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.810
So you knew all along?

00:13:29.843 --> 00:13:31.011
Of course I did.

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:32.479
Lady Hinata might
not have noticed

00:13:32.513 --> 00:13:34.815
but to me you were
right in plain view.

00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:35.816
I see.

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:37.751
Why are you so
formal with my mo-

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:39.152
I mean Lady Hinata?

00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:41.889
She's the heir to the
Hyuga Clan's main family.

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:43.457
I'm from the branch family.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.992
She's like my lord.

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:47.995
But she calls you
big brother, right?

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:50.964
Yes. We were raised
together like siblings.

00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:53.100
I've often told her
not to call me that

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:56.336
but Lady Hinata
just won't listen.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.975
Did something happen?

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:08.415
Ah, I see.

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:10.551
So Naruto did that.

00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:13.854
Has that sort of thing
happened before with him?

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:15.856
Without details,
I can't be sure.

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.224
But it's not the first time

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:18.992
his power's gone out of control.

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:20.661
What, really?

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.698
A power like that
with so many unknowns.

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:26.133
That's the reason why it appears

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.734
that he's always been a loner.

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:33.473
Do you feel pity for Naruto?

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:36.410
Well, I mean wouldn't
anyone feel the same way?

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:37.744
You've got it wrong.

00:14:37.778 --> 00:14:41.648
Don't simply write him off as
someone who should be pitied.

00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:48.355
No one can decide
your fate except you.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.423
What?

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:52.125
Naruto personally
taught me that.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.493
He did?

00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:54.528
Really?

00:14:54.862 --> 00:14:56.129
Long ago,

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:58.765
I used to curse the fate
that had been given to me.

00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:02.603
Simply by being born
into the branch family,

00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:05.606
I'd never be considered an
equal in the Hyuga clan.

00:15:07.307 --> 00:15:09.209
Then my father passed away.

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:12.613
I resigned myself to accepting
I'd never escape my destiny

00:15:12.646 --> 00:15:14.948
of being from the branch family.

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:16.183
But then,

00:15:17.818 --> 00:15:22.956
the one who beat that twisted
cowardice out of me was him

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.059
who'd also had a terrible
fate forced upon him.

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:28.996
I told you.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:32.633
I just don't know
when to give up.

00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:33.834
Why bother?

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:38.005
Why fight a hopeless battle,
trying to defy your destiny?

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:40.541
Because people
called me a failure.

00:15:40.574 --> 00:15:42.876
If you think it's futile
to fight then don't.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.511
Just stand there and take it.

00:15:47.514 --> 00:15:49.616
I'll change the way
of the Hyuga Clan

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.318
when I become Hokage.

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:56.356
I didn't know that happened
between Dad and Uncle Neji.

00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:00.494
Even right Naruto is
fighting his fate.

00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:02.029
A cruel lonely destiny

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:04.765
of harboring a dangerous
power inside his body

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.066
since his birth.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.202
A truly heartless fate

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:11.738
that could pit him against
his friend to the death.

00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:12.973
You mean?

00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:15.275
What am I doing?

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.311
I think that I've said too much.

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:20.113
This isn't like me.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:23.750
To think I'd say all this
to a traveling performer

00:16:23.784 --> 00:16:25.519
whose name I don't even know.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.324
Perhaps it's because you
kind of remind me of Naruto.

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:36.196
Anyway he doesn't need pity
or to be looked down upon.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:41.835
It's natural to be afraid
of power that's so immense,

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:45.272
but I think facing him head
on and moving forward with him

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:48.175
will allow your
strength to grow.

00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:57.017
Thank you so much for that Neji.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.219
I'm going to head
back now, you know?

00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:01.455
Right.

00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:05.392
I should have asked
what his name is.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.664
(hawking wares, haggling)

00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:15.102
Oh, there you are.

00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:19.072
Listen. Can I ask you
to do me a little favor?

00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:21.141
Would you mind taking
them something to eat

00:17:21.175 --> 00:17:22.609
after they train?

00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:24.077
And why ask me?

00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:26.413
I can't seem to
find your companion

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:29.016
and I have to go get
some things ready.

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:30.584
I'm counting on you.

00:17:30.617 --> 00:17:31.852
-Hey.
-All right then.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.054
Make sure that you
bring it to them.

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:53.073
Hey, you're going to
catch a cold out here.

00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:54.975
Huh? Mr.

00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:00.013
So are you upset,

00:18:00.047 --> 00:18:02.349
because you ended
up hurting Boruto?

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:07.754
I mean it's not like you
hurt him on purpose, right?

00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:09.890
No, of course not.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:12.092
But that isn't
quite good enough.

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:14.595
If I let Nine
Tails take me over.

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:17.364
Mr.

00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:19.733
Do you have a friend
that's important to you?

00:18:21.969 --> 00:18:23.437
I do.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.838
I have this one friend

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:27.074
although he's actually
more than that.

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:30.010
He's really a rival right now.

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.245
'Cause we feel differently

00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:33.881
we fought and went
our separate ways.

00:18:33.914 --> 00:18:37.417
But still I can't
just abandon him.

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:39.553
He probably thinks it's
none of my business

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.622
and I'm just being a pest.

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:44.024
So you're saying all the
training you're going through

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:45.959
with Jiraiya is for him?

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.495
I've got to get
stronger no matter what

00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:52.666
so that I can talk to
Sasuke just one more time,

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:56.370
but it's hopeless.

00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:59.740
I lost control and
ended up hurting Boruto.

00:18:59.773 --> 00:19:01.041
At this rate.

00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:08.248
Let me tell you a
story about my friend.

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:12.953
Long ago, to reach a
goal he chose a path

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:15.289
that separated him
from his friend.

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:19.059
He believed he had to sever
all his bonds to become strong.

00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:21.828
He didn't understand the truth.

00:19:21.862 --> 00:19:25.032
More like he didn't
try to understand.

00:19:25.065 --> 00:19:26.900
But he had a good friend

00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:29.469
who thought about
him more than anyone.

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:30.604
No way.

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:32.706
So what happened to that guy?

00:19:34.107 --> 00:19:36.610
His friend finally knocked
some sense into him

00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:40.013
and never once gave up on him,

00:19:40.047 --> 00:19:43.283
even though others
would have done so.

00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:46.086
And that friend never
went back on his word.

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:49.389
I guess that he really
just hated losing.

00:19:50.924 --> 00:19:52.993
A sore loser, huh?

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.729
I got to say, I can
kind of relate to that.

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:56.864
You know?

00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:57.998
I'll bet.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:19:59.566
So tell me in the end,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.369
were the two of those guys
able to laugh together?

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.338
They were.

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:06.740
Well, then I can't be
sitting here whining

00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:08.242
about something like this.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.578
Oh! Ow!

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.848
Thank you, Mr.

00:20:14.882 --> 00:20:16.950
(upbeat music)

00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:19.686
I won't let that friend
of yours outdo me.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.154
I'm gonna get a lot stronger,

00:20:21.188 --> 00:20:24.291
strong enough that I
can protect Boruto too.

00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:27.494
Oh, what is your name anyway?

00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:28.729
I can't tell you.

00:20:28.762 --> 00:20:30.330
Come on.
Meanie.

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:31.131
Meanie.

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:32.633
Listen, after you eat,

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:35.669
makeup with Boruto and
continue your training.

00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:36.670
All right.

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:37.704
You got it.

00:20:39.806 --> 00:20:44.611
Hey, when we first met, I
couldn't really figure out

00:20:44.645 --> 00:20:48.215
just what your deal was,
but you're a nice guy, Mr.

00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:50.617
You think so?

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:56.957
All right.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.525
I'm getting fired up.

00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:02.896
Oh man.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.565
I'm so exhausted again,

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:07.367
Lady Tsunade's such
a strict teacher.

00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:10.704
No, this is all to
make me stronger.

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.077
Oops. I'm sorry.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.480
Wait. You're that
traveling performer.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.418
Be more careful.

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:25.519
Hey, wait.

00:21:33.927 --> 00:21:35.195
Wait, this is...

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:39.066
Hey there.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.901
What's up?

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:43.136
I merely wanted to
express my gratitude.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.739
I have to say you've been
awfully kind to Naruto

00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:47.541
even though you just met him.

00:21:47.574 --> 00:21:51.478
He just reminds me of
someone I knew in the past.

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:52.613
Yes, of course.

00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:53.680
I see. I see.

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:55.682
In the past, huh?

00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:57.284
Sorry. But I'm in a hurry.

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:59.386
Oh, and by the way, do you

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:03.757
happen to be Sasuke Uchiha?

00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:16.069
(closing theme music)

00:23:43.524 --> 00:23:46.760
Hey, so why did your friend
leave the village anyway?

00:23:47.995 --> 00:23:50.998
To obtain power and
avenge his clan.

00:23:51.932 --> 00:23:55.135
Sasuke said that
he'd get stronger

00:23:55.169 --> 00:23:59.072
if he severed our bond
and experienced pain.

00:23:59.106 --> 00:24:00.941
Next time on Boruto.

00:24:00.974 --> 00:24:02.743
Naruto next generations.

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.578
A village without Sasuke.

00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:06.013
I've just got to get stronger

00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:08.448
so I can get Sasuke
to open his eyes.

00:24:08.482 --> 00:24:09.750
Or else...

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:17.224
(closing theme music)
