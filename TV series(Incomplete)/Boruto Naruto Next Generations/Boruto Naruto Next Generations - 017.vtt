00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.276
[balancing efforts]

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.345
This is harder than I thought!

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:17.851
Just concentrate on gathering
chakra on the soles of your
feet!

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.953
[balancing efforts]

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:25.759
That's it! If you can control
chakra skillfully, it's even
possible to walk on water.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:29.395
Compared to everyone else, I'm
at a serious disadvantage.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.498
Isn't it kind of ridiculous
we're learning how to walk on
water?

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.101
What's the point of inventing
things like boats, then?

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.003
Can you stop talking please!?

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:42.075
Alright. Hold on. How about
this?

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:47.047
[grunting]

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.349
The surface of water is never
the same.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.519
Actual rivers and oceans are
nothing like this pond.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:00.126
Vegetables are so expensive
these days.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.196
Hmm?

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.068
Hmph!

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.336
Come on, that was too
dangerous, Boruto!

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.073
I do this all the time! It's all
good!

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.577
Hey, Sarada!

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.879
It looks like you guys are
up to no good again.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.949
We were just going to teach
Denki how to fish. Except it's
kind of a drag.

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.385
I know, can you believe it?

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.721
He's actually never gone fishing
in his whole entire life before!

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.957
But I've played fishing games,
so there's that!

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.226
You should join
us if you're free!

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.962
No, I have to go home and get
dinner ready right now.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:40.066
And not that I care, but you
guys should really learn how to
ride a train properly...

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.067
before someone gets hurt.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.104
Aw don't be so uptight.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.840
It's really great to be able to
sit on the roof and feel the
wind against your face.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.676
Oh yeah? I'm not
a child, you know.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.078
Okay, but don't knock it till
you try it.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.148
I don't have to try anything, I
already know.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.284
What an attitude...

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.092
I'm home!

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.260
<i>(Sarada) Welcome back!</i>

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.430
Oh, that miso soup smells
delicious!

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:14.200
We have some tomatoes, don't we?
Why don't we put some in.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.804
Put tomatoes in miso soup? That
doesn't go together.

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:20.273
You don't think so?

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.543
No, Mom. Anyway, are you all
packed and ready for tomorrow?

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.712
Mm, yeah, everything's perfectly
good to go!

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:13.987
I'm not good to go!
Gotta get this closed!

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:15.488
[sighs]

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.725
(Sarada) Here. I jotted down
your trip itinerary for you.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.660
What?

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.063
You better hurry up and get
ready. Ino's going to be here
any minute.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.600
I'm really not happy about
leaving you here all by
yourself...

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.268
maybe I should just stay home.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.636
Fine, then don't go.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.138
Ah, well...

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:35.441
I see how it is. I don't even
know why you're bringing it up.

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:38.612
You finally got some time off,
so enjoy it!

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:43.283
I'll be back tomorrow, okay? Can
I bring you anything?

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:47.821
My dad...would be nice.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:52.425
[gasps] Sarada, now why would
you go and say something like
that, huh?

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:56.296
Never mind. I don't need
anything, don't waste your
money.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.898
You sure?

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.400
Oh!

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.836
Oh no, they didn't come to get
that yet!

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:04.771
<i>(Sarada) What is it?</i>

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:07.908
Is this a...?

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.712
It's a much loved teddy bear
that belongs to one of our
patients.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.914
[bear noise]

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:19.520
See this? It was torn, so I
brought it home last night to
sew it up for her.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:23.489
I had asked someone from the
hospital to come over here and
pick it up but...

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:25.792
I guess they got too busy.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.629
I should probably go there and
return it to her.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.597
But why can't it wait
until you get home?

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:33.967
Because I promised that I'd get
it back to her today.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.337
Poor little thing, she must be
so lonely without her teddy
bear.

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.839
[sighs]

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.274
I hate to make Ino wait,
but I'd better go.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.209
It's all right, I
can return it.

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:45.512
Are you sure you don't mind?

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.214
Thank you! I'll bring
back lots of presents!

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.884
(Sarada) Yeah, yeah. Have a good
<i>trip!</i>

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.357
[gasps]

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.861
Hey! What do you say we get this
party started!

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.197
(Nurse) Yes, thank you so much.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.432
Okay! I'll stop by sometime
today then.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:11.938
(Nurse) Perfect, thank you! It's
really important to her because
<i>it was a present from her dad.</i>

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:12.939
[sighs]

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:16.076
(Nurse) She's been so depressed
<i>without it.</i>

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.144
Please tell her I'm on my way!

00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:22.415
Ask her if she can wait just a
little while longer, and I'll be
right over.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:33.527
Hmm.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:45.071
<i>(Sakura) Dear Sarada, I'm</i>
<i>gonna have a lot of fun on</i>
<i>this trip.</i>

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:49.710
<i>It's all thanks to you</i>
because I know you'll take care
<i>of everything.</i>

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:55.481
<i>Thank you. Don't forget I love</i>
<i>you Sarada! Love, Mom.</i>

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:58.519
[sighs]

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.588
<i>(Announcer) This stop, Tatsumi</i>
<i>Gate, Tatsumi Gate.</i>

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:03.624
[gasps]

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:07.360
[heavy breathing] What a close
call!

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:12.566
Let's see, the hospital
is...Wait! The package!

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.975
What do I do? What do I do? What
do I do?

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.077
[gasps]

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.214
If I go straight across
these roof tops, I can get to
the next station first!

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:36.022
That makes me no different
from Boruto!

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.458
Oh, Sarada?

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.160
[gasps]

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.395
<i>(Sarada) Ms. Shizune!</i>

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:45.932
Uh, thank you for always
supporting my mom!

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.235
(Ms. Shizune) Why are you being
so formal? Are you okay? What's
<i>going on?</i>

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:52.506
Ah, I, um, um...

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:54.374
Is there something wrong?

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:58.478
Um, it's just that I have
something to do.

00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.214
Please excuse me! [heavy
breathing]

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:04.985
(Boruto) Two whole days fishing
<i>and we're going back</i>
<i>empty‐handed.</i>

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:06.486
<i>(Denki) But it was still super</i>
<i>fun!</i>

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.090
Denki you have no idea about the
joys of fishing yet!

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:14.294
I'll take you to my special
fishing hole, where you're
guaranteed to get a bite!

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.563
Uh, there's a
place like that?

00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:19.199
[chuckles] Yeah, just leave it
to me!

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:24.505
[heavy breathing]

00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:26.439
Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry!

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:28.174
This is confusing.

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:32.679
How do I buy train tickets
again? What did I do last time?

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:34.447
[nervous breathing]

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.517
Oh dear, I can't remember.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.719
Excuse me! Where
do you need to go?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.125
[grunting]

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:46.359
Well thank you very much.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:48.795
You're welcome. [gasps]

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:55.836
[gasping]

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.271
Hmph.

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:02.843
There it is.

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:07.648
[gasps] Oh no!

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:12.553
Here goes! [grunts]

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:14.821
Hmm?

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:17.791
[gasps]

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:23.664
He was right! It feels so good
up here!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:31.371
[gasps] Did he see me? No it was
just for an instant. I think I'm
safe.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:35.576
Of all the trains he could've
been on, why did he have to be
on this one?

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:40.581
Hmm. That's impossible.

00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:42.883
What'd you say?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:46.553
I saw something that's
impossible. I'm probably
just tired.

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:49.656
What's so impossible?

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.693
Guys there's no way that Sarada
would be riding on the roof of
this train, right?

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:53.994
Sarada's on the roof?!

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:57.030
Not a chance! I mean, didn't you
hear what she said?

00:09:57.063 --> 00:10:01.568
She'd be a total hypocrite if
she got on the roof of a train
after everything she said to us.

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.404
Yeah, she'd never be
able to live it down!

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:09.976
Just think, we could tease her
about it right up until we
graduate.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.778
[evil chuckles]

00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:15.481
[grunts]

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.518
See, she's not out here.

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.619
Where did you see her?

00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:20.554
I thought I saw her over that
way.

00:10:20.587 --> 00:10:21.622
[grunts]

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:22.623
Let's find her!

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:25.592
I don't think we'll ever get
another chance like this one.

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:28.929
If you say so. Why do
you have to be so mean?

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.365
I got you now!

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:33.700
Huh?

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.570
You must have seen wrong. She's
nowhere to be found out here!

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:38.639
I know, but I swear I saw her!

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:40.907
<i>(Boruto) Come on, Shikadai!</i>

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.645
[gasps]

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:49.583
(Shikadai) Wait a minute, isn't
<i>that a footprint?</i>

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.718
Looks like a girl's footprint!

00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:53.654
Let's follow it and
see where it goes!

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:56.757
Hmm? What's all the ruckus out
there?

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.091
[grunts]

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.728
<i>(Conductor) You kids again!</i>

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:05.431
<i>(Boruto) It's not what you</i>
<i>think! At least hear us out,</i>
<i>will ya?!</i>

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:08.669
(Conductor) Get down from there
<i>right now! Don't make me call</i>
<i>your parents!</i>

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:10.604
Talk about a narrow escape!

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:13.339
[Sigh] But it's all those dumb
boys' fault.

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:17.511
Anyway, I can't afford to have
anyone see me, especially on the
roof of a train.

00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:18.078
[crunch]

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:19.112
[gasps]

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:19.680
[sighs]

00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:22.749
[chewing]

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:31.692
Please, don't tell
anyone, okay?!

00:11:31.725 --> 00:11:34.561
I promise I'll do
anything you want!

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:37.898
That's perfect, I
couldn't be happier.

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:39.432
Huh?

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.568
Especially since you tend to be
a little too prim and proper.

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:44.004
Then you'll really
keep this a secret?

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.841
Pretty women always have secrets
and this one's no different.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.677
Oh my gosh, thank you!

00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:56.817
All right lady, tell me
everything. I wanna hear more
about your secret.

00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:05.425
The Lost and Found Center?

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:08.428
All the forgotten items
people leave behind on the
train...

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.931
are immediately brought here so
they can get reclaimed.

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.233
Wow, you know everything!

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:14.367
Yeah, I do.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.302
Oh hi, you're back!

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:17.704
Forgot something again?

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.907
Nope. She did.

00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:23.877
I left something on the rack. It
was wrapped in a cloth that had
cherry blossoms.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.279
Train number 7‐6‐1.

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.949
Train number 7‐6‐1 huh?

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:36.957
Wrapped in a cloth with cherry
blossoms, let's see. Oh! How
about this? Is this the one?

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.424
That's it!

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:40.493
Well that sure was fast.

00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:43.329
Here, before you take it
you'll need to sign for it.

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:44.364
Sure!

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.568
Oh thank you so much.

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:53.039
It's a beloved stuffed animal
that belongs to a little girl
who's staying in the hospital.

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:56.242
I promised that I would take it
to her today.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.978
Is it a stuffed animal?

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.480
Or is it a voodoo doll?

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:01.682
Huh?

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:04.751
This isn't it.

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:08.288
This isn't the right item!

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:11.658
I do remember, there was another
package that looked really
similar to that one.

00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:15.762
I'm so sorry, but it looks like
it's already been claimed.

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:18.398
No way! [sighs]

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:25.171
What do I do? What do I
do? Maybe I should report
it to the Leaf police.

00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:28.742
First I think we should try and
find the owner of this thing.

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:30.711
Huh? You brought it with you?!

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:36.683
Stop being such a goody‐goody.
What's the problem if we return
it directly to the owner?

00:13:36.717 --> 00:13:38.919
Yeah sure okay, but...

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:43.757
You see, there you go again.
This is an emergency. There's no
time to quibble.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:49.162
But even if we find a clue, I've
never seen a doll like this
before.

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:52.899
Hmm. Don't worry, Cho‐Cho can
handle this!

00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:58.939
(Sarada) Hey, Cho‐Cho, where are
<i>we going?</i>

00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:01.107
(Cho‐Cho) Don't worry about it,
just follow me.

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:03.176
Huh?

00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:07.714
I didn't even know a place like
this existed?

00:14:07.748 --> 00:14:12.418
[chuckles] It's not so bad
coming to places like this
once in a while, huh?

00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:17.223
What is this shop?

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:20.026
They sell a bunch of food from
all the other villages here.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.396
You know my mom and how she's
from the Hidden Cloud Village?

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:27.500
Whenever she craves food from
her hometown, we always make a
trip down here.

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:28.569
<i>(Madame) Who's there?</i>

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.904
Long time no see!

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:33.473
Hmph. Oh, it's you.

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:36.176
There's something I want you to
take a look at.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.479
Ha! It'll cost you, nothing's
free around here.

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:43.249
And what do you have to say for
yourself, princess?

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:47.453
Huh? I have some money. A little
bit.

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:49.856
Is that right?

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.893
What do I look like to you, an
old woman who's just begging for
money?

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:53.827
Go back home!

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.428
I'm very sorry ma'am.

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:59.866
I know what the drill is down
here. How about, these?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:06.607
[gasps] Those chips! My
goodness! I can't believe there
are still some left over!

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.910
The elusive chameleon plant and
fish sausage flavor.

00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:12.112
I found them in the ruins of the
factory.

00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:15.649
It happens to be the very last
package there is, so...

00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:18.418
Hurry up! Give me
those immediately!

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:21.522
Only if you tell me where this
package came from first.

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:25.559
Hmm. Hmm.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:29.530
This looks like a doll that came
from the area near the Hidden
Waterfall.

00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:32.465
The Hidden Waterfall to the
north of the Hidden Leaf
Village?

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:36.603
They use these dolls during
memorial services for their
ancestors.

00:15:36.637 --> 00:15:41.508
They also hold an annual
memorial ceremony in our village
as well.

00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:45.278
And today just happens to be the
day of that annual service.
[grunts]

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.681
So what do they do at these
ceremonies?

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:51.284
They take these dolls and float
all of them down the river.

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.654
Now please, isn't that enough?

00:15:53.687 --> 00:15:57.858
That means my package is gonna
be sent down the river and now
I'll never find it!

00:15:57.891 --> 00:15:59.392
I can't let this happen!

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:02.262
And where exactly is this
service being held?

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:11.605
She said the service is always
held right at dusk, isn't that
right?

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.007
Yeah we might be able
to make it if we hurry.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.412
Hey Cho‐Cho, that bag of chips,
wasn't that one from your
special stash?

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:22.783
<i>(Sarada) I'm sorry you gave it</i>
<i>away for me.</i>

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:28.488
That's all right. I'll still get
to fantasize about what those
chips would taste like!

00:16:34.528 --> 00:16:39.766
[sighs] It's been so long since
I've been able to relax like
this.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.304
You work much too hard all the
time. You try to do it all
yourself.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.473
Does Sasuke ever contact you
even once in a while?

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:51.512
Mm‐mm.

00:16:51.545 --> 00:16:54.981
But when I think about him and
how long he's been traveling all
alone around the world like that

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.718
it makes me want to do my part
as well.

00:16:57.751 --> 00:16:59.085
Hmm.

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:02.856
Okay! And that's why I've got a
surprise for you!

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:04.024
<i>(Sakura) What is it?</i>

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:09.195
Tell me, where are we? And don't
you tell me that you don't
remember!

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:12.766
Ino, but how'd you know?

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.768
Don't underestimate a good
friend.

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:15.802
I already checked...

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:20.641
and I know this is where you and
Sasuke came on your first date,
isn't that right?

00:17:20.674 --> 00:17:24.044
You can call it a date but, it
only lasted two and a half
minutes.

00:17:24.645 --> 00:17:26.580
Ahh! Spare me the details!

00:17:26.613 --> 00:17:30.050
Just sit down right here and
reminisce to your heart's
content!

00:17:31.652 --> 00:17:33.153
See ya!

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:34.688
[inhales]

00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:36.590
[chuckles]

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:46.700
What great memories.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:50.737
[sighs] But I'm sure Sasuke's
probably forgotten.

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:59.079
I wonder where he is right now?

00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:10.724
No, don't!

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.962
I can't give up now, can I?!

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:17.230
You go girl!

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:24.938
Hey, this is actually
the real one.

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:26.139
It is?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.208
It's complicated, I
gotta go! [grunts]

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:37.951
[heavy breathing] Find it?

00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:39.485
It's over there!

00:18:44.024 --> 00:18:46.226
Huh? Hmph.

00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:49.930
What should we do? It looks like
the currents really pick up down
the river.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:54.400
That's fine by me! If ninjutsu
will work at a time like this,
I've gotta do it!

00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.402
(Cho‐Cho) Huh? But the current's
<i>really rough!</i>

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.772
Stop talking to me right now!

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:04.878
Sarada! Keep your focus, okay?

00:19:04.911 --> 00:19:08.915
If you lose focus for even a
second, you'll fall into the
river!

00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:10.283
Yeah I know!

00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:24.330
[nervous breathing]

00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:25.932
Hmph!

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.335
You got this!

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:30.637
Huh?

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.239
Hey, it's...

00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:36.710
Ha! Got it!

00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:38.679
Boruto?

00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:41.782
I can guarantee you that you'll
catch a fish here!

00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:44.951
Boruto? [gasps] Where is he?

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:48.188
[grunting]

00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:50.323
Cha! [grunts]

00:19:53.126 --> 00:19:56.029
[grunting]

00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:57.297
Sarada!

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.967
Huh? Hey, did you
hear something just now?

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:03.069
It's probably your
imagination again.

00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:05.071
So, do it like this?

00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:07.974
Yeah, looking good!

00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:10.276
I'm gonna let you catch the big
boss of this river when it comes
in!

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.045
You think he'll do it?

00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:15.181
Nah, I seriously doubt it.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.216
[chuckles]

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:19.385
Huh? Uh, Boruto look!

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:23.456
Here it comes! It's gotta be the
big boss!

00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:24.525
Huh?

00:20:28.829 --> 00:20:30.931
The net! Get the net now!

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:37.337
S‐‐Sarada?

00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:39.072
What are you doing...?

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.174
<i>(Inojin) ...out here?</i>

00:20:41.207 --> 00:20:41.808
[grunts]

00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:45.078
How come you were in the river?

00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:48.314
It's hot so I was taking a
little swim.

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:51.151
Got a problem with that?

00:20:51.184 --> 00:20:52.553
(All) Of course not.

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:55.321
(All) Not at all.

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:01.962
[whimpers]

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:04.931
<i>(Sarada) Kuuu?</i>

00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:06.466
[gasps]

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.737
Oh! There you are! [sighs]

00:21:10.771 --> 00:21:13.006
[giggling]

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:15.108
Thanks for waiting.

00:21:15.141 --> 00:21:17.644
So you wanna go grab
a snack or something?

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:19.713
[chuckles]

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:21.982
<i>(Cho‐Cho) It'll be your treat,</i>
<i>right?</i>

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:28.522
I'm home!

00:21:30.256 --> 00:21:31.491
Hmm.

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.497
Are you here?

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:39.399
[sighs]

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:42.302
You should have just
ordered something in!

00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:44.905
Hi! How was your trip?

00:21:44.938 --> 00:21:49.309
It was absolutely wonderful!
Thank you so much!

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.246
Oh that miso soup smells good!

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:56.016
I added some tomatoes
in this time.

00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:59.185
Uh. You actually added some?

00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:01.154
Can you set the
table please?

00:22:01.187 --> 00:22:02.388
Uh‐huh!

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.228
Oh by the way, were you able to
drop off that teddy bear?

00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:10.764
It was easy. [giggles]

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:12.065
Yeah!

00:23:49.696 --> 00:23:51.532
<i>(Hinata) Can you two please go</i>
<i>wake up your father?</i>

00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:52.633
<i>(Himawari) Okay!</i>

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.402
<i>(Boruto) I can't believe he's</i>
<i>still sleeping. He is</i>
<i>completely hopeless.</i>

00:23:56.436 --> 00:23:58.605
<i>(Himawari) Daddy, wake up!</i>

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:00.607
<i>Come on, wake up!</i>

00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:04.310
<i>(Boruto) All this "cutesy</i>
coaxing" isn't going to work on
<i>him, Himawari.</i>

00:24:04.344 --> 00:24:07.280
<i>Now listen, watch and learn!</i>

00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:13.386
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
Generations: "A Day in The Life
<i>of the Uzumaki Family."</i>

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:13.654
<i>Isn't today the Hokage's</i>
<i>Inauguration?!</i>

00:24:15.956 --> 00:24:17.157
<i>Get up, ya know!</i>
