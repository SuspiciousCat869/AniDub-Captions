WEBVTT

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.726
(Kakashi) The Summoning Jutsu is
a blood contract with a beast...

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.498
<i>where the user can instantly</i>
<i>summon that beast to appear.</i>

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.434
<i>Even if the beast's habitat</i>
<i>can't be pinpointed...</i>

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:29.572
<i>at the very least, we know it</i>
<i>exists in the same world as we</i>
<i>do.</i>

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:31.441
<i>But this beast...</i>

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:38.080
<i>...is not from our world.</i>

00:00:38.114 --> 00:00:40.583
<i>It resides in a different</i>
<i>dimension.</i>

00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:45.187
And as a result of that, the way
it's summoned is unique.

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:47.490
<i>(Kakashi) That is Nue.</i>

00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:53.295
That's the reason why we can't
sense its presence?

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.001
Right now there's really no way
for us to do anything.

00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:01.003
I'm at a complete loss.

00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:04.206
[grunts] Is the
jutsu caster nearby?

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.043
I sent out a search party but
nothing yet.

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:10.413
[grunts] They haven't
found anything?

00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:11.748
[sighs]

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.383
Kakashi Sensei?

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:19.321
If the jutsu caster is also in
another dimension, then we won't
be able to track them.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:20.423
Huh?

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:23.960
It's a bomb, and it can be sent
anywhere undetected.

00:01:23.993 --> 00:01:27.263
Danzo Shimura...

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:31.000
(Kakashi) He sure left behind a
<i>big mess for us.</i>

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.010
No luck. I can't find him
anywhere!

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:26.015
I still can't believe that he
hasn't shown up here, even with
all this commotion going on.

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:29.085
Where in the hell did
Boruto go off to?

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:31.788
Could it be possible...

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:35.124
that all of this might be
connected to the Ghost
incidents?

00:03:35.392 --> 00:03:36.593
Huh?

00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:41.831
No way! You don't think
Boruto's inside there?

00:03:41.864 --> 00:03:45.835
I don't know. But the class Rep
has gone missing, too.

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:53.843
So, you think that maybe
something really terrible is
going down here?

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:56.245
I'm gonna go search
for him some more!

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:59.181
Hey! Where are you...guys!

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:01.751
<i>(Shikadai) What's that?</i>

00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:12.395
[yelling]

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:16.666
[grunting]

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:20.102
[moaning]

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:22.338
Whoa, where are we?

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.374
Hey, Class Rep!

00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:29.345
Class Rep!

00:04:31.748 --> 00:04:33.583
Hold on, that's...

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:39.288
(Boruto) That's the thing I kept
<i>seeing.</i>

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.224
It was connected to this place?

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.265
[roars]

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:55.572
So, it's you again, huh?

00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:57.774
What have you done with the
Class Rep?

00:04:57.807 --> 00:04:59.542
[roars]

00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:03.713
All right...I'll let you have my
chakra now.

00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:07.684
Did you actually eat her?
[grunts]

00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:09.519
[roars]

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.120
[grunts]

00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:13.523
Hmph!

00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:14.791
[roars]

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:16.158
Hmph!

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:17.560
[grunts]

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.233
[grunts] Let's go!

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:25.502
Oh, all right!

00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:31.774
[attacking yell]

00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:33.910
[screams]

00:05:33.943 --> 00:05:38.314
[grunting]

00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:43.386
[roars]

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.555
I'm not gonna lose.

00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:49.759
[grunts] I'll avenge the Class
Rep!

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:50.927
[roars]

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.497
<i>What's that?</i>

00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:57.166
[roars]

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.502
[gasps/grunts]

00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:03.806
Why are you just
standing there, staring?

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.674
Mitsuki!

00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:08.645
You talk of revenge, but the
Class Rep isn't even dead yet.

00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:12.549
The fact is, she's still giving
that thing down there orders.

00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:16.318
She's still alive? That's
fantastic news!

00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:18.788
Are you planning on trying to
defend her?

00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:22.459
Are you still planning on going
after her?

00:06:22.492 --> 00:06:26.095
But first we have to do
something, about that guy.

00:06:26.128 --> 00:06:28.097
[grunting]

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.032
Huh!

00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:32.635
It's much smaller then when it
first appeared in the Village.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.405
But if it hits us,
we're in trouble.

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.776
Mitsuki, can you stall him?

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.378
I can attempt to.

00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:44.581
Wind Style: Breakthrough!
[exhales]

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:50.587
Hmph!

00:07:02.565 --> 00:07:03.733
Huh?

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.605
I'm counting on ya!

00:07:08.638 --> 00:07:09.606
All right!

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:17.079
[grunts]

00:07:17.914 --> 00:07:19.416
Mitsuki!

00:07:19.882 --> 00:07:20.417
[roars]

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.586
[attacking yell]

00:07:26.288 --> 00:07:27.690
[grunts]

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.358
[roars]

00:07:34.397 --> 00:07:35.765
Not good!

00:07:39.268 --> 00:07:41.504
[roars]

00:07:41.904 --> 00:07:43.773
[grunts]

00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:54.917
[coughing] Did it work?

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:59.656
[growling]

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.261
[sighs] Regardless, your eye, is
amazing.

00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:08.731
(Mitsuki) You can even see where
<i>that thing is vulnerable.</i>

00:08:10.967 --> 00:08:12.802
Now I'll finish this.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.472
Snake lightening.

00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:16.706
[gasps]

00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:23.112
[grunts]

00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:26.783
<i>(Sumire) I won't let you kill</i>
<i>Nue!</i>

00:08:28.017 --> 00:08:29.419
[gasps]

00:08:33.823 --> 00:08:39.862
I've raised Nue all these years
just for the sake of vengeance.
He's the ultimate weapon!

00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:41.398
<i>(Boruto) Class Rep!</i>

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:48.505
Class Rep. I have
to ask just in case.

00:08:48.538 --> 00:08:52.775
You're not going to come back
with us willingly? Have I
assumed correctly?

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.980
Come on, Class Rep. Let's all go
back.

00:08:58.014 --> 00:09:01.751
How can you be so calm and
easygoing about all of this?

00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:04.521
I launched an attack on the
Hidden Leaf Village!

00:09:04.554 --> 00:09:07.857
From my point of view, I'm
fighting a war!

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.226
If it is, it's just your
father's war.

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.229
No! It's my war, too!

00:09:13.262 --> 00:09:20.437
It's what I was always taught,
to fulfill the long‐cherished
hope he harbored.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.675
<i>(Sumire) During the chaos of</i>
war, my father served the Hidden
<i>Leaf tirelessly.</i>

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:28.310
But when the Great War ended...

00:09:28.344 --> 00:09:32.081
he was treated like a criminal,
<i>just because he'd been part of</i>
<i>the Foundation.</i>

00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:35.718
Even so, all that has nothing to
do with you now!

00:09:35.752 --> 00:09:40.189
You think so? Actually, you just
might be right about that.

00:09:40.222 --> 00:09:45.428
Since Sumire Kakei never existed
in the first place!

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:49.999
<i>(Sumire) For as far back as I</i>
<i>can remember, I've lived in</i>
<i>hiding.</i>

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:54.370
And I've always kept to myself.

00:09:54.404 --> 00:09:59.742
<i>(Sumire) The only moments of</i>
peace I've ever known were when
<i>my mother would brush my hair.</i>

00:10:05.482 --> 00:10:10.553
<i>Until the stress of living in</i>
<i>hiding took its toll. And she</i>
<i>died.</i>

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:13.055
Then, after that, filled with
bitterness...

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:18.695
my father raised me as a tool to
unleash vengeance on the Leaf
Village.

00:10:18.728 --> 00:10:21.998
<i>(Sumire) I can't even remember</i>
<i>my mother's voice anymore.</i>

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:32.675
The Hidden Leaf understands
nothing and has created a system
based in cowardice!

00:10:33.943 --> 00:10:38.214
On top of that, they rejected
our very existence.

00:10:41.984 --> 00:10:46.322
<i>(Tanuki) Sumire, this is one</i>
<i>of the Hidden Jutsu.</i>

00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:49.726
That Lord Danzo experimented
with.

00:10:51.027 --> 00:10:54.597
You will enter into a summoning
contract with Nue...

00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:56.999
and become the beacon of
revolution!

00:10:57.033 --> 00:10:58.100
[gasps]

00:11:00.102 --> 00:11:04.774
The time for my dearest wish
draws near.

00:11:10.713 --> 00:11:17.587
My father, raised me to be a
weapon to act in his place and
seek revenge!

00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:30.933
My father, raised me to be a
weapon to act in his place and
seek revenge!

00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:34.404
Watch out! [grunts]

00:11:34.437 --> 00:11:35.337
[grunts]

00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:37.640
<i>Wind Style: Wind Scythe!</i>

00:11:39.976 --> 00:11:41.077
[grunts]

00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.580
[gasps]

00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:46.282
[grunts]

00:11:47.617 --> 00:11:50.119
You can't have Nue! [grunts]

00:11:50.152 --> 00:11:52.154
Oh I don't need him anymore.

00:11:52.188 --> 00:11:53.189
Hmph!

00:11:56.659 --> 00:11:58.628
Water Style: Suireiha!

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.133
Because actually, you're the one
that I really want.

00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:07.269
[gasps]

00:12:12.241 --> 00:12:14.010
[exhales]

00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:16.212
The Gozu Tennou on your back is
what's valuable.

00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:19.716
And I do not need you to be
alive to get it.

00:12:20.983 --> 00:12:22.118
Hmph!

00:12:24.554 --> 00:12:26.623
Stop!

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:29.158
[grunts]

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:31.494
[gasps]

00:12:31.528 --> 00:12:32.995
Boruto, you...!

00:12:33.596 --> 00:12:37.066
I said...stop.

00:12:38.034 --> 00:12:42.104
What do you think you're
doing to your classmate?

00:12:42.138 --> 00:12:48.411
My classmate? The Class Rep
merely fooled us all to gather
intel.

00:12:48.445 --> 00:12:49.245
[gasps]

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:54.250
[grunts] No way. I refuse to
believe that's true.

00:12:54.283 --> 00:12:57.787
<i>(Boruto) Namida and the others</i>
<i>told me how hard you tried to</i>
<i>save them...</i>

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.190
<i>when they were in danger.</i>

00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:03.760
On top of that, when I returned
<i>to school two weeks after my</i>
<i>suspension...</i>

00:13:03.793 --> 00:13:09.599
<i>Or when all our classmates got</i>
<i>into a fight, you were always</i>
<i>concerned about us.</i>

00:13:09.632 --> 00:13:12.935
<i>Your face is so easy to read.</i>

00:13:12.969 --> 00:13:17.239
There's just no way you faked
all of that. I don't believe it.

00:13:17.273 --> 00:13:19.175
[gasping]

00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:23.245
And that's enough? That's the
reason you still trust the Class
Rep?

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:27.183
Of course! I say that because
she's my classmate!

00:13:30.753 --> 00:13:32.522
[chuckles] Seriously.

00:13:32.555 --> 00:13:37.359
Time and again, you end up at an
answer I wouldn't have even
considered.

00:13:37.394 --> 00:13:41.898
<i>(Mitsuki) To trust people when</i>
<i>there's no basis for it is</i>
<i>stupid, right?</i>

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:44.567
Wait, what?

00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:48.405
Although, back when I went to
visit her at the hospital...

00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:52.409
the Class Rep said that she
wanted "all this to be over."

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:54.444
[inhales]

00:13:55.845 --> 00:13:56.979
<i>(Mitsuki) It felt like she was</i>
<i>being honest.</i>

00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:02.084
<i>(Boruto) It's the same thing I</i>
<i>saw before.</i>

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:06.122
<i>The Ghost...It's fading!</i>

00:14:06.155 --> 00:14:08.491
[heavy breathing]

00:14:09.392 --> 00:14:11.260
<i>(Boruto) I figured it out.</i>

00:14:11.293 --> 00:14:12.929
Hmph.

00:14:12.962 --> 00:14:15.798
<i>(Boruto) Why the Ghost only</i>
possesses people weighed down by
<i>problems.</i>

00:14:15.832 --> 00:14:20.503
It's because you've been dealing
with your own sorrows for so
long now.

00:14:20.537 --> 00:14:25.942
The Ghost easily latches onto
people in the same mental state.

00:14:25.975 --> 00:14:30.046
<i>(Boruto) But when something</i>
affects your mind and heart in a
<i>big way...</i>

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:32.882
<i>the Ghost just disappears.</i>

00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:35.985
You can't fool me, Class Rep.
Not anymore.

00:14:36.018 --> 00:14:41.858
No, you're wrong! I'm a weapon!
To be used to avenge my father!

00:14:42.224 --> 00:14:43.460
Nue!

00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:48.531
I had a feeling that
it would come back.

00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:54.236
This is an order! Extract all of
my chakra, then, explode!

00:14:54.571 --> 00:14:57.073
[growling]

00:14:57.106 --> 00:15:00.943
Nue! What's the matter with you?

00:15:01.243 --> 00:15:02.479
[gasps]

00:15:03.245 --> 00:15:05.382
[growls]

00:15:06.248 --> 00:15:07.417
Hurry up and do it!

00:15:08.818 --> 00:15:10.787
Extract it all!

00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:13.623
[gasps]

00:15:13.656 --> 00:15:16.859
Nue, what do you think you're
doing?

00:15:16.893 --> 00:15:19.328
<i>(Sumire) Why won't you obey my</i>
<i>order?</i>

00:15:19.361 --> 00:15:20.797
[exhales]

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.132
I wonder what's going on here.

00:15:23.165 --> 00:15:23.800
[gasps]

00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:26.135
<i>(Sumire) Nue! Hey!</i>

00:15:26.168 --> 00:15:27.336
[exhaling]

00:15:27.369 --> 00:15:31.140
<i>(Boruto) I think he believes</i>
<i>you're his mother.</i>

00:15:31.173 --> 00:15:31.941
Huh?

00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:33.943
Listen, Class Rep.

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:38.347
You say you raised that creature
only so he could follow
your exact orders.

00:15:38.381 --> 00:15:41.984
Nevertheless, he thinks of you
as his mother.

00:15:42.018 --> 00:15:44.754
Are you gonna turn on him and
make him into a weapon?

00:15:44.787 --> 00:15:49.659
<i>(Boruto) Your whole life</i>
you've borne the burden of your
<i>father's orders.</i>

00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:52.795
(Boruto) And now you're gonna do
<i>the same thing to Nue?!</i>

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:55.798
You can still choose your own
path!

00:15:55.832 --> 00:15:59.268
All of us. Nue, and you, too.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.804
But no, I...

00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:03.272
Sumire!

00:16:10.847 --> 00:16:12.915
The Gozu Tennou!

00:16:15.552 --> 00:16:18.555
Huh? What's happening?

00:16:18.588 --> 00:16:21.991
<i>(Mitsuki) I'm guessing that</i>
<i>since the Gozu Tennou is</i>
<i>broken...</i>

00:16:22.024 --> 00:16:25.061
the chakra that was gathered is
<i>now running amok.</i>

00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:27.997
That's bad, right?

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.734
It's very bad. This place will
probably cave in any minute.

00:16:31.768 --> 00:16:33.335
Hey, Class Rep!

00:16:37.674 --> 00:16:39.409
(Boruto) Let's get out of here!

00:16:39.442 --> 00:16:41.911
What's the matter? Hey!

00:16:42.278 --> 00:16:43.913
Ah!

00:16:44.346 --> 00:16:45.648
[roars]

00:16:45.682 --> 00:16:46.783
Boruto!

00:16:46.816 --> 00:16:48.084
Class Rep! [grunts]

00:16:48.117 --> 00:16:50.420
<i>(Boruto) Class Rep!</i>

00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:55.625
It was so fun at the Academy.

00:16:56.893 --> 00:17:00.096
Studying and training with
everyone in class.

00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:03.265
I never had so much fun in my
life.

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:07.637
<i>(Mix of kids) Class Rep! Class</i>
<i>Rep! Class Rep! Class Rep!</i>

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.171
<i>(Sumire's Mom) Sumire.</i>

00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:09.572
[gasps]

00:17:10.773 --> 00:17:14.176
I believe this way of life will
end with my generation.

00:17:15.311 --> 00:17:19.549
You'll probably live your
life somewhere else.

00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:24.787
I'll pray for you. I'll always
pray that you'll find true
happiness, okay?

00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:26.523
[gasps] Mother!

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.658
[gasps]

00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:37.099
Boruto! Why did you?

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:41.270
I can't leave a classmate
behind. And I never will.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.609
Let's go back home, Class Rep.

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:54.083
[roars]

00:17:58.455 --> 00:18:00.056
[roars]

00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:07.930
Boruto!

00:18:07.964 --> 00:18:10.332
Come on, Mitsuki! This way!
Hurry up!

00:18:10.366 --> 00:18:15.838
<i>To make possible what was</i>
<i>impossible with ninjutsu or</i>
<i>science.</i>

00:18:15.872 --> 00:18:18.140
That is Boruto's true strength.

00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:27.984
Over there!

00:18:32.822 --> 00:18:34.457
Go!

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.795
Up ahead!

00:18:38.828 --> 00:18:40.229
[roars]

00:18:40.262 --> 00:18:41.197
Huh?

00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:43.299
[roars]

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.568

[growls]

00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:56.312
<i>(Sumire) Nue!</i>

00:18:56.345 --> 00:18:58.147
Let's go!

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.687
[heavy breathing]

00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:10.192
<i>(Denki) Boruto!</i>

00:19:10.226 --> 00:19:13.262
<i>(Shikadai) Hey! Boruto! Class</i>
<i>Rep!</i>

00:19:13.295 --> 00:19:17.800
Over this way! [screams]

00:19:24.941 --> 00:19:26.876
Boruto!

00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:29.712
Boruto!

00:19:29.746 --> 00:19:32.982
The line of light you saw, it
was right in this area, wasn't
it Shikadai?

00:19:33.015 --> 00:19:34.250
That's right.

00:19:34.283 --> 00:19:35.184
[gasps]

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:38.020
Hey isn't this one
of Mitsuki's snakes?

00:19:38.054 --> 00:19:39.822
Then they must be around here!

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:41.724
Hey, Boruto!

00:19:41.758 --> 00:19:43.025
Boruto!

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:44.461
Boruto!

00:19:46.496 --> 00:19:47.697
[grunts]

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.931
Boruto!

00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:50.032
[groans]

00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:52.068
[groans]

00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:53.436
Why'd you fall out of the sky?

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.039
Well, uh, a whole lot
of stuff happened.

00:19:57.073 --> 00:19:58.641
You okay Class Rep?

00:19:58.675 --> 00:20:02.211
[gasps] Well, um...

00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:05.014
We heard you guys calling for
us, so that's how we were able
to find our way out of there.

00:20:05.047 --> 00:20:06.616
Uhh.

00:20:07.183 --> 00:20:09.285
What does that mean?

00:20:09.318 --> 00:20:11.488
(Chuckles) Never mind, ya know.

00:20:12.822 --> 00:20:13.856
[gasps]

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.731
Why are you all here? And at
this early hour?

00:20:21.764 --> 00:20:24.233
Oh, uh...

00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:26.202
We were looking for Boruto and
the others, Dad. That's all.

00:20:27.504 --> 00:20:28.738
[sighs]

00:20:33.943 --> 00:20:36.413
I once walked a path
similar to yours.

00:20:36.446 --> 00:20:38.981
So will you please
allow me to help you?

00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:40.683
Well, Class Rep?

00:20:40.717 --> 00:20:42.385
What's going on, huh?

00:20:43.786 --> 00:20:47.557
I think that I'm just gonna go
and talk with him for a little
bit.

00:20:48.591 --> 00:20:50.359
Okay, then.

00:20:50.393 --> 00:20:56.265
This incident was due to ghosts
of the past. Don't worry, Sumire
is safe with me.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.669
[sighs]

00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:06.609
[gasps]

00:21:07.777 --> 00:21:09.512
<i>(Boruto) Class Rep!</i>

00:21:09.546 --> 00:21:10.647
Huh?

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.115
<i>(Boruto) He's alive!</i>

00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:16.853
It's really faint right now, but
he's connected to your left
hand!

00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:21.323
[gasps]

00:21:22.692 --> 00:21:25.194
[chuckles]

00:21:32.068 --> 00:21:35.705
Hey, Boruto. What exactly
happened anyway?

00:21:35.738 --> 00:21:40.943
Well, um, let's just say I'm
glad we were able to get back.

00:21:40.977 --> 00:21:42.144
What's that mean?

00:21:42.178 --> 00:21:43.913
I'll tell you about it some
other time.

00:21:43.946 --> 00:21:47.950
The main thing is that all's
well that ends well.

00:21:47.984 --> 00:21:49.619
<i>(Inojin) Hey, it's morning</i>
<i>already!</i>

00:21:49.652 --> 00:21:51.688
<i>(Denki) Should we just go</i>
<i>straight to school?</i>

00:21:51.721 --> 00:21:53.255
Morning?!

00:21:53.289 --> 00:21:55.525
I went against the wishes of my
parent.

00:21:55.558 --> 00:21:58.260
Oh, I am really
gonna get it now!

00:21:58.294 --> 00:22:00.863
Oh! The first train!

00:22:00.897 --> 00:22:02.532
I gotta go, ok, bye!

00:22:02.565 --> 00:22:03.700
Me too!

00:22:03.733 --> 00:22:04.867
Hey, wait!

00:23:49.171 --> 00:23:53.476
<i>(Inojin) My father's been</i>
<i>gathering brochures for</i>
<i>Academies in other villages.</i>

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.013
<i>(Shikadai) Is the Class Rep</i>
<i>transferring?</i>

00:23:57.046 --> 00:23:59.382
<i>(Inojin) I don't know. But my</i>

<i>recent investigation.</i>

00:23:59.416 --> 00:24:02.885
<i>(Shikadai) I guess returning</i>
to the Academy would be a little
<i>tough for her.</i>

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:04.954
<i>You didn't tell Boruto about</i>
<i>this, did you?</i>

00:24:04.987 --> 00:24:07.757
<i>If he finds out he's gonna</i>
<i>make a big fuss.</i>

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:12.762
Next time on Boruto Naruto
Next Generations: "A New Path."

00:24:12.795 --> 00:24:15.432
(Shikadai) We should keep this
<i>quite for now.</i>
