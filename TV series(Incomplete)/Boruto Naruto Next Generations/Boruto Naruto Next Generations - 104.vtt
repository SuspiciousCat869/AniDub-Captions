WEBVTT

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:38.038
(upbeat music)

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.307
(dramatic music)

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:25.913
(Nezumi gasps)

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.015
Get him! Don't
let, Nezumi escape.

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:30.684
This time we'll
catch him in the act.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:34.888
We have to get that stolen
jewel back from him now.

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:38.392
Damn thief! I'll capture
him for sure. You know?

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:41.562
I say this Nezumi guy
is extremely clever.

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:44.097
In all his thefts he's
never left any incriminating

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.365
evidence behind.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.401
We shouldn't underestimate him.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:48.502
Yes, exactly.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.237
And that's why the
Leaf Police Force

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.706
requested our assistance
in this matter.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.007
[Kotaro] Over there!

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:58.645
Let's go!

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:02.983
Stop!

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.426
(men snoring)

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:14.595
What's this?

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.837
Where's Nezumi?

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.106
I was sure we'd
cornered him this time.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.909
He has to be one of these guys.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.777
Bring 'em all in.

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:31.778
-Yes, sir!

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:32.779
On it.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:34.181
[Man A] What's the big idea

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.883
[Man B] Hey, lemme go!

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:36.750
[Nezumi] What's the deal?

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:37.918
We didn't do anything.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.753
Then I assume you'll
be happy to cooperate

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.154
with our investigation.

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:43.924
We believe that a jewel thief
has snuck into this group.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.025
A jewel thief?

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.460
What are you talking about?

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:47.794
I don't know anything.

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:48.862
Once we've cleared you,

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.797
you'll all be free to go.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.032
But before that happens,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.101
you'll have to be brought
in for questioning.

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:55.369
Take 'em away.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.837
-[Police A] Yes sir.
-[Police B] Yes sir.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.038
All right. On your feet.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.007
[Man B] I didn't do anything!

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.441
[Police Man A] Calm down!

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.442
All right, all right.

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:04.044
-Quit pushing.
-This is harassment you know?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.046
Nezumi has to be one of those
guys...

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.048
so I guess this means we can
say...

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.550
"Mission accomplished," right?

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.451
I guess so. Yeah.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:13.387
(cat meows)

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.889
(cat meows)

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:18.926
(cat meowing)

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.894
I wonder if this kitten got lost

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:23.197
and separated from its mom.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.465
Man, it's such a
tiny little thing.

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:30.404
(cat meowing)

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.872
This is bad.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.240
Why?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.243
Because, we can't just leave
it out here all by itself.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.413
It seems lost and it
won't stop shaking.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.881
Poor little thing,

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:43.984
but I can't have pets
at our house, so...

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.354
What me?

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.890
I don't really think I
can take it home tonight.

00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:53.560
I mean, I'd have to
ask my mom first.

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:56.697
[Sarada] Well, if you can't
take it and I can't take it,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.867
then we're gonna have to
find somebody else who can.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.568
That means you, Mitsuki.

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:04.037
You think you could take
this little guy home

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.772
for the night please?

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.074
Okay.

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:08.275
(Sarada laughs)

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.276
Great.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.077
Here.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.713
(Mitsuki sighs)

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:15.082
(cat meows)

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.558
Hey, excuse me,

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:27.628
but you really shouldn't
be mean to a kitten.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.196
Be mean?

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.498
Is that cat you're
holding yours?

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.034
Not really.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.736
I'm just taking
care of it tonight.

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:37.738
Oh, I see.

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.006
Well, even if that is the case,

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.608
please try to be a little
bit gentler with him.

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:44.011
No, I'm not saying
you can't hold a cat

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:45.179
by the nape of its neck,

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:46.413
at least for a while.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.049
But that kitten looks
very frightened to me.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.919
It's better to hold
them in your arms.

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:55.022
(Mitsuki sighs)

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:02.796
I wonder if Mitsuki's
gonna be okay.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.565
I'm sure he'll be fine.

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:07.100
It's just that Mitsuki's
never really handled

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:08.635
anything other than snakes.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.838
I think that maybe you
should have taken the kitten

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:12.039
after all.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.675
Well, if I can just get
Himawari on my side,

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.878
I'm pretty sure that my Mom
and Dad will say it's okay...

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:20.180
but until I do that.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:22.749
I really hope that
Mitsuki's able to take care

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:24.084
of that kitten by himself.

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:26.720
You worry too much, you know
that?

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:49.977
(cat meowing)

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:56.750
(cat meowing)

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.322
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.109
I wonder if it could
be feeling hungry.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.918
(cat meows)

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:32.452
(cat meows)

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:34.922
(cat meows)

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.924
(cat meowing)

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.559
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:40.928
(cat meows)

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.297
(cat meows)

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:50.437
(cat meows)

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.873
(cat meows)

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:55.242
(cat meows)

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.557
(cat meows)

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.092
(cat meows)

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:15.295
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:26.173
What? None of them had the
jewel in their possession

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:27.741
when you searched them?

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:28.976
No.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:31.845
I'm certain that
we chased the thief

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.347
right into that alley.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.783
Which means that one of them
simply has to be Nezumi.

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.852
Yes. That's what
I believe as well.

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:41.088
However, since we
didn't find the jewel,

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:42.689
there is no evidence,

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:45.592
so we're just going to have
to release all four of them.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:49.930
So once again, we can't take him
into custody.

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.932
Well, I, for one, am not giving
up!

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:54.134
I swear to you we'll get Nezumi!

00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:00.741
(indistinct chatter)

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:03.644
Uh, damn.

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.479
That was so annoying.

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:06.480
Yeah. That's right.

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.849
Getting arrested when we
didn't even do anything,

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.417
it's just horrible.

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:14.955
We'll find proof mark my words.

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:16.623
He'll give himself away in time.

00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:19.660
For now don't let those
four out of your sites.

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:21.028
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:26.533
(Nezumi chuckles)

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:28.268
You see the news today?

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:30.270
All four of those
guys that we caught

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:31.805
just ended up being released.

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.273
They were all searched,

00:09:33.307 --> 00:09:35.809
but apparently none of
them had the jewel on them.

00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:36.810
Huh, wow.

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:37.811
That's really weird.

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.847
It's like a magic trick.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.115
Oh, by the way,
where's the kitten?

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.151
It's still at my house.

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:45.853
How'd it go at home, Boruto?

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.688
Can you keep it?

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:49.122
Yeah, about that.

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:51.825
Do you think you can
keep it at your place

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:52.826
a little longer Mitsuki?

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.228
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:56.964
(sighs) Lemme guess you can't
keep the cat either, huh?

00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:58.198
No, it isn't that.

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.200
I just forgot Mom and Himawari

00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:02.002
went to visit grandpa yesterday,

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.470
so I couldn't ask.

00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:05.839
There'll be gone for
two or three days.

00:10:05.873 --> 00:10:08.809
Okay. I understand.

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:09.810
Oh, Mitsuki.

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:11.545
Have you given it a name yet?

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:12.813
A name?

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:14.948
Yeah, you should give it a name.

00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:16.416
I mean don't you think?

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.685
Okay.

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:19.720
I'll think of one.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:22.789
Are you leaving?

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:26.493
No, I thought I'd
buy a hamburger.

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:27.694
And eat it?

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.196
Oh no.

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.665
I'm taking it home
for the kitten.

00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:33.500
What? No you can't do that!

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:36.670
You can't feed human
food to a kitten.

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:37.704
What?

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:45.679
(suspenseful music)

00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:54.955
So tell me, is it a boy or a
girl?

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.723
Your cat, I mean.

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.326
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:02.095
(Woman exclaims)

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:17.244
(Mitsuki sighs)

00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:26.587
(Mitsuki sighs)

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.511
I wonder where it went.

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:51.512
(cat meows)

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:54.515
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.392
(cat meows)

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:07.361
(Mitsuki chuckles)

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.729
(cat meows)

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:10.397
(cat meows)

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.799
(cat meows)

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:15.502
(cat meowing)

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.073
(cat meows)

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.680
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.550
(cat meows)

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.519
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:46.400
Oh, Mitsuki, have you
given it a name yet?

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.634
A name?

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:49.336
Yeah, you should give it a name.

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:52.206
Mikazuki.

00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:55.809
How about Mikazuki?

00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:57.211
Is that a good name?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.982
(cat meows)

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:02.983
All right.

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:04.751
From here on you are Mikazuki.

00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:09.656
(cat meows)

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:14.595
(cat meows)

00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:32.179
(upbeat music)

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:38.485
(cat meowing)

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:40.020
(Mitsuki chuckles)

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:42.589
(cat meows)

00:14:06.713 --> 00:14:09.283
(cat meows)

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.752
You're really quite fickle.

00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:19.526
(cat meows)

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.695
(cat meows)

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.600
(Mitsuki chuckles)

00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.777
(cat coughs)

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.712
Really? But you
ate so much before.

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:42.349
What's wrong?

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:46.353
Do you not feel
well or something?

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:49.356
(cat sighs)

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:56.029
All right.

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:58.966
Then you oughta be the one
to take care of the cat.

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.001
Listen, I'd be
glad to if I could.

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:02.970
It's just not something
that I can do.

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:05.105
My building doesn't
allow us to have pets.

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:07.674
You know, actually
Mitsuki seems to be

00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:09.276
doing a pretty good job with it.

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:11.345
Well, whether it's
Mitsuki or you

00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:13.547
that gets to keep the kitten.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.815
I'll be fine with it

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:16.817
if I get to dote on it
sometimes,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.151
if you know what I mean.

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:19.786
That means you win either way.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.822
Come to think of it.

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:22.823
Mitsuki's late.

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:23.824
All Right.

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:25.225
Then let's go get him.

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:30.364
(upbeat funky music)

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:31.398
(Mitsuki gasps)

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.432
Medicine.

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:38.739
Hello? It seems sick.

00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:41.708
Oh, I'm sorry,

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:46.046
but we don't carry any
medicine for animals here.

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:49.716
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.690
(Mitsuki gasps)

00:15:58.859 --> 00:15:59.660
A hospital.

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:11.538
I think that it's in pain.

00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:12.506
I'm really sorry,

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:14.608
but this isn't a
veterinary hospital,

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.244
so I'm afraid we can't
examine your kitty.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.114
(Mitsuki sighs)

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.649
Hold on a second, okay?

00:16:22.683 --> 00:16:26.019
I'll see if I can find a
vet somewhere close by here.

00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:29.957
I thought he had a map.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.191
Oh, here it is.

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:33.861
Okay. I'll give you directions.

00:16:33.894 --> 00:16:35.162
[Mitsuki] Great.

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:36.964
First, go out to the main road.

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.732
Keep walking and turn left.

00:16:39.867 --> 00:16:41.301
And once you turn the corner,

00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:43.704
you should see it
right in front of you.

00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:45.239
Right. Thank you very much.

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:48.308
(Mitsuki gasps)

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:49.343
Mikazuki.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.779
(Mitsuki gasps)

00:16:52.813 --> 00:16:55.582
(Nezumi gasping)

00:16:56.884 --> 00:16:59.486
(exclaims) Hold on, wasn't that?

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.654
I think...

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:01.688
Boruto!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.625
Is something wrong?

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:07.361
Did you see a man who's
holding a pet carrier

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:08.395
go by this way?

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.865
Yeah, he went that
way a second ago.

00:17:11.899 --> 00:17:12.866
Hey.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.668
Someone took Mikazuki.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.937
I have to get him back.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.706
(both exclaim)

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.509
(Nezumi gasping)

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:25.946
(Nezumi laughs)

00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:28.015
(chuckles) Those
guys are so dumb.

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.820
(Nezumi laughs)

00:17:33.854 --> 00:17:34.821
You're not getting away.

00:17:34.855 --> 00:17:36.089
(Nezumi grunts)

00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:39.493
-(upbeat rock music)
-Return Mikazuki right now.

00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:40.861
Return it?

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.829
And why would I ever do that?

00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:43.664
This cat is mine.

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.804
You're lying!

00:17:50.838 --> 00:17:52.639
If that cat were really yours

00:17:52.673 --> 00:17:55.943
then you wouldn't be treating
it as roughly as that.

00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:58.345
Look, I don't have
time to waste on you.

00:17:58.378 --> 00:17:59.713
All right?

00:18:00.714 --> 00:18:01.849
Damn it!

00:18:01.882 --> 00:18:04.318
Thought so! You were
one of those four guys

00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:05.285
we caught.

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:07.287
I should have known it was you.

00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:09.223
You won't get away this time.

00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:14.328
Now, give Mikazuki back to me.

00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:15.629
(Nezumi grunts)

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:18.498
If you want it back so bad,
fine, I'll give it back.

00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:21.001
Right after I cut
open it's belly!

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.669
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:25.372
(Nezumi shouts)

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.542
It's all right, Mikazuki, okay?

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.712
I'll take you to
the hospital, now.

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:33.814
Hey Mitsuki?

00:18:33.847 --> 00:18:34.815
(Nezumi groans)

00:18:34.848 --> 00:18:35.649
Damn it!

00:18:36.817 --> 00:18:37.985
(Nezumi exclaims)

00:18:38.018 --> 00:18:41.121
Nezumi! I'm taking
you into custody now.

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:42.990
Where's your evidence?

00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:44.324
The kitten!

00:18:44.358 --> 00:18:47.394
You made it swallow that
jewel you stole, right?

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:49.029
(Nezumi grunts)

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:50.297
Since your release

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.666
we've been keeping
a close eye on you

00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:54.735
and you just gave yourself away.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.672
What a terrible thing
for someone to do

00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:00.007
to a little kitten.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.241
It's unforgivable.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.712
I leave the kitten
in your hands.

00:19:05.746 --> 00:19:07.080
-Right.
-Right.

00:19:09.183 --> 00:19:11.852
[Man] has it been? three weeks?

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:13.420
I remember that.

00:19:16.757 --> 00:19:19.426
(Mitsuki gasps)

00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:24.998
Mikazuki.

00:19:25.032 --> 00:19:27.034
Don't worry this little guy's

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:28.836
gonna be just fine now.

00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:30.103
I'd say it should be up

00:19:30.137 --> 00:19:32.539
and moving around like
normal by tomorrow.

00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:34.007
Thank you so much.

00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:35.175
Did I hear you right?

00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:37.678
It's name is Mikazuki?

00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:38.979
Yes.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:42.716
So, I guess it was your
cat after all. Huh?

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:45.552
(Mitsuki sighs)

00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:47.688
(Sarada giggles)

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:49.389
(soft music)

00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:50.424
I'm so glad.

00:19:57.164 --> 00:20:00.000
Well, you seem like you're
feeling all better now.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.636
(cat meows)

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.838
(cat meows)

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:08.008
(Mitsuki exclaims)

00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:13.680
(cat meows)

00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:15.682
(cat meows)

00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:17.551
(cat meows)

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:20.087
(cat meowing)

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:23.590
Mikazuki?

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:33.667
You really are quite fickle.

00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:39.840
What? Mikazuki disappeared?

00:20:39.873 --> 00:20:41.942
Yes. Its parent came,

00:20:41.975 --> 00:20:44.311
and they just left.

00:20:44.344 --> 00:20:45.312
Oh, I see.

00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:47.648
You think you're
gonna be lonely now?

00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:48.815
Lonely?

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.817
Well, you really
loved it, didn't you?

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:54.555
Oh, it's fine.

00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:56.190
It doesn't bother me.

00:20:56.223 --> 00:20:58.525
Mikazuki will be happy
with its parent, right?

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:30.724
(Mitsuki gasps)

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.332
(cat meows)

00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:39.666
Mikazuki.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.169
(cat meowing)

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.938
You came to visit me?

00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:47.574
(cat meowing)

00:21:48.675 --> 00:21:50.811
Why don't I keep this door open?

00:21:50.844 --> 00:21:52.346
You can visit anytime.

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.416
(cat meowing)

00:21:58.552 --> 00:22:01.722
You really are quite
fickle, aren't you?

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:13.767
(upbeat music)

00:23:43.524 --> 00:23:47.828
Mitsuki, you coming here
on your own is unusual.

00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:49.863
I haven't been feeling well.

00:23:49.897 --> 00:23:52.699
Has anything unusual happened?

00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:55.002
I've been having
a lot of dreams.

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:57.738
Dreams of when I first
saw Boruto's picture.

00:23:59.373 --> 00:24:02.843
Next time on Boruto,
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:04.678
A wound on the heart.

00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:05.946
To find the cause

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:08.749
I'm going to need to
analyze your brain.

00:24:11.752 --> 00:24:14.354
(upbeat music)
