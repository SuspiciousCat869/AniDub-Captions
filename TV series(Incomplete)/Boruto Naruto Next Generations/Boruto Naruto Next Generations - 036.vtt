WEBVTT

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.317
Your time's up!

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.022
Everyone, put your pencils
down now. I will come around
to collect your tests.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.628
What you did was perfect,
Denki! You really saved my
butt back there!

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.931
Sure! But if you hadn't done
such a good job distracting
Sensei...

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.734
then I wouldn't have been
able to steal the test questions
so easily.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:38.271
Security here is pretty lax, but
there's still almost always
someone in the teachers' lounge.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.876
Uh, so is that what you
guys were up to before? But
isn't that just cheating?

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.611
Come on, are you serious,
Boruto?

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.447
Remember what Shino Sensei
said to us a week ago?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.484
Be sure to review the exam
questions and figure out your
strategy.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.419
He practically told us to do
it!

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:56.289
Yeah, basically he said that it
was a part of the test...

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.625
to steal the questions from the
teachers' lounge, right?

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.596
<i>(Shikadai) They're testing our</i>
<i>skills as ninja in collecting</i>
<i>intel.</i>

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.631
<i>But it is a drag.</i>

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.535
Is that what he meant?! I
guess I shoulda been
listening.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.437
Uh, are you gonna be okay,
Boruto?

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.974
You didn't do anything
to get ready for the exam,
right?

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.709
Don't worry, it'll be easy!

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.945
I don't really even need to
bother studying for a test
like that one.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.480
You are awesome, Boruto!

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:23.650
But I am not going to lose to
you.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:26.386
I am going to go all out on
the practical application exam
tomorrow!

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.856
Uh. But now I'm starting to
get nervous about it.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.526
I wonder what the
practical exam'll be like
exactly?

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.596
It's probably gonna be really
tough!

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.732
There's no need to get so
scared, guys! After all, it's
just a test!

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.502
It's probably not going to be
that hard, anyway!

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:45.772
Let's just wrap this up so we
can get on with becoming
ninja, together!

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:46.673
[chewing]

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:52.813
Hm.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:57.651
Boruto got a perfect score,
huh? Boy, he's quite a kid.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.219
Lord Sixth! When did you?!

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:04.190
But, I believe he's become a bit
too confident.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.462
Hmph!

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.067
Coordinated Light Formation!

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.336
[grunting]

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:57.938
Aww, what?!

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.472
So, what are you trying to do?

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:02.843
Oh, I was just trying to test
out my Sealing Jutsu.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:05.311
You don't have enough chakra
built up to get it to work.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.982
I guess I'm not gonna be able
to use it during a real
battle, then.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.450
Denki! Why you!

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.253
Sorry, Iwabe! I didn't mean
anything by it!

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.155
<i>(Shino) You all seem pretty</i>
<i>relaxed.</i>

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:15.856
Huh?

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.227
Uh, hey, Shino Sensei!

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:26.600
I'm going to explain the rules
for the final practical
application exam.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.871
First, all of you tie your
white bandanas around your
foreheads.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:34.274
(Shino) In the exam, these will
<i>represent your life.</i>

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:37.277
If yours is taken, you fail.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.513
Consider this an actual combat
situation.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:44.851
The arena is this entire forest.
The enemy that you're going to
be battling against is us.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.755
And the time limit is the next
twenty‐four hours.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.059
By the way, this target that
we're all wearing is just like
your bandanas.

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:57.430
If you destroy it, it's like
you've defeated us, and we
won't be able to fight back.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:03.036
No way! We gotta go up against
Shino Sensei and the others?
This'll be so easy!

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.239
But don't we have to be
careful about Konohamaru
Sensei?

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.041
Isn't he aiming to become
Hokage?

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:11.211
Oh, really? Then this is even
less of a big deal!

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.948
Listen, these bandanas and
targets are only going to get
in the way.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.118
I say that what we should do is
just fight like normal people!

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.555
Then we wouldn't be able to
use discretion, would we?

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.794
It's Lord Sixth!

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:28.461
[gasps]

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.130
Old Man Kakashi?!

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.665
Hey, Boruto!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:40.206
Call me Lord Sixth when we're
with the others. I know it's
annoying, but still.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.208
Uh, sure.

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:45.879
But what are you even doing
out here, old man Lord Sixth?

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.881
What am I doing?

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.684
Well, I'm going to be the
proctor for the test.

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.118
Huh?!

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.154
Lord Sixth is gonna be the
proctor?!

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.389
You've gotta be kidding.

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:59.993
Oh, so you came to confirm how
strong I am, huh?

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:03.429
So awesome! The Hidden Leaf's
famous child genius who became
a jonin at age twelve!

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:07.568
The Sixth Hokage, who forged
peace after the Great Ninja
War, is our proctor?!

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:10.470
I just know this is gonna turn
out to be a drag.

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:13.273
Just calm down, you guys! It's
really no big deal!

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.475
I mean, old man Kakashi's
already retired!

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.544
As I said, call me Lord Sixth.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.680
(Boruto) We know all about him.
<i>He's not our enemy!</i>

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.549
I know all about you guys, as
well.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:25.485
Oh, you do, huh? What do you
know about us?

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:28.488
I know that all of you are a
bunch of troublemakers.

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:32.526
<i>(Kakashi) That's the whole</i>
reason why I became the proctor
<i>for this test.</i>

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.962
Because we can't allow
troublemakers to become shinobi.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:36.763
Huh?

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:41.301
I'll say it again: we don't
need to have troublemakers as
Leaf shinobi.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:46.139
I'll be watching. And I'll also
be deciding whether you have
what it takes...

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.575
to become a worthy shinobi or
not.

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:51.477
Let's see. First...

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:56.817
<i>(Kakashi) If you can take this</i>
bell away from me, you'll pass.
<i>How's that sound?</i>

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:03.156
<i>By the way, headbands and</i>
targets are only for clarifying
<i>our decisions, if need be.</i>

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.393
<i>We wouldn't want to go</i>
<i>overboard and end up killing</i>
<i>someone, right?</i>

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.596
[gasps]

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.833
This sounds like a lot of fun.

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:16.069
It'll give us the perfect
chance to show you just what
we're made of!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:20.841
Um. I'd like to ask one question
if I could. There's one bell for
each participant, right?

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:21.675
Nope.

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:22.576
What?!

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.412
I'm saying that all there is,
is just this one bell.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:31.552
Hold on a second! Does that mean
that you're only gonna pass one
person out of all of us?!

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:36.289
Well, you can always quit if you
don't like it. Although that
would be an automatic fail.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:40.326
<i>(Kakashi) In this day and age,</i>
we have enough personnel to fill
<i>all our needs.</i>

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.796
<i>It's not a big deal if no one</i>
<i>passes.</i>

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:43.697
[gasps]

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:46.266
How can you do something that
messed up?!

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.001
<i>(Shino) What's messed up about</i>
<i>it?</i>

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:48.902
Hmm?

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.805
The reason is, because in an
actual battle...

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:55.141
there's no way to predict just
what you're going to come up
against.

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:57.811
There's something very important
that you mustn't forget.

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:02.482
In the world that you're all
striving to enter, one single
mistake can mean death.

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:03.984
That's the harsh truth.

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.953
The Sensei are really scaring
me now.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:09.756
The three of us will be acting
as Lord Sixth's bodyguards.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.494
Which means in order to get
to Lord Sixth, you're going to
have to get through us first.

00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:17.130
And we don't plan on making it
easy for you.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:21.702
Well, there you have it. We're
not going to hold back, either.

00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:24.938
So come at us with the intent to
kill.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:28.474
All right, you guys. Show us
how strong your resolve is.

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.578
Are you sure about what you
just said?

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:34.915
Of course. Absolutely.

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:38.451
Because there's no way that
I'd ever allow myself to lose
to immature school kids...

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:41.221
who just pal around and refuse
to grow up.

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:42.088
[grunts]

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:46.259
You have twenty‐four hours
starting now. On your mark.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.094
No need for that!

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:48.862
<i>(Kakashi) Hm?</i>

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:50.797
'Cause I'll settle this right
now!

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:53.567
[gasps]

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:57.170
[gasps]

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:02.275
Good grief! Like father, like
son. So impatient!

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.845
Never mind. We start now.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.212
[gasps]

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:06.780
[gasps]

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:09.315
So, what should we do?!

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.652
They're mocking us!

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:13.186
Wait! Come back here!

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:13.687
[gasps]

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.189
We don't pal around. I mean,
come on!

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.924
You're not getting away!

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:20.927
[sighs]

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:27.300
I'm gonna become a ninja this
year, I'm sure of it!

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.970
I'm gonna make it, too!
There's no way that we'll
lose!

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:35.576
You two really make a great
couple of rivals for me! I am
not going to lose either!

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:37.511
[determined yell]

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:40.647
Hm? [chuckles]

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:41.882
[grunts]

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:46.052
Enko, they're getting ahead of
us. Aren't we gonna go after
them?

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.489
Nice try! You wanna use Iwabe
and the others as a diversion.

00:09:49.523 --> 00:09:52.392
You're just looking to find a
way to preserve your energy!

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.828
Well, it's not gonna work on me,
Houki!

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.098
What did you say? Like I'd
ever pull a cheap trick like
that!

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:00.066
I don't know about that.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:01.467
Come on!

00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:02.168
[gasps]

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.369
Damn it.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:06.973
Wait, Doushu!

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:13.479
Going after Lord Sixth blindly
will only end badly for
whoever tries it.

00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:16.950
Before we do that, we first
have to figure out a strategy
to get the bell.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.219
But what are we going to do if
somebody else...

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:22.222
is able to get to Lord Sixth
before we can reach him, Sarada?

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.991
After all, there's only one
bell, remember?

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.026
Yeah, well.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.263
Look, just worry about that
once we face off against him!

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.064
Boruto?!

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:33.466
Relax, guys! It's just an
exam!

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:37.704
If things don't work out now,
we'll just have to practice
some more.

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:39.640
Or take a make‐up
exam, that's all.

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:42.042
[chuckles] That's so like you,
Boruto.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:42.743
Mitsuki!

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:46.246
Well, nevertheless, the fact
that ever since Lord Sixth told
everyone...

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.882
that the exam had started,
they've all gone off on their
own.

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:51.718
<i>(Mitsuki) Even Shikadai's not</i>
<i>here.</i>

00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:57.157
It seems it may be the case
that we can't simply do
anything that we might choose.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.261
(Inojin) You planted a GPS on
Lord Sixth! Nice job, Shikadai!

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:04.931
Yeah, well, it's just a drag
to use more energy than you
really have to.

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:09.202
I feel bad about ditching
Boruto, but right now, we've
gotta look out for ourselves.

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:12.906
My mom and dad are totally
gonna nag me if I don't make
it as a ninja.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:17.110
That's why we really don't have
a choice but to do whatever it
takes to make this work.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:20.113
The Ino‐Shika‐Cho goes back a
long time, huh?

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:22.816
[gasps] This is...

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.317
...Really close to here!

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.186
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:28.989
[gasps]

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.462
It's a bug!

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:38.131
Guess they got us.

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:39.065
This is bad.

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:39.700
Hm?

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:44.270
The Sensei wanted to separate
us all, and we fell for their
strategy to do just that.

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:48.108
Uh?

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.010
Hm?

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:52.746
Hey, hasn't it felt off for a
while now?

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:54.548
So you can sense it, too, huh?

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:59.720
Yes, you are right. I am
pretty sure I have seen that
giant tree before.

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:07.093
They're such easy pickings when
they're scattered. One genjutsu
done and complete! Hm?

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:10.931
[grunts]

00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:15.401
You guys do know it's an
individual exam, right?

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:18.304
And you're only reminding us of
that because your objective is
to separate all of us.

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:19.405
Isn't that right?

00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:23.476
At least in the beginning, it's
more effective if we all work
together...

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.580
in order to overcome the
obstacles that are standing in
our way.

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:29.049
Sensei, I know our mutual love
of sweets has nothing to do
with this exam.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.885
But please let me be the one who
gets the bell, okay?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:35.255
(Inojin) Cho‐Cho, now's not the
<i>time!</i>

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:39.292
[chuckles] So, I'm gonna have
to deal with the weaklings, is
that it?

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:42.495
I can definitely say that
they've underestimated me.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.931
[grunts]

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:47.500
Anko Sensei's doing battle
over there.

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:49.736
We gotta find Lord Sixth and
soon.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.738
Early bird gets the worm,
right?

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:53.406
Yep, that's right!

00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:55.542
Huh?
[gasps]

00:12:55.576 --> 00:12:58.411
[grunts]

00:12:58.712 --> 00:12:59.580
[grunts]

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.047
Whoa, what happened here?!

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.985
[grunts]

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.821
[groans]

00:13:07.854 --> 00:13:10.056
Early bird getting the worm or
not...

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:15.862
did all of you really believe
that you'd be able to get past
the three of us so easily?

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:18.098
And here comes the second
wave.

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:28.709
It's Big Brother Konohamaru!

00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:30.911
It's "Sensei" right now, got
it?!

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:33.179
Hmph!

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:36.016
Hmph! [grunts]

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.784
[grunts]

00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:43.223
[grunting]

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:46.893
You don't seem to understand
what Lord Sixth said to all of
you!

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:48.194
Ah! [grunts]

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:50.964
I'll show you what a real
battle is like.

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:53.033
[chuckles]

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:53.900
[gasps]

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:58.004
Hey! Wait, Boruto! Where do
you think you're going?!

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:03.443
Like I'm gonna wait! I don't
waste time on low‐scoring
questions or hard word problems!

00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:06.246
<i>(Boruto) Don't you know the</i>
<i>first thing about test‐taking</i>
<i>strategy?!</i>

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:10.050
[grunts] Hey, are you saying
that I'm like some kind of
word problem?!

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:14.254
<i>(Boruto) My only target's Old</i>
<i>Man Kakashi! He gets me the</i>
<i>passing score!</i>

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:18.024
Ugh, that kid. He really does
know all the tricks of the
trade.

00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:21.227
Well? Shouldn't the two of you
be going after him?

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.564
If going that way was the
correct thing to do...

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:26.567
then you wouldn't have allowed
Boruto to pass by you so easily.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.572
Not bad. I knew that you'd
understand things better than
Boruto. But!

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.473
Class Rep! Let's do this!

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:34.340
Right!

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:43.550
So what exactly is your plan
to find Lord Sixth, Boruto?

00:14:43.584 --> 00:14:46.753
I don't actually know it just
yet, but for right now...

00:14:46.787 --> 00:14:50.290
<i>(Boruto) I'm gonna search from</i>
<i>the top of the highest tree.</i>

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:52.959
[gasps]

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.528
Wind Style: Breakthrough.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.129
[inhale/exhale]

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.564
[grunts]

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:01.167
Lord Sixth is up ahead.

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.804
To pass, you'll have to take
me down first.

00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:08.374
But it will be impossible for
you to reach him. And the
reason is because...

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.410
Lightning Style: Snake
Lightning!

00:15:13.547 --> 00:15:15.516
Boruto, you go on ahead.

00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:16.216
What?!

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:18.418
You can just leave this to me.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.053
Wait, are you sure?

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.488
Yes. I'd like to battle
Sensei.

00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:24.324
Okay, then! See ya!

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:27.227
Hey!

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:31.965
Let's do this, Shino Sensei.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:39.372
All right, so where is Lord
Sixth?

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:42.709
(Kakashi) Hm. A rather carefree
<i>and simplistic approach.</i>

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:47.180
But searching from a high
vantage point isn't a bad idea.

00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:57.624
Shadow Clone, huh?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.194
Really?

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:01.427
[gasps]

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.902
All right, then, bring it on!

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:13.239
I'm ready, old man! I'm gonna
pass this exam right here and
now!

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:14.575
[chuckles]

00:16:24.885 --> 00:16:25.586
Huh?

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:28.221
Hm? [chuckling]

00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:30.123
<i>(Cho‐Cho) [attacking yell]</i>

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:36.296
[attacking hiss]

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.363
Snakes!

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:39.465
Uh?

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.333
[attacking hiss]

00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:42.536
[grunts]

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.572
Special Jonin are good.

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:48.742
You're totally not just some
middle‐aged lady who loves
sweets.

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:54.214
You only realized that now? Goes
to show, you shouldn't take
middle‐aged ladies for granted!

00:16:54.247 --> 00:16:56.182
Hmph! [attacking hiss]

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:57.784
Damn it! [grunts]

00:16:57.818 --> 00:16:58.919
Shikadai!

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:00.120
Ahh! [grunts]

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:02.488
[attacking hiss]

00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:04.625
[grunting]

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:05.491
Mud Wall!

00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:07.528
[gasps]

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:12.599
Hmph!

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:14.134
When did all of you?

00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:18.238
The genjutsu counter that you
taught us worked just perfectly,
so thank you for that.

00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:19.640
There's nowhere to run.

00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:22.242
I guess you'd call this a
reversal of fortune.

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:26.146
You know, I have to admit it,
you kids are pretty tough.

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:27.581
[licking lips]

00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:31.952
<i>(Mitsuki) I'm not letting you</i>
<i>get past me, Shino Sensei.</i>

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:36.422
<i>(Shino) How unusual. You've</i>
<i>never shown this much</i>
<i>determination before.</i>

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:40.226
<i>I thought you weren't</i>
<i>interested in exams like this.</i>

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.229
That might've been true in the
past that is.

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:47.467
But now, thanks to Boruto, I
see some things differently.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.771
<i>(Mitsuki) At the very least...</i>

00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:54.708
I want to help Boruto pass this
test and to become a ninja
together with him.

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:55.842
[gasps]

00:17:57.778 --> 00:18:00.647
One more thing, back then I
said there was nothing more
that I could learn from you.

00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:05.752
Now I know that you are the
one I must challenge with
everything I've got.

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:10.857
It seems that I'm going to
need to become a bit more
serious right now.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.728
Hmph.

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:20.333
[gasps]

00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:24.505
[grunting]

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:27.541
Sharingan, huh? You've already
awakened it?

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:31.011
But it appears that you still
haven't mastered using it yet.

00:18:31.044 --> 00:18:31.912
<i>(Sumire) Summoning!</i>

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:32.579
Huh?

00:18:32.613 --> 00:18:33.714
[grunts]

00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:34.848
[gasps]

00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:36.049
[grunts]

00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:37.383
What is this thing?!

00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:38.118
Sarada!

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.086
Thanks.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.555
<i>(Konohamaru) Lightning Style!</i>

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:41.988
Hm?

00:18:42.022 --> 00:18:43.724
[grunting]

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:46.693
Please be careful, Nue!

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:49.129
That was practically nothing at
all compared to Konohamaru
Sensei's full power!

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:51.998
That's Nue, huh?

00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:55.268
It's much smaller than the last
time I saw it, but it's still a
real handful.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:19:00.373
With you having the Sharingan
and Nue too, you're more trouble
than I thought you'd be.

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:02.809
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:09.049
Shadow Clones, huh? Naruto
teach you that?

00:19:09.082 --> 00:19:11.451
You think I'd ask him for
anything?!

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:16.857
[grunting]

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.758
Okay.

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:18.491
[grunts]

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:19.760
[attacking yell]

00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:23.730
[grunting]

00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:26.633
You used Substitution to
switch with my clone?!

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:29.870
You and your father really are
so similar.

00:19:29.903 --> 00:19:31.905
Oh no we're not!

00:19:31.938 --> 00:19:33.874
Hmph!

00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:41.147
[grunting]

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.482
[frustrated grunt]

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.787
I'm surprised. You're pretty
good.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.254
[chuckles]

00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:53.660
[heavy breathing]

00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:58.464
Didn't think you'd get this
far. I have to say, you truly
are his son.

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:00.834
[chuckles] Sure, you may say
that.

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:04.505
But I know that you
still have some insects that
you haven't even used yet.

00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:07.508
Oh, well. In any event, I
don't really care either way.

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:10.677
I can't very well kill one of
my own students, now, can I?

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:15.181
But there is still more to
this exam, so why don't you go
on ahead.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:15.882
Right.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:20.821
Although, there may not even be
a point, since Boruto might have
already settled everything.

00:20:20.854 --> 00:20:23.156
<i>(Shino) Not possible.</i>

00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:26.993
The reason is because Lord
Sixth is not as lenient as I
am.

00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:29.229
[heavy breathing]

00:20:29.262 --> 00:20:33.099
To get this far even before
you've graduated from the
Academy.

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:37.838
Honestly, even in my eyes,
you're a cut above the rest of
your fellow students.

00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:40.040
(Kakashi) You're a real genius.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.976
[chuckles] So you finally get
it, huh?

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:44.645
<i>(Kakashi) But it's no good.</i>

00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:45.378
[gasps]

00:20:46.312 --> 00:20:48.048
You still aren't suited to
become a ninja.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.950
What?!

00:20:49.983 --> 00:20:53.319
I say that because you lack a
decisive element.

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:55.989
[chuckles] I wondered what you
were gonna say.

00:20:56.022 --> 00:20:59.560
But, I don't need to hear yet
another lecture, ya know.

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:00.794
So anyway.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.964
<i>(Boruto) If I take that bell</i>
<i>from you, I pass, right?</i>

00:21:03.997 --> 00:21:04.931
Of course.

00:21:06.132 --> 00:21:07.000
Let's go!

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:08.034
Yeah!

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:10.103
Wind Style! Gale Palm!

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:11.972
[grunts] Take this!

00:21:12.005 --> 00:21:13.206
Lethal!

00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:14.741
Boruto!

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:15.709
Stream!

00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:16.977
[gasps]

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.478
[grunts]

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:21.782
[chuckles]

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:28.454
The bell's mine!

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.995
[grunts] Not this again!

00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:37.598
[gasps]

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:42.969
<i>(Kakashi) So you hid the real</i>
you underground and lured me out
<i>with clones.</i>

00:21:43.704 --> 00:21:44.505
Hm?

00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:47.207
(Kakashi) You really did almost
<i>get the bell.</i>

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.842
[grunts]

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:51.011
[grunts] Ow, ow, owww!

00:21:51.044 --> 00:21:56.216
<i>(Kakashi) Taijutsu, ninjutsu,</i>
<i>you excel all around. You're a</i>
<i>cut above the rest.</i>

00:21:56.249 --> 00:22:00.687
The skills you have are those
of a genin or even a chunin.

00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:01.788
[grunts]

00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:05.826
And that's the reason why this
is going to be the end of the
line for you.

00:22:06.593 --> 00:22:08.461
Damn it!

00:23:44.658 --> 00:23:47.093
<i>(Kakashi) It's probably</i>
<i>impossible for someone...</i>

00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:49.830
who doesn't have the motivation
<i>to become a ninja.</i>

00:23:49.863 --> 00:23:52.098
(Boruto) How would you even know
<i>anything about me?!</i>

00:23:52.132 --> 00:23:55.602
<i>(Kakashi) Oh, I know plenty.</i>
This year's Academy students are
<i>horrible.</i>

00:23:55.636 --> 00:23:57.771
They underestimate what a ninja
<i>is.</i>

00:23:57.804 --> 00:24:01.307
<i>I can only assume that's</i>
<i>because of your influence on</i>
<i>them.</i>

00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:02.876
<i>(Boruto) No way?! Me?!</i>

00:24:04.811 --> 00:24:08.014
<i>(Kakashi) Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations: "A</i>
<i>Shinobi's Resolve."</i>

00:24:08.048 --> 00:24:12.485
<i>There's just no way that I can</i>
<i>acknowledge this group as</i>
<i>ninja.</i>
