WEBVTT

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.442
(cheerful music)

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.845
(eating loudly)

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.815
(stunned gasps)

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.050
That was good, thanks.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.586
Okay, I'm heading out now!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.388
Oh, where are you going?

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.358
I'm doing some training
with Mr. Sasuke today!

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.094
It's been so long since
Sasuke's been home.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.630
Don't you think he might
want to relax a bit?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.534
A shinobi knows no rest.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.670
Sasuke'd probably say
something cool like that!

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.705
(giggles)

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.340
What is it, Mom?

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:43.177
You're just like your
dad when he was young.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:44.978
Ugh!

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:46.413
Like dad?

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.347
Yeah.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.249
Your dad was always
excited about going off

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:50.751
to train with his Master.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.855
Hold on, dad had a master?

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.123
Yes, of course!

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.358
He was a great man
named Master Jiraiya.

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:00.594
Oh?

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.597
I totally wanna meet him!

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.631
Where is he?

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:09.736
Well, it's impossible.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.040
He passed away.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:15.709
Oh, I see.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.812
We have some photos!
Wanna see?

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.047
Huh?

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:23.217
Yeah, let's see 'em!

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.588
(opening theme music)

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.177
(opening theme music)

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:07.054
"Make-Out Tactics"

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:08.055
[Hinata] That's him.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:09.790
That's Master Jiraiya.

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:10.824
Whoa.

00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:13.660
He looks wild and crazy!

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:14.828
Yes, you're right.

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.096
He does look that way!

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.498
But he was a very heroic man.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:21.368
Not only was he a
teacher but in some ways

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.904
was like a father
figure to your dad.

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.138
Oh, yeah?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.209
Granny Tsunade still
looks exactly the same!

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.044
[Himawari] Wow, she does!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.948
And Kakashi Sensei hasn't
changed much, either!

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:36.216
[Himawari] Oh, look!

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.219
That's Sarada's mom
and Shikadai's dad!

00:03:39.253 --> 00:03:41.555
That's Metal's
dad, Inojin's mom,

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.423
and Cho-Cho's dad, too, huh?

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.795
And that's Uncle
Neji, right, mom?

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:49.796
Yes.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.931
He was my cousin.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.766
But I don't really
think of him as that.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.404
To me, he was more like a kind
and supportive older brother.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.438
Huh?

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:01.308
Hold on.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.810
How come Sasuke's not
in the picture with you?

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:04.912
[Hinata] Sasuke?

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:07.181
Oh, he was away at the time.

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:11.351
Too bad he wasn't there
to be in the photo!

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.688
Back then what was Sasuke like?

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:15.822
Huh?

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.391
Strong, right?

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.392
Oh!

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.626
Uh, yes!

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.197
Sasuke was always at the top
of our class in every lesson!

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.233
Yeah, I figured that
had to be the case!

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.268
Sasuke is totally awesome!

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:32.506
And he looks way cooler
than this old guy!

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.907
I think so, too!

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:34.908
Yeah!

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:36.210
Right?

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.046
But still, Master Jiraiya
was an amazing shinobi.

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:44.251
He even might've been stronger
than Sasuke or your dad.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.185
What?

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.287
Come on, there's
no way that's true!

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.695
(humming)

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:55.929
Oh, hey, Sarada?

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.097
Hm?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.932
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.067
Oh, I don't know.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.035
Just make something
that Dad likes.

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.804
Speaking of which, where is he?

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:05.539
Did he go out already?

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:06.640
Yeah.

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.342
He had business with the Hokage.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:11.044
If he's not actually
here when he's here,

00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:14.014
it's no different than
staying away from the village.

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:15.682
(doorbell rings)

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:16.717
Huh?

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:18.552
Yes?

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:19.653
How's it going?

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:20.821
Boruto?

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:21.822
Hey!

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.824
Is Uncle Sasuke home?

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.192
He wasn't at the
training grounds,

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:27.594
so I thought he
might still be here.

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:30.831
Sorry, but Dad went to
the Hokage's office.

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.065
Ugh, seriously?

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.467
He went to see my dad?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.936
Aw, man, and I really
wanted to train with him

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.038
and ask him about some stuff.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.306
Ask him what?

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.476
Well, you probably
never heard of him,

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.413
but I wanted to ask about
someone by the name of Jiraiya.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.448
Jiraiya, huh?

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:50.517
I think I've heard
that name before!

00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:51.518
Huh?

00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:52.553
Wait, really?

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.055
Oh, that's it!

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:58.025
(startled gasp)

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:00.561
"Leaf Flea Market"

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:07.234
The book's "Make-Out Tactics?"

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:08.202
Yeah.

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.671
Do you remember back
when we had Family Day?

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.706
Yeah.

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:16.944
Things between my Dad and me
were kinda awkward back then.

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.213
So, Kakashi Sensei
loaned that book to him

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.049
and said that he should read it.

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:23.951
He said that it would
help him understand

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.053
how his daughter feels.

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:28.956
I'm almost positive that
the author of that book--

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.291
Was Mister Jiraiya?

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:32.492
Yeah.

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:36.063
If you read his book, maybe
you'll learn more about him.

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:38.465
Oh, I get it!

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.601
[Sarada] I'm not sure
what the story is about,

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:43.203
but I think it has to do with
inter-personal relationships

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:44.938
and advice on how to build them.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.574
Oh I see.

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:50.277
So it holds the secrets
to success in life!

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.478
Probably.

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:54.815
In any case, it's Kakashi
Sensei's favorite book.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.050
So I'm sure it'll be useful.

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:58.719
Yeah.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.655
So why're we here?

00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:02.656
It's an old book,

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.224
so I figured it would be easiest

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:05.959
to find it at the flea market.

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.761
You're so on the ball, Sarada!

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.531
Okay, let's split up, look for
this Make-Out Tactics book,

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:11.798
-and--
-Thief!

00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:13.934
(shocked gasps)

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.769
What's going on? Oh no!

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.238
Someone stop that guy!

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:19.506
Ready?

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.541
Hold it!

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:26.413
(shocked, frightened gasp)

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.616
(applause, cheering)

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.286
Don't break the rules,
or you'll pay the price!

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.320
Seriously.

00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:36.790
Shino Sensei!

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.125
Boruto!

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:40.427
If you two were nearby,
then you shoulda caught him!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.362
Uh, well, we...

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:45.199
Seriously, you guys
gotta stop relying on us

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.067
to fix all of your problems!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.368
Yeah, right.

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:50.537
You just wanted to look
good in front of everybody.

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:53.273
(uncomfortable chuckle)

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:54.474
Huh?

00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.877
You're asking if I know
about "Make-Out Tactics?"

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:02.082
Oh, uh, that's the book that
was written by Master Jiraiya,

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:04.518
that's what it is, right?

00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:05.552
What's wrong?

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.254
Are you feeling okay?

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:08.288
Uh...

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.559
Yes, that's definitely the
book he wrote, all right.

00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:14.361
So you knew Mister Jiraiya?

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:17.064
Oh, yeah, of course I knew him.

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.966
What was he like?

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.134
Well, what I can
tell you about him?

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:24.638
He was the Third
Hokage's student

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.707
and one of the Legendary Sannin.

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.309
I've heard that term before.

00:08:30.077 --> 00:08:31.311
Who're the others?

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.948
Uh, Lady Tsunade and Orochimaru.

00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:37.584
He was an amazing shinobi.

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.187
He taught two generations
of your family,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.456
Lord Fourth and Lord Seventh.

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:45.726
You mean he taught my
dad and my Grandpa, too?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.197
And was crucial in
two Great Ninja Wars.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.433
He helped secure the peace
we now enjoy in the Leaf.

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:54.468
No way!

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.436
He was really that
impressive, huh?

00:08:57.237 --> 00:08:58.472
There's no doubt about it!

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.074
Master Jiraiya was
an awesome shinobi!

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:04.178
But unlike me, he just
wasn't the right material

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:05.445
to become the Hokage.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.316
Uh, what do you
mean, "unlike me?"

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:11.718
Oh, didn't you guys
know about this?

00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:15.422
You see, back in the day, I
turned down the title of Hokage.

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.423
What?

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:17.524
Really?

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:18.525
Yeah.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:21.428
Naruto and I competed
to become the Hokage.

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:24.565
I never heard that before.

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:25.933
(uncomfortable grunt)

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:29.203
But, Naruto had been
going on for so many years

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:31.338
about how he was
gonna become Hokage,

00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:33.473
so I decided just
to let him have it.

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:37.411
And that's something not
even Naruto knows about.

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:39.079
Wow!

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:41.081
Yep, when I was around your age,

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:44.551
the village placed all their
hopes squarely on my shoulders.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:46.220
(Shino uncomfortable grunt)

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:48.922
Well, just do your
best, you guys.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:51.225
Yeah, so thanks for
sharing all that,

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.961
but what we'd asked you
is if you knew anything about

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:55.829
Jiraiya's "Make-Out
Tactics" book.

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:58.365
(nervous chuckle)

00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:02.169
Seems it's his masterpiece
about the secret of success.

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:06.173
Well, I don't know if I'd
say that's quite what it is.

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.408
I think it's really
more of a novel

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:09.543
than a how-to book.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.644
Oh, cool!

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:11.645
It's a novel?

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:12.946
Now I wanna read it even more!

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.581
[Both] No!
You can't!

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:16.049
And...

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.452
Why not?

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:20.521
Because you're
still way too young.

00:10:20.554 --> 00:10:21.555
Mm-hmm.

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:25.058
We're still too young?

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:28.428
Man, what exactly could
be in that novel, anyway?

00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:30.831
Maybe it's so
incredibly profound

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:32.499
that you can't
really understand it

00:10:32.533 --> 00:10:36.036
unless you've gotten a little
more life experience first?

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:37.938
That makes sense.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.807
So, it's way too profound, huh?

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:42.809
Now I wanna read
it more than ever!

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:43.810
Yeah, me, too.

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:45.045
[Cho-Cho] Sarada!

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:48.916
[Both] Hey!

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.217
(chuckle)

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.152
You're selling stuff here?

00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:53.187
Yep!

00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:55.489
Are these used clothes?

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:58.325
Yeah. My dad and I are
selling off some old stuff

00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:00.194
that we just don't wear anymore.

00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:02.729
But it seems that no
one's wants to buy them.

00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:04.698
[Cho-Cho] I don't get why!

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:06.333
I mean, they're so cute!

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:08.569
Yeah, that's too bad.

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:12.306
Hey, Uncle Choji,
let me ask you,

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.942
have you ever read the
book, "Make-Out Tactics?"

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.310
-(shocked gasp)
-Huh?

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.045
[Boruto] We're trying
to find out more

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:19.680
about Mister Jiraiya.

00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:20.714
Hey, hold on, dad.

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:22.049
You've read that
book, haven't you?

00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:24.518
No! Well, I mean, uh...

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.086
It's a novel, right?

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:28.822
So is it a cool action
novel about a hero's journey

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.557
that's also really deep?

00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:31.558
Right?

00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:32.693
That's it, right?

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:34.094
Well, is it?

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:38.098
No, uh, well, that's, uh,
not exactly what it is--

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.333
Is it a mystery?

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:41.668
Well, it's more like--

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:42.669
Like what?

00:11:42.703 --> 00:11:45.072
Uh, like a romance novel.

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:46.306
Whoa, seriously?

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.442
I totally wanna
read it, too, then!

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.645
Well, maybe you will someday.

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:53.046
Oh, that's right!

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.250
Master Jiraiya was the
one who taught Naruto!

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:57.050
Yeah!

00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:58.452
That's what I heard too!

00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:02.189
Naruto was just about the
age that you are now, Boruto

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.592
when he first began his
training under Master Jiraiya.

00:12:05.626 --> 00:12:08.095
And your dad mastered
the Summoning Jutsu

00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:09.963
and the Rasengan!

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.532
Really?

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:12.533
Oh, yeah!

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:15.035
Naruto was absolutely
incredible back then!

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.371
I mean, not that he
isn't right now, too!

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.306
Uh-huh.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.543
Anyway, about this
"Make-Out Tactics" book

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:23.777
that you're looking for,

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.312
if you go right down that way,

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.314
you'll see the
antique shop's tent.

00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:29.416
They have some old
books for sale.

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:30.417
Oh yeah?

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.785
They do?

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.820
(chuckle) I want
to read it, too!

00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:35.355
-You gotta let me borrow it!
-Dad, look!

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:38.058
I think this t-shirt'll
actually fit me!

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.060
(robust laughter)

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.429
The stuff these guys're
selling in this stall

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:43.931
is just our style.

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:44.932
Hey, wait...

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.567
Aren't you two?

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:49.636
No way, it's you!

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.771
Son, take a look!

00:12:50.804 --> 00:12:52.206
They're our eternal rivals!

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:53.941
Meeting you like this is fate!

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:56.410
Now we get to challenge
you one more time!

00:12:57.978 --> 00:12:59.246
Who're you again?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.247
Kui!

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.081
And Daore!

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.683
How could you ever forget about

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:04.051
our eating contest to the death?

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:06.053
Welcome to our store!

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.388
We're offering a limited-time
special right now.

00:13:08.422 --> 00:13:09.389
What?

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:10.357
We are?

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.659
If you purchase
just three t-shirts,

00:13:12.693 --> 00:13:14.228
then you get two more for free!

00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:15.562
Did you hear that, dad?

00:13:15.596 --> 00:13:16.363
That's a great deal!

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:19.099
Get to it, my dear son!
Go on!

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.834
The rest is up to you, dad.

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:22.402
Huh?

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:23.537
Boruto, Sarada!

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.538
Let's go!

00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:25.572
-Excuse us.
-See ya!

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:29.576
[Daore] This one's so
cute, I want to eat it!

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:34.414
Excuse me.

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:37.217
By any chance do you have a
book called "Make-Out Tactics?"

00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:38.018
Huh?

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:40.587
Uh, let's see.

00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:43.090
It looks like there
are five or six books

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:44.725
in the "Make-Out" series.

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:46.960
We only need one.

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.562
Do you have any of 'em?

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.634
Hmm, let me look.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.269
Just a minute.

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:57.137
I really hope they have it.

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:59.039
That'd be so great.

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:01.041
Oh, please, please, please!

00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:04.077
Ah, here it is, right here!

00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:05.946
(excited, eager gasp)

00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:07.881
Yep, this is the one!

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:09.116
[All] Huh?

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:11.952
[Cho-Cho] Dad?

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:14.421
Sorry, but you're
not old enough yet!

00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:16.790
Aw, c'mon, Dad!

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.025
Why?

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:22.196
And next up, in
scientific news, today,

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:24.765
a team of archeologists
from the Land of Fire

00:14:24.798 --> 00:14:28.001
managed to recover an
artifact from the ocean floor

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.404
that they believe to be a
relic from ancient times.

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:33.473
Why is everyone saying we're
too young for this book?

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:34.808
All we really want to do

00:14:34.842 --> 00:14:37.544
is to learn more
about Mister Jiraiya.

00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:38.545
Yeah!

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:39.546
Right?

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.681
Seriously.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.283
Them saying that makes me
want to read it even more!

00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:44.484
Yeah.

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:48.088
Well I guess we have to give
it up, for today, at least.

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:49.556
Yeah, you're right.

00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:52.893
Damn it!

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:54.294
I'm going to the
training grounds

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.230
to work out before I go home.

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:59.366
Maybe Sasuke'll be there, too.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:02.936
'kay. Well, if you do see him,
tell him to come home early.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.171
My mom's super happy

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:06.740
and is making something
special for him.

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:08.775
All right, you got it, Sarada.

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:10.077
See ya!

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.378
And thanks for today!

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.379
Yeah!

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.547
See you later!

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.684
Hey, Sasuke!

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:26.560
So you want to
know about Jiraiya?

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.495
And what brought this on?

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:32.766
Well, my mom said he
was an amazing shinobi.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.334
Uh, is it really true

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:37.104
he was even stronger
than you and my dad?

00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:41.041
She also told me
that the relationship

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:43.343
my dad had with Mister Jiraiya

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:46.446
was a lot like our
teacher-student relationship.

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:48.916
I'd say she's right about

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:51.485
the teacher-student
relationship part.

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:54.555
Although it's not
exactly the same thing.

00:15:54.588 --> 00:15:56.023
What do you mean?

00:15:57.124 --> 00:16:00.060
[Sasuke] Naruto trained very
rigorously under Jiraiya

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:02.663
to reach his goals,
and in the end

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:07.234
that became the seed that
grew into a deep bond.

00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:09.436
That's pretty much
just like you and me.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.806
You taught me the Rasengan
and Shuriken Jutsu!

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.309
That isn't quite the point here.

00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:16.743
Naruto trained with Jiraiya

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:20.247
to protect something he felt
was worth risking his life for.

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:26.587
He had a profound influence
on who Naruto is today.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.357
He's the one who taught Naruto
what it means to be a ninja

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.060
and how to walk
his own Ninja Way.

00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:36.930
To Naruto, he was a master
but also like a father.

00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.365
You and I haven't come close

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:40.734
to what he and Naruto
were to each other.

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:46.607
But I've heard that he
was a great shinobi.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.110
Well, if you say so,
then it must be true.

00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:55.015
Oh, right! There was an old
photo with a bunch of people

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:57.384
in it, including my dad
and Mister Jiraiya.

00:16:58.385 --> 00:16:59.520
But not you.

00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:04.958
Well, back then I
lost my way and--

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:05.959
What?

00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:07.361
Don't tell me you got lost

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.396
and were late for
the photograph?

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:12.165
Yeah, you could say that.

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:12.966
Oh!

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.001
Right!

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.536
I forgot the most
important thing!

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.771
Can you ask Mr. Kakashi

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:19.973
and borrow his
Make-Out Tactics book?

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:27.948
Don't go there, all right?

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.450
Aww, c'mon!

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:35.022
I'm home.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.623
-Oh, welcome back!
-Hey, welcome back!

00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:39.226
Ugh, I'm so hungry.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.562
And in further news
about the ancient relic

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:43.897
efforts are now underway
to break the Sealing Jutsu

00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:46.567
that have been placed upon it.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.735
The archaeological team
is still struggling

00:17:48.769 --> 00:17:49.903
to decipher the
unusual pattern--

00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:51.705
I've seen that
pattern somewhere.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.475
Learn anything about
Master Jiraiya?

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:56.476
Yeah.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.745
Well, kinda.

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:02.749
Hey, so what was Dad like when
he was around my age, anyway?

00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:03.817
Huh?

00:18:03.851 --> 00:18:05.452
Why the sudden interest?

00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:08.355
Well, it's around
the same time, right?

00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:10.924
He was about my age when
Mister Jiraiya taught him

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.026
all sorts of cool stuff.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.562
I just wondered what
he was like then.

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:18.832
Well, actually, he hasn't
really changed that much

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:20.467
since he was a little boy!

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.404
He's always been
straightforward.

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:28.876
He'd always say, "I
never go back on my word!

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:30.477
"That's my Ninja Way!"

00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.814
And sure enough, he stayed
true to what he said!

00:18:33.847 --> 00:18:35.215
No matter what,

00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:38.785
he always kept on forging
ahead and never gave up.

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:40.921
He valued his
friends very highly

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.090
and would do anything
to protect them,

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.192
and he was never dishonest.

00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:48.695
That's just how
he's always been!

00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:49.897
Mm-hmm.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.766
Uh, anyway, your
dad was like that

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.201
since he was a little kid,

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:56.270
but after he met Master Jiraiya,

00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:58.572
I think those feelings
grew even stronger.

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.876
"A real Ninja is
one who endures."

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.078
That's what Master Jiraiya said.

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:07.347
Your dad really took
those words to heart,

00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:09.449
and he's never, ever given up!

00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:15.389
And I've always been watching
your dad for a long time.

00:19:19.693 --> 00:19:20.661
(harrumphing chuckle)

00:19:20.694 --> 00:19:21.662
But come on, mom.

00:19:21.695 --> 00:19:23.330
I bet that you could've
found someone way cooler

00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.732
than a loser like Dad, right?

00:19:25.766 --> 00:19:29.069
Even back then, just like
now, I loved your dad!

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:31.138
[Boruto And Himawari] Huh?

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.473
No way! Don't tell me you've
been in love with Dad

00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:34.675
since you were a kid!

00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:35.876
You both loved each other?

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:37.644
Uh, never mind!

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:39.079
Forget I said anything!

00:19:39.112 --> 00:19:40.881
[Boruto] C'mon, mom, tell us!

00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:42.049
[Hinata] No way!

00:19:42.082 --> 00:19:43.517
[Himawari] Please
tell us, Mommy!

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.685
Yeah, come on!

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:50.324
(yawning)

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.292
Okay, so what am I
gonna to tomorrow

00:19:52.326 --> 00:19:54.995
to find this "Make-Out
Tactics" book?

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:56.997
Huh!

00:20:03.504 --> 00:20:06.173
Maybe he's got a
copy somewhere here.

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:08.976
I found it!

00:20:10.177 --> 00:20:12.179
More than one copy, too!

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:15.015
Wow, what an awesome
student you are, dad!

00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:22.823
All right!

00:20:22.856 --> 00:20:24.625
Just what are you doing?

00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:25.626
Oh!

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:26.627
This!

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.029
It's the novel that
Mister Jiraiya wrote!

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.497
D'you know about it, Mom?

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:33.100
I had such a hard
time finding a copy!

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:35.736
We were looking all
over for it today!

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.705
Guess I shoulda' known earlier
that Dad would have it!

00:20:42.042 --> 00:20:43.443
You can't read this.

00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:46.647
Sorry, but you're
still way too young.

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:05.632
[Sarada] Welcome home, Dad!

00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:07.501
Thanks for all your hard work.

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:08.869
I know you're busy.

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:10.470
Are you eating properly?

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:12.172
I understand that you
don't get the chance

00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:13.340
to come home very often,

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:16.009
but Mom was hoping that
we could eat together

00:21:16.043 --> 00:21:17.211
once in a while.

00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:20.214
Oh and Boruto keep
saying ask Mr. Sasuke

00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:23.483
to borrow a copy of "Make-Out
Tactics" from Mr. Kakashi.

00:21:23.517 --> 00:21:24.885
So, could you?

00:21:24.918 --> 00:21:25.886
Thanks!

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:27.120
Love, Sarada

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:30.724
(chuckle)

00:21:35.062 --> 00:21:37.297
I'm sorry about this, Sasuke,

00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:39.399
But I gotta send you out.

00:21:39.433 --> 00:21:40.200
It's all right.

00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:41.568
Did something happen?

00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:44.738
[Naruto] Yeah.

00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:46.473
We received a report
from the guards

00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:48.642
that are stationed
along the border.

00:21:49.643 --> 00:21:51.745
The Otsutsuki is
apparently stealing chakra

00:21:51.778 --> 00:21:53.514
from anyone he can.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.386
I can't sense any Tailed
Beast chakra anymore.

00:22:00.354 --> 00:22:02.456
So, they're being
hidden, are they?

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:07.127
These humans truly
are incredibly crafty!

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:14.034
(ending theme music)

00:23:43.657 --> 00:23:44.958
Why am I the only one

00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:46.827
who's been taken
off of that mission?

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.795
Urashiki has a
vendetta against you

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:50.364
because of your fight before.

00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:53.433
What if Boruto and I
form a two-man team?

00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:54.434
How does that sound?

00:23:54.468 --> 00:23:56.537
Yeah, all right,
permission granted.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.273
However, you're forbidden
from leaving the village.

00:23:59.306 --> 00:24:00.440
Got it?

00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:03.076
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.912
"Urashiki's Target."

00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:06.880
[Urashiki] I'll just
take my sweet time

00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:09.983
stealing the Nine Tail's Chakra.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:14.655
(ending theme music)
