00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.015
[saying goodbye]

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.584
Thank you all for everything!
Goodbye!

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.986
So long, everyone! Be well!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.890
See you later! Take care!
Goodbye!

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.959
Wait! Wait for me!

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.562
I'm coming, I'm coming, don't
leave! Wait!

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:32.265
You're very late, Cho‐Cho. Why
the heck do you have so much
stuff?

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.801
Ohh, I got stuck
in the gift shop.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:38.304
All the food gifts looked
so delicious I just couldn't
decide!

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.978
It's so weird.

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.848
So Kagura never showed up
after all.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.785
Well, he was a big part of the
rebellion. Maybe he's just
ashamed.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:55.121
I hope you were planning on
punching him in the face if he
showed up.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.957
Why would I do that?

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.827
I mean, it's really only thanks
to him that we just had such a
great field trip.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:06.499
Whoa, wait a minute, are
you serious? It's thanks to him
that we almost got killed here!

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.771
Man, what a letdown. I was so
sure he'd come to see us
off.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.682
Boruto.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.590
Hey! It's almost time,
right?

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:12.292
That's right. It's any minute
now.

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.260
Can't wait! I can't wait!

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.529
<i>(Boruto) I'm home!</i>

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.263
Yay! He's back!

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:23.904
Welcome home, big brother! How
did your field trip go? Did you
have fun?

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:28.274
Hi, Hima. Yeah, we had all
kinds of fun times, it was
great!

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.644
Welcome home, Boruto.

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:32.278
Oh hey, hi Mom.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:34.147
Here.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.182
[gasps] Is this for me?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:40.120
It's just my laundry. Hey
I'm super tired, Mom.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.824
I'm gonna sleep till
dinner, all right? [yawn]

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:46.226
[sighs]

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.265
And this guy Kagura got
totally hooked on Shinobi
Bout.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:56.069
<i>(Boruto) I mean, like addicted</i>
<i>to it! It was ridiculous!</i>
<i>[laughing]</i>

00:03:56.102 --> 00:04:00.440
You really have a gift for
making new friends wherever
you go, don't you?

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.176
You think? Yeah, I guess,
kinda.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.310
Thank you for dinner.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.846
What's wrong, Hima?

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:10.684
I get it, hearing me talk about
my field trip makes you wish you
could go on one of your own.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.451
[chewing]

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.319
[sighs]

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.622
What's up with her?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.860
Anyway, there's even more to
the story.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:22.362
This guy Kagura is so good with
a sword, he's the...

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:27.233
(Boruto) successor to one of the
Ninja Blades of the Hidden Mist!
<i>Really, he's that good!</i>

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.269
[students talking]

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.337
Man, I sure hope he's doing
okay.

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.540
Are you talking
about Kagura again?

00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:36.109
I just wanna know he's all
right, that's all.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.811
Oh. I pass.

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:41.915
Whatever the reason for it, he
sure got mixed up with the Seven
Swordsman.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:45.886
Yeah, I really don't think
they're going to let the guy
get off with just a warning.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.522
Wait, so you think Kagura's
been arrested too?

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:51.191
And that's why he couldn't be
there to see us off?

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.559
Oh, come on, like I'd know.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:55.428
<i>(Shino) Boruto! Sarada! Iwabe.</i>

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.664
Come to the principal's office
later.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:58.264
Huh?

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.933
What's it about?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.035
Why does he want me?

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:04.070
You'll find out then.

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:09.643
[sighs] You think they found out
about everything with the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen?

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.079
That's gotta be it, if it's
just us three being called in.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:16.817
But we didn't miss roll call
that day, we made it back just
in time.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.121
Yeah, true. I'm sure all the
Sensei didn't suspect anything.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:26.159
So what do we do? I sure
don't want to be lumped in as
an accomplice with you guys.

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.528
[sighs]

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:32.198
Heh! I got this. You guys
just let me do the talking.

00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:33.433
And then!

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.139
This storm suddenly came
outta nowhere! A huge storm
with lightning and everything!

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.574
I thought it was all over!

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.177
I thought I was going to die,
right there, in the Village
Hidden in the Mist!

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.215
It was then that Miss Sarada
here and Mr. Iwabe right here
luckily showed up!

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.886
Man! I thought I was dreaming
when I saw these guys! Really!

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:57.157
Hmm.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.025
Let me see.

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:03.530
You're saying that you got
lost and these two rescued
you, is that the gist of it?

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:08.334
When I think about it, it's
kind of a miracle we ever made
it back in time for roll call.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.836
Yep, yep.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.206
I see, so you didn't cause any
incidents while you were
there?

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:17.177
More specifically, you're saying
you didn't have a run‐in with
shinobi from the Mist.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.579
Is that right?

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:19.445
Uhh.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.081
Y‐yeah, that's about right.

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:24.618
I'm a proud student of the
Hidden Leaf, and proud of it!

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.621
Why the heck would I wanna go
around causing trouble?

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:28.922
Very well.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:34.227
Then perhaps you can explain the
meaning of this petition that
arrived from Lord Mizukage.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.596
Huh?

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:42.335
"I hereby declare that the
actions taken by Boruto Uzumaki,
Sarada Uchiha and Iwabe Yuino...

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:46.573
<i>(Iruka) were justified, and</i>
benefited both the Lands of Fire
<i>and Water.</i>

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:50.376
<i>Hence, it is my sincere hope</i>
<i>that they are not punished in</i>
<i>any way."</i>

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.945
<i>That's what it says.</i>

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:56.482
[groans] Why did Old Man
Chojuro have to be so honest?

00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:57.884
<i>(Shikadai) You missed a spot!</i>

00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.019
Shut up!

00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:00.921
[laughing]

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:03.657
Move your hands, not your
mouth, Boruto!

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.426
Do it right or you'll have to
start all over again.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.029
You should've just come
clean and apologized...

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:12.132
instead of coming up with
some ridiculous story!

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.468
Yeah, well, how was I supposed
to know he was going to write
them a letter?

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:16.903
No excuses!

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:17.971
[growls]

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:22.342
Hey! Get to work or we'll
still be at it when the sun
goes down!

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.877
[resigned sighs]

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:30.150
(Suigetsu) It turns out that the
one who made it seem like it was
<i>Chojuro killing off the...</i>

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:35.722
<i>officials who were opposed the</i>
<i>peace treaty was actually that</i>
<i>hoodlum named Shizuma.</i>

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.792
I see.

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:43.463
That's why I always said, from
the very beginning, that we
shouldn't use guys like that.

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:49.736
I thought it would make it
easier to move around...

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.441
if there was trouble in the Land
of Water. What a disappointment.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.411
So then, what happened to
them, where are they?

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:02.482
They're in a correctional
facility undergoing
rehabilitation.

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:07.754
<i>(Suigetsu) Still, even if they</i>
<i>were rebels, officials from</i>
<i>his own Land of Water...</i>

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:13.727
were killed to put a lid on
the incident, silence them, and
pretend as if nothing happened.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.797
<i>That Chojuro is a pretty bad</i>
<i>guy.</i>

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.831
[gasps]

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:22.468
<i>(Orochimaru) Do you think he's</i>
<i>keeping silent in order to</i>
<i>protect himself?</i>

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.237
(Suigetsu) What other reason is
<i>there?</i>

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.774
(Orochimaru) If it becomes known
<i>that a coup d'etat was</i>
<i>attempted...</i>

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:31.044
<i>it will set everything back to</i>
<i>the dark ages again.</i>

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:38.919
(Orochimaru) He might have felt
<i>that secrecy was his only</i>
<i>option.</i>

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:42.022
<i>That probably explains his</i>
<i>silence.</i>

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:44.891
Yeah well, one thing we can
be pretty certain of...

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:48.629
Shizuma sure didn't count on
Boruto being in the
neighborhood.

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:53.700
He's just like his father, he
loves to go around poking his
nose into everything.

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:59.372
Still, it's curious how the
child got ahold of incriminating
evidence against Shizuma.

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:03.309
[gasps] Y‐yeah, I know! Strange,
isn't it? [nervous chuckle]

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:05.646
Hmm.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.168
You must be more self‐assured.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.206
[breath in, out]

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:37.210
You will never be able to cut it
in two if you doubt yourself.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:43.817
I was weak‐willed and caused
trouble for Boruto. I can't
forgive myself.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:49.455
But he will forgive you, if
you face him honestly about
it. That is the way he is.

00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:52.392
Yes, I‐ I know that.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:57.831
Being upfront and honest,
that can sometimes be a very
difficult thing to do.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.332
Hm.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.204
I'm home!

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.742
Juicy juicy juice.

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:10.076
Hm?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.612
[sighs]

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:15.616
What is it, Hima? Something
on your mind? [gulps]

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:17.050
It's nothing.

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:17.718
Hmm?

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.294
Hey, uh, did something happen,
Mom?

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:32.899
Himawari's been acting weird
toward me ever since I got
back from my trip. [gulps]

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:37.838
I'd hoped that you would
eventually figure it out on
your own.

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:38.739
Hm?

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:42.643
Don't you remember? You
promised to bring back a
souvenir for Himawari.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:45.311
[realization grunt]

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:48.682
Don't worry, I'll bring back
lots of souvenirs for you.

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:51.217
You have to promise, okay?

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:53.587
Oh, no! I totally forgot!

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.457
Himawari's been waiting
patiently for you at least to
say something.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.694
Man, why didn't you tell me
sooner, Mom? It's already been
awhile!

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:04.665
If you forgot to get her
something, you'll just have to
tell her and apologize.

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:09.235
[nervous laugh] Yeah, and
she might try to kill me with
her Byakugan again.

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:10.671
She might.

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.639
I'm going out for a bit!

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:13.373
[chuckles]

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:21.615
<i>(Boruto) Hey, uh, Hima, uh...</i>

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:24.618
Listen, about that
souvenir I promised you.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.252
[sighs]

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.689
You see...

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.691
[whimpers]

00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:35.461
Well, I know you like super
delicious snacks, so that's
what I brought you!

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:39.833
<i>(Boruto) You've heard of the</i>
<i>Hidden Mist's famous Water</i>
<i>Cinnamon Sweets, right?</i>

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:41.802
Oh, yeah!

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.639
But here's the thing, they got
mixed up somehow in my
friend's luggage.

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:48.809
So I'm gonna go get them,
'kay? So just hang on!

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:51.377
[delighted gasp]

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:52.913
[panting]

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:54.515
So how'd she take it?

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:58.719
The way she looked at me, I
couldn't bring myself to tell
her.

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:01.187
Honesty's the best policy,
don't you think?

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.155
Yeah.

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:05.592
You want me to ask Dad for
you?

00:12:05.626 --> 00:12:06.760
[grunt]

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:08.461
Maybe he'll be able to
figure something out.

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.430
No way, absolutely not!

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:15.936
Don't worry. I swear, I'm going
to find her that souvenir! Not a
word of this to Dad, okay?

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:32.853
This trying to be a good and
thoughtful big brother is hard
work!

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:38.258
I wonder what that idiot did
this time.

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:43.697
Water Cinnamon Sweets? I ate
all of mine days ago.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.066
How long did you think I was
gonna keep them?

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.835
Okay, never mind.
Thanks anyway.

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:57.343
Sorry but I ate all of mine. I
still have some dumplings left
though.

00:12:57.377 --> 00:13:00.681
Thanks, but nothing else will
do. It's okay, forget it.

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:01.281
Uh!

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:04.017
They tasted perfectly
exquisite!

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.887
Okay, that's not exactly what
I was asking you about.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.222
Well I could draw you a
picture of them.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.825
Yeah, a picture's not gonna do
any good.

00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:13.927
[laughs] Didn't think so.

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:19.365
[gasps] Cho‐Cho! You have any
Water Cinnamon Swee...

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.767
No way she'd have any left.

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:25.739
Huh? Wait what did you ask? Do I
have any what?

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:27.473
Any Water Cinnamon Sweets?

00:13:27.508 --> 00:13:28.474
No?

00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:30.210
Water Cinnamon Sweets?

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:30.911
None?

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:32.212
Not even one?

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:32.879
No?

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:36.049
<i>(Boruto) C'mon, someone say</i>
<i>you've got some!</i>

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:42.589
[street chatter]

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:46.392
Boruto? Did something
happen? Why are you
sleeping here?

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:51.765
M‐Mitsuki. You don't have
any Water Cinnamon Sweets on
you do you?

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:52.566
<i>(Mitsuki) No.</i>

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:53.466
'Course not.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.400
Why do you ask?

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:58.639
I forgot to get them for
Himawari as a souvenir.

00:13:58.672 --> 00:13:59.773
Souvenir?

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.175
You need them badly?

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:05.612
I couldn't bring myself to
tell her I forgot.

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:08.348
<i>(Sarada) I figured it was</i>
<i>something like that.</i>

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:08.882
Hm?

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.118
I heard you were out looking
around for Water Cinnamon
Sweets.

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:15.321
Wha‐? [gasp] Are you
saying you have some?

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.156
No.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.857
[sighs]

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.761
But I might know a place that
may or may not sell them.

00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:22.262
Which place? Where?

00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:25.566
Sarada, if you really know,
then please tell him.

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:31.538
All right. On one condition,
you're not to go snooping into
how I know about this shop.

00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:32.773
That's a deal‐breaker.

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:34.741
I won't, I promise! I'd never
do that!

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:36.309
Like I believe you!

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.210
[gasps]

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:38.545
Well, whatever.

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:41.848
Okay. If you go to the very
end of the alley off of 3rd
Street...

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:44.150
there's a sketchy‐looking
grocery shop.

00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:46.620
They carry food from lots of
different villages...

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:49.389
so there's a pretty good chance
they'd have what you're looking
for.

00:14:49.422 --> 00:14:52.158
The end of the alley, huh?
Right! Thanks, Sarada!

00:14:52.192 --> 00:14:57.297
But even if they have it, they
might not be willing to sell
it to you! Just so you know!

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:02.603
Mitsuki! You're coming with
me?

00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:03.937
Why, of course I am.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.471
Okay, then!

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:13.379
Okay, a sketchy‐looking shop,
a sketchy... Hey, look!

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.648
<i>(Boruto) Is that it?</i>

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:24.024
They really do sell things
from all over, don't they?

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:27.961
Oh, look Boruto. What
strangely colored mushrooms.

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:35.001
Ah, I don't think I was
supposed to touch them.

00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:39.673
Interesting place, isn't it
Boruto? [gasps]

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:45.478
[mesmerized/ecstatic sighs]

00:15:45.512 --> 00:15:48.815
It couldn't be an illusion,
could it?

00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:52.252
This is the real thing right?
Huh?

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:55.756
That's the souvenir you've
been looking for?

00:15:55.789 --> 00:16:00.927
<i>(Boruto) The great delicacy of</i>
the Hidden Mist, Water Cinnamon
<i>Sweets! Ow!</i>

00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:03.396
Who said that you could
touch the merchandise?

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:05.766
Huh?

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.668
So that's what all the racket
was.

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:11.271
A couple of brats wandered in
and thought they'd start poking
around.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:14.875
Listen, Granny, I wanna buy
these Water Cinnamon Sweets!

00:16:14.908 --> 00:16:16.777
They're just what I've
been looking for. Ow!

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.347
Don't touch them with
your filthy hands! I run a
classy and elegant shop.

00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:25.218
It's just a box of sweets! Why
are you being so difficult,
anyway?

00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:27.554
Just sell 'em to me, it's an
emergency!

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:32.125
You're quite assertive, aren't
you? All right then, let me
ask you this.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:35.796
Just what kind of emergency
is it exactly? Eh?

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.163
Well, it's just that...

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.233
My little sister.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.603
Eh? Speak up,
I can't hear you.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:45.739
Look. who cares? It doesn't
matter what the reason is!

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:47.040
Oh, yeah?

00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:52.813
Get! Go on, get out of here! I
don't have time to bother with
you! Out! Out of my shop!

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:57.050
[gasps] Is this your friend?
Just what do you think you're
doing?

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:58.952
You let go of me! [grunts]

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:01.021
What now, Boruto? Wanna go?

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.956
What the! Mitsuki! Stop!

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:08.762
Let me go right now! I never
sell anything to customers I
don't like! Not even trash!

00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:13.033
Hmm, Shinobi Bout?

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:16.002
Eh? You play
that game, too?

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.804
Well, what if I do?

00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:19.740
Aha, very interesting.

00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:25.478
All right, if you can beat me at
this game, I'll sell you those
Water Cinnamon Sweets.

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:26.780
Yeah? Really?

00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:30.083
But if you lose then you get out
of my shop immediately!

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:32.753
Okay! You got yourself a
deal, Granny!

00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:38.158
Stop calling me Granny, you
little squirt! Call me the
Ruthless Shinobi Bout Queen!

00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:39.726
That thing's filthy.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:46.432
Hmm.

00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:51.037
I think this one, yes. No, this
one.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.607
Can we like, hurry it up,
Granny?

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.777
Huh you little brat, don't
be so sure of yourself.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.846
You'll be bawling your eyes out
when I'm done with you.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.183
Ruthless Shinobi
Bout Queen, my foot.

00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:06.286
Hey, Boruto. Take a look.

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:06.553
Hm?

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:08.154
Hmm.

00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:11.925
[gasps]

00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.160
This game is yours to win.

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.329
Hmm.

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:25.071
[sighs]

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:28.474
Damn it! What is going on
with my hand?

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:30.010
Huh?

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.812
I'm out, Granny.

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:33.680
Hm.

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:35.081
Are you just giving up?

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.317
I can see all of your cards!

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.987
What do you mean? Where?
Hm?

00:18:41.021 --> 00:18:44.190
Hmm.

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:55.802
Hmph! What a dumb little brat.
If you hadn't said anything,
you could've won!

00:18:55.836 --> 00:18:59.673
Yeah whatever! Now just
re‐shuffle the cards and deal
out a new hand!

00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:01.074
[annoyed grunt]

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:03.276
[grunts]

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.680
[sighs] Never mind this is
boring.

00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:10.651
But, wait! What do you mean? The
game's not over, where you
going?

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:12.753
Hm?

00:19:12.786 --> 00:19:15.889
Ow! What're doing Granny
what's wrong with you?

00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:21.061
[grunts] Wait a sec. Don't
forget, you're the one who
suggested we play this ga‐‐

00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:22.896
<i>(Madame) Here! Take it.</i>

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:24.698
Huh?

00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:30.537
Go on, take it and get going.
It's an emergency, isn't it?
[chuckles]

00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:33.740
[groans] Now I'm in a
rotten mood.

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:36.342
Hm?

00:19:39.813 --> 00:19:43.149
<i>(Mitsuki) Now Himawari will be</i>
<i>happy, huh?</i>

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:44.851
<i>(Boruto) Yeah, I guess.</i>

00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:50.524
How weird.

00:19:52.092 --> 00:19:55.261
You finally got the thing you
wanted, and yet you don't seem
very happy about it.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.199
<i>(Tayori) Hey! Boruto!</i>

00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:00.701
Look who it is.

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:03.169
Mr. Tayori!

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:06.472
Long time no see. I'm
glad I ran into you.

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:09.643
Here you go. A letter
with your name on it.

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:10.611
For me?

00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:12.212
<i>(Tayori) It's from</i>
<i>the Land of Water.</i>

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.147
[gasps] It's from Kagura!

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.716
That's great, Boruto.

00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:18.118
<i>(Boruto) Hey, thanks a lot Mr.</i>
<i>Tayori!</i>

00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:19.485
[chuckles]

00:20:21.487 --> 00:20:26.727
<i>(Kagura) "Dear Boruto, I'm so</i>
sorry I wasn't there to see you
<i>off. After you risked...</i>

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.398
<i>your life to bring me back, I</i>
<i>used our circumstances as an</i>
<i>excuse and criticized you.</i>

00:20:32.432 --> 00:20:36.970
<i>I blamed everything on my</i>
<i>environment and ran away from</i>
<i>the truth.</i>

00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:42.442
After I thought about it, I just
<i>couldn't face you. I'm really</i>
<i>sorry.</i>

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:46.079
<i>But I'm determined to overcome</i>
<i>my weaknesses...</i>

00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:50.016
<i>and become a shinobi who's</i>
<i>worthy of wielding the</i>
<i>Hiramekarei.</i>

00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:54.420
<i>When that time comes, I'll</i>
<i>come visit you!</i>

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.791
<i>You've taught me so many</i>
<i>things.</i>

00:20:57.824 --> 00:21:02.295
I want to be true to myself and
<i>live honestly, just like you!"</i>

00:21:05.165 --> 00:21:07.500
He's making too big
a deal out of it.

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:11.304
He says here he wants to play
you in Shinobi Bout again
someday.

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.679
Man, that guy is too much.

00:21:18.712 --> 00:21:24.551
Instead of sending a rambling
letter like that, a simple
"sorry" would've been fine.

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:27.353
Boruto?

00:21:29.656 --> 00:21:32.726
Hey Mitsuki, thanks for today,
ya know?

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:36.096
I've decided I'm gonna come
clean to Himawari.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.533
Why would you do that? She won't
know if you don't tell her.

00:21:39.566 --> 00:21:43.704
Yeah. But I guess maybe I'm
"too much" as well.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.442
Welcome home, big brother!

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:52.312
Hey. Here are those
sweets I told you about.

00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:55.381
[delighted scream] Thank
you, big brother!

00:21:55.415 --> 00:22:01.387
[grunts] You're welcome. But
actually, Himawari, I really
owe you an apology.

00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:04.925
You do? Why? Did you do
something wrong?

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:07.861
Yeah, you see, um.

00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:11.698
You really are quite a mystery,
aren't you?

00:23:47.393 --> 00:23:49.429
<i>(Sai) Inojin, what are you</i>
<i>doing?</i>

00:23:49.462 --> 00:23:52.365
<i>(Inojin) It's tiresome drawing</i>
<i>something in the midst of</i>
<i>battle...</i>

00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:55.669
<i>so I thought it'd be more</i>
<i>efficient if I drew stuff in</i>
<i>advance.</i>

00:23:55.702 --> 00:23:57.037
<i>(Sai) Are you sure you...</i>

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.172
(Inojin) I'll try it in
Ino‐Shika‐Cho training tomorrow.

00:23:59.205 --> 00:24:04.244
<i>(Sai) If he keeps this up he</i>
might not be able to use justsu
<i>anymore.</i>

00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:08.381
<i>(Inojin) What? I can't perform</i>
<i>the Super Beast Scroll?</i>

00:24:08.414 --> 00:24:14.555
<i>Next time on Boruto Naruto</i>
<i>Next Generations: The Super</i>
<i>Beast Scroll Slump!</i>
