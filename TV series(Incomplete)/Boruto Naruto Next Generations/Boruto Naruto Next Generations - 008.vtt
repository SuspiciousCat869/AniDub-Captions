You guys only know about

So is Lord Hokage totally cool

Huh?

00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:10.907
I mean, he was a hero during
the Great Ninja War, right?

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.777
So he must be really cool and
together when he's at home.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.379
Nope. My Dad isn't
anything close to that.

You can just... leave
all that there. Argh!

Lord Hokage...?!

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.241
Isn't that always the way?

00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:48.712
It just doesn't usually
work out that the
hero's cool in real life.

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:52.415

right in front of us like
the movies, it'd be easy.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.697
[sigh] Well, I guess we'll just
have to hang in there...

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:10.934
Until we know what's really
going on, we should stay quiet.

00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:14.638
And besides, you're the only
one who can see that shadow.

00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:17.541
Seems like the problem
is spreading.

00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:20.710
Yeah. It's starting to happen
outside the Academy now.

00:06:20.744 --> 00:06:24.147
You think it's okay that we're
looking into it by ourselves?

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.985
Who knows? But if you're worried
about it, talk to Lord Hokage.

00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:31.454
[groan]

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.528
I can't, ya know! I just don't
wanna depend on Dad and his
friends!

00:06:38.562 --> 00:06:43.767
All right, fine. But do you
have any idea how to find out
what or where that shadow is?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.234
[gasp]

00:06:45.268 --> 00:06:48.171
I'm happy to help you,
but we've gotta figure
out what we need to do.

00:06:48.204 --> 00:06:50.874
See ya!

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:09.192
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:15.665
I say that four heads
are better than one!

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.868
Now, let's try to figure out
just what's been going on.

00:07:18.902 --> 00:07:21.204
<i>First, there was</i>
<i>that incident with Denki.</i>

00:07:21.237 --> 00:07:26.643
<i>It was the morning of the</i>
<i>entrance ceremony, and I saw</i>
<i>that shadow around him, so I</i>
<i>followed him.</i>

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:32.481
And then... The train went out
<i>of control. That was a really</i>
<i>close call!</i>

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:35.785
(Clone)
<i>You're way too rough on us</i>
<i>clones, you know that?!</i>

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:38.121
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>I couldn't help it! There</i>
<i>wasn't any other way!</i>

00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:39.989
[grunts]

00:07:40.023 --> 00:07:43.727
Didn't Denki's shadow disappear
after you guys talked?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.763
That's what happened,
all right...

00:07:46.796 --> 00:07:49.065
But with Metal, you
had to knock him out.

00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:52.401
And it was the same with that
delinquent and the repairman!

00:07:52.435 --> 00:07:56.372
But with that guy Magire, it was
just the same as what happened
with Denki.

00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:59.175
Does that mean those guys were
different from Metal somehow?

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:04.748
Doubt it. They started acting
weird after the shadow
possessed them, too.

00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:10.119
But with metal and the others,
knocking them out or some kind
of impact is what worked.

00:08:10.153 --> 00:08:15.391
But all of them acted weird
and violent, like the shadow
affected their emotions.

00:08:15.424 --> 00:08:18.828
[groaning]

00:08:18.862 --> 00:08:25.001
Plus, judging by how even Shino
<i>Sensei became possessed, it</i>
<i>doesn't seem to matter if</i>
<i>someone is skilled or not.</i>

00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:27.571
<i>I'm just glad Mitsuki was</i>
<i>around when that happened!</i>

00:08:27.604 --> 00:08:31.174
Do you think that shadow
could be chakra?

00:08:31.207 --> 00:08:35.579
I dunno. But for a moment, you
saw something that looked like
a monster, right?

00:08:35.612 --> 00:08:40.950
Yeah, I thought I did. And
chakra doesn't actually do
stuff like that.

00:08:40.984 --> 00:08:45.488
But the fact is that after the
shadow disappears, so does the
chakra.

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:48.257
[groan]

00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:50.393
Hmm.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:53.096
So, how come I'm the only
one who can see it, then?!

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:55.599
Uh...

00:08:55.632 --> 00:08:56.666
A hallucination?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.568
Why would I be
hallucinating, ya know?!

00:08:58.602 --> 00:09:00.403
Calm down there's
no proof of that!

00:09:00.436 --> 00:09:04.941
Yeah, I know, you saw
it clearly, so it
must've been real.

00:09:04.974 --> 00:09:09.478
Aw man, this is so
confusing! We can't
solve this by ourselves!

00:09:09.513 --> 00:09:12.181
Maybe we should talk to Dad?

00:09:12.215 --> 00:09:15.484
What, at this point?
That's so uncool!

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:17.320
Well, "at this point"
is where we are...

00:09:17.353 --> 00:09:21.390
I don't want to just leave this
to Dad and all the Sensei.

00:09:21.424 --> 00:09:23.627
This is about Denki
and the others.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.129
I can't forgive anybody
who would do that to them.

00:09:26.162 --> 00:09:28.064
Yeah, that's true.

00:09:28.097 --> 00:09:31.635
But if I tell Dad about all
this, he'll just say that we're
kids and tell us to stay out of
it.

00:09:31.668 --> 00:09:34.504
And I don't want that!

00:09:34.538 --> 00:09:40.309
I wanna make whoever did this to
my friends pay! And I wanna do
it with my own hands!

00:09:40.343 --> 00:09:43.379
Yeah! That's for sure!

00:09:43.412 --> 00:09:47.551
That's all the more reason why
we have to find out why we're
the only ones who can see it.

00:09:47.584 --> 00:09:51.020
[groan]

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.825

Uh!

Your mom's like a princess
from the Hyuga Clan, right?

00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:16.746
So maybe you just
awakened that "thing..."

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:21.417

strongest in the Leaf.

the eye that sees through all.

00:10:31.728 --> 00:10:33.597
How long have you been there?!

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.467
For this whole time. Judging by
your look, I guess you suspected
that.

00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:40.336
Uh, yeah, I guess
I did...

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:44.007
Why not talk to her? Go and ask
your mom about the Byakugan.

00:10:55.952 --> 00:10:56.586
[groan]

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.287

Yeah, kinda.

00:10:59.723 --> 00:11:02.458
But you seem like
you're at a loss.

00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:07.631
Ultimately, I don't think this
will go anywhere until you learn
more about the Byakugan.

00:11:07.664 --> 00:11:11.735
[sigh] [chew]

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:16.840
Yeah, I guess that
I'll have to ask...

00:11:19.543 --> 00:11:25.949
Except... If this eye isn't the
Byakugan and I'm wrong about it.

00:11:25.982 --> 00:11:31.721
So is this eye actually
the Byakugan?

00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:36.092
Does it really possess
that kind of power?

00:11:39.896 --> 00:11:44.000

00:13:39.749 --> 00:13:47.724
No one can escape my Byakugan,
the eye that unravels lies! You
know?

00:13:47.757 --> 00:13:49.225
[gasp]

00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:56.065
So that's it. And we're
investigating the places Shino
visited and the people he came

00:13:56.099 --> 00:13:59.268
into contact with before
he started acting strangely.

00:13:59.302 --> 00:14:01.004
Hm...

00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:06.676
Anyway, there are other cases,
too, involving people acting
strange near the Academy.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:11.247
There were signs that something
unnatural had transpired with
their chakra.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.084
And all of this occurred
with Boruto nearby?

00:14:15.118 --> 00:14:17.921
As far as we can determine.

00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:19.355
Who do you think the
target could be?

00:14:19.388 --> 00:14:22.458
Who knows? We can't say it's
just coincidence

00:14:22.491 --> 00:14:25.428
but also don't know of a motive
for targeting Boruto.

00:14:25.461 --> 00:14:29.899
Hm. So you don't think that
this is about going after
the Hokage's son, then?

00:14:29.933 --> 00:14:32.969
That would be a
roundabout way to do it.

00:14:33.002 --> 00:14:36.239
Besides, he was just
being nosy each time.

00:14:36.272 --> 00:14:40.910
Yeah, that sounds exactly like
something that he'd do.

00:14:40.944 --> 00:14:43.379
Anyway, I'll warn him.

00:14:43.412 --> 00:14:48.251
Listen, don't let it become a
drag. Just go easy on the kid.

00:14:48.284 --> 00:14:49.919
Yeah, all right. I'll do that.

00:14:49.953 --> 00:14:53.456
Anyway, let's just keep going‐

00:14:53.489 --> 00:14:56.793
[groan]

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:58.895
Hey, are you okay?

00:14:58.928 --> 00:15:00.664
Yeah, sorry.

00:15:00.697 --> 00:15:04.901
You've been working too hard. Go
home and get some rest before it
becomes a drag.

00:15:04.934 --> 00:15:08.538
[sigh]

00:15:09.973 --> 00:15:11.741
I'm home.

00:15:11.775 --> 00:15:17.213
Hey! Welcome back. Oh,
Shikamaru, thanks for
walking him home.

00:15:17.246 --> 00:15:21.618
No problem! I'm going now.
You let your husband rest up.

00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:22.952
Thanks for looking out for him.

00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.789
(Boruto)
[excited yell]

00:15:25.822 --> 00:15:27.991
Hm? What's that?

00:15:28.024 --> 00:15:31.427
Boruto's been... acting
kinda strange.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.365
[footsteps]

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.635
Huh?

00:15:38.668 --> 00:15:42.305
I'm brighter than the light
descending from the sky!

00:15:42.338 --> 00:15:44.340
Darkness more
dazzling than light.

00:15:44.373 --> 00:15:47.844
I will envelop the world in
darkness.

00:15:47.877 --> 00:15:50.647
that's nearly lethal and
intoxicating.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.553
Infinitely ingenious and
elegant, too that is my truth.

00:15:56.586 --> 00:16:00.323
Please forgive me, Goddess
of Destiny.

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:03.760
Daddy...!

00:16:03.793 --> 00:16:06.329
He's acting really weird...

00:16:06.362 --> 00:16:08.798
Yeah, it sure seems that way.

00:16:08.832 --> 00:16:12.802
Now it's time...
...for genesis!

00:16:12.836 --> 00:16:14.203
Huh?

00:16:14.237 --> 00:16:18.575
Heh heh! Dad! Guess what? I
awakened an awesome power!

00:16:18.608 --> 00:16:22.111
"Awakened an awesome power?"
What do you mean by that?

00:16:22.145 --> 00:16:29.886
[gasp] Wait a minute, Boruto!
You didn't steal the Scroll of
Sealing or something like that,
right?

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:30.954
[gasps]

00:16:30.987 --> 00:16:33.557
Scroll of what? What's that?

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.693
It's a scroll that contains
Forbidden Ninjutsu.

00:16:36.726 --> 00:16:41.197
And naturally, since they're
forbidden, all of them are
very dangerous jutsu.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.869
Never heard of it before.
What's it got to do with me?

00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:50.306
Well, you see, a long time ago
there was someone who wanted
power fast

00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:52.008
and so he stole the
Scroll of Sealing.

00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:54.177
What?! That's horrible!

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.913
Look, don't lump me
with a guy like that!

00:16:56.946 --> 00:16:59.248
Uh, yeah, you're right.

00:16:59.282 --> 00:17:01.918
That guy was absolutely
inexcusable!

00:17:01.951 --> 00:17:05.789
(Naruto)
S‐Sorry. Forget what I
said just now, okay?
[giggling]

00:17:05.822 --> 00:17:10.226
Anyway, you said you'd awakened
this "awesome power." So, what
is it?

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:13.096
It's the Byakugan.

00:17:13.129 --> 00:17:19.168
What!? Ordinarily, the Byakugan
requires intense training before
one can manifest it.

00:17:19.202 --> 00:17:21.771
Oh. Is that really true?

00:17:21.805 --> 00:17:25.575
Well, then, I guess that...
I must really be a genius!

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:32.048
Could it...?

00:17:32.081 --> 00:17:34.851
What is it, Dad? What's wrong?

00:17:34.884 --> 00:17:40.690
Like Shikamaru just told you,
you need a lot of training
before you can use the Byakugan.

00:17:40.724 --> 00:17:44.060
And to be honest, there's
something that I know better
than anyone else...

00:17:44.093 --> 00:17:47.263
you haven't gone through
that kind of training.

00:17:47.296 --> 00:17:49.833
What's that mean?

00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:52.836
Are you trying to say that I'm
just lying about this?

00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:57.907
No, I'm not. There are cases
like Himawari who've awakened
it out of the blue.

00:17:57.941 --> 00:18:01.778
So we can't simply write off
what you're saying. But, then
again...

00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:05.815
I see... So in other words, you
just don't trust me, is that it?

00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:09.619
At the very least, there
has to be some proof.

00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:11.655
But I can see it!

00:18:11.688 --> 00:18:17.393
...Boruto... Please, Boruto...
It's pointless to argue about
this here.

00:18:17.426 --> 00:18:22.098
You have to go and talk
to your grandfather.
I'll contact him.

00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:27.403
I'm sure your grandfather will
be able to tell if it's really
the Byakugan or not.

00:18:29.673 --> 00:18:32.776
I'll go to see Grandpa or
anyone else, anywhere!

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:35.144
[slurp]

00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:38.915
I bet... that he's probably
talking to him right about
now...

00:18:38.948 --> 00:18:43.086
Anyway, I'm gonna go and
talk to my Grandpa about it.

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:45.054
You just sit tight and
wait for the good news!

00:18:45.088 --> 00:18:50.359
I'll get proof that my
Byakugan's real, and I'll make
my dad eat his words.

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:51.728
Hm!

00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:55.231
With the Byakugan, you can see
the flow of chakra, can't you?

00:18:55.264 --> 00:19:00.103
Yeah. I've heard that in
battle, you can also tell how
your opponent's gonna move

00:19:00.136 --> 00:19:02.506
and you can even
see through walls.

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:05.942
It'll be amazing if
it's really the Byakugan.

00:19:05.975 --> 00:19:09.278
[freaked out] Will you quit
doing that, already?

00:19:17.721 --> 00:19:22.291
Aw, man. I really can't deal
with this place.

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:28.431
What is it that you
can't deal with?

00:19:28.464 --> 00:19:31.234
[groan]

00:19:35.772 --> 00:19:39.643
Come here, you! I'm
so glad you, Boruto!

00:19:39.676 --> 00:19:41.410
Grandpa! Grandpa!

00:19:42.311 --> 00:19:47.450
Come give me a hug, Himawari!

00:19:47.483 --> 00:19:50.186
I'm so happy to see you!

00:19:50.219 --> 00:19:52.155
Uh, Grandpa, come on!

00:19:52.188 --> 00:19:55.324
I'm so glad you're here.

00:19:56.192 --> 00:19:57.927
Father.

00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:59.729
[sigh]

00:19:59.763 --> 00:20:04.067
It sure has been a
while, Father...Hanabi.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.438
You just saw what Father's like.
There's no need to stand on
formalities, Lord Hokage.

00:20:09.472 --> 00:20:15.979
Hey, there, you two!
It's me! Your big sis!

00:20:16.012 --> 00:20:18.748
[chuckle]

00:20:18.782 --> 00:20:23.319
Kenkenpa kenpa kenpa!

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:34.864
I'm glad that you came to me.

00:20:34.898 --> 00:20:37.701
This is about the
Byakugan, isn't it?

00:20:37.734 --> 00:20:43.072
Grandpa, I think... I've been
able to awaken my Byakugan,
ya know!

00:20:43.106 --> 00:20:50.046
First, let me explain something.
The Byakugan's a Kekkei Genkai,
passed through the Hyuga Clan.

00:20:50.079 --> 00:20:56.485
As I'm sure you know, it's one
of the special ninjutsu that
only those with Hyuga blood are
able to inherit.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.124
However, not every member of the
Hyuga Clan can awaken it.

00:21:01.157 --> 00:21:05.194
And even then, not everyone who
awakens it is able to master it.

00:21:05.228 --> 00:21:08.364
The Byakugan is a shinobi jutsu.

00:21:08.397 --> 00:21:15.471
Ordinarily, one cannot awaken it
without undergoing intense
training... and a lot of
practice.

00:21:17.073 --> 00:21:20.476
you need a lot of training
before you can use the Byakugan.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.781
And to be honest, there's
something that I know better
than anyone else...

00:21:24.814 --> 00:21:27.016
you haven't gone through
that kind of training.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:33.089
When you use your Byakugan,
you'll become aware of this.

00:21:33.122 --> 00:21:35.191
It will become completely
apparent. Not only to you...

00:21:35.224 --> 00:21:40.129
But also to those around you.

00:21:40.163 --> 00:21:41.164
[gasp]

00:21:41.197 --> 00:21:44.968
<i>However....</i>

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:54.077
Now, in this situation, I can't
tell if you truly have the power
of the Byakugan or not.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:22:00.016
Therefore, let's test it.

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:01.951
Come on outside.

00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:03.887
[gasp]

00:22:07.824 --> 00:22:14.497
I shall personally be
