No way! I can't lose here!

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.614
That's right!

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:17.584
I gotta pass the Chunin Exams to
keep walking down the path to
becoming the Hokage!

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.319

What...?!

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.333

no water nearby?! Ah!

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.288
Yes! We're okay!

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.161
Boruto! Are you alright?! [gasp]

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.302
Mmm...

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.306
[chuckle] You seriously asking
me that?

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:14.975
Yeah! Alright...

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.746
this means Lord Seventh will
finally get to see how strong we
are in Round Three!

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.715
Oh... Yeah!

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.150
You're right!

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.789
He got through again.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.458
It seems he used it this time
around.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:36.630
Oh! Great! So, he finally used
it... Did you get any footage?

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:37.397
(SUBORDINATE B) <i>Yes.</i>

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:38.665

Fifth, I think...

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.758
I couldn't even eat my breakfast
this morning!

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.627
Yeah, I know what you mean!

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.262
But you're eating right now!

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.565
(CHO-CHO) [gasp] Now way! I
didn't even know I was eating!

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:29.316
Hm!

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:34.421
Alright! From this point
on, everyone's an enemy!

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.222
Hm!

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:36.757
Seems so!

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:40.928
I wanna fight you guys, so don't
lose too fast, okay?

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:42.296
That goes without saying!
[chewing]

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:47.067
I have a feeling that we aren't
going to be defeating anyone all
that easily...

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.603
Come on, let's show them the
Leaf's true strength!

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.471
'Cuz the winner's gonna be-

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:52.639

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.805
Round Three consists of
individual matches!

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:06.673
They will be held
tournament-style.

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:10.744
We purposly did not pit
teammates against one another in
the first bracket...

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:14.581
But if you win, you may end up
<i>facing each other later.</i>

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:29.062

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.283
Huh?! Smoked wholesale?

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.751
It means you're gonna lose!

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.990
Then just say that! You don't
have to beat around the bush so
much!

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:32.793
Maybe I'll stop beating around
the bush right now.

Looks like that might not
happen...

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.659
I'm not interested in
fighting anyone weak.

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:09.696
But be careful of the other two.
They look tough, especially
Mitsuki.

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.799
[chuckle] I don't need your
advice.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:17.738
When I get in there, I'm gonna
crush whoever I'm up against,
even that Mitsuki guy.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:22.176

these Exams... is really quite
sad.

Damn it! That gum's getting in
the way!

Oh, so that's the gum I've heard
about that uses chakra as a
catalyst, is that right?

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.047
Yeah, it is pretty interesting,
isn't it?

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.983

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:08.589

00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:57.437

It's Yurui. [pained groan]

Boruto Uzumaki!

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:16.657
Yeah! He won! He won!

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.026
Nicely done. That kid's good.

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:27.701
Damn it, that makes me so angry!

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:31.772
Who would've ever guessed that
both our teams would be
eliminated before the finals?

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:32.639
But of course...

00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:36.944
the secret weapon that we were
hoping to enter in the
competition was already...

00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:41.281
promoted to Chunin before this
joint exam even began! So I
suppose it just can't be helped.

00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:45.485
You think they would've won, if
they came? Such doting "parents"
are annoying, Mizukage!

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.021
Yes, well, I shall take that to
heart...

00:09:50.524 --> 00:09:51.425
(SHIKADAI) <i>Not bad.</i>

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:52.025
Uh...

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.295
So when exactly did you practice
that little move?

00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:58.031
Oh, you know... It was a piece
of cake!

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.571

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.608
This brings back memories of
our Chunin Exams, doesn't it?

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:12.546
You know, come to think of it,
that was the first time we met
you, Temari.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.816
Oh, yeah, that's right! You had
such a bad attitude then.

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:17.918
I don't recall.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.586
Actually... you still kinda have
a bad attitude!

Listen up, Shikadai! If you
lose, then it's game over!

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.268
Give it all you've got!

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.135

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.972
Alright, Shikadai, come on;
don't turn this into a bad
match...

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:41.675
Well... Anyway, go easy on me,
would ya?

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.483

Stand ready! Don't act like I'm
ranked lower than you!

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:07.301
Damn it. What a bad attitude...

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.636
Fine. It's a drag, but I'll
attack first.

No, Shikadai... Don't waste your

[pained groans]

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:26.673
Those are high frequencies, huh?
If they hit me again, I'm done
for...

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:28.509
[chuckle]

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:33.113
But no matter what, I can't
afford to lose this early in the
game!

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:37.184
[gasp]

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:38.018
[grunt]

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.323
[grunt] So close!

00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:46.527
<i>Her reaction was slightly</i>
<i>delayed just now. But why?!</i>

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:51.131
Huh? [straining]

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:56.036
Chewed up gum... Ugh, how gross!

00:13:56.637 --> 00:13:57.671
Damn it...

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.042
<i>Ugh, that guy...!</i>

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:03.177
[gasp]

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:05.445
I get it!

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:11.485
It's sound. Isn't it?

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:15.522
At first, I thought that you had
exceptionally sharp eyes.

00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:20.394
But even in that smoke bomb...
<i>and with that feint... You</i>
<i>countered easily.</i>

00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:24.631
Which means, you weren't
actually relying on your eyes
after all.

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:29.937
When you took your hood off, I
noticed that your earbuds were
gone, so it crossed my mind...

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.637
...but honestly...

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:34.975
who would've ever imagined that
you could hear the slight sound
of me merely shifting my weight

00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:37.010
as I turned to control my
shadow?

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:40.814
<i>That expalins why your</i>
<i>reaction was slightly delayed</i>
<i>earlier.</i>

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:42.683
<i>It's cause I stepped on that</i>
<i>gum.</i>

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.553
Your hearing is really
frighteningly good.

00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:49.656
I suppose that I should commend
you for noticing that...

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.593
But shifting your weight is a
subconscious habit...

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:56.496
So realizing what's happening
doesn't mean that you can
actually control it.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.667
You use earbuds to keep your
oversensitive ears in check,
don't you?

00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:01.502
You nervous?

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:02.669
Huh?

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:06.773
Your heart has started beating
faster, your breathing is
shallow...

00:15:06.807 --> 00:15:08.842
It's so painfully
obvious!

00:15:08.876 --> 00:15:10.744
Yeah, so what if all that's
true?

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:14.047
No, don't let her manipulate
you!

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:17.050
Too slow!

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:20.988
[gasp and straining]

00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:25.526
Ahhh!

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:26.960
Uhhh...

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:28.061
Shikadai...

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:32.966
Here I thought that since you're
Lady Temari's son, you'd have at
least a little skill.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.269
But I guess the Hidden Sand is
the best-

00:15:35.302 --> 00:15:37.571
(SHIKADAI) <i>When you say stuff</i>
<i>like that...</i>

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:41.508
...you're disrespecting my mom,
who's now a citizen of the
Hidden Leaf Village.

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:46.046
[gasp]

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.784
You set... the Paper Bombs off
on purpose?!

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:56.590
There was no other way for me to
muffle the sound of my shoes
when I shifted my weight.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:57.191
[gasp]

00:15:57.925 --> 00:15:59.059
[wincing]

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:02.596
So, shall we call this a match?

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.166
[wince] I give up! [gasp]

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.436
The winner! Shikadai Nara!

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:09.937
[cheering]

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.305
Aw yeah!

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:12.506
Aw yeah!

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:13.340
[embarrassed groan]

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.180
Hm.

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:22.182
[grunt]

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.519
Uh, sorry about that! Pardon me!

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:34.928
She sure gave you a hard time.

00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:37.764
Yeah, so what? Sarada...

00:16:37.798 --> 00:16:39.266
Go all out, alright?

00:16:39.867 --> 00:16:41.034
Three seconds...

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.505
Watch me.

00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:46.039
Huh...?!

00:16:46.807 --> 00:16:47.307
[cheering]

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:51.845
I've heard... that you've been
dreaming about becoming the
Hokage...

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:54.348
Let me give you a reality
check...

00:16:56.984 --> 00:17:02.289
Now, Sarada Uchida from the
Hidden Leaf versus, Tarui from
the...

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:04.191
...Hidden Cloud...! ready?

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:05.792
<i>Begin!</i>

00:17:05.826 --> 00:17:07.194
Huuuuuh! Ahhhh!

00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:10.631
Huuuuuuah...

00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:12.065
<i>One!</i>

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:14.168

<i>Three!</i>

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:17.171
[gasp]

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.942
[pained groans]

00:17:21.975 --> 00:17:24.444

00:17:25.546 --> 00:17:27.014
Yeah, alright! Cha!

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.487
Nice! This means we got three
straight wins!

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.821
Piece of cake!

00:17:34.855 --> 00:17:37.791
Good thing your opponent was so
weak.

00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:43.197
Gimme a break. It isn't that she
was weak! Not at all! I'm just
so much stronger!

00:17:43.964 --> 00:17:45.365
[chuckling]

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:51.772
[cheering]

00:17:51.805 --> 00:17:55.776
Well, okay! I guess that I'll
make it four in a row, then.

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:56.677
[cheering]

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.853
(ROCK LEE) Match Four! Inojin
Yamanaka of the Hidden Leaf

00:18:05.886 --> 00:18:08.655
Inojin! Stay focused! Go get
him!

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:16.864
[cheering]

00:18:16.897 --> 00:18:19.800
Oh... Quite a long weapon you
have...

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:24.438
And these are my weapons. As the
saying goes, "the pen's mightier
than the sword."

00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:31.044
Oh... Do you think that makes
you look cool or something?

00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:33.680
I'll pull that pretentious mask
right off your face.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.086
Ninja Art! Super Beast Scroll!

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:48.228
[chuckle]

00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:56.537
How's that?

00:18:57.371 --> 00:18:59.473
I made them with Paper Bombs
inside!

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:07.080
Hm? No damage at all?!

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:08.382
[roar]

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:12.553

This is my Lightning Style:
Overdrive! There's nothing you
can do to stop me!

00:19:42.649 --> 00:19:45.986
Electrical signals sent from the
brain are what make muscles
move.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:51.491
I can use Lightning Style to
speed up those signals so that
I'm more powerful, ya get it?

00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:05.539
Ohhh... WHat is that...?!

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.544

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:24.224
What was that just now?!

00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:27.728

snakes?!

C'mon Mitsuki, give me your
hand! Yay! [chuckle]

00:21:09.002 --> 00:21:11.605
Make sure you do your best out
there!

00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:12.506
Yup!

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:13.207

strong?

00:21:32.025 --> 00:21:37.030

00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:40.534
Hey, hold on a second, are you
one of those shy boys?

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:43.837
Did you avert your gaze because
you're enthralled by my charm?

00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:45.739
I should appologize in advance.

00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:47.541
Huh?! And what does that mean?

00:21:48.675 --> 00:21:50.143
