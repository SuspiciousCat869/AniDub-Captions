WEBVTT

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.378
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.247
(cicadas chirping)

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:58.085
(sound of running water)

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:07.995
(chipmunks squeaking)

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:09.763
Miss Mirai...

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.964
Uh?

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.900
Have you ever heard
of the hot spring

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.835
where you can see
people who've died?

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.236
People who've died?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.441
Seeing the dead?

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.376
But there's no way

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.311
that something like
that could be true.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.579
It's real!

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:26.613
(crows cawing)

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:29.016
(Mirai makes startled sound)

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.151
The entire reason that
I came all this way

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:34.021
is so that I could get
to see my late mother.

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:37.124
Oh, come on, it's
just not possible.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.626
At first I thought so, too,

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:41.862
but then I thought that

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.997
it's probably worth
at least checking out.

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:47.835
I just wanna see my mom, so bad.

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.537
(sound of water running)

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:53.874
Don't you want to see your
father, too, Miss Mirai?

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.576
Uh.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.378
(dramatic music)

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:02.850
Yeah, maybe, but...

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.251
I can't go.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.887
Oh, I see.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.255
Sorry.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.859
-See you later.
-(water splashing)

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:14.761
(Tatsumi makes depressed sound)

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:18.365
(sound of wet footsteps)

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.337
That's right, I mean,
I'm on a mission.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.641
(dramatic music)

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:33.480
(sound of cloth rustling)

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.116
(Guy snoring)

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.658
(Kakashi snoring)

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.998
[Tatsumi] It's real.

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.000
The entire reason that
I came all this way

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.469
is so that I could get
to see my late mother.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.606
There's no way it's real.

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:05.345
[Tatsumi] At first,
I thought so, too,

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:07.848
but then I thought
that it's probably

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.616
worth at least checking out.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.988
I just wanna see my mom, so bad.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.658
(heavy breath)

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:21.628
Don't you want to see your
father, too, Miss Mirai?

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:23.297
(Mirai grunts)

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.731
(sound of door sliding open)

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.767
(Mirai's footsteps)

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.268
Hey, Tatsumi!

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:30.103
(surprised gasp) Miss Mirai?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.273
On second thought, I will go.

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:34.441
(breathy sound from Tatsumi)

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.743
It's dangerous for you
to go alone, anyway.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.612
I would be worried.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.280
Oh yes, thanks so much.

00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:43.250
Honestly, I was feeling
anxious about going alone.

00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:46.587
Well, all right,
then, let's get going.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.754
I've heard that you're only able

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.623
to meet the deceased at night.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:50.657
'Kay, got it.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.996
Yeah, I'll just think of
this as an investigation,

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.632
and besides, as long
as I'm back by morning.

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:07.374
(Sound of footsteps)

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.844
Now, I drew this map based
on all the rumors I've heard,

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:13.247
but who really knows
if it's correct?

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:20.287
(Tatsumi makes breathy sound)

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.389
This whole place feels
totally different

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.525
at night than it
does during the day.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.262
(sound of wind blowing)

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.598
Yeah, maybe 'cause it was
so lively during the day,

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:33.901
it feels more desolate now.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.335
The vibe is so different.

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:36.703
It's creepy.

00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:37.838
(sound of wind blowing)

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:39.006
(Tatsumi screams)

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.374
It's just a banner.

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:43.744
That really freaked me out.

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:45.279
Oh, I'm such a scaredy-cat.

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:47.147
Maybe, but your reaction now

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:49.216
still doesn't top Guy Sensei's.

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.417
Huh?

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.253
You know, on the night of
the whole ghost fiasco?

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.256
It appeared!

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.459
He was completely freaked out.

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:00.427
Really?

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.397
Although, what was
even scarier than that,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.866
in the room where they said
an armored warrior appeared

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.167
(Tatsumi gasps)

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.403
was finding out that Kakashi
slept through it all.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.605
That was way scarier
than any ghost.

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.440
(giggles) That's for sure!

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.342
(Mirai giggles)

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.212
(pleasant music)

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.448
Miss Mirai, Are you
feeling thirsty at all?

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.683
Yeah, a little.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.552
There should be a drinking
spring right around here.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:28.255
Let's take a break and
get some water there.

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:32.159
There it is!

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:34.127
(Tatsumi panting)

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:37.898
(sound of running water)

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.266
Wow, it's so warm!

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.837
Here you go, Miss Mirai.

00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:46.006
Thank you.

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.141
Another rumor I've heard
before is that the people

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:50.277
from the Land of
Steam stay healthy

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.879
by sipping on hot spring water

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.747
like this while
they're out walking.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.382
Oh, is that so, huh?

00:06:56.283 --> 00:07:00.487
(Mirai and Tatsumi
gulping water)

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:02.623
Kinda tastes like iron.

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:03.857
Really?

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:05.292
Oh, yeah, I didn't
really notice that.

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:08.262
I may not look it,
but I am a shinobi!

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:11.899
So, um... if you do
get to see your mom,

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.067
what do want to
talk to her about?

00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:16.103
I want...

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:18.872
to apologize.

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:20.240
Uh?

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:22.676
You see, the day
before my mom died,

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:27.114
we had a ridiculous fight
over something really minor.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.416
I refused to give in,

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.419
and didn't speak to her
the rest of the day.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.556
Then, I went to the
hospital to apologize,

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:40.327
but she'd taken a turn
for the worse, and then...

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.495
soon, she...

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:43.630
and that's why...

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:48.502
(sobs) I want to
say sorry to her.

00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:52.606
I had no idea.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.509
(Tatsumi sobbing)

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.746
(sad music)

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:08.622
What about you?

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:12.359
Your dad was a shinobi,
too, wasn't he?

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.894
Mmhmm.

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.630
He was Mr. Choji's
sensei, right?

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:21.134
Your dad must've been
an amazing shinobi.

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:23.403
That's what everybody tells me,

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:25.873
but I don't personally
know anything about him

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:28.509
since I never got the
chance to meet him.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:31.144
Well then, if you do
get to see him tonight,

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.881
what do you want to say to him?

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:36.984
(grunts) There's just
so much stuff I want

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.519
to say to him and ask him,

00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:42.789
like what exactly is this "King"

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:46.326
that shinobi are supposed to
give their all to protect?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.995
Huh?

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.130
It's just a question
that my sensei asked me,

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:53.433
but I heard that my father was
the one who asked it first.

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:57.004
Of course I still have no clue
as to what the answer might be.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.138
Oh, yeah.

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:00.440
Now I remember you were
talking to Mr. Choji

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.675
about it before.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.678
That's right, but even more
than just getting the answer,

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:08.148
I want to talk to him about why
he died before I was born,

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:09.883
but that's not a question.

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:12.419
So then, were there
lots of things that

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:14.655
you wanted to do
with your dad, too?

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.357
Oh, well, you know...

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:32.739
(dramatic music)

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:02.102
(Mirai's footsteps)

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:10.344
Hey, Dad!

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:19.987
[Tatsumi] Miss Mirai?

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.990
Oh, sorry.

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.892
[Tatsumi] Is something wrong?

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:26.627
Oh, no, it's nothing.

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:35.235
There's just so much that
I want to ask you, Dad!

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.640
(sound of running water)

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:47.848
(frustrated sigh) We won't
be able to cross here,

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:50.384
and I don't see any
bridges around, either.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.624
I think we're headed the right
way, let's just cross here.

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:58.625
What?

00:10:58.659 --> 00:10:59.760
Don't be worried, come on!

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:00.761
Just follow me!

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:02.496
But Miss Mirai,

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:03.597
please wait!

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.300
(dashing sound)

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.202
Okay, it's your turn, Tatsumi!

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:09.736
Uh?

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.071
Miss Mirai!

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:13.307
I can't!

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.741
I can't do that!

00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:16.210
I'm so sorry.

00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:19.713
Here, just hold on to me.

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:20.848
We'll cross together!

00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:21.982
(Tatsumi panicking)

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:26.153
-All right, here we go!
-(Tatsumi screams)

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.021
(Tatsumi gasps excitedly)

00:11:28.055 --> 00:11:31.225
(triumphant music)

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:34.761
See? We did it!

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:37.164
Wow, thank you so
much, Miss Mirai.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.032
I'm sorry I left you behind!

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:40.868
Well, let's go!

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:42.469
(cable wrapping around branch)

00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:44.872
(grappling sound)

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.441
(Tatsumi screams)

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:48.442
(Mirai grunts)

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:51.345
(leaves rustling)

00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:55.282
(thudding sound)

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:58.018
Oh wow, you're
awesome, Miss Mirai,

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.286
and you're so pretty, too.

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:00.888
I bet you're really popular.

00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:02.389
Huh? No way, not me!

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.625
Well, I really like
you, Miss Mirai.

00:12:04.658 --> 00:12:06.994
(Mirai laughs nervously)

00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:08.562
If you hadn't come
along with me,

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:11.398
then I never would've been
able to make it this far.

00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:14.001
There's nothing to fear as
long as you've got a friend.

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:15.202
You're right!

00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:18.605
What's this?

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.207
There's a fork in the road,

00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:25.746
but there only seems to
be one road on the map.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.881
(Tatsumi makes perplexed sound)

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:29.750
So which way?

00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:30.984
Uh...

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.887
[Stranger] Excuse me.

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:35.889
(Tatsumi and Mirai gasp)

00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:36.890
I'm sorry.

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:38.725
I didn't mean to scare you.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.227
Wow, you sure did, though!

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:42.763
By any chance are you two headed

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:45.032
to the hot spring
to see the dead?

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.166
You're going, too?

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.136
Actually, I was just
coming from there.

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.270
We couldn't figure out which

00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:52.739
of these two roads
we're supposed to take.

00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:54.441
It's at the end of this one.

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:55.876
You know, if you'd like,

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:57.845
I just can take you
to the entrance.

00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.346
Oh, great, thank you.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:03.383
So were you able to see
the person that you lost?

00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:05.853
Yes, of course!

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:07.120
Really?

00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:08.288
My older brother,

00:13:08.322 --> 00:13:09.690
I was able to see him again

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:12.759
and tell him about me, my
family, and lots of stuff.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.895
I'm so happy.

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:16.263
Back when he was still with us,

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.131
he was so worried
about what would happen

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:19.900
to us after he died,

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:22.836
so I'm sure that he's
feeling relieved now.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.071
[Tatsumi] I see.

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:25.973
Relieved, huh?

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.976
I wonder if Dad sees me,

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:30.611
will he feel relieved, too?

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.647
(waterfall roaring)

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.653
The hot spring's on the other
side under that waterfall.

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:44.124
(somber music)

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.160
They're here for the
Resurrection Hot Springs.

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:49.396
It's back there, please, come in

00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:52.733
Okay, I'm going now.

00:13:52.766 --> 00:13:54.301
Thank you for all your help!

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.235
Yeah, thank you!

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:58.605
I hope you see them,
your loved ones!

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:03.977
[Tatsumi] It's so dark.

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:11.385
Uh, I smell sulfur.

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:14.021
[Tatsumi] We're almost
there, Miss Mirai!

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:15.255
[Mirai] Yeah!

00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:18.358
Look up ahead, do you see that?

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:20.494
(Mirai gasps)

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.231
(somber music)

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:30.470
Soon...

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.375
I'll get to see you, Dad.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.382
Dad!

00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:52.459
(sound of water dripping)

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.402
So many people.

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:03.437
I'll say.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:05.205
Oh, hey!

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:07.407
You here for the
hot spring, too?

00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:08.408
[Tatsumi] Yeah!

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:09.409
Both of you?

00:15:09.443 --> 00:15:10.611
[Mirai] Yes.

00:15:10.644 --> 00:15:13.947
That means there are
twenty of us now, you guys!

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:15.082
Oh, that's great!

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:16.350
We finally have enough!

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:19.353
What? What do you mean by that?

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:20.954
We were told that
they need to have

00:15:20.988 --> 00:15:23.357
at least twenty people
to hold the ceremony.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.092
I've been waiting here
for almost a month

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:26.960
for my chance to go inside.

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:28.228
[Tatsumi] That long?

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:30.964
[Misato] But still,
those people over there

00:15:30.998 --> 00:15:33.433
have been taking
good care of us.

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:34.501
I see. That's great.

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.203
But thanks to you
two showing up,

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:37.938
now I'm finally
going to get a chance

00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:39.473
to see my friends again!

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:42.209
So who are you guys
hoping to see in there?

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:45.546
Well, I came here
to see my mother.

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:46.947
I came for my dad.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.215
Oh, gotcha!

00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:50.484
I'm actually here to
see my whole family!

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:53.687
Oh, boy, I can't believe that
I'll get to see them soon!

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.222
Right?

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:58.525
(crowd chatting excitedly)

00:15:58.559 --> 00:15:59.626
How lucky we'll get to see

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.095
our loved ones so soon
after getting here.

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.463
That's for sure.

00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:06.099
Thank you all for waiting.

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:08.468
I'll take you to
the next room now.

00:16:08.502 --> 00:16:11.538
Your wishes are finally
about to come true!

00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:15.175
(crowd happily laughing)

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:23.217
Please, make sure

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.052
to watch your step through here.

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:27.688
We're going in now!

00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:29.223
I can barely wait!

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:30.824
I guess it was worth coming

00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:33.293
all this way, right, Miss Mirai?

00:16:33.327 --> 00:16:34.328
Mmhmm.

00:16:35.863 --> 00:16:37.097
Are these ruins?

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.498
Uh-huh, I heard that this place

00:16:38.532 --> 00:16:42.169
was initially chosen
because it's so secluded.

00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:43.937
Who'd imagine there's
such a beautiful place

00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:45.939
at the back of this dark cave?

00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:47.808
Yeah, I agree!

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.076
(doors sliding open)

00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:52.079
[Sect Member] Please,
everyone, come right in!

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:56.049
(crowd laughing excitedly)

00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:04.558
(sound of doors sliding shut)

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:06.593
This is Lord Ryuki.

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:15.569
I welcome you!

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:19.540
Each of you has
come all this way

00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:20.607
in your quest to fulfill

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:23.477
-your deepest wish.
-(crowd gasping excitedly)

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.414
And very soon, now, I
will grant you that wish!

00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:30.317
(crowd giggling)

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:33.687
'Scuse me!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.721
Uh?

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:37.224
Yes, what is it?

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:39.059
I was just wondering
how you plan

00:17:39.092 --> 00:17:40.827
on letting us see the deceased?

00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:42.062
What?

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:45.098
Come on, why would you ask that?

00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:46.834
If they find a
non-believer among us,

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:48.936
then none of us
will get to go in!

00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:50.170
Miss Mirai!

00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:52.172
[Ryuki] No no,

00:17:53.307 --> 00:17:54.474
it's okay.

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:57.211
I understand where you're
coming from with your question,

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:00.314
and I'll be more than
happy to answer it for you.

00:18:02.983 --> 00:18:05.219
A shinobi in the
Fourth Great Ninja War

00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:07.688
used a jutsu to
reincarnate the dead,

00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:09.223
so he could rule the world.

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:11.225
I've heard about this.

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:15.362
That person used the dead
as the soldiers in his army.

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:19.633
I think it's a Forbidden Jutsu
called the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:23.203
It was a Forbidden Jutsu that
not only desecrated the dead

00:18:23.237 --> 00:18:26.473
but also required
a living sacrifice.

00:18:26.507 --> 00:18:29.209
I researched it and
mastered a new version,

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:32.946
a Reanimation Jutsu that
wouldn't dishonor the departed

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.049
and also doesn't need
any living sacrifice.

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:41.488
For those who didn't get a
chance to express their feelings

00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:43.757
to someone before
they passed on,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.093
and for those who died
without being able to express

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.696
their feelings to
someone living,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.198
it was all for them.

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:54.368
After undergoing some
very strict training,

00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:57.471
I was able to acquire the jutsu.

00:18:57.504 --> 00:19:00.474
Yes, so that he's able to
grant everyone's wishes,

00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:02.943
Master Ryuki works
himself to exhaustion

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.578
to perform this jutsu!

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:09.283
You, there.

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:10.951
Oh, uh, yes?

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:12.619
Please, tell me your name,

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:15.556
and the person that
you wish to see here.

00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:17.824
Okay, my name's Misato,

00:19:17.858 --> 00:19:19.726
and I want to see
my friend, Kikuna.

00:19:21.128 --> 00:19:24.565
Miss Misato, please
come over here.

00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:25.599
All right!

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:30.470
(cloth rustling)

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:34.308
Don those robes and
go face the afterlife.

00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:38.178
(eerie sound)

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.085
(Misato gasps)

00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:46.954
[Misato] Kikuna, is that you?

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:48.589
I finally get to see you!

00:19:49.723 --> 00:19:51.091
I'm so glad!

00:19:51.124 --> 00:19:52.960
Oh, I'm so glad!

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:55.229
[Woman watching] Is she
really able to see her?

00:19:55.262 --> 00:19:56.964
So then we'll be
able to as well?

00:19:56.997 --> 00:19:58.832
We'll get to see them.

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:01.235
Good thing we came,
right, Miss Mirai?

00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:03.670
You're right, good thing.

00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:05.205
All right, everyone-

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:08.275
So, anyone else ready?

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.309
Oh, me!

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:14.815
All right, then please
tell me what your name is,

00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:17.551
and who it is that
you wish to see.

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:20.220
Okay, my name's Tatsumi,

00:20:20.254 --> 00:20:23.323
and I wanna see
my mother, Asami!

00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:25.592
Come this way.

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:39.173
(eerie sound)

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:46.079
-[Ghostly voice] Tatsumi?
-(Tatsumi gasps)

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:47.548
[Tatsumi] That voice...

00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:49.816
Is it really you, Mom?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.084
I can hear you!

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:53.220
Oh, I knew it would work!

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.821
It is you, isn't it, Mom?

00:20:54.855 --> 00:20:56.456
It's me, Tatsumi!

00:20:57.124 --> 00:20:58.458
Is it really?

00:21:00.327 --> 00:21:01.562
Mom!

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:02.596
I'm so happy!

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:09.269
How about you?

00:21:09.303 --> 00:21:11.805
Uh...

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:13.473
I'm Mirai Sarutobi.

00:21:13.507 --> 00:21:17.544
Please, I wanna see my
father, Asuma Sarutobi.

00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:19.046
Huh, Sarutobi?

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:23.584
All right, then, this way.

00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:27.321
(eerie music)

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:41.034
(dramatic sound)

00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:45.305
(eerie sound)

00:21:55.115 --> 00:21:58.719
(Mirai breaths heavily)

00:22:06.193 --> 00:22:07.194
Dad?

00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:13.600
