WEBVTT

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.744
You were right.

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:20.049
As expected, it was an heirloom
left by the Foundation, the Gozu
Tennou.

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:25.655
Who's using it?

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:26.789
Hiss.

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:28.791
As to that...

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:38.067
Huh?

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:43.305
Hmm. All right. Got it.

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:49.579
I'm on it.

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:05.247
[grunting]

00:03:05.948 --> 00:03:06.549
Oh!

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:08.250
Hey!

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.424
[grunting]

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:18.493
[grunts]

00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:22.231
All right!

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:23.265
Next group!

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.868
[grunting]

00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.102
[small scream]

00:03:27.136 --> 00:03:34.376
[grunting]

00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:37.980
[heavy breathing]

00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:39.014
<i>(Shino) Next!</i>

00:03:41.483 --> 00:03:42.351
[grunts]

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:44.954
[grunting]

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:51.293
Denki! Nice!

00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:54.163
I'm trying! I can't just keep
being unskilled forever.

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:56.065
Did you hack your body, then?

00:03:56.098 --> 00:03:57.366
Uh, I can't do that!

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:59.201
All right! Let's finish this!

00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:00.369
Right!

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:04.874
[heavy breathing]

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.311
[heavy breathing]

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:14.249
[grunting]

00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:16.051
You cool?

00:04:16.085 --> 00:04:20.155
[screaming/grunting]

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:21.390
Denki!

00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:27.362
I'm okay! But I don't think I
can make it! You two finish
without me!

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:31.266
[exhales]

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.536
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:35.437
[taken aback]

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.208
Never give up, okay?

00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:40.509
We'll help!

00:04:40.543 --> 00:04:41.076
Thanks!

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:46.181
[yelling]

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:48.217
Go!

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.484
Ah!

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:51.587
[grunts]

00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:52.421
Denki!

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:57.192
[screaming]

00:04:57.226 --> 00:05:07.436
Thanks, Mitsuki.

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.972
You too, Boruto.

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:12.441
Well we can't have you dropping
out after you made it this far.

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:15.210
[buzzer]

00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:16.445
Huh?

00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:18.347
[groans]

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:25.721
[whispering]

00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:29.491
That was a tough break. You guys
can join up with us next time.

00:05:29.524 --> 00:05:32.928
You're never gonna pass if you
got Denki on your team.

00:05:32.962 --> 00:05:33.996
Uh.

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:38.433
That isn't true at all! You just
don't know about all the amazing
things Denki can do!

00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:40.870
<i>(Shino) Quite, everyone!</i>

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:44.974
For this practice assignment,
everyone has failed!

00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:48.077
[shocked murmurs] I finished
within the time limit!

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.682
Unless all three members of your
team finish together, you fail.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.054
(Shino) That's because genin
always work in groups of three!

00:05:59.088 --> 00:06:02.825
Which means, your missions will
be done in three‐man teams.

00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:06.395
For success in a mission,
teamwork is essential.

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:09.599
Abandoning a comrade is simply
out of the question!

00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:11.400
[sighs]

00:06:12.968 --> 00:06:17.006
When you graduate from the
Academy, you're all gonna fall
under our command.

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.375
Before then, we're going to come
and observe you periodically.

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.012
That way, we can put together
the best teams.

00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:26.081
But there's no point obsessing
about it.

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:29.518
Just try out different
combinations and see how they
work.

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.054
All right, then!
Class dismissed!

00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:33.422
Thank you, Sensei!

00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:41.196
No Ghost Incidents since the
post office, right?

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.967
Oh yeah! Guess we must have
really scared that guy away.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.438
We almost had him! We came
really close to catching him
that last time.

00:06:49.471 --> 00:06:51.941
Well, it doesn't help that he
escaped.

00:06:51.974 --> 00:06:54.877
And I bet he's gonna be a lot
more cautious, now.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.650
That's true. And even if Boruto
can see the ghost, we still
don't know who's behind it.

00:07:00.683 --> 00:07:05.454
He knew we were looking, and he
still caused an incident, so
he's bound to start up again.

00:07:05.487 --> 00:07:07.857
That means the enemy must have a
plan.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.192
Some of the grown‐ups are
starting to get involved.

00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:13.095
Maybe we shouldn't look into
this whole thing too hard.

00:07:13.128 --> 00:07:18.067
We've come too far to just give
up now! I won't let them treat
us like little kids!

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.368
[stomach growls]

00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.805
But never mind that now. We've
gotta hurry up!

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:26.475
Or else those tasty yakisoba
buns are gonna be all sold out!

00:07:26.508 --> 00:07:28.310
Hey! Wait, Boruto!

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:30.880
Yeah! I'm coming along, too!

00:07:30.913 --> 00:07:34.249
Damn it. Boruto always
messes me up.

00:07:35.517 --> 00:07:37.252
About that practice.

00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:38.487
Huh?

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.455
I understand Sensei's words.

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:42.191
But for the success of a
mission...

00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:45.127
wouldn't it make more sense if I
just went ahead on my own?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:52.134
Uh, yeah but, it would also mean
that you would have to abandon
your teammates.

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:56.839
Oh! So then, do you know why I
acted the way I did?

00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:59.174
Huh? [laughing]

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:04.079
[laughing] I don't know. Maybe
Boruto got to you, too.

00:08:04.113 --> 00:08:06.649
<i>(Shikadai) That guy is such a</i>
<i>drag.</i>

00:08:14.624 --> 00:08:17.259
This year's students look quite
promising!

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:22.497
They're beginning to show a
maturity that exceeds our
expectations.

00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:25.701
If they keep it up, they'll
become fine shinobi.

00:08:27.903 --> 00:08:30.305
Did any students pique your
interest?

00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:35.578
Well, let me see. It seems like
Iwabe Yuino is coming out of his
shell nicely.

00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:38.981
And uh, Boruto shows a lot of
vitality.

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:44.186
Of course! I mean Boruto is the
pride of Lord Seventh, after
all.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:46.088
Why are you bragging about him?

00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:49.091
Who cares? Lord Seventh gave me
the responsibility of
watching...

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:51.260
Yeah, yeah, I've heard
it a hundred times.

00:08:51.293 --> 00:08:55.497
When you talk about Lord
Seventh, Konohamaru,
time drags on and on.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.699
[dramatic gasp]

00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:59.168
Boruto Uzumaki.

00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:04.239
There isn't any doubt that he's
the one who's become the nucleus
of the entire class.

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:09.579
<i>(Konohamaru) Although at the</i>
same time, he's also the nucleus
<i>of trouble!</i>

00:09:12.147 --> 00:09:13.583
[sighs]

00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:15.751
Hmm?

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.654
Iwabe! What's going on, buddy?

00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:23.559
Oh! Boruto. Don't bother me now.
I'm busy.

00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:26.395
He probably has to
stay after school again.

00:09:26.428 --> 00:09:27.529
Shut up!

00:09:27.563 --> 00:09:29.231
What part don't you get?

00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:34.103
[groans] Damn it! This one!

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:40.009
Oh! For problems like that what
you have to do is separate them
into groups by objects first.

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:44.413
[mouth full] You see? And then
you just drop them into the
formula.

00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:47.717
<i>(Iwabe) Oh, I get it. But hold</i>
<i>on, show me again.</i>

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.786
<i>(Boruto) Heh! You're hopeless.</i>
<i>Okay so...</i>

00:09:57.492 --> 00:09:58.493
Hey.

00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:00.429
Huh? What is it?

00:10:00.462 --> 00:10:03.999
I heard some rumors that you're
feeling out of place in class.

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:06.368
[grunts] Are you picking a
fight?

00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:09.839
But right at this moment, you
seem to be enjoying yourself.

00:10:09.872 --> 00:10:11.440
[sighs]

00:10:11.473 --> 00:10:13.408
Is that because of Boruto?

00:10:13.442 --> 00:10:15.778
I, I don't know.

00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:16.879
Hmm.

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:23.318
[school chatter]

00:10:25.354 --> 00:10:28.724
You've been paying a lot of
attention to Boruto lately.

00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:36.532
Well, because, it seems he's
always having fun.

00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:38.901
Hmm.

00:10:38.934 --> 00:10:42.838
Everyone gravitates toward him.
Why do you think that is?

00:10:44.473 --> 00:10:45.941
It's cause he's an idiot.

00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:47.743
Wha?

00:10:47.777 --> 00:10:50.713
Boruto couldn't care less about
what others think.

00:10:50.746 --> 00:10:53.683
He makes up his own mind about
everything.

00:10:56.218 --> 00:10:58.588
He got sick and tired of being
judged...

00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:02.892
for no other reason than he
happened to be the son of the
Hokage.

00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:06.428
<i>(Inojin) That's why he tries</i>
extra hard to see things through
<i>his own eyes.</i>

00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:10.065
<i>Although sometimes that just</i>
<i>ends up making things worse.</i>

00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:14.770
He causes a lot of unnecessary
<i>trouble. That's why he's an</i>
<i>idiot.</i>

00:11:16.772 --> 00:11:19.508
But still, that's why
everyone's drawn to him.

00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:23.212
People love to be
accepted just as they
are, right?

00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:26.982
Oh! But having a guy like
that around can be a pain
as well.

00:11:27.016 --> 00:11:33.255
Especially for people like the
Class Rep. He probably stresses
her out more than anyone.

00:11:33.288 --> 00:11:35.891
Maybe I'm over thinking it!
[laughing]

00:11:37.693 --> 00:11:39.428
The Class Rep...

00:11:56.612 --> 00:11:59.314
You seem to be
doing much better.

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:01.951
Mitsuki, hey.

00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:08.824
It's just you, huh?

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.895
Are your injuries healing?

00:12:12.928 --> 00:12:16.666
Yeah. They told me I'll
be discharged soon.

00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:18.701
I see. That's great.

00:12:18.734 --> 00:12:21.971
We can't have you
dying on us, after all.

00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:22.872
Huh?

00:12:23.873 --> 00:12:26.508
Actually, I'm dealing
with some things, too.

00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:30.245
Um, may I please
ask you something?

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:33.348
Can you tell me how
you feel about Boruto?

00:12:34.584 --> 00:12:37.286
What do you mean?

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:42.357
Inojin said that Boruto's
behavior places a great deal of
stress on you.

00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:43.659
That isn't true at all!

00:12:43.693 --> 00:12:47.196
Sure, a lot of times there can
be some trouble in class.

00:12:47.229 --> 00:12:49.498
And I'm always a little stressed
out about that.

00:12:49.532 --> 00:12:53.869
But it's kind of fun with Boruto
around. Don't you think so, too?

00:12:56.438 --> 00:12:57.973
And what about you?

00:12:58.007 --> 00:12:58.808
Me?

00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:02.845
Well I, I don't really
know yet.

00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:05.881
Do you have any family, Mitsuki?

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.884
Well, kinda.

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.587
Oh, I see.

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:17.593
(Sumire) I'd always thought that
<i>you were like me.</i>

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.166
You mean, you don't have any
family?

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:27.803
Hmm. All of them have
passed on, now.

00:13:27.837 --> 00:13:32.575
When I was young, my
father was a ninja too.

00:13:32.608 --> 00:13:39.582
But I'm not as skilled as he was
so that's why I worry, and why I
work so hard to do well.

00:13:39.615 --> 00:13:43.385
But then being in this class
with everyone else...

00:13:43.418 --> 00:13:46.255
before I knew it, I was having
so much fun.

00:13:46.288 --> 00:13:49.759
It got me wondering what I'd
been doing before all this.

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:52.562
What did I do with all that
time?

00:13:52.595 --> 00:13:54.597
Hey.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.669
How do you feel about the person
who did this? Who hurt you.

00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:06.542
I don't know. I just want all of
this to be over, so I can put it
behind me.

00:14:07.843 --> 00:14:09.945
That's how I feel.

00:14:18.654 --> 00:14:23.158
[school chatter]

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:25.494
Hey, Boruto.

00:14:25.527 --> 00:14:28.063
Oh hey, what's up, Mitsuki?

00:14:29.632 --> 00:14:30.566
Hmm.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.101
Uhh.

00:14:35.905 --> 00:14:37.506
<i>(Boruto) I'm home!</i>

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.941
Oh! Welcome back.

00:14:38.974 --> 00:14:40.843
Thank you for having me over.

00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:43.813
Anytime! You're Mitsuki, right?

00:14:43.846 --> 00:14:44.947
Hey! Hi there!

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.717
Oh hello, Himawari!

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:52.021
Wow! I can't believe that Big
Brother actually brought a
friend home!

00:14:52.054 --> 00:14:56.125
What? Come on! It's not like
it's that unusual, is it?

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:56.926
Uh.

00:14:57.793 --> 00:15:00.462
Oh, wow! What a feast!

00:15:00.495 --> 00:15:03.699
You said you were bringing a
friend home for dinner, so I
thought I'd go all out.

00:15:03.733 --> 00:15:07.537
Thanks for doing all this, but
it's kind of overboard don't you
think?

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.071
Just act normal, Mom!

00:15:09.104 --> 00:15:12.575
Mitsuki! Dinner will
be ready soon.

00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:18.080
(Hinata) And Boruto, guess what?
<i>Dad's going to be coming home</i>
<i>early for a change!</i>

00:15:18.948 --> 00:15:20.616
He is? really?

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.852
Yup! Daddy's joining us!

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:26.321
Hold on, so Dad's actually
coming home?

00:15:26.355 --> 00:15:28.891
Oh, well, guess it can't be
helped.

00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:30.860
You don't want him to?

00:15:30.893 --> 00:15:35.430
Huh? No I, no it isn't that
exactly I...

00:15:35.464 --> 00:15:37.867
Anyway, come with me and I'll
show you my room.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.369
Let's go!

00:15:40.402 --> 00:15:43.005
Please make yourself at home.
Have a good time, boys.

00:15:48.077 --> 00:15:50.580
You can just sit anywhere you
want to.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.850
Your dad is the Seventh Hokage,
right?

00:15:54.884 --> 00:15:56.018
Yeah...

00:15:56.051 --> 00:15:59.722
Huh. I've never actually
talked to him before.

00:15:59.755 --> 00:16:04.093
Yeah all right, fine, I'll
introduce you to him later on,
then.

00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:08.497
Naruto Uzumaki, the Seventh
Hokage.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.801
<i>(Mitsuki) The hero who brought</i>
an end to the Fourth Great Ninja
<i>War.</i>

00:16:11.834 --> 00:16:13.335
Who possesses immense chakra...

00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:15.838
<i>and has command of an</i>
<i>overwhelming number of jutsu.</i>

00:16:15.871 --> 00:16:20.676
<i>Lord Hokage, whose skill makes</i>
<i>him possibly the strongest of</i>
<i>the Five Kage.</i>

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.378
I've heard that he's amazing.

00:16:23.412 --> 00:16:26.015
You don't actually have to
bother with the "Lord" part,
though.

00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:27.717
I know I can't speak for
everybody else...

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.653
but here at our house, he's just
our good‐for‐nothing dad.

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:34.657
He makes Mom do everything. He
can't do anything around the
house.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.061
He only nags and eats ramen.
That's my stupid old man for ya!

00:16:39.962 --> 00:16:41.931
Hmm. Hey.

00:16:41.964 --> 00:16:45.935
So tell me, do you like Lord
Hokage? Or hate him?

00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:47.870
Huh?

00:16:47.903 --> 00:16:51.073
[sighs]

00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:53.208
Well, I guess...

00:16:57.046 --> 00:17:00.950
(Hinata) Hey, you two! Dinner's
<i>ready!</i>

00:17:00.983 --> 00:17:03.285
[sighs] Let's go.

00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:14.664
Oh, wow, all I ever see you eat
are hamburgers and yakisoba
buns.

00:17:14.697 --> 00:17:17.499
So I figured you ate stuff like
that at home as well.

00:17:17.533 --> 00:17:19.969
Hey, quit talking about that
stuff in front of my mom!

00:17:20.002 --> 00:17:22.938
Okay, eat up! Go ahead, Mitsuki.

00:17:22.972 --> 00:17:24.206
<i>(Naruto) I'm home!</i>

00:17:24.239 --> 00:17:26.709
Oh! It's Daddy!

00:17:26.742 --> 00:17:28.343
[sighs]

00:17:28.844 --> 00:17:30.079
Welcome home!

00:17:30.112 --> 00:17:34.917
Hey guys, and here, Ichiraku's
Char Siu.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:35.785
Oh, nice!

00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:40.556
Daddy! Guess what? I helped
Mommy make all of the food for
dinner tonight!

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:44.159
Oh, really? Wow, that's
terrific!

00:17:44.193 --> 00:17:48.163
[scoffs] Well, you're late
again, just like always.

00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:51.967
Hmm? Oh, you must be...

00:17:52.001 --> 00:17:54.770
My name is Mitsuki, of the
Hidden Sound.

00:17:54.804 --> 00:17:59.474
Oh, I've heard about you. I'm
Naruto Uzumaki.

00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:03.846
Yes, I've heard lots of stories
about you from my parent, Lord
Hokage.

00:18:05.147 --> 00:18:07.917
It's been a while since Boruto
brought a friend home.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.019
Seeing this makes me really
happy!

00:18:10.052 --> 00:18:14.256
Hmm. Welcome, Mitsuki! Please be
good to Boruto.

00:18:15.024 --> 00:18:16.191
Sure.

00:18:17.893 --> 00:18:20.229
What the heck are you talking
about? I'm the one who's being
good to him, ya know?

00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:22.898
<i>(Naruto) Okay, I got</i>
<i>it, I got it.</i>

00:18:22.932 --> 00:18:24.900
Just quit it, Dad.

00:18:24.934 --> 00:18:29.772
All right! I've only been able
to eat instant noodles lately!

00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:32.474
It's been so long since I had
your home‐cooking, Hinata!

00:18:32.507 --> 00:18:35.678
I see. He is your
father, after all.

00:18:35.711 --> 00:18:38.247
[scoffs] Don't lump
me in with him.

00:18:39.148 --> 00:18:41.150
<i>(All) Thank you for the food!</i>

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:43.052
[laughing] All right! Let's dig
in!

00:18:43.085 --> 00:18:44.787
Uh.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.256
[laughing] Huh?

00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:50.159
<i>(Boruto) Uh, Dad?</i>

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:52.261
<i>(Naruto) A strange chakra?</i>

00:18:54.263 --> 00:18:57.833
(Shikamaru) Yeah, it's spreading
<i>across the village. We got a</i>
<i>report from the Barrier Team.</i>

00:18:57.867 --> 00:19:02.071
It's similar to the one detected
in the incidents of people
rampaging.

00:19:02.104 --> 00:19:04.073
Sai's already out looking into
it.

00:19:04.106 --> 00:19:05.174
Understood.

00:19:05.207 --> 00:19:08.210
I'll let you know if there's
anything more.

00:19:08.243 --> 00:19:10.646
You have't been able to go home
early much. Just take it easy
tonight and...

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.216
No way. I'm heading straight
back there right now.

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:18.688
What's wrong, dear?

00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:20.890
I'm sorry, Hinata. But I
have to go back to...

00:19:21.857 --> 00:19:23.559
Not again!

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:24.426
Look, there's been another
incident, so I...

00:19:25.494 --> 00:19:27.296
It's always like this! Why does
it have to be you?

00:19:27.329 --> 00:19:30.232
<i>(Naruto) Boruto.</i>

00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:32.902
I'm the Hokage. If someone in
the village is in need, I have
to go.

00:19:32.935 --> 00:19:37.172
<i>(Naruto) The entire village is</i>
<i>my family. You understand</i>
<i>that, don't you?</i>

00:19:37.206 --> 00:19:39.074
No, I'll never understand!

00:19:39.108 --> 00:19:40.810
Boruto!

00:19:41.176 --> 00:19:42.444
Boruto!

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.418
I'll go get him.

00:19:49.451 --> 00:19:50.285
Huh?

00:19:54.323 --> 00:19:56.125
Thanks a lot, Mitsuki.

00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:57.159
Right.

00:19:57.192 --> 00:19:58.928
Oh, Naruto...

00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:02.898
<i>So that's Mitsuki, huh?</i>

00:20:08.303 --> 00:20:12.107
The Hokage is much busier than I
imagined he would be.

00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:14.777
Hey.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.014
You know, before he was always
there for me. And for Himawari,
too.

00:20:19.048 --> 00:20:23.986
But since he became the Hokage,
it's all about work.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:28.824
It's always because he's the
Hokage. He never comes home
because he's the Hokage!

00:20:28.858 --> 00:20:31.126
He's never there for us because
he's the Hokage!

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.998
Hokage, Hokage, Hokage! Just who
the hell is the Hokage, anyway?

00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:41.003
So to answer your question,
yeah, I hate the Hokage.

00:20:41.036 --> 00:20:47.042
Oh, really? because when I look,
all that I see is your love for
the Hokage.

00:20:47.076 --> 00:20:48.778
No way! What do you mean?

00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:53.883
The Hokage is someone who
sacrifices those closest to him
for the village!

00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:56.919
And I don't need that person!

00:20:56.952 --> 00:21:00.956
So that's the reason I will
never abandon those who are
close to me!

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.493
I'm gonna do what my Dad
couldn't, and show him the
light!

00:21:04.526 --> 00:21:05.895
[gasps]

00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:32.154
<i>I'm going to do what my parent</i>
<i>couldn't.</i>

00:21:32.187 --> 00:21:35.891
I see. So it's the same for you,
too.

00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:43.733
Hey, Boruto.

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:47.469
I came here tonight to
tell you something.

00:21:48.103 --> 00:21:49.271
Huh? What is it?

00:21:49.304 --> 00:21:53.442
Hmm. I've been wondering
if I should tell you.

00:21:53.475 --> 00:21:55.578
But it seems like I should.

00:21:55.611 --> 00:21:56.846
Huh?

00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:07.657
I know who it is, behind the
Ghost Incident.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.558
[gasps]

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.260
<i>(Boruto) [scoffs] That's</i>
<i>seriously not funny, Mitsuki.</i>

00:23:51.293 --> 00:23:54.163
<i>(Mitsuki) It's the truth,</i>
<i>though.</i>

00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:56.465
<i>Right before every incident,</i>
<i>each victim was in direct</i>
<i>contact with...</i>

00:23:58.233 --> 00:23:58.734
<i>(Boruto) Are you saying that's</i>
<i>when the Ghost was implanted</i>
<i>onto them?</i>

00:24:00.469 --> 00:24:01.704
<i>(Mitsuki) If you don't want to</i>
<i>believe me, then you are free</i>
<i>not to.</i>

00:24:01.737 --> 00:24:03.973
<i>But I think it's too late,</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

00:24:05.608 --> 00:24:09.011
(Boruto) What the hell is that?

00:24:09.044 --> 00:24:12.848
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "The Demon Beast</i>
<i>Appears!"</i>

00:24:12.882 --> 00:24:15.084
(Mitsuki) Looks like it's begun.
