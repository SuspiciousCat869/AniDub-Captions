WEBVTT

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:25.571
That's Tanuki Shigaraki,
correct?

00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:30.075
That's right. He's a former
member of the Foundation who'd
gone missing.

00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:35.147
<i>(Sai) Seems he was a talented</i>
<i>researcher and an ardent</i>
<i>follower of Danzo's.</i>

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.783
He was also the brains and the
driving force...

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:43.088
behind a plan to develop a new
weapon utilizing the Hashirama
Cell.

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:47.059
(Sai) The weapon's code name was
<i>"Gozu Tennou."</i>

00:00:47.092 --> 00:00:51.096
<i>Even after Danzo died, Tanuki</i>
<i>didn't give up on it.</i>

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.900
<i>(Subordinate A) But he</i>
<i>disappeared long before these</i>
<i>recent incidents even began.</i>

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.370
<i>So he couldn't be behind them.</i>
<i>What a letdown.</i>

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:09.414
Even after we discovered this
hideout of his too, this was all
just a waste of our time.

00:01:11.817 --> 00:01:15.353
Our investigation's at square
one. Huh?

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:18.256
Captain?

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:20.092
What's wrong?

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:23.361
Yes of course, that's it!

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:27.866
(Sai) The incidents began at the
<i>Academy!</i>

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.569
<i>Why didn't we realize earlier?</i>

00:01:31.537 --> 00:01:33.305
What do you mean, sir?

00:01:33.338 --> 00:01:36.509
Hold on! Do you know
who's behind all this?

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:39.277
I do.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:42.515
It is clear that
the culprit is...

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:45.183
[gasps] Well come on, who is it?

00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:48.320
I've thought about it for a
while.

00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:53.158
Exactly, how I can confirm if
you are the sun to my moon.

00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:55.694
The sun? What's that mean?

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:59.898
That's why I've been watching
you ever since I arrived in the
Hidden Leaf.

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:03.201
I wanted to be able to
observe your reactions.

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:06.972
Every time an incident occurred,
you dove straight into it.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.274
You restored all the victims to
normal.

00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:13.078
I don't know what you're getting
at. I did what anybody would.

00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:17.415
However, I wonder what
you will do this time.

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:21.854
The culprit...

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:23.455
<i>(Mitsuki) Is the Class Rep.</i>

00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:24.623
[gasps]

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:30.649
(Shikamaru) That's what we know
<i>so far.</i>

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:35.821
The one who caused the incidents
is the daughter of a former
member of the Foundation.

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:40.425
<i>(Shikamaru) Sumire Kakei.</i>

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:43.295
Isn't she one of Boruto's
classmates?

00:04:43.328 --> 00:04:46.431
<i>(Shikamaru) Her father's name</i>
<i>was Tanuki Shigaraki.</i>

00:04:46.464 --> 00:04:52.204
Shortly before he died, he
entrusted her with the Gozu
Tennou, which he'd perfected.

00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:54.039
(Shikamaru) Sai's out searching
<i>for her now...</i>

00:04:54.072 --> 00:04:56.809
since she's disappeared from her
<i>hospital room.</i>

00:04:56.842 --> 00:05:01.413
Put that aside for now. People
are saying these incidents
wouldn't have happened...

00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:04.282
if the Leaf Police had vetted
everyone involved.

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:07.620
(Shikamaru) What's our response?

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:11.023
(Kakashi) Well, Lady Fifth and I
<i>decided to stop exposing the</i>
<i>identities...</i>

00:05:11.056 --> 00:05:13.659
<i>of everyone connected to the</i>
<i>Foundation.</i>

00:05:13.692 --> 00:05:15.694
<i>(Naruto) Kakashi Sensei!</i>

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.033
Whatever. That's seriously not
funny, Mitsuki.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:22.768
Like at all!

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:26.004
It's the truth, though.

00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:30.475
Just think. Right before every
incident, each victim was in
direct contact with her.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.881
Are you saying that's when she
implanted the Ghost on them?

00:05:35.914 --> 00:05:38.116
But she was a victim too.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.756
I believe that was merely a
deception to deflect suspicion
away from her.

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:44.723
[exhales]

00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:48.193
I can give you more proof, if
you're still not convinced.

00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:50.495
Enough already! It just doesn't
make any sense.

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.832
Why exactly would the Class Rep
do this?

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:57.169
Don't beat yourself up, Boruto.
It wasn't your fault!

00:05:57.202 --> 00:05:59.638
There's no way! I don't buy it!

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:03.175
Well, you don't have to believe
me if you don't want to.

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:05.443
But I think it's too late
anyway.

00:06:05.477 --> 00:06:08.814
It's too late? Just what
do you mean by that?

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:11.750
She's realized she can't hide
the truth any longer.

00:06:11.784 --> 00:06:15.521
I've no doubt that she's already
moving on to the next phase.

00:06:15.554 --> 00:06:16.689
Huh?

00:06:18.156 --> 00:06:21.193
In the Ghost Incidents, her
victims were manipulated into
rampaging.

00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:23.061
But that wasn't the main
purpose.

00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:27.132
It was just a way to absorb the
victims chakra, that's all.

00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:28.767
That can't be!

00:06:29.134 --> 00:06:30.569
[grunts]

00:06:32.638 --> 00:06:34.372
What is that?

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:36.709
It's coming from Senju Park!

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.645
Looks like it's begun.

00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:46.218
Not seeing through the ruse that
Sumire Kakei set up was a big
mistake on our part.

00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:50.088
But doing a full background
check on every villager had been
ruled out.

00:06:50.122 --> 00:06:55.093
We didn't want people to become
suspicious of each other, right?

00:06:55.127 --> 00:07:01.834
<i>(Naruto) Back then after the</i>
<i>Fourth Great Ninja War, the</i>
<i>village was in shambles.</i>

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:06.038
<i>Everyone had lost someone</i>
<i>precious to them.</i>

00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:09.441
In that climate, if we stirred
up suspicion that a family
member...

00:07:09.474 --> 00:07:12.110
or a colleague was once a member
of the Foundation...

00:07:12.144 --> 00:07:15.648
the village would've been torn
apart by doubt and distrust.

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.950
I think that you made the right
decision.

00:07:17.983 --> 00:07:19.351
If you'd chosen otherwise...

00:07:20.853 --> 00:07:22.921
someone like Sai would've been
among the first to fall under
suspicion.

00:07:22.955 --> 00:07:24.890
Sumire's the problem now.

00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:28.927
We already knew that her late
mother had never been any kind
of ninja.

00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:33.065
We confirmed that much back when
we received her Academy
application.

00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:35.501
Her father's background was
unknown.

00:07:35.534 --> 00:07:38.504
But we probably knew that he was
a Rogue Ninja, right?

00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:42.908
But there's no rule that someone
can't be accepted just because
they don't have any parents.

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.545
That's true. But whatever her
reasons might have been...

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:50.148
the fact is that she roped a lot
of innocent victims into this.

00:07:50.182 --> 00:07:51.917
<i>(Shikamaru) So even if she's a</i>
<i>child...</i>

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.219
You think we should punish her
like a criminal?

00:07:54.252 --> 00:07:58.490
Our role now is to maintain
peace and order in the Hidden
Leaf Village.

00:07:58.524 --> 00:08:00.492
We can't be soft on everyone.

00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:03.729
You pick the strangest times to
act all "by the book."

00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:08.601
This isn't a joking matter!
Anyway, why are you here, Lord
Sixth?

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:11.003
Weren't you supposed to be away
at the hot springs?

00:08:11.036 --> 00:08:15.974
Well, to be honest, I'd hoped
that I could just take it easy
in my retirement.

00:08:16.008 --> 00:08:19.512
(Kakashi) But Danzo and I appear
<i>to be linked by destiny.</i>

00:08:19.545 --> 00:08:22.781
So, I've been hunting for traces
<i>of his research.</i>

00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:26.384
<i>(Naruto) [gasps] And? Did you</i>
<i>find anything?</i>

00:08:26.418 --> 00:08:33.225
Yeah. Something I wish that I'd
never learned. Danzo's legacy,
the Gozu Tennou.

00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:37.029
(Kakashi) It's very likely that
he imbedded it in Sumire's body.

00:08:37.062 --> 00:08:38.263
[gasps]

00:08:38.296 --> 00:08:39.464
[grunts]

00:08:40.733 --> 00:08:42.635
It's no wonder we couldn't find
it no matter how hard we looked.

00:08:42.668 --> 00:08:45.538
Her father probably took that
precaution.

00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:50.308
So Sumire herself is the very
gate through which that creature
Nue is summoned.

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:52.678
How could he!

00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:55.548
Then, you realize Sumire is...

00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:56.915
[gasps]

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:58.984
What just happened?

00:09:04.122 --> 00:09:05.958
<i>Danzo Shimura.</i>

00:09:08.126 --> 00:09:11.830
The man who used any means, no
matter how despicable, to
protect the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:13.699
<i>But ultimately...</i>

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:17.970
<i>His actions were based only on</i>
<i>his own personal view of what</i>
<i>was best for the Leaf.</i>

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:22.708
To avenge him by destroying the
<i>village is mistaking the cause</i>
<i>for the end.</i>

00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:27.079
Furthermore, if another cycle of
tragedy and hatred starts up...

00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:32.585
<i>people whose past is connected</i>
to the Foundation will be viewed
<i>with hostility.</i>

00:09:32.618 --> 00:09:37.690
<i>So if there are still others</i>
living under this curse, I must
<i>free them.</i>

00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:41.527
It is my duty as someone who was
<i>liberated in the past.</i>

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:50.536
(Tanuki Shigaraki) Never forgive
them! Do you hear me? Avenge the
<i>Foundation!</i>

00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:55.608
<i>You're the only one who can do</i>
<i>this! Do not fail to wreak</i>
<i>vengeance on the Leaf!</i>

00:10:08.453 --> 00:10:12.658
That was nicely done!
You're really just a kid?

00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:15.694
Stay alert! Who knows
what she's capable of.

00:10:24.202 --> 00:10:25.938
[groans]

00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:27.806
I'm sorry.

00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:33.712
I know you're Inojin's friend,
but I have no choice.

00:10:33.746 --> 00:10:37.182
As long as I'm here, nothing bad
will happen to you.

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:40.653
Although, I have to keep you
restrained for now.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.757
[groans] Nue...

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:48.727
[gasps]

00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:55.568
[grunts]

00:10:56.334 --> 00:10:58.003
Can you still move?

00:10:58.036 --> 00:10:59.304
<i>(Subordinate A) Yes...</i>

00:10:59.337 --> 00:11:01.607
[roar]

00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:11.049
[roaring]

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:14.119
[roar]

00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:15.487
Huh? [grunts]

00:11:25.097 --> 00:11:27.332
What is that thing?

00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:30.168
Nue.

00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:32.938
The Gozu Tennou is being
summoned through chakra gathered
in an intermediary.

00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:37.610
(Boruto) If something like that
<i>goes on a rampage, the village</i>
<i>will be wrecked, ya know!</i>

00:11:37.643 --> 00:11:42.380
What are you going to do? What
could you do even if you were to
go down there?

00:11:42.414 --> 00:11:44.182
I don't know yet!

00:11:45.884 --> 00:11:48.954
But I won't believe anything
till I talk to the Class Rep
myself! I know that much.

00:11:50.222 --> 00:11:51.924
Boruto...

00:11:56.161 --> 00:11:59.865
What is it? I'm a little
preoccupied at the moment.

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:06.204
Weren't you going to let her
live and observe her? Why now?

00:12:09.074 --> 00:12:11.343
All right, fine.

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:18.617
Mission acknowledged. My new
orders are to eliminate Sumire.

00:12:26.224 --> 00:12:28.594
[roars]

00:12:29.494 --> 00:12:31.530
I'm sorry, Captain.

00:12:31.564 --> 00:12:35.133
No. It's fine, we can't handle
it ourselves.

00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:37.169
[growls]

00:12:37.202 --> 00:12:38.336
Incoming!

00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.077
Purple Lightening!

00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:51.850
Lord Sixth?

00:12:51.884 --> 00:12:53.619
We can't let that thing get
loose in the village!

00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:55.788
Sai, create a diversion.

00:12:55.821 --> 00:12:56.589
Sir!

00:12:57.455 --> 00:12:59.792
Ninja Art! [grunts] Super Beast
Scroll!

00:13:03.662 --> 00:13:05.998
Earth Style: Multi Mud Wall!

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.377
What now?

00:13:19.411 --> 00:13:20.312
[gasps]

00:13:20.345 --> 00:13:21.980

[grunts]

00:13:31.023 --> 00:13:33.025
My strength is...

00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:37.062
Their chakra's been absorbed!

00:13:38.997 --> 00:13:40.866
This isn't good.

00:13:44.603 --> 00:13:47.673
What exactly is going on?

00:13:47.706 --> 00:13:49.975
I wouldn't get closer
if I were you.

00:13:50.008 --> 00:13:51.009
Mitsuki.

00:13:52.177 --> 00:13:55.180
<i>(Mitsuki) It's just like the</i>
<i>Ghost Incidents.</i>

00:13:55.213 --> 00:13:58.083
<i>At this rate, the Chakra of</i>
everyone in the village will be
<i>extracted.</i>

00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:02.621
Everyone in the village? Damn
it! What are we gonna do?

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:04.456
There is one solution.

00:14:04.489 --> 00:14:07.793
Nue will stop if the jutsu user
dies.

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:10.796
Wait hold on, you mean?

00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:14.266
What will you do now?

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:18.403
The lives of your family and the
villagers, or the Class Rep?
Which side will you choose?

00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:20.539
I don't...

00:14:20.573 --> 00:14:24.142
I don't even have to think about
it! I'll just save both sides!

00:14:26.378 --> 00:14:28.146
[chuckles] Oh I see.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.649
That's an answer that
I couldn't give.

00:14:30.683 --> 00:14:34.887
Once again, you reveal choices
that I would never think to
make.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.722
Uh.

00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:39.858
Boruto, teach me even more about
our differences.

00:14:39.892 --> 00:14:42.828
I'd like to know, I want to feel
it more.

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:45.397
Just what are you
trying to tell me?

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.635
But that'll have to come later.
I have my mission.

00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:52.470
Hey, what are you doing?

00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:56.008
I must get rid of the source
before it's too late. I've been
given my orders.

00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:58.711
What are you talking about, what
orders?

00:14:58.744 --> 00:15:01.446
Are you seriously going through
with it?

00:15:01.479 --> 00:15:06.018
(Mitsuki) As things stand now, I
<i>feel this is the best choice.</i>

00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:09.655
Oh, and if you follow
me, you'll regret it.

00:15:09.688 --> 00:15:12.090
Hey, wait! Mitsuki!

00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:19.231
I'm sorry, but until my real
self finishes his task, I'd like
you to take a short nap.

00:15:19.264 --> 00:15:23.936
Yeah right, like I'd ever let
you do that.

00:15:23.969 --> 00:15:28.373
A shadow clone...always has a
shadow clone!

00:15:29.141 --> 00:15:31.376
Do it! No wait, not me!
[screams]

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.214
[grunts]

00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:37.616
[groans]

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.918
Sorry about this. [grunts]

00:15:41.353 --> 00:15:44.723
[groans] Take it easier next
time, will ya?

00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:47.059
You told me to do it.

00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:48.093
Right?

00:15:49.595 --> 00:15:53.298
Damn it. I can't just hang
around here, I've got to get to
the Class Rep.

00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:58.804
But, where is she? [gasps]

00:15:58.837 --> 00:16:01.907
(Boruto) That thing looks like a
<i>chakra current.</i>

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.976
Could it be?

00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:10.949
[roars]

00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:14.486
That thing's gotten bigger. Is
it from all the gathered chakra?

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.123
The wall's reaching its
limit. Let's give it one last
push.

00:16:18.156 --> 00:16:19.157
Okay!

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:20.693
Barrier Team!

00:16:20.726 --> 00:16:21.459
Right!

00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:30.202
All right!

00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:31.269
Okay.

00:16:32.104 --> 00:16:33.338
[roars]

00:16:35.774 --> 00:16:40.012
Well! I guess we're gonna have
to take this thing on ourselves.

00:16:40.045 --> 00:16:42.114
In a fist‐fight with a monster
like this...

00:16:42.147 --> 00:16:45.884
I wish we could borrow some
power from Choji and the others.
[grunts]

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.929
Are you two doing okay?

00:16:56.962 --> 00:17:00.566
Huh? Hey! Who's commanding the
relief operations?

00:17:00.599 --> 00:17:02.935
<i>(Naruto) Shikamaru and the</i>
<i>others are on it.</i>

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.741
Now I'll settle this, in only
one move!

00:17:08.774 --> 00:17:10.308
<i>(Kakashi) Wait Naruto!</i>

00:17:10.342 --> 00:17:10.976
Huh?

00:17:11.577 --> 00:17:12.711
You don't want to do that.

00:17:12.745 --> 00:17:15.047
That monstrosity absorbs chakra.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:15.848
Huh?

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:19.752
If it gets ahold of your immense
chakra, it'll become more than
we can control.

00:17:19.785 --> 00:17:26.491
And as a last resort, the jutsu
user can detonate the chakra
that's stored inside of Nue.

00:17:26.525 --> 00:17:28.994
<i>(Kakashi) Then we'll all be</i>
<i>blown to bits!</i>

00:17:29.027 --> 00:17:31.530
<i>(Sai) Are you saying Nue's a</i>
<i>giant bomb?</i>

00:17:31.564 --> 00:17:34.499
(Kakashi) That was its original
<i>purpose as a summoning.</i>

00:17:34.533 --> 00:17:38.637
The Gozu Tennou user would be
sent into enemy territory to go
on a rampage...

00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:42.140
and then blow themselves up
along with everyone nearby.

00:17:42.174 --> 00:17:44.843
The cold rationality is
sickening!

00:17:44.877 --> 00:17:51.283
I think that you should go join
the Barrier Team. If the barrier
collapses, then it's all over.

00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:58.023
Okay, I understand. But still,
is this really all we can do?

00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:04.262
<i>So they put up a barrier after</i>
<i>all. Nue doesn't have enough</i>
<i>chakra to break through yet.</i>

00:18:04.296 --> 00:18:08.100
Should I set off the detonation?
<i>Hmm.</i>

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:11.704
<i>After coming this far?</i>

00:18:11.737 --> 00:18:15.674
<i>Just a little more. If I can</i>
<i>give it a little more chakra,</i>
<i>Nue will be whole!</i>

00:18:16.542 --> 00:18:18.043
Hmph!

00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:32.891
You're good when you want to be,
huh Class Rep?

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:38.531
[heavy breathing] Oh no, I'm not
really, Mitsuki.

00:18:38.564 --> 00:18:40.866
How'd you know where to find me?

00:18:40.899 --> 00:18:44.570
Hiding is my specialty.

00:18:44.603 --> 00:18:50.108
<i>(Mitsuki) When I visited you</i>
<i>at the hospital, I made some</i>
<i>preparations.</i>

00:18:50.142 --> 00:18:53.211
Although it did take me quite a
bit of time.

00:18:55.013 --> 00:18:58.250
So then, have you
come here to kill me?

00:18:58.283 --> 00:19:02.888
Yes, I have, It's an order. I do
not have a choice.

00:19:02.921 --> 00:19:08.694
I doubt that Lord Seventh's the
one who gave that order. So who
are you really working for?

00:19:08.727 --> 00:19:11.196
It doesn't matter. Anyway...

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.736
[gasps/grunts]

00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:19.237
[gasps]

00:19:19.271 --> 00:19:23.075
Sorry. It ends here and now.

00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:25.578
[inhales]

00:19:25.611 --> 00:19:26.912
Stop it, Mitsuki!

00:19:26.945 --> 00:19:29.381
Boruto! [grunts]

00:19:31.349 --> 00:19:35.921
Class Rep. Are you really the
one behind all of this?

00:19:35.954 --> 00:19:37.790
(Boruto) The Ghost only I could
<i>see.</i>

00:19:37.823 --> 00:19:40.993
You're actually the one who used
<i>it on all those people?</i>

00:19:41.026 --> 00:19:43.028
Boruto. It's not...

00:19:43.629 --> 00:19:44.763
Hmph.

00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:50.202
Yes, I am. So you were the only
one who could see Nue, huh?

00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:55.874
[grunts] So it's true then...

00:19:55.908 --> 00:20:00.178
I did it to manifest Nue, and
destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!

00:20:00.212 --> 00:20:05.851
And what about Wasabi and
Namida? And Sarada and Cho‐Cho?
All our classmates?!

00:20:05.884 --> 00:20:07.786
None of them matter to me!

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.925
For revenge! That's the reason I
was born, and all I've lived
for!

00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.192
[gasps]

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.130
From the very start, I've
existed only for vengeance!

00:20:18.163 --> 00:20:24.202
This is proof. I've lived until
today only to accomplish what my
father couldn't!

00:20:25.571 --> 00:20:28.841
What your dad couldn't
accomplish...

00:20:28.874 --> 00:20:31.409
Shall fall to the child, right?

00:20:31.443 --> 00:20:36.181
You guys are taking all this too
far! Weird orders, revenge?!

00:20:36.214 --> 00:20:38.784
I'm not gonna let any
of that happen!

00:20:38.817 --> 00:20:40.485
Then what are you going to do?

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:44.422
Are you going to stop me by
killing me here? Could you
really do that?

00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:48.293
[sigh] It always turns out like
this.

00:20:49.127 --> 00:20:51.163
Hey! Mitsuki!

00:20:51.196 --> 00:20:55.500
This is why I said you'd regret
it if you came.

00:21:00.639 --> 00:21:02.875
Stop this.

00:21:02.908 --> 00:21:04.442
<i>(Boruto) Stop, Mitsuki!</i>

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.444
<i>(Boruto) Stop!</i>

00:21:06.478 --> 00:21:06.945
Hmph!

00:21:06.979 --> 00:21:08.113
[gasps]

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:13.552
Boruto...

00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:15.588
Boruto...

00:21:17.355 --> 00:21:21.459
Just knock it off! Do you really
want to kill each other? Up
until now you've been. Huh?

00:21:21.794 --> 00:21:23.128
What?

00:21:25.731 --> 00:21:27.199
[grunting]

00:21:27.232 --> 00:21:29.267
What happened?

00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:40.178
The Transportation Technique?

00:21:40.212 --> 00:21:44.650
It's one thing after another.
What the hell is going on around
here?

00:21:49.722 --> 00:21:54.226
All right. I'll let you have my
chakra now.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.261
[gasps]

00:21:59.097 --> 00:22:00.599
Class Rep...

00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:01.700
No, wait.

00:22:01.734 --> 00:22:03.368
Class Rep!

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:52.945
(Sumire) I raised Nue all these
<i>years just for the sake of</i>
<i>vengeance.</i>

00:23:52.978 --> 00:23:54.346
<i>He's the ultimate weapon!</i>

00:23:54.379 --> 00:23:56.515
<i>(Boruto) Come on, Class Rep.</i>
<i>Let's all go back!</i>

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:58.817
(Sumire) I launched an attack on
<i>the HIdden Leaf Village.</i>

00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:01.754
<i>From my point of view, I'm</i>
<i>fighting a war!</i>

00:24:01.787 --> 00:24:03.989
<i>(Boruto) If it is, it's just</i>
<i>your father's war!</i>

00:24:04.022 --> 00:24:06.091
<i>All of that has nothing to do</i>
<i>with you now!</i>

00:24:06.124 --> 00:24:11.730
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "The Path That</i>
<i>Boruto Can See."</i>

00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:15.500
<i>(Sumire) Sumire Kakei</i>
<i>never existed in the first</i>
<i>place!</i>
