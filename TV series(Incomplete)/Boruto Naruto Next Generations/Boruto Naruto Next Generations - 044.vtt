WEBVTT

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.976
(KOTARO)
We need your help as genin

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.312
in order to capture
the Byakuya Gang.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.448
They've proven themselves
to be very elusive indeed.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.118
And regrettably, our standard
search procedures

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.587
have so far been unsuccessful.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.724
I'm here today to ask you
to keep your eyes open.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.860
Watch out for any unusual
activity in the village.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.228
If you notice something,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.230
report it immediately
to the Police Force

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:34.267
or to a shinobi who is
ranked higher than a chunin.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.769
Sounds like
a serious mission.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.538
We really have to do
our best!

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:38.404
(KOTARO)
However...!

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.139
‐ Hm?
‐ Hm?

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.373
As you are still genin,

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.008
the scope of your mission
is limited.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.177
You may observe.
And you may report.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.080
And depending on
the situation, you may track.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.082
Does that mean
we can't fight?

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.517
We cannot authorize
you genin

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.086
to take part in
any combat yet.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.388
Avoid engaging in
reckless behavior!

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.659
[chattering]

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:01.127
We can't fight the enemy
even if we do find them...

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.663
That's going to
be a tough mission!

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.030
(MITSUKI)
Hey...

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.632
Even though we don't intend
to fight them,

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.301
what do we do if
the enemy attacks us first?

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.171
In that case, well then...

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.544
Then we'll have no choice
but to fight them!

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.212
And there's always
the possibility

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.115
that we might even
be able to capture them.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.349
Right, Boruto?

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.284
Huh?

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:27.087
Well...
I wonder about that.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.954
What do you mean?

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.155
I thought for sure

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.124
you'd be agreeing with me
this time.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.626
This isn't like you.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.427
Oh, just shut up!

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.163
I've been giving these kind
of questions a lot of thought.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.939
Earth Style, Mud Wall!

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.413
Hey, you're something else!

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:36.016
Your talents are going
to waste as a ninja!

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.151
How about it?
Wanna come work for us?

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.385
[chuckle]

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.254
Robbers in the village!

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.088
And they're wearing
owl masks!

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:43.289
[gasp]

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.025
Contact the Police Force
right away!

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.426
‐ There's no time for that!
‐ [gasps]

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.829
We're gonna
capture them ourselves!

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:49.996
Wait, Iwabe!

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.864
[heavy breathing]

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.265
Stop right there!

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.466
Ignore them!

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.570
Earth Style...Mud Wall!

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.320
You are quite amazing, Iwabe!

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.723
This must be the natural
result of daily training!

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.459
My Mud Wall is
fortified bedrock.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.028
And I've gotten stronger too!

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:24.030
I'll go notify
the Police Force now.

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:25.031
Ahhh!

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.101
[groan]

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.302
Denki!

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:30.604
[gasp]

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:32.506
[grunt]

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:36.910
‐ [gasp]
‐ (METAL) Ahhh!

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.915
(BORUTO)
Are you okay, Metal?

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.918
I am very sorry I have
caused you all to worry...

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.219
[pained groan]

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.888
Aw... Metal...

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.124
Don't exert yourself.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.458
You have
a really serious injury

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.660
and you shouldn't
be moving around.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:54.628
[scoff]

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.396
This is nothing
but a small wound

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.164
and as long as
I have some mobility,

00:04:58.198 --> 00:04:59.900
I can continue to train!

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.401
[struggling]

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.436
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.706
No. I was too careless...

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.708
(UDON)
It wasn't carelessness.

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:08.975
Iwabe...

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.513
Your arrogance is the main
reason all this happened.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:14.347
You were told to
report back at once

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.382
if you found
the Byakuya Gang.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.385
So why did you ignore
your orders?

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.421
Sorry, Udon Sensei...

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.157
You are all
inexperienced genin.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.426
Learn to face that reality.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.494
This time, you got off
with an injury.

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.664
But that one mistake
could have cost you

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:32.533
your life or someone else's.

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:33.867
[quivering breaths]

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:35.902
Forgive me...

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:37.638
Iwabe...

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.240
You're suspended for now,
so go on home.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:43.009
You should all practice
self‐restraint.

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:44.645
I'm going to make
my report now.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.887
It is okay, Iwabe.
I will be fine.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.288
I will do physical therapy

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.357
and get stronger
than I was before.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.459
Look, just let it go, Metal.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.863
Udon Sensei just told us
we have to be more realistic.

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:03.664
Well...uh...

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:04.965
Face it.

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:08.434
The higher‐ups match
our missions to our abilities.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.905
Over‐reaching will only
turn out to be a drag for us.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:13.139
That's the reality.

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:15.809
[emotional sigh]

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:19.713
<i>(NEWSCASTER)</i>
<i>Coming up next,</i>

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.782
<i>a report on</i>
<i>the Byakuya Gang.</i>

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.984
<i>With the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf Village</i>

00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:25.652
as their current target,

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:28.354
<i>the Byakuya Gang has been</i>
<i>stealing gold and jewelry</i>

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.289
<i>from wealthy residents.</i>

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:30.857
<i>They sell the items</i>

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.927
<i>and give the proceeds to</i>
<i>the poor in remote areas.</i>

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.496
<i>They call themselves</i>
<i>noble thieves.</i>

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.964
<i>We had a water shortage.</i>

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.601
<i>But now,</i>
<i>the problem's been resolved.</i>

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:42.468
<i>All thanks to</i>
<i>the Byakuya Gang.</i>

00:06:42.503 --> 00:06:44.204
<i>(POOR FEMALE VILLAGER)</i>
<i>We're very grateful.</i>

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.272
<i>They're our saviors!</i>

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:47.708
<i>And that feeling</i>
<i>is growing.</i>

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.576
<i>Increasing numbers</i>
<i>within the Land of Fire</i>

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.911
<i>support them, too.</i>

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:52.478
<i>It's probably</i>
<i>another indication</i>

00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:53.880
<i>of just how dissatisfied</i>

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.650
people throughout
the nation are feeling.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.853
Why is the Byakuya Gang
becoming so popular?

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.888
They are only
common thieves, right?

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.626
Probably because poor people
resent rich people.

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.759
Right?

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:09.530
Woah!
Now that's not really fair.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:10.764
Not everyone in the world

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.833
is going to be
a financial success.

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:16.970
Hey, Mommy!

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:19.906
Is the Byakuya Gang
good or are they bad?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.574
[gasp]

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.909
Why the sudden interest?

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.010
The news was on...

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.879
and they said that
the gang only steals

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:29.149
so they can give money to
people who really need it.

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.517
And that we should
admire them!

00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:33.086
Because people like that
are noble thieves.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.254
Actually‐‐

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.757
No thief is good or noble,
ya know.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.490
Huh?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.761
Now don't get me wrong‐‐

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.529
helping the weak is fine...

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:44.030
if you do it right.

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:46.332
They don't care who they hurt
in the process.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.834
And that's bad.

00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:50.537
[chewing]

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:53.073
I get it.
That makes sense.

00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:55.942
But Dad's at
the root of all this,

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.879
because his policies are
obviously ineffective.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:00.246
[chewing]

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.148
Everybody knows that
the Hokage's job

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.717
is to help people
in trouble.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.120
Unfortunately, there isn't
an easy fix for everything.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.555
And some problems

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.792
can only be solved
little by little over time.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.360
Daddy's doing the best
he can, right?

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:16.429
That's right!
He sure is, dear!

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.965
I get that Dad is
"doing his best"...

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.835
But I just can't support
the Byakuya Gang.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.770
I believe the right thing
to do is to always

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:26.172
help people out in the open,
fair and square!

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.176
(DENKI)
[sigh]

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.878
Worrying never
solves anything.

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.948
Just take it easy during
your suspension.

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:35.716
Yeah, but...

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:37.618
You gotta cheer up, Denki.

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:40.654
We'll come over to keep you
company when we have time.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.823
Thanks a lot, Boruto.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.758
You know what I still
can't figure out...

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:47.728
is why the Byakuya Gang
operates like it does.

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:50.063
They say it's for
"the sake of justice."

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.297
Isn't that it?

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:53.466
That is exactly the type
of propaganda

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.969
people you can't trust
always come up with.

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:58.805
It's the way they do things
that really bothers me.

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.007
Ugh, they are so not cool.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.276
But despite that,
you gotta face facts.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.645
There are people who are

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:07.380
genuinely grateful
to them for their help.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.715
What are you trying to say?

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:10.617
You taking their side,
Shikadai?

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.620
I don't like the things
those people are doing either.

00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:15.722
But you are aware that
there are a lot of things

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:18.191
in the world
that defy logic, right?

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.793
If we only cling to one view

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:21.562
and refuse to see
the other side,

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:24.731
we might wind up making
the situation worse.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:26.633
Instead of sitting
and talking,

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:29.002
we need to capture
the Byakuya Gang.

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.571
We can't just let them
run around

00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:32.038
doing whatever they want.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.575
Only chunin and higher
can capture them.

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:35.909
Don't forget that
our assignment

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.744
is only to report
and track them.

00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:39.513
I know all of that!

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:40.647
But c'mon...

00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:41.915
As long as we're
on their trail,

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:44.017
I'd rather capture
them myself.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.653
You haven't been listening
to anything we've said.

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.522
Get real.
We can't do that.

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:49.890
I know, all right?!

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:54.394
Well, all right.
I really have to get going.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.762
Okay.
Me, too.

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.764
I've gotta go and deal
with a real‐life problem

00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.700
I'm struggling
with right now.

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:02.736
And just what real‐life
problem would that be?

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.104
I've blown through
my allowance

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:05.872
and can't buy any more
video games.

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:08.241
So I'm gonna borrow them
from Mr. Katasuke.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.311
[gasp] You're really going to
go see that weird guy again?

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:14.114
Yeah, 'cuz that weird guy's
got a ton of games,

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:15.348
what can I tell ya?

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.116
Later!

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:16.650
See ya.

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:17.584
Bye, guys.

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:18.952
Katasuke?

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.186
(MITSUKE)
I met him once.

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:22.689
He's an odd adult

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:25.626
who does scientific
research on ninjutsu.

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:27.928
I'll take your word
that he's a weirdo.

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:35.936
You've come back.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.004
Yes, sir.

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:41.107
Okay.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.576
Then we can begin.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:45.812
Our next target is
this pawn shop.

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:47.648
I've already scouted
the place.

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.916
We'll enter from the back,
steal the goods,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.085
and escape through the front.

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:55.021
We know this shop has
a really bad reputation.

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:58.659
If things go well, support for
our cause will only grow.

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:05.431
[gasp]

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:06.800
What is it?

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.737
If it's all right,
can I go on ahead?

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:13.540
I want to memorize
the layout of this area.

00:11:13.574 --> 00:11:16.009
Hm? That's fine.

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.043
Yes, sir!

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.050
You sure about this?

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:25.151
Let him go.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.854
The boy is nothing
but a loyal pawn.

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:30.223
He'll never betray me.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:30.957
[chuckle]

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:36.396
(BORUTO)
What's up!

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:37.864
I'm here to borrow
some games.

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:40.166
(KATASUKE)
Young lord! Welcome!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.136
Please feel free to take
as many of these as you like.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:46.339
Wow! This one's the newest
limited edition!

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.407
Sweet!

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:51.344
That game's really great.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.746
I had to pull an all‐nighter

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:55.749
in order to finish
every level of it.

00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:57.784
You're amazing,
Mister Katasuke!

00:11:57.818 --> 00:11:59.853
When do you find time to work?

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.523
[chuckle]
I approach my work and play

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.591
with the same amount
of seriousness.

00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:06.059
Since I am a rational adult...

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:09.229
I am able to balance
everything I do perfectly.

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:11.598
Why at this very moment,
I'm revising

00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:14.535
the ninjitsu database
in its entirety.

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:18.204
I believe once every ninjutsu
is analyzed scientifically

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.206
then future generations
will be able to use

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.544
any jutsu they desire
with ease.

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:25.345
Really? Whoa...

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:28.114
Technology that can help
people lead better lives!

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:30.316
Solutions that work quickly
and cost less!

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.253
That's the type of science
I'm interested in!

00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:36.256
But of course,
reality never moves forward

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:38.759
quite as fast
as one wants it to.

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:39.960
Are you kidding?

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:41.161
You another one
of these people

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:43.396
who goes on and on
about reality?

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.899
Finding a way to make
reality work for you

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.969
is the core principal
of being an adult.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:49.970
Mhm!

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.674
‐ (TEMARI) Shikadai?
‐ [gasp]

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:54.975
Huh? Mom?!

00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:57.511
What're you doing
all the way out here?

00:12:57.544 --> 00:12:59.212
Oh...y'know...

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.481
Just waiting to
meet up with a friend.

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:02.849
Is it Boruto?

00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:05.686
He has absolutely no interest
in playing this.

00:13:05.719 --> 00:13:06.920
I see.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.522
Well, I've actually
got a mission,

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:09.756
so I'm heading out.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.324
I'll probably be late
coming home.

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:12.959
A mission?

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:16.029
Everyone who's ranked chunin
and above is being mobilized.

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:18.765
Thanks to the Byakuya Gang.

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:23.169
Oh... Moegi Sensei said
something about that too.

00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:25.572
Yeah... Well, dinner's
all ready for you.

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:26.940
You just gotta heat it up.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.875
Yeah, yeah,
I know the drill.

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:30.577
And don't you worry
about me.

00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:32.145
Just focus on your mission.

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.047
Don't be such a smart alec!

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:39.886
[chuckle]

00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:51.064
So what happened
the other day?

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:54.267
You been busy?

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:56.269
Sort of.

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.939
I guess it couldn't be helped.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.910
You are not gonna ask why?

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.848
Nah.
Things just happen.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:10.350
That move...

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:14.187
You used the same tactic
the last time too.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.991
I've been studying
this strategy a lot lately.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.660
Then I'll just make
this move here.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.662
That same play again?!

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.730
'Cause my decoy move
always works.

00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:25.331
You fall for it every time.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:26.466
Really?

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:29.469
Well, it's not like
I'm doing it on purpose.

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:30.937
Look at it again.

00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.106
You think you're protecting
the King over here.

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:34.941
That gives me
a lot of openings.

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:36.409
Huh? Like where?

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.310
Like here.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.079
(SHIKADAI) Oh...
Right there, huh?

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:40.847
I didn't even see it.

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:43.684
That's because you never
go on the offensive.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:44.951
Hmmm...

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.954
‐ [grunt]
‐ What?

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:49.455
You ended the game?

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:51.257
You could have still recovered
if you worked at it.

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.527
That would be a drag.
Never mind.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.097
(RYOGI)
Your moves surprise me.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.332
I thought you'd stick
to one strategy,

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.101
but you're quick to
change you tactics.

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:02.235
(SHIKADAI)
You think so?

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:03.870
(RYOGI)
You're so mature.

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:05.972
You don't ask
personal questions.

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:09.876
(SHIKADAI) I think prying
is just a drag, that's all.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.877
Hey...

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.378
Can I ask you a question?

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.848
(SHIKADAI) What's with
all the seriousness?

00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:16.016
What do you think
about this village?

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:17.350
Do you like it?

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.920
I think it's a comfortable
enough place.

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:21.387
Is that all?

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.090
The village has been
modernizing at a fast rate.

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:26.560
That must put a strain on
the people here.

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.929
Do you ever feel it?

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.597
I guess so.

00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:35.301
But stuff like that is really
such a drag. Ya know?

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:35.435
I see...

00:15:36.637 --> 00:15:39.840
Besides, there's nothing
I can really do about it.

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:41.074
[gasp]

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.275
I couldn't do anything

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:43.810
even if the strain
on the village

00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:45.145
caused huge problems.

00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:47.548
The only ones
with that kinda power

00:15:47.581 --> 00:15:48.615
are the adults.

00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:50.116
They could change things.

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:53.186
[exhale]

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.222
Hey... It's your move.

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:57.858
So the adults
have the power...

00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:00.160
[chuckle] We're still
only kids at this point.

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:01.895
Why try to do
what's impossible?

00:16:01.928 --> 00:16:03.163
It'll be a drag.

00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:05.065
What we should do

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:06.933
is just take care of
our own business

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.134
as best we can.

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:11.104
I guess you've
given these things

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.574
a lot more thought
than I have.

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:14.608
But you're right.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.843
I can see your point of view.

00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:18.078
I'm curious.

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.514
What do you think
about recent events?

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:21.982
You mean those robbers?

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:23.584
They're noble thieves.

00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:27.053
I can't sit here and pretend
I condone anybody stealing.

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:29.756
But I can't totally
condemn them either.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.891
You could say
they're a product

00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:32.926
of the times we live in.

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.428
Exactly. I knew you'd say
something like that.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.130
Most of the guys
I hang around with

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.533
don't really see it that way,
though.

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:40.934
I can understand.

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:42.603
I know how you feel.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:43.336
[chuckle]

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:45.371
[chuckle]

00:16:46.907 --> 00:16:48.542
There you are, Shikadai!

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:49.309
[gasp]

00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:50.744
Check this out!

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:51.745
Wow!

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:53.514
Is this the limited edition?

00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:54.881
Uh, and who's this?

00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:58.519
Uh, we're friends.
We only met recently.

00:16:58.552 --> 00:17:00.787
I didn't even catch
your name, did I...?

00:17:00.821 --> 00:17:02.222
Dude, what's up with that?

00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:05.659
Formal introductions
are always such a drag.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.493
Well, I'm Ryogi.

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:09.095
And I'm Shikadai.

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:10.731
And that's Boruto.

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:12.032
Nice to meet you!

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.671
Why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.306
You must have me confused
with someone else.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.076
I only arrived in this village
a little while ago.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.244
Oh, that's cool.

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:25.646
Oh man...
How'd you get this one?

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:27.147
Oh yeah...

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.650
I went and borrowed
all of them from Mr. Katasuke.

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.084
Are you serious?!

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:32.719
This Katasuke's amazing!

00:17:32.753 --> 00:17:33.754
I told ya!

00:17:33.787 --> 00:17:35.055
Oh...

00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:37.490
I'm sorry.
It's a rare limited edition,

00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:39.325
so I got a little
carried away.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:42.095
It's hard to believe
you can get carried away!

00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:43.496
Anyway, so are the things

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.832
this Mr. Katasuke
keeps in his lab

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:47.267
always this interesting?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.603
Well I'd call the majority
of it junk.

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:51.672
[chuckles]

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.141
Well, I'm off.

00:17:55.175 --> 00:17:56.877
I should probably
get going now.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.144
‐ Huh?
‐ What? Don't go!

00:17:58.178 --> 00:18:00.514
Stay and play
the game with us.

00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:01.548
Can't, sorry.

00:18:01.582 --> 00:18:03.016
You should both
make your way home

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:05.018
before it gets dark too.

00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:07.120
There's been a lot of
trouble lately.

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:08.789
Wait, hold on!

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:09.890
[flinching grunts]

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.124
It's freezing!

00:18:13.994 --> 00:18:14.695
Huh?!

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:26.607
[struggling]

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:29.643
You're late!

00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:30.811
I'm sorry.

00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:32.245
Did something happen?

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:35.015
There were Leaf genin
at the park.

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:35.949
Did you engage?

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:37.183
No.

00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:39.520
I didn't want to attract
any attention.

00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:42.255
We should avoid the park area
during our escape.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:45.191
Okay, understood.
Good job.

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:45.592
(RYOGI)
Sir!

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:50.263
(GEKKO)
Okay, it's time to move out!

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.166
[sigh] What a time
for Namida to be late.

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:54.768
Aren't there any jonin nearby?

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.605
[gasp] Oh no,
they're coming out!

00:18:58.639 --> 00:18:59.773
What do we do, Sumire?

00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:06.079
[gasp]

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.347
They're gonna get away!

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:09.449
[gasps]

00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:18.358
Wind Style...
Gale Raging Wall!

00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:20.827
[grunts]

00:19:20.861 --> 00:19:22.495
I'm sorry we got here late!

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:24.364
The three of you
stay back there.

00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:25.599
‐ Yes, Ma'am!
‐ Yes, Ma'am!

00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:30.771
Gale Raging Wall!

00:19:30.804 --> 00:19:31.805
You're not getting away!

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.740
Ice Style: Mangehyo!

00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:35.475
Tsk!

00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:39.345
Hold it!

00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:45.919
[gasp]

00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:46.553
Huh?

00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:48.689
It's you guys again!

00:19:49.956 --> 00:19:50.557
Come back!

00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:51.658
We can't!

00:19:51.692 --> 00:19:53.560
We don't have authorization
to engage!

00:19:53.594 --> 00:19:54.360
[grunt]

00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:55.295
(TEMARI)
You guys!

00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:57.430
Lend me a hand!

00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:58.665
[grunt]

00:19:58.699 --> 00:19:59.399
Huh? But we‐‐!

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:00.534
Create a diversion!

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:01.802
On it!

00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:03.637
Hey, shouldn't we just keep
an eye on the situation?

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:04.304
Boruto!

00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:05.806
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.576
Ice Style...Mangehyo!

00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:12.813
Oomph!

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.414
Shikadai! Shadow Paralysis!

00:20:14.447 --> 00:20:15.949
Huh?! From this distance?

00:20:15.982 --> 00:20:16.683
Tsk!

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.786
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:22.656
Woah!

00:20:24.257 --> 00:20:25.425
Let's grab him!

00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:28.294
‐ [gasp]
‐ Ah!

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:29.896
[worried groan]

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:30.664
Huh?

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:35.836
Did a man wearing a mask
just come through here?

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:38.071
Uh, yeah.
He went that way.

00:20:38.104 --> 00:20:39.506
Thank you very much.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.273
Let's go!

00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:44.310
Damn it!
Where did he go?

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.186
(TEMARI)
Does this mean he uses

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:55.989
jutsu we don't
even know about?

00:20:56.022 --> 00:20:57.290
So Shikadai...

00:20:57.323 --> 00:20:59.459
Why did you hesitate
to act back there?

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:01.127
Well, no...
I wasn't hesitating...

00:21:01.161 --> 00:21:02.596
I get it.

00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:05.031
You're very cautious
and it's your strong suit...

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:09.069
as long as you use it
at the right time and place.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.004
I was going to be
right there with you.

00:21:11.037 --> 00:21:12.272
You need to learn that

00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:14.440
sometimes it's okay
to take a risk.

00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:16.176
I know that already.

00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:17.443
Good grief...

00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:18.879
At this rate,
you're going to end up

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:21.047
letting the important things
pass you by.

00:21:21.081 --> 00:21:22.382
[sigh]

00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:24.685
(TEMARI) I'll go submit
the report now.

00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:26.820
Good work.
You all did a great job.

00:21:26.853 --> 00:21:29.222
We're so grateful
you came to our rescue.

00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:30.023
Thank you so much.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:34.828
[sigh] Guess we should
go home now, Shikadai.

00:21:34.861 --> 00:21:35.562
Shikadai?

00:21:37.163 --> 00:21:39.299
[sigh] I'm fine.
It's nothing.

00:21:44.237 --> 00:21:46.339
That certainly took you
long enough.

00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:47.173
I'm sorry.

00:21:47.207 --> 00:21:48.308
It's all right.

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.643
Because you were the decoy,

00:21:49.676 --> 00:21:52.445
the rest of us were able
to make a clean getaway.

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:54.781
You always do well by me, son.

00:21:54.815 --> 00:21:55.516
[satisfied sigh]

00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:58.451
Boss... It seems
we had some help

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.687
from a few special villagers.

00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:02.055
I see.

00:22:02.088 --> 00:22:05.391
Our philosophy has been
understood and accepted here.

00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:06.793
We'll now move forward

00:22:06.827 --> 00:22:09.530
and implement
the next part of our strategy.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.659
(SHIKADAI)
Checkmate.

00:23:45.692 --> 00:23:46.893
(RYOGI) You really got me
this time.

00:23:46.927 --> 00:23:47.994
Damn...

00:23:48.028 --> 00:23:50.330
I don't suppose
there are any take backs?

00:23:50.363 --> 00:23:51.565
(SHIKADAI)
Well, those are the rules.

00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:53.800
But I guess
I could consider it...

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:57.938
If you answer one question for
me completely and honestly.

00:23:57.971 --> 00:24:00.541
(RYOGI) What?
You'd be fine with just that?

00:24:00.574 --> 00:24:02.676
(SHIKADAI)
Yeah... You're...

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:06.212
(BORUTO) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:06.246 --> 00:24:07.981
"Memories from
the Day of Snow"

00:24:08.014 --> 00:24:09.716
(RYOGI) That's the place
where I belong.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.918
That's how I decided
to live my life,

00:24:11.952 --> 00:24:13.053
ever since that day.
