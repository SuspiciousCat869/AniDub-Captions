with.

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:33.113

my back on him!

I'm sorry to say, but I'm gonna
have to seal you away right now.

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:55.269
You know, the pictures that
you draw are pretty nice.

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:57.804
Make sure you draw a pretty one
of me, too!

00:13:57.838 --> 00:13:59.273

this?

Also...

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:20.060
I'm worried about Mitsuki's role
in this whole thing.

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:24.798
(DECISIVE) This situation calls
for quick action.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.602

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.839
We'd like you former Hokage...

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:34.107
to explain things to each
village...

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:36.610
...and get their approval for
the Leaf to intervene

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:38.045
in the Stone's affairs.

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:41.048
All right, sure. Just leave it
to us.

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:44.418
Although... the real problem's
the Feudal Lords...

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.954
That part is my job. I'll meet
personally with them...

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:49.656
and I'll convince them to
authorize us...

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.658
...to cross their borders.

00:14:51.692 --> 00:14:53.360
Judging from past experience...

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.496
getting permission such as that
could take quite a while.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.131
Even if you saw them right
away...

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.133
the official procedures and
what-not...

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:01.969
would still take several days.

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.370
Leaving Boruto and the others...

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:05.539
It'll be fine.

00:15:05.873 --> 00:15:07.774

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:09.476
No matter what it's gonna
take...

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.347
I'll make sure Lord Seventh gets
to the Stone quickly.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.650
I gotta say, it was the same
when I was Hokage...

00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:19.052
