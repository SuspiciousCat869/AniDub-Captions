WEBVTT

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:14.848
Mr. Kotaro! Please tell us
what happened!

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.349
They completely
cleaned us out.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.019
These guys made off with
every last jewel in the safe.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.187
Looks like the case
that you guys solved

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.124
was a well‐planned out
diversion just to distract us.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.759
Oh no!
Damn!

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:29.930
It's a group of guys who call
themselves "noble thieves."

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:30.831
The Byakuya Gang?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.965
They've been active

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.734
in several other villages
all over.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.235
They're anonymous.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:37.971
They leave no trace,
no matter where they've been.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.640
I'm about to investigate
the safe.

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.942
I wanna come with you
to check it out, sir!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.309
That's not a good idea.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.579
It's too cold in there
without proper clothing.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.446
I'll be fine.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.314
I've trained for
stuff like that.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.851
It's freezing in here!
[shivering]

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.485
It says they always keep
the temperature

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.954
at minus 20 degrees.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.255
If it goes up even one degree,

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.323
the alarm's programmed
to go off.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.459
It's near impossible
to steal things in here

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.595
without the sensors
picking it up.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.929
That's interesting.

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.731
Then that means
this whole operation

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.667
was most likely
an inside job.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.003
Yeah, we're investigating
from that angle as well.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.672
I sure hope Boruto's okay
in there.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:15.141
I imagine he must be shivering
his butt off right about now.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:19.846
[gasp]

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.350
All right!

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:07.153
Here's to successfully
clearing the tunnel!

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.555
You did such
an amazing job, Metal!

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.023
Thank you.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.426
I realized I am exceptionally
good at digging holes as well!

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.661
Well, you did put holes

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.030
in the Great Stone Faces
once upon a time.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.665
B‐But...back then...

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.966
I got s‐so nervous.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.701
I‐I didn't d‐do it
on p‐purpose!

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.135
Lemme guess.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.871
You're thinking about
the Byakuya Gang again.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:26.372
It's been five days.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.774
I don't feel much like
celebrating

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:30.210
until I can catch
those stupid bastards.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.012
(SHIKADAI)
Konohamaru Sensei warned you

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.214
not to take any action
on your own.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.883
Yeah, but I can't tell you
how frustrated I am!

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.418
Hey, what're "noble thieves"?

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:40.086
Well technically speaking,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.655
the definition of
"noble thieves,"

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.456
is a gang of guys
who steal from the rich

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.925
and give to the poor.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.459
Yeah, but stealing
is stealing,

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.128
no matter what excuse
you come up with.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.429
Right, Sarada?

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.998
Excuse me.
I'm trying to read my book.

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.433
Oh, boo hoo.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.168
What do you think, Shikadai?

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.070
(SHIKADAI) Oh, everybody
has their own reasons

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.404
for stealing, you know?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.342
There's more to the world
than what we see at home.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.110
And what they teach at
the Academy

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:06.179
is only theoretical.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.448
Maybe someday,
when we go on missions,

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.450
we'll have to face
the same thing.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:12.185
But I wouldn't know...

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.454
So what exactly
are you saying then?

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.189
I'm saying you shouldn't
just go around

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:18.324
defining things
in black and white.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.326
You sound like
a jaded old man!

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.962
Sitting over there acting
like you've seen it all!

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.329
It's true.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:24.965
I can't believe
you're the same age as us.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:25.566
I know, right?!

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:25.666
Hm.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.004
Ugh... That's enough already.
Let's not talk about me, okay?

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:34.074
I just wanna go with the flow.
I'm not looking to standout.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.308
I'm not like you.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.443
I don't necessarily wanna
go poking around

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.412
into stuff that's
none of my business.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:40.914
It is what it is.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:44.217
But I never get tired of
getting a piece of the action.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.952
All right already.

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:47.888
Can't you see I'm busy now?

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.122
(BORUTO)
What're you doing?

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:50.891
I'm playing a game
called shogi.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:53.527
My dad said if I figure out
this Shogi strategy,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.228
then he'll give me some money.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.497
But man, it's such a drag!

00:04:57.531 --> 00:05:00.100
So each one of those pieces
is a character?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.568
Yeah, you could say that.

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:04.037
What kind of items
do you get to use?

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.238
This game doesn't have any

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:07.674
ultimate moves or items,
actually.

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:10.176
What kind of game is that?
It sounds boring.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.044
[chuckle]

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.478
Hmmm...

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:14.681
Hey, why don't you move
this piece over here?

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:17.951
The Gold General can't move
diagonally or backwards.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.486
So all the moves are decided
ahead of time?

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.756
Can you shut up now?
You're so annoying.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:23.724
[gasp]

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.559
I think I just
figured it out.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.161
Where are you going?

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:29.195
What'd you figure out?

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.731
(SARADA)
Just come with me!

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:31.765
[grunt]

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.303
They're always doing things
on the spur of the moment.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.673
Where do they get
their motivation from anyway?

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.842
It is because they are in
the springtime of youth!

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.176
Ya really think so?

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.145
Hold on...
You're leaving too, Shikadai?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.381
Yeah. I'm stuck, so I'm gonna
try to rethink things

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:49.883
by moving to another spot.

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:54.688
What am I holding
in my hand?

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:55.822
It's a flower?

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:58.291
The correct answer is
"a frozen flower."

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.526
It was in front of
the bank safe.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.961
I've been thinking...

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:03.496
How is it possible that
a flower outside the safe

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.831
was able to stay frozen?

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:07.400
And that's when I suddenly
remembered this.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:08.669
(BORUTO)
Ice Style?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.504
(MITSUKI) You mean...
an Ice jutsu?

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.805
(SARADA)
You're both aware that

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:15.208
we use five styles
of ninjutsu, right?

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.677
Fire,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.044
Water,

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:19.279
Earth,

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.080
Lightning,

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.447
and Wind.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.216
Look, if I wanted a lesson,
I'd go to school.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.718
Hang on.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:27.453
But there are other
styles of jutsu in the world.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:28.989
There's jutsu
that is passed on

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:30.356
only to certain clans.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.326
Those jutsu are the ones
called Kekkei Genkai.

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:35.128
Is that similar to
the Sharingan

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.229
of the Uchiha Clan?

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:37.463
Mhm.

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.533
And the Ice Style
seems to be a rare jutsu

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:40.801
that's used by shinobi

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:43.369
whose roots come from
the Land of Snow.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.605
I get what you're saying.

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:46.372
Maybe whoever used
the Ice Style

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.841
is able to bring
their body temperature

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.743
down to minus 20 degrees,
right?

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.745
That's an astute observation.

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.514
And that's the reason
the thermal sensors

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:55.415
didn't go off in the safe.

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.483
Plus, if the suspect used
the Ice Style

00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:58.819
before they even entered
the safe,

00:06:58.852 --> 00:06:59.986
it would explain

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.488
how the flower got frozen
in the first place.

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:04.791
We have to let Mr. Kotaro know
right away.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.093
Hold on a second.
Don't you remember?

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:09.229
The missions that involve
confronting shinobi

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.463
are B‐ranked.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.232
Genin like us
can only participate

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.867
in missions up to C‐rank.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.702
So if you're gonna go report
this information,

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.037
we'll be the stupid suckers

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.272
who get completely
left out of the loop.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:20.541
Are you saying
we should pretend

00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:22.242
that we don't know
any of this?

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.610
You got a problem with that?

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:25.045
It's a great idea.

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:25.746
Then it's decided.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:26.880
All right,

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.782
do you have any info
on where these guys are?

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.651
Honestly, I don't have a clue.

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:33.153
Well then, why did you go and
get our hopes up so high?

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.021
It's too hard with just this.

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.590
We could ask Shino Sensei.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.525
He might know something
about Ice Style.

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:39.926
Except if we go to him,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.494
then he'll figure out
that we were trying to

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:43.463
take on the shinobi
all by ourselves.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.265
There must be somebody
we can rely on

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.900
to help us figure this out.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:50.303
I do have one person in mind,
but I don't know about him.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.838
He's kinda strange.

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:54.575
Today is the day when
I'll take a giant step forward

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.777
in ninjutsu research!

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.511
Oomph!

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.114
Wha‐‐?

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.683
Oh...uh...

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:05.652
Oh, well, gee,
that was really embarrassing.

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:07.187
You see I was
experimenting with

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.789
being able to
go through a wall.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:11.324
But as you can see,
I'm still a little ways off.

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.759
How do you know
this guy again?

00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:15.128
He's an old acquaintance
who hangs around my dad.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.462
He does "weird research"

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.632
and invites himself over
to the house a lot.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.768
Oh...Young Lord.

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:24.370
I just have a passion
for innovation is all.

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:26.072
But every time he comes over
to our house,

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:28.642
he manages to slip me
the newest game software.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.376
(KATASUKE)
Speaking of which, Young Lord,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.945
I got a hold of another one!

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:32.646
Really?!

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.515
Did he say Young Lord?

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:35.415
Hey, Boruto...

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:36.382
Huh?

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:37.618
Uh, oh yeah...

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:40.320
We have an important
question for you.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.422
Do you know anything
about Ice Style?

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.456
Last time...

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:46.026
[chattering]

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:47.360
[yawn]

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:48.595
A paper bomb?

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:50.664
Yeah, I found it in
my dad's room!

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.102
[laughing]
This could be fun!

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:57.504
So what're you gonna do?

00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:00.507
Just watch me.
Don't you move!

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:01.908
[gasp]

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:03.343
Ah!

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.277
[pained grunt]

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:05.746
Ouch! That hurt!

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:06.947
Then why don't you stop

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.949
pulling stupid pranks
like that?

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:09.716
Hm?

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.117
[pained groans and crying]

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:13.587
Wait here. I'll go and
get some ice for you.

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:18.058
Let's go.

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:19.660
Yes.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.631
If one were to use
Ice Style jutsu...

00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.900
it's absolutely possible
to sneak into a safe

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.369
without ever triggering
the alarm's sensors!

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.237
Yes that's what we suspected.

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:34.374
A gang of thieves who
use Ice Style jutsu?!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.241
How interesting!

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.577
Do you have any idea

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.545
where thieves like that
might hang out?

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.981
I'm not sure if this will be
any help, but...

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:45.619
I do know of one place that
might provide a few clues.

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:46.620
I didn't know there was
something like this

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:48.121
in the village.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:50.924
I'm not surprised that
you didn't know, Young Lord.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:54.728
Usually villages have several
undiscovered sides to them.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.997
(MITSUKI) There are a lot of
interesting things here,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.633
(KATASUKE) This is just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.802
This village has
a black market where items

00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:05.371
that can never be made public
are bought and sold.

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:06.840
Due to the nature of my work,

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.909
sometimes,
I come down here and visit.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:12.212
Recently, I found
a peculiar posting.

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:13.680
This is a message board

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:16.783
strictly for those
who wish to barter secretly.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.552
(MITSUKI)
It's not just graffiti?

00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:19.853
No look.

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:21.722
This section is looking
for a buyer

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.157
of the stolen jewels
that you're searching for.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.827
The trade is set for
tomorrow afternoon.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.461
That's gotta be
our perpetrator.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:31.264
How about if we pretend to be
the buyer of the jewels

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.766
and then,
we can ambush them?!

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.434
Damn Byakuya Gang!

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.069
I'm gonna get
those guys for sure!

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.672
Oh... Here's the part
I've been looking for!

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:41.141
The elusive Kagemasa
Limited Edition Doll

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:43.243
is for sale down here,
Young Lord!

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:48.414
[chattering and giggles]

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.353
Damn it, really?
This strategy's all wrong.

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:55.121
I'm really in a rut now.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.958
I can't think it through
all by myself anymore.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.260
(RYOGI) Hey...

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:00.360
Huh?!

00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:03.363
I think you might've
dropped this.

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:05.098
Oh...

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:08.569
Now I see,
I was missing a piece.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:09.435
Thanks a lot!

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:09.736
Mm.

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:12.138
I...uh, watched
how you saved

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.374
that boy earlier today
in the village.

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.009
Oh, back there?

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:18.879
Yeah, that was
kind of embarrassing.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.480
Why is that embarrassing?

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:21.815
You were just
trying to help him.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.249
It's not a big deal.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.620
This game you're playing
is really ancient.

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:27.821
[sigh]

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.155
How come you're playing alone?

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.824
You don't have any friends
to play with?

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.893
Are you always this impolite?

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:33.794
(RYOGI)
What do you mean?

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:35.095
I guess if you're someone

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:37.430
who makes snide remarks
all the time,

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:40.466
then you can protect yourself
from getting hurt.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.467
Humph.

00:11:41.502 --> 00:11:42.736
Can't argue with that.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.039
So the rules are that

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:48.742
each piece can only make
certain moves, right?

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:51.477
Yeah, but I'm sure you're
gonna say it's boring.

00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:52.078
No I'm not.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.048
I think
it's pretty interesting.

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:55.782
Hm?

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:03.524
They say shogi without pawns
is a loser's game.

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:05.559
But even
the weakest‐looking pawn...

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.360
should never be disregarded.

00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:09.930
So it looks like every pawn

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:11.832
is there to protect
the King, huh?

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.735
They only have one purpose
and that's to serve him.

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:16.970
You bet. That's the name of
the game all right.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:20.541
How 'bout this?
Checkmate.

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:23.076
Wait a minute.
Are you kidding me?

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.512
How do I get out from
under you now?

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:29.082
Well, aren't you the King?

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:32.018
Yeah and the game is over
if the King is taken.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:35.288
So you're absolutely correct.

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.289
Then I guess I'm a pawn.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.658
A pawn who makes it

00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:40.160
into enemy territory
is called an upstart,

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:42.195
and gets promoted to
a Gold General.

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.096
(RYOGI)
Hmmm...

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.965
So it turns into
another piece?

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:46.600
It's not just the pawn.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.702
The Silver General
and the Knight too...

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:51.171
They can all become
Gold Generals.

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:52.138
I see.

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:53.273
Well...

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:53.940
checkmate.

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:56.176
No way, seriously?!

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:57.544
[chuckle]

00:12:57.578 --> 00:12:59.546
No do‐overs
in this game, right?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.181
No, but we could play again.

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.727
What is that piece?
I can't tell.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.861
Do you have a Rook?

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:16.229
(RYOGI)
The Silver General.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:19.265
Time to quit!
I can't even see the pieces.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.502
Oh yeah,
it's gotten really dark, huh?

00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:22.936
I usually play with my dad,

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.706
but every time we play,
he always wins.

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:27.741
So today was kinda fun.

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:30.343
Sounds like your father's
good at this game.

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:31.712
What does he do?

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:33.379
He's an aide to the Hokage.

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:37.818
Oh that's pretty cool.

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:38.885
You can have this.

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.053
Are you sure?

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:42.523
Yeah, I have more
at home anyway.

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:43.690
Keep practicing really hard.

00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:45.025
And then...

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:47.060
If you want,
we can play again tomorrow.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:50.030
[chuckle]

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:55.836
I'm home.

00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:59.906
Oh, you're back
unusually early.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.575
I gotta eat dinner
with my family

00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:03.409
once in a while, don't I?

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:04.144
[chuckle]

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.112
[humming]

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.081
Huh?

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.054
Ah...

00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:15.121
Hi, Dad.

00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:16.723
I see you're finally
getting serious

00:14:16.757 --> 00:14:18.592
about learning how to
play the game, huh?

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.360
No, I'm just messing around.

00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:27.901
You seem rather happy.

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:29.503
‐ Huh?
‐ Did something happen?

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:30.904
Not really.

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:34.808
Anyway, can you teach me
some new board tactics?

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:36.476
Let's see...

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.913
It's a little too soon
to teach you Climbing Silver.

00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:42.082
Don't be stingy Dad.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:44.918
By the way, did I hear
something about Boruto

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:46.219
being up to
his old tricks again?

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.621
Beats me.

00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:50.824
I saw him and Mitsuki earlier
buying some weird clothes.

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:51.825
Oh yeah?

00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:53.226
Now that sounds exactly like

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:56.563
something his old man
would do back in the day.

00:14:56.597 --> 00:14:58.932
I get it now.
Very good.

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:01.968
Climbing Silver uses soldiers
to attack the enemy.

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:04.571
Back when I was
a snotty‐nosed little kid...

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:06.239
Dinner's ready, guys!

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.441
So you gotta remember
that sacrifice

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:10.310
is the price you pay
to protect the King

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:12.846
from an opponent who is
much better than you are.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.247
Gotcha...

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.282
Did you hear me?
Dinner's ready.

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:19.419
I remember how much I hated
to learn strategies like this

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:20.353
when I was your age.

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:21.421
Mhm.

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:21.522
Humph!

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:25.592
But lemme tell ya,
one day my Sensei said‐‐

00:15:25.626 --> 00:15:27.594
[gasp]
Ah! Dad?!

00:15:27.628 --> 00:15:28.361
Huh?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.467
I said, dinner's ready,
damn it!

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.703
‐ Ahhh!
‐ Ahhh!

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.448
Good, you're right on time.

00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:49.550
The gold is in here.

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:54.588
I brought the gold
just like I promised.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:58.024
Before I hand it over, let me
see the goods you brought.

00:15:58.058 --> 00:16:00.026
Toss the bag over here.

00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:02.462
First, hand over the jewels.

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:05.098
We can cancel this
at any moment, you know.

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:10.336
Sarada! Right now!

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:14.140
[struggling]

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.879
Boruto Uzumaki of Team 7
is here! Look out!

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.781
I wouldn't make a fuss
if I were you.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.082
Now hand over those jewels!

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:23.517
‐ [struggling]
‐ [gasp]

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.685
[gasp]

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:25.418
[gasp]

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.490
Wind Style: Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:38.865
Don't move...
If you do, that man will die.

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:40.066
[gasps]

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:42.035
(SARADA)
Paper Bombs!

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:44.538
I was being threatened
by them...

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.606
I was set up!

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.973
Looks like the Byakuya Gang

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.543
are lowlifes that really
like to play dirty.

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:50.911
Same goes for you.

00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:52.879
Why do you always side
with the rich?

00:16:52.913 --> 00:16:53.179
Huh?

00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:57.050
Our operation is nothing
but charitable.

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:59.786
We take from the rich
and give to the poor.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.955
That is our grand
and noble mission!

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:03.223
You steal from people,

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:05.191
then turn around and
call it noble?!

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:07.293
The rich themselves
are thieves

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:09.630
who've stolen happiness
from the poor,

00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:11.231
all for their own greed!

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:13.834
That is the dumbest excuse
I've ever heard!

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:14.768
Oh really?

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:16.069
I guess it's too hard

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:18.505
for a spoiled Leaf brat
to understand.

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.907
If you want the jewels
that much...

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:22.208
you can have them.

00:17:24.578 --> 00:17:25.478
[gasp]

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:26.747
[grunting]

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.714
[gasp]

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:28.481
Huh?

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:31.251
Follow him!

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:43.997
That's so strange.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.867
How come he didn't use
those Paper Bombs?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.334
I have no idea.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.103
And look at
these frozen tracks.

00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:51.738
It's like he left
an invitation

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:52.739
for us to follow him.

00:17:52.773 --> 00:17:54.007
You think it's a trap?

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.242
(BORUTO) Even if it is,
we've got to go!

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.287
(SARADA)
Look!

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.389
It's some kind of
equipment to draw water.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.858
(MITSUKI)
I wonder if it's broken.

00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:12.859
Looks like it.

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:18.799
Keep your guard up.

00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:41.655
[chattering]

00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:42.956
Something's strange here.

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:43.690
Mm.

00:18:46.593 --> 00:18:47.628
Listen up!

00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:50.296
Did a guy in a scary mask
just come by?!

00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:55.368
‐ Ah! My legs!
‐ Damn!

00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:57.571
(RYOJI) Take a good look
around you, Boruto Uzumaki.

00:18:57.604 --> 00:18:59.072
[gasps]

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:01.341
This village is
high above ground.

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:04.077
Can you understand how
precious water is here?

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.546
The only way to get it
is to draw it

00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:07.681
from the river below
with a water wheel!

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:08.615
What're you talking about?

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:09.883
Unfortunately,

00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:12.786
the water wheel broke down
from being used too much.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.220
As a result,

00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:16.489
the villagers have to walk
three hours one way

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:18.792
just to get drinking water.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:21.494
You live in the city,
without a care in the world.

00:19:21.528 --> 00:19:23.697
Bet you can't
even imagine this.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.232
How come they don't fix
the water wheel then?

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:28.101
Do you think a poor village
like this one

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.504
can afford the cost of
fixing it?!

00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:31.037
[gasp]

00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:32.372
Humph.

00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:34.608
I'll let you in on
something interesting.

00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:36.977
Those jewels are no longer
in my possession.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.845
Then where are they?!

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:40.046
[gasp]

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.583
Hey, the water wheel
started working!

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:44.250
Don't you get it?

00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:46.887
The jewels that were just
locked away in the safe

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.791
became the funds to repair
the village water wheel!

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:51.792
[gasp]

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:00.066
[chattering]

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.334
[gasp]

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.403
Mommy, is there enough
water for us?

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.138
Don't worry, sweetheart.

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:09.309
Try taking your jewels
back now, Boruto Uzumaki!

00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:13.714
Uh...?

00:20:13.747 --> 00:20:14.981
Boruto, what's going on?

00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:22.923
[chattering]

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.226
I've been looking
all over for ya!

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:29.996
I told you not to take
any action on your own.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.565
Big Bro Konohamaru...

00:20:31.598 --> 00:20:32.566
I couldn't...

00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:34.768
Don't worry about
the jewelry heist.

00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:38.038
All of the losses will be
fully covered by insurance.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.173
So don't give it
another thought.

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:42.943
I know that I can
do better next time.

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:44.410
Listen to me, Boruto...

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:46.312
You don't have enough
experience under your belt

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:47.681
to get depressed over

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:50.283
one or two missions
that happened to fail.

00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:51.685
Don't forget that.

00:20:51.718 --> 00:20:52.719
[sigh]

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:56.823
(GEKKO)
You're late.

00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:01.194
So your plan was
to use the jewels

00:21:01.227 --> 00:21:04.297
as a lure to get money
from foolish rich people?

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.300
I wanted to help
as many people as I could,

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:08.802
just like you.

00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:10.804
Yet, you failed miserably.

00:21:10.837 --> 00:21:11.538
[gasp]

00:21:12.973 --> 00:21:15.141
Your desire is noble...

00:21:15.175 --> 00:21:16.610
But don't be impatient.

00:21:16.643 --> 00:21:18.478
I'm already working
on my next plan.

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:19.813
[gasp]

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:22.849
And we're depending on
the strategy you came up with.

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:26.887
I have guard duty.
Excuse me.

00:21:30.924 --> 00:21:34.795
[exhale] He's gotten a little
too big for his britches.

00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:47.473
Hm?

00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:49.275
Uh...

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.411
Are you playing
all by yourself?

00:21:51.444 --> 00:21:53.814
I'd be happy to play a game
or two with you.

00:21:53.847 --> 00:21:55.115
No, it's okay.

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:56.983
I'm actually
waiting for someone.

00:21:57.017 --> 00:21:58.652
Ah, I see...

00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:00.721
I'm sorry to bother you then.

00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:01.755
[chuckle]

00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.862
I guess I should've asked
his name at least.

00:23:46.459 --> 00:23:47.393
(BORUTO) Huh?!
It's you guys again!

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:48.228
Come back!

00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:48.529
(SHIKADAI) We can't.

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:51.832
We don't have authorization
to engage!

00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:53.867
(TEMARI)
You guys, lend me a hand!

00:23:55.502 --> 00:23:57.137
Just create a diversion!

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.505
(SHIKADAI)
Huh?!

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:00.941
Shouldn't we just keep
an eye on the situation?

00:24:00.974 --> 00:24:04.277
(BORUTO) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.946
"Shikadai's Doubts"

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:07.514
(TEMARI) At this rate,
you'll end up letting

00:24:07.548 --> 00:24:09.650
the important things
pass you by.
