WEBVTT

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.285
And, there! Done!

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:18.920
<i>(Boruto) The shadow I saw</i>
<i>kinda looked like this!</i>

00:00:19.388 --> 00:00:20.756
[stunned]

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.558
When it happened
to Shino Sensei...

00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:25.661
he said it felt like he was
being controlled the whole
time, right?

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:26.295
Uh huh.

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.664
So that must mean...

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:31.333
There's someone behind
this pulling the strings?

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:33.502
Although, then it
would be unusual...

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:36.638
for the person being
controlled to have a
memory of what happened.

00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:40.842
Besides, controlling
someone is usually done
for a purpose, right?

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.245
Yeah, you'd think so.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:49.485
But so far, all people
did was go on rampages.

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:53.455
And that's why I'm wondering
if this is just some kind of
illness.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.457
But if that's so...

00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:56.925
The fact that you're the
only one who can see it...

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.728
just doesn't seem
to make sense! [sigh]

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.796
[sigh]

00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:02.531
<i>(Sarada) Damn it...</i>

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:05.834
Now we've wasted so much time
thanks to Boruto and those other
guys!

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.804
Well, maybe they had some
kind of emergency.

00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:11.707
Please! Don't let
them fool you.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.810
I guarantee you that all they
wanted to do was get out of
cleaning duty!

<i>[slow, creepy heavy breathing]</i>

00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:21.850

those losers? Let's go and get
<i>something sweet to eat!</i>

[slow, creepy heavy breathing]

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.022
Sweet treats from all over the
world are waiting for us!

00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:28.390
Yay!

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:29.325
Huh?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.929
What's wrong,
Miss Class Rep?

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.368
Oh... Well, uh...I thought I
felt someone watching me.

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:42.371
Hm. I don't see anyone
around here, so...

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:43.539
Sorry! [sheepish

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:46.875
Hm?

[frightened gasp]

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.378

[worried sighing]

00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:44.826
You guys. isn't it obvious that
I'm wasting away?!

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.495
Uh...I guess so?

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:48.664
She's been like this
ever since it started.

00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:51.600
What?! Are you telling us that
you're still being stalked?

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:55.504
We can sense someone watching
but we never see them.

00:03:56.972 --> 00:03:59.608
[chewing]

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:03.178
I'm so anxious, I haven't been
able to eat properly.

00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:04.145
[sighs]

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:07.383
Stalkers are totally sticky,
just like natto!

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:12.621
And I really, really hate it!
They just won't leave me alone
and in peace, whoever they are!

00:04:12.654 --> 00:04:15.991
But next time, I'm gonna find
him and get him for sure!

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.026
Is this another incident?

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:22.230
No way. Come on, it's not
as if everything's gonna
lead to a rampage now.

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.099
Hmm.

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:26.935

<i>(Cho‐Cho) Ugh, I hate this!</i>

00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:35.477
I can't believe that I actually
ran out of potato chips!

00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:38.280
I thought you were having
problems eating properly.

00:04:38.314 --> 00:04:39.114

[gasp] Oh!

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:47.155
Mugwort and Sweet
Red Bean Paste, huh?

00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:50.125
Hmm.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.228
Sure, why not?

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:57.333

Ugh! Too sweet!

00:05:04.072 --> 00:05:06.408
Why on earth did you
buy that flavor?

00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:08.744
It may know it sucks, but
even so...

00:05:08.777 --> 00:05:12.848
it's still trying to compete
against all those other chips as
a new product.

00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.716
No one's even considered
buying it.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.719
It's been ignored and shoved
to the corner of the lowest
shelf.

00:05:17.753 --> 00:05:21.957
That's exactly why I had to
accept its challenge, fair and
square.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.692
[crunch] So sweet!

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:25.927
Uh...
Sure thing.

00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:28.964
You think he'll show
up again today?

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:33.234
Well...sticky guys like that do
tend to show up in deserted
places like this.

[gasp]
[gasp]

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.904
So, you are here!

(Shikadai) What was
that scream about?

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:46.181
(Boruto) It came from close by!

Cho‐Cho! Hey! You don't have to
be so violent!

00:05:57.826 --> 00:05:58.627
What?

00:06:03.131 --> 00:06:04.165
<i>(Boruto) Huh?</i>

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.168
So this is the guy you've
been talking about?

00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:08.036
That's right.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:09.004

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:09.738
Huh?

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.206
Wait, come to
think of it, you're...

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.742
You know this guy?

00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:17.413
(Cho‐Cho) I'm pretty sure he's
Magire from the class next door.

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:21.717
There aren't that many handsome
guys in the Academy, so I'd say
he actually ranks near the top.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.420
I can't believe he was really
following you.

00:06:24.453 --> 00:06:25.321
Hm.

00:06:26.822 --> 00:06:28.590
Boruto, does this guy have...?

00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:30.926
Nah, I don't see
anything around him.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:33.862
And I don't sense anything
weird coming from him, either.

00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:34.663
Okay.

00:06:35.063 --> 00:06:37.833
But still...

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:41.303
We can't just let him off
the hook that easily, ya know.
[sigh]

00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:45.741
All right! Why would you do
something like this?

00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:46.675

Ah, silent treatment, huh?

00:06:57.386 --> 00:07:01.056
But seriously. What are you
doing following Cho‐Cho around?

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:02.924
You have really
strange taste.

00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.893
[giggle] Oh, my!

00:07:04.926 --> 00:07:10.832
I totally understand why you
would want to follow me around,
but I'm so, so sorry.

00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:14.836
You and I, well, we're just like
macaroons and natto.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.104
We're just in different
leagues.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:17.806
No! You're wrong!

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:22.210
The person I'm following...is
Miss Sumire!

00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:25.247
Oh, no!

00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.082
What?! The Class Rep?!

00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:29.451
So that means the
one he likes is...

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:31.019

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:40.061
Well! Great! It seems my plan to
get him to confess the truth...

00:07:40.095 --> 00:07:42.130
was a complete and total
success, then!

00:07:42.163 --> 00:07:43.231
Yeah, right!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.670
Well, in any case, you
took all of this way too far.

00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:52.207
But, what else was I
supposed to do, then?

00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:53.909
I‐‐I just...

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:58.880
All that I really wanted to do
was breathe the same air as
Sumire!

So, are we all done here? I'll
just be on my way...

00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:07.623
No we're just getting
started, pal!

00:08:07.656 --> 00:08:10.225
Actually, this may
be your big chance.

W‐‐ What are‐‐?!
Are you serious?!

00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:22.904
If you tell her how you feel
right now, then I'll forgive you
for what you've been doing.

00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:24.205
And maybe even...

Please! Will you
go out with me?!

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.775

I'm sorry!

did it 'cause you told me to!

Wow, I really can't
believe that she'd
be so cruel.

Listen. Here, have one of these.
Cheer up, okay?

00:09:31.273 --> 00:09:32.408
Huh?

You never really know what's
going to happen until you step
up to the challenge, right?

(Mitsuki) Boruto... Apparently,
<i>you‐know‐who was absent today.</i>

00:10:53.322 --> 00:10:54.390
Huh?!

00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:55.457
No one's seen him.

00:10:56.124 --> 00:10:57.293
That can't be!

00:10:57.326 --> 00:11:00.296
My intuition's never
wrong. I'm sure it was him!

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:01.563
What's that?

00:11:02.197 --> 00:11:03.432
(Everyone) Huh?

00:11:11.307 --> 00:11:12.541
[gasp]

00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:21.082
Eww! He's lost it.

00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:24.320
Pretty sure that guy's the only
one that would have done this.

00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:27.456
Yeah, you're right about that.
Although...

00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:29.625
<i>(Cho‐Cho) How did he do it?</i>

00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:40.336
Damn it, where do you
think he could be now?

00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:41.437
Don't worry.

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:44.573
As long as the Class Rep's
not alone, it'll be fine.

00:11:47.075 --> 00:11:48.310
Huh?

00:11:48.344 --> 00:11:50.178
What the‐‐?! What is this?!

00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:51.012
[gasp]

00:11:51.046 --> 00:11:52.514
This guy's serious.

00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:53.549
<i>(Boruto) You okay?</i>

00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:55.451
<i>[grunt] Damn it!</i>

00:11:55.484 --> 00:11:57.152
<i>(Mitsuki) It's pretty solid.</i>

00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:58.720
It might be dangerous
to stay here!

00:11:58.754 --> 00:11:59.421
Let's go.

00:11:59.455 --> 00:12:01.390
[worried panting]

00:12:01.423 --> 00:12:02.624
(Shikadai) Hey! Wait, you guys!

00:12:11.066 --> 00:12:14.270
I don't think he'll
find us in here. Do you?

00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:17.573
<i>(Cho‐Cho) We ran super far, so</i>
<i>I'm sure we'll be fine.</i>

00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:20.175
[sighs]

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:24.246
[coughing]

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.447
What's going on?!

00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:27.283
I can't see anything!

00:12:27.316 --> 00:12:32.120
[coughing]

00:12:32.153 --> 00:12:33.455
I‐‐ I'll open the door!

00:12:33.489 --> 00:12:34.390
[door sliding]

00:12:34.423 --> 00:12:37.659
[panting and coughing]

00:12:38.494 --> 00:12:40.762
Hey, you guys! It's this
way!

00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:41.463
[slam]

00:12:41.497 --> 00:12:42.498
[gasp]

00:12:42.531 --> 00:12:43.599
<i>(Sarada) Huh?! Where?!</i>

00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:44.500
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Ouch!</i>

00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:46.702
Sarada! Cho‐Cho!

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:49.004
<i>(Sarada) Hold on!</i>

00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:51.907
Huh?

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.343
Hey! Miss Class Rep!
What's going on?!

00:12:54.376 --> 00:12:56.077
Oh! Denki!

00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.745
Are you oka‐‐?

00:12:56.778 --> 00:12:57.546
[grunt]

00:12:58.447 --> 00:12:59.648
Oof!

00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.683
[gasp]

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.452
[chuckling]

00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:05.354
Finally, we're
alone together...

00:13:05.387 --> 00:13:06.522
[gasp]

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:10.158
<i>(Magire) [heavy</i>
<i>breathing</i>]

00:13:10.191 --> 00:13:13.695
<i>(Cho‐Cho) [coughing]</i>

00:13:15.831 --> 00:13:16.465
We made it!

00:13:16.498 --> 00:13:18.634
Denki! What
happened?

00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:20.669
[pained grunts]

00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:22.538
Is that guy behind
this, too?!

00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:24.906
He's totally out
of control.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.442
Hey, where's
the Class Rep?

00:13:26.475 --> 00:13:28.143
Sorry.

00:13:28.176 --> 00:13:29.745
<i>(Sumire) [scream]</i>

00:13:30.211 --> 00:13:31.112
That was her!

<i>(Sumire) Stop! Don't</i>
<i>come near me!</i>

00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:37.218
Just what is it about me you
don't like, Sumire?

00:13:37.553 --> 00:13:38.720
[whimper]

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:42.758
All right! This has
gone far enough!

00:13:43.492 --> 00:13:45.394
You okay, Class Rep?

00:13:45.427 --> 00:13:47.629
I knew that you
were behind all
of this!

00:13:47.663 --> 00:13:50.165
Could you not
bother us right now?

00:13:50.198 --> 00:13:53.068
We finally have a
chance to be together.

00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:56.272
<i>(Boruto) Wait, that's‐‐!</i>

00:13:57.873 --> 00:13:58.774
[grunt]

00:14:00.342 --> 00:14:02.077
I see that shadow again.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.146
Yesterday, you said he
didn't have anything
around him!

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.949
Yeah, I know I did, but
it's there right now.

00:14:07.983 --> 00:14:10.586
So he may start rampaging
at any moment.

00:14:13.355 --> 00:14:18.026
Listen up natto guy! I'm
gonna flatten you. You
understand what I'm saying?

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:22.731
Sit tight, Sumire. I'm gonna
get rid of these guys for us
right now, okay?

00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:26.368
Watch out!

00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:29.738
Thanks for
that, Sarada!

00:14:30.572 --> 00:14:31.640
Hey, you!

00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:34.142
Boruto, what now?!

00:14:34.175 --> 00:14:36.478
I guess we're just gonna
have to knock him out.

00:14:36.512 --> 00:14:37.679
Hey!

00:14:38.213 --> 00:14:38.780
Hm?

00:14:41.717 --> 00:14:43.652
Fine, we'll take you on.

00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:46.187
[gasp] Boruto!

00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:50.459
<i>All right. What'll you</i>
<i>do this time, Boruto?</i>

00:14:50.492 --> 00:14:52.628
Now get away from the
Class Rep!

00:14:53.295 --> 00:14:56.998
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:14:57.032 --> 00:15:01.803
Shut up!! Don't interfere with
me and Sumire!

00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:05.641
Disguise jutsu!

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:07.409
He's gone?!

00:15:07.443 --> 00:15:08.344
I see.

00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:11.280
He must have used this
ninjutsu when he wrote
on the class blackboard.

00:15:13.048 --> 00:15:16.718
<i>(Magire) Sumire is the only</i>
<i>one who can truly see me!</i>

00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:18.687
[gasp]

00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:23.559
<i>(Magire) There's no way</i>
<i>that you guys can see me.</i>

00:15:23.592 --> 00:15:24.560
Where is he?!

00:15:24.593 --> 00:15:25.461
Damn it.

00:15:25.494 --> 00:15:25.761
Whoa!

00:15:26.595 --> 00:15:28.397
That's what happens
without a plan!

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.931
[grunts]

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:32.668
Boruto!

00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:34.836
Quickly! We need a plan!

00:15:35.671 --> 00:15:36.838
[grunts]

00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:44.313
(Magire) I never stood out from
<i>the crowd. But Sumire was</i>
<i>different than the others!</i>

00:15:44.346 --> 00:15:46.047
She came over and talked to me!

00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:49.385
<i>Me! She actually talked to</i>
<i>someone like me!</i>

00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:51.387
[grunt]

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.388
Damn!

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:56.191
[sigh]

00:15:56.625 --> 00:16:03.399
[grunts]

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:06.402
[deep inhale]

00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:08.937
Hey, you! That's enough!

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:09.905
Huh?

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.278
Do you actually believe that
doing this is the best way to
win the Class Rep's heart?

00:16:16.312 --> 00:16:18.847
Hey, listen Cho‐Cho! Be
careful with this guy!

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.752
Sneaking around and doing
stuff like this isn't gonna
get a lady to notice you.

00:16:26.655 --> 00:16:29.325
The reason I picked
these gross chips...

00:16:29.358 --> 00:16:33.395
was because they'd been
sitting on the shelves just
about forever.

00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:35.431
What? Po‐‐
Potato chips?!

00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:41.370
But you...you've just hidden
yourself away and you aren't
even on the shelf right now.

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:45.541
Even these potato chips are
stepping up to the challenge!

00:16:45.574 --> 00:16:49.345
But you've totally removed
yourself from the "romance
shelf!"

00:16:49.378 --> 00:16:52.581
<i>(Magire) I did step up</i>
<i>to the challenge! But</i>
<i>it didn't work!</i>

00:16:52.614 --> 00:16:53.449
Hm?

00:16:54.983 --> 00:16:55.817
<i>(Magire) So there's no reason</i>
<i>to go back on any shelf!</i>

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.759
<i>Before now, nobody else</i>
<i>had ever really noticed me!</i>

00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:06.428
No, you're wrong
about that.

00:17:06.462 --> 00:17:10.366
They've noticed. I
doubt you've been
able to hide.

00:17:10.399 --> 00:17:12.334
[angry grunts]

00:17:12.368 --> 00:17:15.504
<i>You can't hide that</i>
<i>you're weak and pathetic.</i>

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:19.441
Who would ever want to talk to a
person like that?

00:17:19.475 --> 00:17:22.511
Then what am I supposed to do?!

00:17:22.544 --> 00:17:26.515
First of all, think
about why you have that
Disguise Jutsu of yours.

00:17:26.548 --> 00:17:31.853
Polish that skill, keep stepping
up to the challenge, and be
someone people take notice of.

00:17:32.888 --> 00:17:35.891
And become a strong and
dependable man!

00:17:47.369 --> 00:17:48.437
Hmm.

00:17:50.472 --> 00:17:52.741
[chewing]

00:17:52.774 --> 00:17:55.611
[gasp] It's delicious!

00:17:55.644 --> 00:17:59.681
Right? You're never
sure until you step
up to the challenge.

00:17:59.715 --> 00:18:01.417
You know what I mean?

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.919
Then you'll know what
to do the next time.

00:18:03.952 --> 00:18:06.588
Since you're kinda
handsome already...

00:18:06.622 --> 00:18:11.327
Work on becoming a
better man and once you
are, come back to me.

00:18:12.728 --> 00:18:15.096
Come back to
you, Cho‐Cho?

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.568
[sobbing]

00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:20.469
All right!

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:23.839
What do you mean, "all right?"
You do realize you almost got
stabbed!

00:18:23.872 --> 00:18:29.077
So what? Once you share chips,
you become friends! That's just
common sense.

00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:32.848
[sobbing]

00:18:33.449 --> 00:18:34.983
<i>It's disappearing...</i>

00:18:36.818 --> 00:18:39.355
What... What have I done?!

00:18:39.888 --> 00:18:45.093
[sobbing]

00:18:46.227 --> 00:18:48.364
What the heck is
going on here?!

00:18:48.397 --> 00:18:52.768
Hey Boruto. We didn't
knock him out, but he
still went back to normal.

00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:55.504
I know. And the
shadow's disappeared.

00:18:55.537 --> 00:19:02.077
[deep breaths]

00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:03.779
Um...

00:19:03.812 --> 00:19:05.814
I'm sorry. For everything...

00:19:05.847 --> 00:19:09.785
Oh...It's okay, really!

00:19:09.818 --> 00:19:12.521
I'm so, so sorry!

00:19:14.189 --> 00:19:16.625
[sniffle]

00:19:16.658 --> 00:19:21.162
And I promise you I will
never hide in front of you
again, Sumire.

00:19:21.697 --> 00:19:23.064
[gasp]

00:19:23.565 --> 00:19:24.900
Mhm.

00:19:24.933 --> 00:19:26.968
[shocked gasps]

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:28.804
You okay?!

00:19:28.837 --> 00:19:31.507
What's wrong with him?

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.941
<i>(Sarada) Maybe we should take</i>
<i>him to the nurse's office.</i>

00:19:32.974 --> 00:19:34.910
<i>(Shikadai) Yeah. Probably.</i>

00:19:44.586 --> 00:19:46.087
<i>(Sumire) Boruto?</i>

00:19:46.855 --> 00:19:49.558
Hey, Boruto!
What's the matter?

00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:53.194
Huh? Oh, no. Don't
worry, it's nothing at all!

00:19:53.829 --> 00:19:55.431
Come on, let's all go home.

00:19:57.766 --> 00:19:59.167
<i>Guess that's it for now.</i>

00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:04.506
<i>[people chatting]</i>

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.909
<i>(Boruto) Why did he go</i>
<i>back to normal?</i>

00:20:07.943 --> 00:20:11.947
Well, I guess you can shake
that thing off even if you're
not knocked out physically.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.048
[chewing]

00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:15.651
Yeah, that happened with Denki,
<i>too.</i>

00:20:20.656 --> 00:20:24.460
But why did he become so gaunt
all of a sudden?

00:20:24.493 --> 00:20:27.696
It's just like when you lose a
lot of chakra, actually.

00:20:27.729 --> 00:20:28.330
Hmm?

00:20:28.364 --> 00:20:29.130
You're right.

00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:33.635
Yeah, that's true. But his jutsu
wasn't that demanding.

00:20:37.639 --> 00:20:39.007
So, guys...

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.711
Can chakra manifest as a giant
monster?

00:20:42.744 --> 00:20:45.247
I mean, do you think
something like that's even
possible?

00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:48.016
Huh? A monster? Hmm.

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:50.185
Wait! Hold on one sec!

00:20:53.889 --> 00:20:55.156
Hmm?

00:20:57.859 --> 00:21:03.098
I'm not sure if it's chakra or
what it is but I saw a monster
just like this around that guy.

00:21:03.665 --> 00:21:05.000
[groans]

00:21:05.033 --> 00:21:07.903
Seems you saw something
amazing...

00:21:07.936 --> 00:21:12.774
Well, anyway, I've never heard
of anything like that before.

00:21:12.808 --> 00:21:17.178
All those incidents. You think
they could be related to chakra?

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.719
<i>(Naruto) People are losing</i>
<i>chakra?</i>

00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:28.724
Yeah. A number of people have
been taken to the hospital
lately.

00:21:28.757 --> 00:21:33.061
It's not clear if it's from an
illness or from something
someone did.

00:21:33.094 --> 00:21:35.597
We should keep an eye on the
situation.

00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:38.367
You think that chakra's being
targeted?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.271
<i>(Shikamaru) I've arranged for</i>
<i>an investigation with</i>
<i>that possibility in mind.</i>

00:21:42.771 --> 00:21:43.805
Hmm.

00:21:47.776 --> 00:21:51.179
(Mitsuki) It seems Boruto's able
<i>to see it after all.</i>

00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:58.153
Hmm. That's right. He described
<i>it as looking like a monster.</i>

00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:01.089
All right, then.

00:22:01.857 --> 00:22:03.625
I'll keep investigating.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.827
But...

00:22:08.096 --> 00:22:11.066
Why is Boruto the only one
who can see it?

00:23:48.597 --> 00:23:50.966
<i>(Naruto) What's wrong? Did</i>
<i>something happen?</i>

00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:52.968
<i>(Hinata) Boruto's been acting</i>
<i>kind of strange...</i>

00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:55.971
<i>(Boruto) I can't believe the</i>
<i>fate of the world is on my</i>
<i>shoulders!</i>

00:23:56.004 --> 00:24:00.108
<i>My destiny was revealed in a</i>
<i>pearl grey‐colored nightmare!</i>

00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:05.947
<i>No one can escape my Byakugan,</i>
<i>the eye that unravels lies.</i>

00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:11.287
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "The Dream's</i>
<i>Revelation."</i>

00:24:14.055 --> 00:24:16.725
(Himawari) Big Brother is acting
<i>weird!</i>
