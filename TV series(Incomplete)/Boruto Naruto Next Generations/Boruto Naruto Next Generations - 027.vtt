WEBVTT

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.087
What have they done?

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.527
Who the hell did this anyway?

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.929
It was Hachiya.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.965
A genin. I know him
from the Academy.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.801
A genin? That guy?

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:40.140
It's true. He can't stand the
fact that our village has turned
into a tourist destination.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.677
We have to go save Denki right
away!

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.813
Not yet. We should tell Lord
Chojuro first.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.214
No, we can't.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.052
If this thing gets out of
hand, our field trip will be
totally canceled.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.721
Hey you're a
pretty strong guy.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.624
Don't you think we can do this
without relying on the adults?

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:01.227
Well that's...

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.130
We'll make sure this doesn't
turn into a big deal.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.567
So please help
us out, will ya?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.368
Hmm.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.675
Alright then.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.176
[excited inhale]

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.912
But a lot of time has passed
already.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.313
We've gotta hurry!

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.399
It should be right around
here.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.172
Denki!

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.040
Are you okay?

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.075
Boruto!

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.445
Hey! You all better let him
go right now!

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.415
I'm afraid that's all gonna
depend on you guys.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:40.554
If you get on your knees and
bow your heads, then I just
might consider it.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.489
Please, don't be so damn
ridiculous!

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:46.092
Yeah! Don't get carried
away, you dumb jerk!

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:48.194
Hachiya, are you outta your
mind?

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.196
What's the point of picking a
fight?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.866
You shut up! This is none of
your business!

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.136
You're just a lapdog sucking
up to the Hidden Leaf!

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.239
[chuckling]

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.108
This is war between the
Hidden Leaf Village and us!

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:03.910
War in this day and age?

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:07.080
You're so dumb, it's one
cliche after another.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:08.749
This is really
becoming a drag.

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:11.417
Remember, you said you
wouldn't cause any trouble.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.287
But they sure seem determined
to fight us.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.192
[laughing] Don't mess with the
Blood Mist Shinobi! You're gonna
learn to fear our might!

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:21.394
[gasps] What's that sign?

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.564
Crimson Mist Barrier Jutsu!

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:26.933
The mist!

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.202
Hmm?

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.705
Now you can't see anything
from the outside.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:33.840
In here, there's no one who
can help you.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:37.911
<i>(Hachiya) We're going</i>
<i>to beat the living hell out of</i>
<i>every single one of you!</i>

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:42.215
So then no one will notice, no
matter how much noise we make?

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:43.750
That's perfect.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.888
Yeah, because if we get
found out, our field trip will
definitely be over.

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:50.156
Wait, you guys. Calm down!

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.925
That's what you should say to
them.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:56.630
We've got a lot more guys with
us now. It won't be like it was
earlier today.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.032
Make them pay! Go after them
now!

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.568
[charging]

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.069
[grunting]

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:04.404
[groans]

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.008
[grunting]

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.409
Super Beast Scroll!

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:13.313
Woah!

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.448
[grunts]

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.184
[grunts]

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:20.153
[grunting]

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:22.322
Fall back and regroup
immediately!

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.891
[grunts] Huh?

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.226
What the hell?

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.428
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:31.898
[grunting]

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:35.235
It's too bad when you're stupid
enough to fall into your own
trap!

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:36.236
Die!

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.740
[grunting]

00:05:39.773 --> 00:05:43.309
<i>(Hachiya) Is that sword</i>
<i>you're carrying just for show?</i>

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:48.949
What a shame that a coward
like you would become one of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.251
It's a disgrace, really.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:52.452
Kagura!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.720
Get back!

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:54.988
Uh!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.359
What's the matter? Why don't
you go ahead and kill him as
well?

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.195
You know, just like you did at
the Academy.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:05.465
[angry breathing] Shut up!

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.534
Kagura.

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:11.071
[angry breathing]

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.073
Let me tell you a little
secret!

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:17.143
This guy completely changes
when he draws that sword of
his.

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:22.248
When he was at the Academy,
he dropped a bunch of his
classmates into a sea of blood.

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:24.250
Quit saying such stupid
things!

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.887
I'm just telling the truth!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.789
As a matter of fact.

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:33.594
<i>(Hachiya) This guy's</i>
<i>the grandson of the Fourth</i>
<i>Mizukage, Yagura!</i>

00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:34.528
[gasps]

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:36.162
[grunts]

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:37.764
Seriously? [grunting]

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.935
But look at how
pitiful he is now.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:46.106
He won't touch his sword because
he's afraid of cutting someone.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.941
How sad is that?

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:53.046
<i>(Hachiya) If you're</i>
<i>Yagura's grandson, then you</i>
<i>better start acting like it!</i>

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.149
I'm nothing like Yagura.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:07:00.521
Yeah, that's for sure. You're
actually nothing like him at
all.

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:02.756
You're just a stupid idiot!

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.191
Hmph!

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.159
<i>(Hachiya) Heh!</i>

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:08.461
[grunts]

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:09.730
Kagura!

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:11.598
[grunting]

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:14.400
[laughing] I got him now!

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.368
[grunting]

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.469
Uh!

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.504
[gasps]

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:18.805
Hmph!

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:26.279
[laughing] Whatcha got there? A
wooden sword?

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.348
[panting]

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.685
[choking]
[laughing]

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:35.088
[choking] Ka...gura...

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:42.095
[fighting efforts]

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.464
[groans]

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:45.832
[snickers]

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:50.103
[panting]

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.507
[grunting]

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.678
[grunts]

00:07:58.712 --> 00:07:59.412
Kagura!

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.480
Uh!

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.683
[exhales]

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.050
Hmph!

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.187
[grunting]

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:09.022
What?!

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:14.795
Huh? [embarrassed breathing]

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.096
Uh, hmm?

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:20.066
[grunts] Ahh!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.369
Hmph.

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.138
<i>(Iwabe) That ought to shut you</i>
<i>up.</i>

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.874
Hmm.

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:29.810
The mist.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.947
Denki! Are you okay?

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.915
Mm‐hm!

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:37.417
I was waiting for the right
moment to jump in.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.052
Heh. steppin' up!

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.488
We were really outnumbered
though.

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.991
So are you guys really genin?

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.960
[whimpering]

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.161
Hachiya!

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.031
Damn! [grunts]

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:52.733
You'll be sorry someday!

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.701
<i>Let's get outta here!</i>

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:58.672
Get lost you guys! And don't
come back here!

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.841
<i>(Security) Who's down there?</i>

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:01.908
[grunts]

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:02.809
Security's here!

00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:04.911
That's not good! Let's get
outta here!

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.886
[exhales] I'm so beat!

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.922
Well, it looks like our sensei
haven't heard anything about it.

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.191
Hah! We accomplished
our mission then!

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.793
You guys are something.

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:23.263
Hey, is it really true you're
Yagura's grandson?

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.064
Hmm.

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:31.071
Hmm.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:33.406
Yes, it's true.

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:34.575
Hmph.

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:38.745
Is it also true you hurt
your classmates?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.947
Mm‐hm.

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:52.993
<i>(Kagura) When I snapped out of</i>
<i>it, everyone was on the ground</i>
<i>around me.</i>

00:09:57.297 --> 00:10:02.803
It was at that moment I realized
I really am the grandchild of
Yagura.

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:09.342
Even now, I struggle for control
when I hold a sword.

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:11.878
I don't know.

00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:15.516
I guess I'm afraid of wielding
a sword.

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:17.951
That explains why you
looked so relieved...

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.754
when you were done sparring
with Boruto the other day.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:23.023
Uh.

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:26.259
[uncomfortable laugh] Was it
really that obvious?

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:30.163
It's just a personal issue of
mine. Forget it.

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:32.065
Should we go back?

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:35.636
After that blow, I doubt if
Hachiya will try anything else.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.393
<i>(Shino) Regarding the peace</i>
<i>treaty for all nations.</i>

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:06.332
The Lands of Fire, Water, Waves,
and Sea, are considering
signing it.

00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:09.369
Hmm.

00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:14.975
Please milady, could
we abstain a bit?

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:19.746
Oh, I'll be fine. I just need to
control my internal chakra.

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:24.885
See that?

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:27.554
It's a talent we
kunoichi have.

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:29.455
All right, back to the
subject.

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:35.929
What we should be concentrating
on now is analyzing the current
state of affairs.

00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:41.334
The Land of Water is clearly not
interested in signing a peace
treaty. Do we agree?

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.437
Yes, you're right, that's our
conclusion too.

00:11:46.507 --> 00:11:47.708
Hmm.

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:52.412
So the Feudal Lords of our
nation believe that the
instability along the Middle...

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:56.817
Sea, will provide more
opportunities for power and
expansion.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:59.019
[chewing]

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:05.726
If only they could focus their
lust on some other things
here at home.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.360
I completely agree.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.294
[chomps]

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.266
Let's finish this discussion.
It's so discouraging.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:17.237
I'm sure you'd rather be out
enjoying the Hidden Mist's
nightlife! Right?

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:23.143
Would it be correct to say that
the Hidden Mist Village...

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:26.212
does not agree with the Land of
Water then?

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.816
[sighs] Exactly.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.452
The Land of Water can say
whatever it likes...

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:35.556
but those of us in the Village
only want stability.

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:40.360
However, if the Lands of
Waves and Sea continue seeking
expansion...

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:43.864
then the Land of Water will
be in a risky position.

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:48.835
If the two nations clash, then
our village will be forced to
take some action as well.

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.504
I understand that.

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:55.341
And the Hidden Mist Village
cannot go back to being called
the Blood Mist.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:59.412
Don't worry. Both
Lord Sixth and I will.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:04.017
[sighs] Will do all we can to
support the peace treaty.

00:13:12.693 --> 00:13:15.696
<i>(Shikadai) That could have</i>
<i>been a drag.</i>

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:17.698
I think we're going
to be okay now.

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:21.502
But it's probably a good
idea if you don't go out
alone anymore.

00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:22.969
I understand.

00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:24.805
Hmm.

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.840
Well, I'll see you guys later.

00:13:27.508 --> 00:13:28.675
Hmm.

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:29.743
Hey, wait a minute!

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:30.877
Huh?

00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:33.046
Why don't you come and
have some fun with us?

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:35.982
I'm sorry, but I don't really
feel like it.

00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:39.920
Just for sec, come on! Besides,
our Sensei aren't here!

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:41.755
<i>(Kagura) Hold on! I'm good!</i>

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:43.456
<i>(Boruto) Don't worry, it's ok!</i>

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:44.858
<i>(Kagura) Wait a second!</i>

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:55.201
Ah, so that's it?
Well here, then!

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.369
What the?

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:59.840
Okay, then how about this?

00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:05.512
[sneaky chuckle] Shinobi Bout!

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:07.380
No way! Already?

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:08.782
H‐Hey wait a second!

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:11.752
Uh, couldn't you
have used that card?

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:13.754
Yeah but, we're
already done here.

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:15.488
[sighs]

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:19.492
[laughs] Looks like I've won
again!

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.327
I'm going to win next time!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.195
[gasps]

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:24.731
Whoa! That's the spirit, Kagura.

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:26.933
Huh? You still wanna play?

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:28.802
What, you gonna win and
leave?

00:14:28.835 --> 00:14:30.837
I didn't know you
were like this.

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:31.938
[gasps]

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:33.439
[sighs]

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.275
Ignore Inojin.

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:36.610
[chuckles]

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:44.284
I honestly didn't think that you
would get this hooked on Shinobi
Bout, Kagura.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.453
I'm kinda surprised myself.

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:50.356
I've hardly ever played any
games in the past.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.059
I had no idea that
they could be this fun.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:54.427
Oh yeah.

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:58.264
And that sad expression you
had on your face earlier has
completely vanished.

00:14:58.298 --> 00:14:59.232
Huh?

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:05.071
You guys are...

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.073
[exhales]

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:11.111
Thanks so much.

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:14.314
Well Kagura, you don't seem to
have a lot of friends so.

00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:17.551
But isn't that Hachiya
guy a friend of yours?

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.486
Huh? What makes you think
that he's his friend?

00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:23.189
Because, they were classmates
at the Academy.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:26.059
It's true, Hachiya used to be
my classmate.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:32.065
He obsessed about the "Blood
Mist's past," and began hanging
out with a bad crowd.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:35.502
And before we knew
it, we had grown apart.

00:15:37.838 --> 00:15:42.576
It's not like I had all that
many friends before but it still
hurt.

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:46.212
All because it bothered you
that you were the grandson of
Yagura.

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.414
And so you put up a wall, right?

00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:52.919
Uhh.

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.121
You're right, that's true.

00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:01.161
Ah okay, I'll start!

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:11.004
So Kagura, why'd you decide
to become a ninja?

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:15.408
I needed to survive.

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:19.145
If you didn't want to be poor
and struggle, that was the
only choice.

00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:25.285
But the blood of
Yagura flows within me.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.121
So people were
always pretty distant.

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:35.762
<i>(Kagura) But one day, I met</i>
<i>someone.</i>

00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:41.234
<i>I met someone who finally saw</i>
<i>me for the first time, as a</i>
<i>human being.</i>

00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:46.540
But then, during our first
combat training.

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:53.647
[grunting]

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.649
I give up... no, please!

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.083
[growling]

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:58.251
Ahhhhh!

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:06.259
[panting]

00:17:09.062 --> 00:17:11.998
The blood of Yagura flows
within me.

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:16.803
That'll never change. It's
my fate.

00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:21.708
Since then, I've fought
against that voice inside of
me.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.714
<i>(Kagura) So I can make sure it</i>
<i>never happens again.</i>

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:30.216
Like in the past with Yagura?

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:37.991
The sins of the Blood Mist
Village will never fade.

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:41.562
Just like the blood that flows
in my veins.

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:46.800
<i>(Kagura) Yagura's sin, is my</i>
<i>sin.</i>

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:50.403
That has nothing to do with
you.

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:54.608
<i>(Boruto) I am who I am.</i>

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:58.945
And you are who you are. What
our dads and grandpas did
doesn't matter.

00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:00.781
We do things our own way.

00:18:01.815 --> 00:18:03.917
[sighs]

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.819
That's all that matters for
Boruto.

00:18:05.852 --> 00:18:08.488
But it seems like you have a
Type A personality.

00:18:08.522 --> 00:18:10.290
Like you're super driven, am I
right?

00:18:11.992 --> 00:18:16.096
But to keep thinking about
something beyond your control.
Isn't that kind of a drag?

00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:18.732
Thank goodness you came to my
rescue, Kagura!

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:22.503
I'm so grateful. I've got a
lot of respect for you.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:29.409
Well, it didn't seem like you
were having any kind of struggle
with your sword earlier.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:33.413
Why are you guys so kind?

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.416
We're friends. And
that's what friends do.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.217
[gasps]

00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:41.154
You cast off criticism about
being Yagura's grandkid and
you advanced.

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:45.325
That's why Lord Mizukage,
chose you as one of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen.

00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:48.394
(Boruto) Why not just be upfront
<i>and accept it?</i>

00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:50.030
Hmm.

00:18:50.063 --> 00:18:51.698
It's the same with games.

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:55.335
You never know if it's going to
end up being any fun until you
try it yourself!

00:18:58.438 --> 00:18:59.606
[gasps]

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.376
Hmm.

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:14.154
I think you're right.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.723
Shinobi Bout!

00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:18.258
Huh?

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:20.794
Ah, already?

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.596
That was fast!

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:26.332
So, um, what just
happened here?

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:29.335
Having those three cards is
very rare.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.071
Looks like I won.

00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:33.106
Ah, damn it!

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:34.107
Thanks so much.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.175
<i>(Boruto) Huh?</i>

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:40.013
That was really gutsy, the
way you blocked all those red
cards. Nicely done.

00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:41.948
But I lost the game.

00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:43.717
Hey, wanna play again?

00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:45.552
Huh?

00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:50.056
Boruto! Time for evening roll
call!

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:55.195
Eh, nobody even cares about
roll call! What do ya say we
play one more?

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:58.832
Don't make me say it again.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.366
Uh. [nervous giggles]

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:03.604
I guess it's time
to call it quits.

00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:04.370
[chuckles]

00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:06.206
Yeah, alright I get it.

00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:10.176
Uh, you should take these.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.645
Huh? Are you sure?

00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:12.212
Yeah.

00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:13.146
<i>(Sarada) Boruto!</i>

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:15.315
Uh. Okay I'm coming!

00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:17.083
Let's play again soon.

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:18.552
Ah, sure!

00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:26.727
Hmm.

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:48.281
It's been quite a while... since
we've had some time together
like this, Kagura...

00:20:49.182 --> 00:20:51.317
So, how are you?

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:55.556
Are things still going smoothly
with all the visitors from the
Hidden Leaf Village?

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:56.322
Yes.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.458
I'm glad to hear it.

00:20:58.491 --> 00:21:02.996
They're really nice. They call
me a "friend" and they treat
me as their equal.

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:07.601
I can't remember the last
time I had so much fun.

00:21:08.168 --> 00:21:10.070
Hmm.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:14.474
It brought back a lot of
memories of how I used to feel.

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.911
Lord Chojuro.

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:24.184
The candidacy test for the
Hiramekarei.

00:21:24.217 --> 00:21:26.386
I'm ready to take it now.

00:21:38.264 --> 00:21:40.534
I see.

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:44.170
So Kagura went to see the
Mizukage.

00:21:44.204 --> 00:21:51.712
[nervous breathing]

00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:59.419
[laughs]

00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:01.487
That's wonderful.

00:22:02.022 --> 00:22:04.991
It all starts right now.

00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:09.696
[gasps]

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.863
<i>(Shizuma) Hello Kagura, and</i>
<i>there's Boruto!</i>

00:23:49.896 --> 00:23:52.198
(Boruto) Wait, you were with the
<i>guys at the harbor!</i>

00:23:52.232 --> 00:23:53.466
<i>(Kagura) Mr. Shizuma!</i>

00:23:55.135 --> 00:23:57.370
(Shizuma) You now have the Great
<i>Twin Swords. It's time to</i>
<i>declare war.</i>

00:23:57.403 --> 00:23:59.105
<i>(Kagura) What are you talking</i>
<i>about?</i>

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:02.242
<i>(Shizuma) Fighting to kill is</i>
<i>the way of the</i> Blood <i>Mist</i>
<i>shinobi.</i>

00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:06.446
<i>We will usher in a brand new</i>
age and we'll need warriors just
<i>like you.</i>

00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:11.518
<i>(Boruto) Next time on "Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations: A</i>
<i>Declaration of War!"</i>

00:24:11.552 --> 00:24:15.822
(Shizuma) Kagura, I'll always be
<i>there, to protect you.</i>
