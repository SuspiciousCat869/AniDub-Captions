WEBVTT

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:12.646
As you can see, Boruto, in
general you're performing
exceptionally!

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.880
[chuckles]

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.081
[clearing throat]

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.553
Although, I have noticed that
you sometimes don't take class
time seriously enough.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.789
Aw, come on! Give me a break,
would ya?

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.726
[sighs] I can't believe you!

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.964
All the same, I doubt that
doing so will much affect your
future prospects.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.332
[chuckles]

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.003
So, Boruto, tell me, what kind
of ninja do you want to
become?

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.772
Uh, what kind?

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.844
That's right. Exactly what do
you want to do? What do you want
to focus on after graduation?

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.714
Uh, hmm.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.752
To be completely honest with
you, Shino Sensei, when I think
about it...

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.155
there isn't really anything in
particular that I want to do as
a ninja.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:58.124
What?! But, you're saying that
right now?!

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.861
You know the graduation exam's
coming up, don't you?

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.563
He's right, Boruto!

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.230
Hmm.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.299
Eh, it doesn't matter.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:11.572
The whole reason I entered the
Academy was only to get Dad all
riled up. After that...

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:14.741
What? It doesn't matter?

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:18.579
Look, I'll just make something
happen. I'm "exceptional." Isn't
that what you called me?

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:22.649
I'm sure I'll be able to
breeze through the graduation
exam, too.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:24.417
[sighs] Right.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:28.421
[sighs]

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:30.824
(Anko) Thanks for your hard work
<i>on today's conferences!</i>

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.527
Anko Sensei.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.429
You know, you're looking kind
of exhausted.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:40.166
Hmm. Students these days are,
how do I put this?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.870
They're not giving much
thought to why they want to
become ninja.

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:48.975
Let me guess, topping that
list is the problem
child‐genius Boruto, right?

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.176
Yeah.

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:57.450
He's definitely got true talent.
But there are some barriers that
skill alone cannot overcome.

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.353
<i>(Shino) One of them being the</i>
<i>graduation exam.</i>

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.292
[laughing]

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:50.363
No, but seriously, you guys,
I'm telling you, my mom was
being such a drag!

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.599
Seems like you had a tough
time in there!

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.935
So how was your conference,
Denki?

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:58.471
Good! My Dad was super happy to
finally hear me say...

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.841
that I'm really planning on
becoming a shinobi!

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:01.608
Oh yeah?

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.679
I'm excited to graduate so I
can lose my nickname of "The
Repeater!"

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.749
I vow to become a shinobi like
Lord Hokage.

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:12.052
Cool! I'm sure that you can do
it, Iwabe!

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:12.953
Yeah.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.189
But is becoming a shinobi
really that big a deal?

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:21.728
Yeah, of course it is! Being a
famous shinobi is almost the
same as being a national hero!

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.598
You'll even get offers to be
in commercials!

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.600
<i>(Denki) See?</i>

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.172
Just like Kagemasa. A whole
lot of shinobi act in movies
and TV after they retire.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.508
Aren't you excited about it,
Boruto?

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.909
Oh, uh.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.277
Well, I...

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.548
I don't.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.952
Sorry, but I'm not really
interested in all of that
stuff.

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:49.823
I mean, is becoming a shinobi
actually something to get all
worked up about?

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.393
[speechless]

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.562
What?! Seriously?!

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.264
You're the one who inspired me
to study the Ninjutsu!

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.333
Why don't you feel as excited as
me?!

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.268
I don't know what to tell you,
Denki.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:06.507
Boruto says all that but he
still gets the best grades. So
unfair.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.875
That's for sure! Unfair!

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.745
Well, talking about the future
is nice and all.

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:16.149
But we've got the graduation
exam closing in on us really
fast.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:17.818
Yeah, it sure is.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.555
And there are two parts, right?
The written exam and the
practical application exam?

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:23.590
[groans] I sure am dreading
those.

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:27.493
Oh yeah, the written exam's
like a normal test, right?

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:30.196
<i>(Boruto) But what's the</i>
<i>practical application about?</i>

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.632
<i>(Denki) It tests your skills.</i>

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:34.601
(Iwabe) One time when I failed,
<i>it was on wall climbing.</i>

00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:40.206
<i>If I hadn't failed the written</i>
<i>exam, then I would've cleared</i>
<i>the whole thing, no problem.</i>

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.811
I heard that back in the day,
you passed if you could do the
Clone or Transformation Jutsu.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.079
Transformation Jutsu?

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.015
<i>(Boruto) It would be easy if</i>
<i>that's all you had to do.</i>

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.958
[groans]

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:02.763
[nervous giggle] By the way,
who are the proctors for the
exams gonna be?

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:06.332
It's gotta be Shino Sensei and
Anko Sensei, don't you think?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.235
Eh, I'm sure it'll be easy
whoever it is!

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:12.238
I wouldn't be so confident.

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:15.041
Depending on the proctor, half
or even none of the class
could become genin.

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:17.644
Yep. I've heard that kind of
thing has happened before.

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:20.380
What?! Sometimes the whole
class can fail?!

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.816
[groans] Then I guess that
means...

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.020
We won't really know much of
anything until the test is
underway.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:33.527
(Boruto) If that's true, are we
<i>all gonna get scattered and go</i>
<i>our separate ways?</i>

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:41.001
Graduation exam, and becoming
genin...uh?

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:44.037
<i>(Sukea) Hey, you're a student</i>
<i>here, aren't you?</i>

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.807
Who are you, old man?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.344
Old man? Kinda harsh! My
name's Sukea. I'm a freelance
reporter.

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:54.014
Oh. Do you mean like a
journalist?

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:54.948
Yep!

00:06:56.717 --> 00:07:00.486
I'm here to do a story on the
Academy students preparing to
take the graduation exam.

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:03.389
I want to hear everything! How
energized they are, what their
dreams for the future are.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:09.195
Oh, yeah? A story? That sounds
really interesting. I'd be glad
to help you out, if you want!

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.096
<i>(Sukea) Oh?</i>

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:13.734
Come this way! I'll gather up
some guys who're still on
campus.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:19.873
Actually, the person that I
had hoped to interview first
is you. But, that's okay.

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:21.441
[grunts]

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:23.544
(Sukea) So why do you want to be
<i>a ninja?</i>

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:24.878
For the obvious reason.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:29.082
So I can become a strong man
like my papa! I want to see how
far I can go!

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:33.954
[gasps] Wait, are you recording
this right now?! Uh, in that
case, I'm Metal Lee!

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:37.257
It's nice to meet you! Um, my
dreams are to, um...

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.529
Hmm, I'll get to draw stuff I
like and make more money than
an ordinary artist would.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.265
So I guess I'll be putting my
hobby to practical use.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:49.803
Well, it's a drag, but to live
up to my parent's expectations.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:53.507
And also, it's because I really
wouldn't mind being a ninja!

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.242
My goal is to become the
Hokage one day.

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:59.079
And to do that, I first have to
become a worthy shinobi.

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:01.982
One who's acknowledged by
everyone in the village.

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.817
Was that okay?

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.751
[gasps]

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.754
I, um...hmm.

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.456
I want to become a
ninja!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.359
Actually, I don't plan on
becoming a ninja at all.

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:16.663
After graduation I'm going
home to run the family temple.

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:19.332
I'm going on to take
intermediate courses...

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:23.103
in the general middle school
curriculum. When our class had
career week...

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:26.907
I realized that being a ninja
wasn't the only job I had fun
doing.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:30.276
[chewing]

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.813
Huh? Are you recording right
now?

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.649
Isn't the camera too far to
the right?

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:38.151
Here, come closer!

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.622
Yeah! That's the best angle!

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:44.090
[grunts] Hey, what are you
recording?!

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.261
Well all right, then.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.232
After listening to everyone,
I'll say your class is full of
strong personalities!

00:08:52.933 --> 00:08:54.000
Hmm.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.503
Hmm? What is it?

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:57.738
It's nothing.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.974
I was just thinking how
everyone's got some pretty solid
ideas...

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.709
about what their future
should be.

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:05.912
And some students don't even
intend to become ninja.

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:06.913
Yeah.

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:11.618
It's funny though. I just
assumed that everyone would
want to become a ninja.

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:16.957
You know, come to think of it,
why did you want to enter the
Academy?

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:22.062
Oh, I... I only wanted to get
back at my stupid old man.

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:25.799
Really now? And the Academy's
the only place you could do
that?

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:28.902
Yeah, that's why I followed
the same path he did.

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:31.872
Because if I was able to do
everything better than him...

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:35.008
I figured everyone would
finally see that I am better.

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:35.976
Hmm.

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:39.179
Look, I've got to get going
now, ya know!

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:42.315
But I can help out with more
interviews tomorrow!

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.284
See you later, Mr. Sukea!

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:53.293
Boruto, it's time for you to
finish up your game.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.728
<i>(Boruto) Okay.</i>

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.129
Here!

00:09:57.463 --> 00:10:00.634
Hey, Mom? What was it that
made you decide to become a
ninja?

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:04.070
Huh? [chuckles]

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.439
It was different back when I
was a child.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:09.510
Becoming a ninja was just
something that was expected of
me.

00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:13.146
<i>(Hinata) And not just me, but</i>
<i>your late Uncle Neji as well.</i>

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:17.718
<i>If you were born a Hyuga, then</i>
<i>you were destined to become a</i>
<i>shinobi.</i>

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:21.254
Really? Wow, that sounds
pretty rough, mom.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:25.325
That's not all. Your grandfather
was very strict back in those
days.

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:27.060
Seriously?! Our grandpa?!

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:31.064
Come here, you! I'm so glad to
see you, Boruto!

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:33.567
I really can't picture him
being like that.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.338
[chuckles] Well, time has
brought many changes, that's
for sure!

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:42.308
<i>(Hinata) Today, becoming a</i>
<i>shinobi isn't everything.</i>

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:43.043
[giggles]

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:45.712
I was surprised during your
conference today.

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:51.117
But still, if you decide you
don't want to become a shinobi,
I think it'd be fine, too.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.920
Really, mom?!

00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:57.858
Both your father and I, want
you to be able to choose your
own path in life.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:10:59.960
[doubtful groan]

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.797
<i>You say that but Dad might not</i>
<i>feel the same way.</i>

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.366
What does he know about who I am
<i>and what I want?</i>

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.435
<i>(Boruto) He didn't come home</i>
<i>again today, either.</i>

00:11:13.974 --> 00:11:15.441
[yawns]

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:16.510
<i>(Wasabi) Why, Namida?!</i>

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:17.077
Hmm?

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.913
I thought that we were gonna
become ninja together!

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:24.117
Wasabi, I... I'm sorry, but,
it's just...

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.319
What's going on with those
two?

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:30.390
Namida's planning to continue
on in the general middle
school curriculum.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:34.194
Huh? You mean she's gonna give
up on becoming a ninja?

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:35.529
Yeah.

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.097
Together with her parents...

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:41.735
she's planning on telling Shino
Sensei during their
parent‐teacher conference today.

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:45.739
<i>I guess that's one kinda path</i>
<i>someone can take.</i>

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:53.079
Oh, I understand. That's how
it is.

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:57.851
But if she was gonna quit
anyway, why'd she even enter the
Academy in the first place?

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.920
I just don't get it.

00:11:59.953 --> 00:12:01.855
Well, it's not out of the
ordinary to do so.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.791
Even just completing the
ninjutsu course...

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:07.027
can be advantageous when looking
for a job.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.261
Huh? Really?

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.532
You've been attending the
Academy, and you aren't even
aware of that?

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:12.733
[uncomfortable chuckle]

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.337
Graduating from the program
certifies that you're
talented.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.840
That could really help you out
in the future. The demand for
shinobi's gone down.

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:22.075
That tends to happens during
times of peace.

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:27.180
Utilizing skills gained at the
Academy in fields other than
being a ninja is more secure.

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:28.815
And less risky, right?

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:32.418
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:36.389
(Boruto) I've seen former ninja
<i>working in all sorts of jobs,</i>
<i>all over the village.</i>

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:39.492
I've found that people who
have a reason to become a
shinobi don't give up.

00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:44.264
No matter how small their
chances are for success, they
keep going.

00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:47.200
They don't give up because
they all have a reason, huh?

00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:50.837
My goal is to become the
Hokage one day.

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:52.839
Hmm.

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:53.439
<i>(Mitsuki) Oh!</i>

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.842
So this is where you are,
Boruto.

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:58.444
Oh, Mitsuki! Your timing's
perfect!

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:01.582
Do you think you could you
answer some questions for Mr.
Sukea's story?

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:07.654
Sorry, but I can't. My
conference is about to start.
Maybe later.

00:13:07.688 --> 00:13:12.192
Come to think of it, I've
never seen his parents before.
I wonder what they're like?

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:16.196
Hey, Mr. Sukea!

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:17.831
How would you like to go and
crash a parent‐teacher
conference with me?

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:19.032
Let's not.

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:21.401
I don't think that's a good
idea.

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:24.037
Huh? Why not?

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.273
Let's just call it a
journalist's hunch, okay?

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:33.279
[chuckles]

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.617
By all rights someone like me
shouldn't be invited here.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.220
It's hard to imagine I'm
allowed in such a special room.

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:42.856
I'm surprised that you're so
trusting.

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:47.093
You shouldn't be. Because
frankly, I don't trust you all
that much.

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:50.864
Well, a lot of stuff has
happened in the past.

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:53.967
But today, our relationship is
one of cooperation.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.140
That is true, and you did
accept my dear child for
enrollment in the Academy.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.676
There are still only a few of
us who know about that.

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:06.847
And most of the people who are
aware of our relationship
are right here.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.519
You've been doing your part.
Your analysis of Danzo's
research has been a huge help.

00:14:12.553 --> 00:14:15.689
<i>(Naruto) It'll help speed up</i>
<i>Sasuke's investigation.</i>

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:20.727
[chuckles] I sowed the seeds
and now must clean it up,
that's all.

00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:22.996
There's no need to thank me
for it.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:27.901
All the same, I'm honored if
my work's helpful to Sasuke.

00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:31.337
But now, seems it's almost
time.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.074
[grunts] You seriously intend to
go?

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:37.177
[chuckles] Why, yes. Of course.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.612
[chuckles]

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:42.783
Well then, we wouldn't want to
get in your way or hold you up
any longer.

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:45.652
Hey, you should know this
already.

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:48.989
But if you're going to go out
in town, make sure you
disguise your face.

00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:50.957
Naturally. [chuckles]

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:52.793
I'm certain that quite a lot of
people...

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:56.329
would be absolutely
shocked if they saw me out and
about.

00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:26.660
Uh.

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:29.029
Hmm.

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:32.132
[about to cry]

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:33.534
[sighs]

00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:41.041
<i>(Boruto) Hey, what are you up</i>
<i>to?</i>

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:44.110
Oh, Boruto. It's just you,
huh?

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:46.613
"It's just you?" That's kinda
harsh.

00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:50.751
You're the big honor student.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.153
If you're as worried as you
seem to be, why don't you just
go talk to her, huh?

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:55.522
It's really easy for you to
say that.

00:15:56.523 --> 00:15:57.423
<i>(Sarada) I mean...</i>

00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:01.762
<i>I'm pretty sure that Namida</i>
really wants to become a shinobi
<i>along with Wasabi.</i>

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:05.398
But still, she's dealing with
some family stuff right now.

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:08.569
And it really isn't my place
to say anything to her.

00:16:08.602 --> 00:16:13.106
[annoyed sigh] Come on, what
are you even talking about?!

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.909
You said you wanna be Hokage,
right?

00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:18.111
[gasps] Why would you bring
that up?!

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.714
Some Hokage you're gonna end
up being...

00:16:20.747 --> 00:16:24.284
if you're too scared to stick
your neck out for something like
this.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:25.318
[gasps]

00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:29.890
Listen, maybe it's okay if you
let yourself be a little less
tactful.

00:16:29.923 --> 00:16:34.227
I mean, because otherwise,
you're never gonna surpass my
stupid dad.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.096
Boruto.

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:39.465
Hmph.

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:45.706
Thank you.

00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:56.049
Oh, man. [chuckles] What a
pain.

00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:59.119
I'm so happy! [giggles]

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:02.188
Yeah, I know! Me, too, Wasabi!

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:04.758
I'm happy, too. For you both!

00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:05.992
This means...

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:06.793
What's up?

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.632
It seems Namida wanted to
continue toward being a ninja
but thought she couldn't.

00:17:11.665 --> 00:17:16.202
And Sarada was able to coax
out her true feelings and set
everything right.

00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:18.505
Really? Sarada did that?

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.541
I really think that I would've
dropped out!

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:21.307
[chuckles]

00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:26.513
All of them went and talked to
Shino Sensei and he was able to
get Namida's parents to approve.

00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:30.316
Yeah, Shino Sensei really is
reliable in situations like
these.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.285
Let's become great ninja!

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:33.053
Yeah!

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.159
Thanks for all the help that
you gave me!

00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:41.728
Sure thing! It wasn't a
problem at all!

00:17:41.762 --> 00:17:45.566
Plus, I got to hear everyone's
stories, and that was great.

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:47.067
Oh? Everyone's stories?

00:17:48.769 --> 00:17:51.638
That's right. And, 'cause of
that, I realized everyone's
got their own ambitions.

00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:55.441
So anyway, you gonna cover the
graduation exam, too?

00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:59.445
I believe I will.

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:03.149
Maybe we'll meet again when
they finally arrive.

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:04.851
Oh, yeah. By the way.

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:09.322
I'd like to give you a bit of
advice as your senior in life.

00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:09.690
Hm?

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:12.125
There may be times when you walk
down a path...

00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:14.260
without really knowing where you
want to end up.

00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:17.664
It's not actually bad to have a
grace period like that.

00:18:17.698 --> 00:18:20.867
However, if that's all you end
up doing...

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:25.572
you'll run into barriers you
won't be able to break. Remember
that.

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:28.474
Huh? I don't really understand
what you're saying.

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:33.647
Well, anyway, it may not always
look like it, but I've gotten
things to work out up to now.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.082
I'm sure I'm gonna end up being
just fine!

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:37.317
See ya!

00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:42.723
And watch, I'll pass the exam
with top scores! Make sure you
give me a good write‐up, kay?

00:18:43.524 --> 00:18:45.458
Up to now.

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:54.668
<i>Why do I want to become a</i>
<i>shinobi?</i>

00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:00.040
Going home now, Boruto?

00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:04.477
Hey, Mitsuki. I could ask you
the same. What've you been
doing all this time?

00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:10.216
After we had our conference, my
parent and I talked a bit since
we rarely see each other.

00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:12.285
Your "parent?"

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:16.156
Anyways, what're your plans
after graduation?

00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:19.359
Well, I could go back to the
Hidden Sound Village.

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:23.564
But I'm going to stay right
here, and become a ninja.

00:19:23.597 --> 00:19:26.700
I told my parent I wanted to
stay, and they consented.

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:30.837
Oh, yeah? And is there a
reason why you want to do
that?

00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:33.707
Yes. You.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.008
[shocked]

00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:37.043
I want to continue to observe
you.

00:19:37.077 --> 00:19:38.812
Hmm.

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:41.848
You're not aware of how you
affect others.

00:19:41.882 --> 00:19:44.885
You may not realize it, but your
actions have really changed
people.

00:19:44.918 --> 00:19:46.587
Is that so?

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.156
Like Denki and Iwabe, and the
Class Rep too.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.758
<i>(Mitsuki) And without you...</i>

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:56.096
<i>I might not have been able to</i>
<i>speak up about what I want to</i>
<i>do, either.</i>

00:19:56.129 --> 00:20:01.134
You see, I too am among the
people whom you've influenced.

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:07.140
I kinda don't get what you're
saying, but I'm glad it all
worked out for you.

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:11.912
You're the only one without a
clear path, Boruto. Does that
worry you?

00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:13.680
What's that?! I'm the only
one?!

00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:15.716
[sighs]

00:20:17.283 --> 00:20:20.186
I guess you're right. And I'd
only be lying if I said it
didn't bother me.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.688
But, still.

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:22.355
Hm?

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:27.694
Really all I want to do is
hang out with everybody, to
stay together.

00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:29.229
All right, then!

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:33.567
If I don't know what the answer
is yet, I'll become a ninja and
then figure it out!

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.969
I mean, that's kind of a path,
right?

00:20:36.002 --> 00:20:41.074
I think that I get it. Well,
that's certainly one way of
looking at things.

00:20:41.107 --> 00:20:46.847
(Boruto) And besides, right now
<i>I've been having so much fun</i>
<i>with everybody, you know?</i>

00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:50.751
And so, I'm gonna become a
ninja...

00:20:50.784 --> 00:20:54.755
so I can keep on having fun with
everyone for a little while
longer.

00:20:54.788 --> 00:20:57.257
That's the plan for now and
that's enough!

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.559
[chuckles]

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:02.563
(Mitsuki) I see. That's so like
<i>you!</i>

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:12.906
[sighs] Are you serious? Why
did you have to go and do
something like that?

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:18.211
What's the big deal? I just
wanted to meet and talk to the
students...

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:23.416
before the graduation exam and
verify a few things, that's all.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:28.221
Ah, ahh, mhm, ahh.

00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:32.659
[sighs] Gathering intel's a
fundamental duty for a
shinobi.

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:36.462
And besides, I was curious.

00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:40.500
No matter what, you never seem
to change, Lord Sixth.

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:44.470
Your supervising the graduation
exam is going to be a big help.

00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:46.472
So thank you for volunteering to
do that.

00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:49.442
But please, try not to be too
hard on them, all right?

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.512
I know. I got it.

00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:54.047
But even if these are peaceful
times...

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.719
we can't have kids passing who
don't take becoming a shinobi
seriously.

00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:04.558
(Kakashi) Now, I have to wonder
<i>how many of them will still be</i>
<i>standing at the end.</i>

00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:10.764
Since my exams can be a bit,
shall we say, challenging?

00:23:44.725 --> 00:23:47.761
(Boruto) We gotta go up against
<i>Shino Sensei and the others?!</i>

00:23:47.794 --> 00:23:50.263
<i>This'll be a piece of cake!</i>

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:52.498
