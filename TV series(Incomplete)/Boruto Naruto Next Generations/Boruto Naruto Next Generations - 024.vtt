WEBVTT

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.301
Can't get enough
of this place, huh?

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:29.306
I tried a new kind of
fertilizer. [chuckles] But it
really hasn't helped.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.812
Didn't all the pros already
write it off? I don't know why
you're wasting your time.

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:41.318
In a battle that destroyed
almost everything in its path,
this tree was able to survive.

00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:43.654
(Naruto) I want to take care of
<i>it myself.</i>

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:48.993
Gardening is great, but more
importantly, is everything all
set up for the summit yet?

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:52.262
<i>(Shikamaru) The Five Kage will</i>
<i>be arriving very soon.</i>

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:54.398
<i>(Naruto) Yeah. They will.</i>

00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:44.341
You talk a big game,
Metal. Hope your fists
can back up your mouth!

00:02:44.374 --> 00:02:48.713
You are one to talk! What are
you waiting for? Come on! Let us
go!

00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:50.781
Lord Hokage is the
strongest!

00:02:50.815 --> 00:02:53.518
But that depends on the
time and place!

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:55.520
Another fight? Boring.

00:02:55.553 --> 00:02:59.890
Yeah they're arguing about who
among the Five Kage is the most
powerful leader.

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:02.359
<i>(Shino) Knock it off, both of</i>
<i>you! We're still in class!</i>

00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:03.127
[gasps]

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.596
[grunts]

00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:11.101
Hey, don't make such a big deal
out of the Five Kage Summit.

00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:14.004
It's just your uncle coming to
meet my stupid old man,
Shikadai.

00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:16.541
It's totally not worth
getting freaked out over.

00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:21.445
Yeah, but you still don't
understand. Uncle Gaara brings
such weird gifts.

00:03:21.478 --> 00:03:23.447
[laughing]

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.685
It's funny, you guys talk about
the Five Kage Summit like it's a
family reunion or something.

00:03:27.718 --> 00:03:29.954
<i>(Wasabi) Whoa, awesome!</i>

00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:31.889
[impressed] Huh?

00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:35.125
Wow, amazing Sarada! You seem
really motivated today!

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.529
I've come to a decision.
I'm going to be Hokage.

00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:40.230
Whoa! Are you serious?

00:03:40.264 --> 00:03:42.232
Well, you've got what it
takes.

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:43.968
Yeah! Go, Lord Eighth!

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:46.403
Did you hear that?

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:49.640
Ha! Wasn't all that long ago,
you were making fun of ninja.

00:03:49.674 --> 00:03:51.976
<i>(Boruto) What prompted the</i>
<i>sudden change of heart?</i>

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.746
Unlike you, I choose not
to be childish anymore.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.815
Hey! What's childish about me?

00:03:57.848 --> 00:04:00.651
You mean, what's not childish
about you?

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:05.389
[grunts] Whatever. Aiming to be
the new Hokage is fine.

00:04:05.422 --> 00:04:11.896
But you can't just hurl some
shuriken. You gotta master a
skill, some kinda special jutsu!

00:04:13.197 --> 00:04:14.098
[grunting]

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:20.037
Oww! Oww!

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.405
That was great.

00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:23.407
Whatever, I hit the
target, didn't I?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.742
That was just lucky.

00:04:24.775 --> 00:04:26.143
Oh, is that right?

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:27.344
[chuckles]

00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:29.914
And what are you laughing
at?

00:04:29.947 --> 00:04:32.750
I was just thinking that the two
of you make a very nice duo.

00:04:33.951 --> 00:04:36.987
Uh, no way!

00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:41.058
Excuse me, it seems you don't
quite get it yet, so I think I
should enlighten you.

00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:42.359
Sarada has...

00:04:42.392 --> 00:04:46.063
Hey, Cho‐Cho! I'm so
thirsty. Let's go get
some water, come on!

00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:48.332
What was that about?

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:49.634
Uhh, dunno.

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:52.302
Ehh, forget them. Listen up!

00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.740
<i>(Inojin) Graffiti the Great</i>
<i>Stone Faces?</i>

00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:57.942
Shh! Keep your voice
down, kay!

00:04:57.975 --> 00:05:01.846
You already did that before.
That's like, so unoriginal.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.616
Well, a true artist sticks to
the style that he knows best?

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.818
And my last attempt lacked
a little something.

00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:12.690
But this time, I'm way more
prepared. I plan to create an
outright masterpiece!

00:05:12.723 --> 00:05:14.692
Art? Yeah, sure.

00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:18.863
Alright! Inojin, you're
good at art, so you can
help me out, right?

00:05:18.896 --> 00:05:20.931
No! That's so lame.

00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:26.771
Just forget it, man. The Five
Kage Summit is today! Village
security is way too tight.

00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:30.240
Yeah, but that's the
whole point!

00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:33.143
Being a shinobi means
outsmarting your enemies and
succeeding no matter what right?

00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:36.446
Nah, sounds like a
drag. Sorry, I'm out.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.049
Good luck, Boruto. See
ya.

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.451
[groans]

00:05:41.485 --> 00:05:45.489
Why are you keeping your
Sharingan such a big
secret?

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:49.493
Mom said if I don't keep it
under wraps, then I might get
targeted again.

00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:54.131
Also, I'm thinking it'll be so
much more fun to master the
thing first.

00:05:54.164 --> 00:05:57.334
So afterward I can rub it
in that idiot's face.

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:00.337
There she is, the Evil Sarada!

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.541
Yeah but anyway, I still want to
get better at it so...

00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:06.376
will you help me with
training after school? Or are
you busy?

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.348
Aw, I'm sorry, I have to train
with my dad today. Maybe ask
your mom?

00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:14.952
I can't, she doesn't
have the time right now.

00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:17.187
<i>(Sarada) We just moved into a</i>
<i>new place...</i>

00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:21.058
<i>and she's barely even had</i>
<i>the time to start unpacking</i>
<i>boxes.</i>

00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:28.866
Stupid me. Why didn't I
bother to label these
things? [groans]

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:30.935
We're here in front of the
Hokage's Office.

00:06:30.968 --> 00:06:35.272
The air is filled with tension
that only the start of the Five
Kage Summit can create.

00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:38.543
Spit it out, man! You know you
owe me an explanation!

00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:40.077
Fine, here you go!

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.945
[growling]

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:43.681
You guys, please
stop, we're in public!

00:06:43.714 --> 00:06:45.049
<i>(Reporter) Oh my!</i>

00:06:45.082 --> 00:06:45.883
Huh?

00:06:48.452 --> 00:06:49.654
<i>[cheering]</i>

00:06:49.687 --> 00:06:51.822
<i>(Metal) There! There he is!</i>

00:06:51.856 --> 00:06:54.024
The Fifth Raikage, Darui!

00:06:54.058 --> 00:06:56.493
Kind of a showoff, if you
ask me.

00:06:56.527 --> 00:07:01.632
When the previous Raikage
tragically lost his left arm, he
trusted Darui's abilities...

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:05.469
so much he is known to have
said, "Who needs a left arm,

00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:09.907
when I have a mighty right hand
man as you!" Those words are a
testament to his worthiness!

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.144
Right hand man? Still, nobody
compares to Lord Hokage.

00:07:17.882 --> 00:07:21.018
<i>(Metal) It is the Sixth</i>
<i>Mizukage, Chojuro!</i>

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.723
One of the great, powerful Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist from
the Hidden Mist Village.

00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:30.360
When he wields the Ninja blade,
Hiramekarei he has no mortal
equal!

00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:35.566
A sword? So that means when it
comes to ninjutsu, no one can
touch Lord Hokage.

00:07:39.837 --> 00:07:41.205
[cheering]

00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:45.710
<i>(Metal) Wow, it is really her!</i>
<i>The Fourth Tsuchikage.</i>

00:07:45.743 --> 00:07:49.647
There is a legend that even when
<i>confronted by 100,000 Zetsu,</i>
<i>she never flinched.</i>

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.649
<i>And the legend still stands!</i>

00:07:51.682 --> 00:07:53.518
<i>(Metal) And for that I must</i>
<i>say...</i>

00:07:53.551 --> 00:07:55.452
Go, Big Sister Kurotsuchi!

00:07:55.485 --> 00:08:01.125
I'll admit, If they battled
using Lord Hokage's Sexy Jutsu,
that would make a great match.

00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:01.992
I'd watch.

00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:11.936
<i>(Metal) Here we go! The Fifth</i>
<i>Kazekage, Lord Gaara!</i>

I can't believe he's Shikadai's
uncle, it's such a waste!

00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:30.855
I know, so unfair! [crying]

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:36.561
Hey, Mom! I'm home! [gasps]

00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:39.697
It's not in here, either!

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.832
What are you looking for
in there, Mom?

00:08:41.866 --> 00:08:46.336
I can't find the claim ticket
for the last photograph you and
I took.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.773
Do you know which
box it might be in?

00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:52.442
Uh‐uh, but that's why I
said to label the boxes.

00:08:52.476 --> 00:08:54.111
Oh, come on.

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:58.048
[giggles] Tadah!

00:08:58.482 --> 00:09:00.685
When did you?

00:09:00.718 --> 00:09:03.554
I knew that it was important to
you, so I got it earlier.

00:09:05.022 --> 00:09:06.657
<i>(Sarada) [giggles]</i>

00:09:08.325 --> 00:09:09.493
There!

00:09:09.527 --> 00:09:12.096
What a wonderful photo!

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:13.664
Mmhmm.

00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:15.700
Oh, are you going out?

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:17.635
Yeah, I have to be somewhere
now.

00:09:17.668 --> 00:09:21.706
Wait, what? You're not going to
stay here and help me?

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:24.509
I'll help when I get
back, okay? Bye!

00:09:24.542 --> 00:09:27.011
[sighs]

00:09:27.044 --> 00:09:30.414
The Fourth Great Ninja
War ended fifteen years
ago.

00:09:30.447 --> 00:09:35.219
And ever since that fateful,
historic battle, many children
have been born.

00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:39.657
<i>(Naruto) Not only the Land of</i>
<i>Fire, but all Five Nations</i>
<i>survived without...</i>

<i>excessive upheaval, thanks to</i>
everyone's perseverance and hard
<i>work.</i>

00:09:45.863 --> 00:09:51.636
We, the Five Kage, will continue
to stand united and protect the
peace we all strove to win.

00:09:51.669 --> 00:09:53.303
<i>[cheering]</i>

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:55.172
[chuckles]

00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:02.479
[grunts] Come on! I wasn't ready
for that!

00:10:02.513 --> 00:10:06.216
Hey, I'm helping you, so
quit whining and get
ready!

00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:08.653
Uh!

00:10:09.153 --> 00:10:10.688
<i>(Sarada) I see it!</i>

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:13.591
[grunts] Now I'm annoyed!

00:10:15.359 --> 00:10:16.160
Huh?

00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:20.164
[giggles] That's Shadow Clone
Jutsu.

00:10:20.197 --> 00:10:26.070
Sharingan lets you copy someone
else's jutsu? That's so
convenient. No fair.

00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:29.907
But still, I have a ways to go
before I master it.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.410
(Sarada) [sighs] Wait a second,
<i>I feel dizzy.</i>

00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:35.813
[shaky breaths]

00:10:35.846 --> 00:10:37.114
Sarada!

00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:42.452
Konohamaru Sensei!

00:10:42.486 --> 00:10:43.688
[sighs]

00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:45.389
I wondered who would come all
the way out here to train...

00:10:45.422 --> 00:10:47.391
wouldn't have guessed it was you
two!

00:10:49.627 --> 00:10:51.529
The Sharingan, huh?

00:10:51.562 --> 00:10:55.099
Yeah. Is there anything about it
that can you teach me?

00:10:55.132 --> 00:11:00.137
<i>(Konohamaru) Well you are a</i>
<i>child of the Uchiha. So it's</i>
<i>only natural you'd be curious.</i>

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.673
Get over yourself
and help her out!

00:11:02.707 --> 00:11:06.611
In general, there are three
things unique to the Sharingan.

00:11:06.644 --> 00:11:10.014
<i>(Konohamaru) The first one is</i>
<i>superior kinetic vision.</i>

00:11:11.582 --> 00:11:16.420
Second, is the power to analyze
a jutsu structure, copy it, and
make it your own.

00:11:16.453 --> 00:11:19.990
Although the ability won't work
with extremely high‐level
jutsu...

00:11:20.024 --> 00:11:21.959
or those that depend on
peculiar traits.

00:11:21.992 --> 00:11:23.493
Oh, I see.

00:11:23.528 --> 00:11:25.730
And the third is powerful
genjutsu.

00:11:25.763 --> 00:11:29.934
Specifically, being capable of
causing someone else to see
illusions.

00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:33.170
<i>(Konohamaru) Of course, any</i>
<i>average shinobi can use</i>
<i>genjutsu...</i>

00:11:33.203 --> 00:11:36.173
<i>but the Sharingan renders</i>
<i>it even more effective.</i>

00:11:36.974 --> 00:11:39.043
That's so awesome!

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:42.980
(Konohamaru) However, because
the Sharingan consumes so much
chakra, you must be cautious...

00:11:43.013 --> 00:11:46.150
<i>and try to conserve your</i>
<i>energy, or it'll tap you out,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:48.986
So that's why I got so
dizzy.

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:51.221
Huh? What are you
talking about?

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:52.857
It's nothing, never mind!

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.460
Sarada, now you're one step
closer to becoming the Hokage!

00:11:56.493 --> 00:11:58.328
Cho‐Cho!

00:11:58.362 --> 00:12:01.866
Really? Aiming to become the
next Hokage, are you?

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:07.137
Oh, I, uh, yeah!

00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:12.142
Got it. Then I suppose I look
forward to being your rival!

00:12:12.543 --> 00:12:13.911
You too, Sensei?

00:12:13.944 --> 00:12:15.412
Of course, me too!

00:12:15.445 --> 00:12:18.949
Since I was a kid, I've idolized
Big Brother Naruto...

00:12:18.983 --> 00:12:21.451
and sharpened my skills to be
just like him!

00:12:21.485 --> 00:12:24.121
Cool, but I'm still
gonna beat you.

00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:30.561
Becoming the Hokage will be
tougher than I thought. I mean,
with you and Boruto around.

00:12:30.595 --> 00:12:35.199
Uh, that idiot told me he has
no interest in becoming
the Hokage.

00:12:35.232 --> 00:12:37.535
I'm not so sure about
that.

00:12:37.568 --> 00:12:38.536
Huh?

00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:44.441
(Konohamaru) See, I believe he's
<i>just frustrated that everyone</i>
<i>sees him...</i>

00:12:44.474 --> 00:12:47.578
<i>only as the Hokage's son.</i>

00:12:47.612 --> 00:12:51.015
After all, I grew up the
grandson of the Third Hokage...

00:12:51.048 --> 00:12:53.551
so I can truly understand how he
feels.

00:12:53.584 --> 00:12:56.386
Then, I guess I have my work
cut out for me.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.389
I'll just beat that bratty
attitude right out of him.

00:12:59.423 --> 00:13:02.627
And as a daughter from the
famous Ino‐Shika‐Cho trio...

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.730
surely you must understand too,
right, Cho‐Cho?

00:13:05.763 --> 00:13:07.798
Hmm, not really. [chewing]

00:13:07.832 --> 00:13:09.333
[uncomfortable laugh]

00:13:09.366 --> 00:13:12.803
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Well, sorry, I gotta</i>
<i>go train now, bye.</i>

00:13:12.837 --> 00:13:15.940
[laughs] Okay. Thank you!

00:13:15.973 --> 00:13:20.845
Yeah, so anyway, a friend you
can compete with is also a very
dependable friend to have...

00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:21.812
wouldn't you say?

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:23.447
Yes.

00:13:28.118 --> 00:13:30.688
We're going into a
closed session now.

00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:32.957
[disappointed sighs]

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:38.462
[sighs] Alright, let's get to
the real agenda, yes?

00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:45.235
I'm wondering why I don't
see Sasuke here.

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:50.140
You called us all here to
discuss something regarding his
mission, I recall.

00:13:50.174 --> 00:13:52.376
Sasuke has already left the
Village.

00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:56.013
This is a serious
situation that calls for quick
action.

00:13:56.046 --> 00:13:58.215
What are you getting at?

00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:03.287
(Naruto) It's about our Shinobi
<i>world.</i>

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.525
I fear, we're about to face
a brand new peril.

00:14:13.698 --> 00:14:17.434
Well, don't keep us in
the dark, tell us.

00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:24.408
Regarding Danzo Shimura of the
Nue incident, as well as Shin
Uchiha, who I recently fought.

00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:27.244
Turns out, there's a common
factor that keeps showing up...

00:14:27.277 --> 00:14:29.814
in the materials that they
left behind.

00:14:29.847 --> 00:14:33.718
An account... that a parallel
dimension exists.

00:14:34.484 --> 00:14:36.153
I'm sorry?

00:14:36.186 --> 00:14:41.792
Isn't that the same thing Sasuke
has been investigating? Are they
connected in some way?

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.464
Kaguya, the one Sasuke and I
sealed away back then...

00:14:47.497 --> 00:14:50.635
was backed by a terrifying,
powerful army.

00:14:50.668 --> 00:14:54.271
<i>(Chojuro) You mean the White</i>
<i>Zetsu that Madara mobilized?</i>

00:14:54.304 --> 00:14:56.440
<i>They sure gave us a ton</i>
<i>of trouble.</i>

00:14:56.473 --> 00:14:59.343
Kaguya herself was definitely
formidable enough.

00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:03.914
But the fact that she was
fortified by the White Zetsu
army really worried a lot of us.

00:15:03.948 --> 00:15:09.186
But didn't she require them in
order to face down the Shinobi
Allied Forces?

00:15:09.219 --> 00:15:11.889
No, apparently, that was
not the case.

00:15:11.922 --> 00:15:16.727
This is what we found. In
reality, the White Zetsu were
conceived and created...

00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:20.130
long before we shinobi were born
into this world.

00:15:20.164 --> 00:15:22.499
What? But how is that
possible?

00:15:22.533 --> 00:15:26.370
And if what you say is
true, what purpose does
it serve?

00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:31.475
<i>(Naruto) We've only gathered a</i>
<i>little intel thus far. But it</i>
<i>hints at this:</i>

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:36.380
Soon, a different entity, even
more dangerous and frightening
than Kaguya...

00:15:36.413 --> 00:15:38.616
will make its appearance in
this world.

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:39.750
[gasps]

00:15:52.196 --> 00:15:54.398
You're the Hokage, huh.

00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:58.102
Someday, I'll be one of these
Great Stone Faces.

00:15:58.135 --> 00:16:00.905
Uh, Boruto?

00:16:01.672 --> 00:16:04.642
A foe more powerful
than Kaguya?

00:16:04.675 --> 00:16:08.579
And you think that's
why the White Zetsu Army
was created?

00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:11.115
Well, what other purpose
could there be?

00:16:11.148 --> 00:16:16.587
And you were investigating
something as vitally important
as this without our knowledge?

00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:19.123
That was rather sneaky
I have to say.

00:16:19.156 --> 00:16:23.894
I'm sorry, but until we
had real proof, I had to
maintain secrecy.

00:16:23.928 --> 00:16:25.663
But something like this?

00:16:25.696 --> 00:16:28.666
While we may all be at peace
now, that doesn't mean...

00:16:28.699 --> 00:16:32.302
the ravages of war have been
completely erased from our
minds.

00:16:32.336 --> 00:16:35.673
And how do we explain
this to our people?

00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:38.976
Just thinking about this
makes me feel dull.

00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:44.381
I can't fathom that this could
be false intel, a cruel prank
intended to fuel unrest.

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:49.019
"The future ought to
stay bright."

00:16:49.053 --> 00:16:51.689
That's what Sasuke said.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.331
How much time remains
until we can expect this
new enemy to appear?

00:17:01.365 --> 00:17:08.172
Perhaps a few months or even
years. Maybe more. The truth is
we don't know yet.

00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:11.509
[sighs] That doesn't bode well.

00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:18.182
[sighs] Yes, bad enough during
our generation. Even worse, if
it falls on the next one.

00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:20.150
What do you mean by that?

00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:21.852
[sighs]

00:17:23.387 --> 00:17:26.123
Difficult to say, but I
will.

00:17:26.156 --> 00:17:31.061
The generation coming up
behind us is, frankly,
just not up to par.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.437
The once‐tense past between the
Five Great Nations has now
changed.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.807
Every village shares the valid
concern...

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.243
about the lack of real life
skills among the young people.

00:17:46.276 --> 00:17:51.582
Shin Uchiha thought that for
true evolution, conflict is
essential to the selection...

00:17:51.616 --> 00:17:55.586
of superior genes, and I regret
he may have a point.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:02.159
Our generation united together
as the Allied Shinobi Force.
That's why we won the great war.

00:18:02.192 --> 00:18:03.994
<i>(Kurotsuchi) But there's no</i>
<i>built‐in guarantee...</i>

00:18:04.028 --> 00:18:06.831
<i>that the next generation is</i>
<i>capable of repeating that.</i>

00:18:06.864 --> 00:18:11.135
And that's why we have to be the
ones who destroy any existence
that surpasses Kaguya now...

00:18:11.168 --> 00:18:17.441
or there will be agony extending
far beyond our powers and worst
fears.

00:18:20.678 --> 00:18:21.546
Hmm?

00:18:23.413 --> 00:18:25.750
You sure have lots of free time.

00:18:25.783 --> 00:18:28.519
Oh, great. Sarada. Dang
it.

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:34.659
Don't you have an opinion about
this whole situation, Gaara?

00:18:35.726 --> 00:18:38.563
Can't live up to this
generation.

00:18:38.596 --> 00:18:42.166
Is there any generation that
hasn't been compared that way?

00:18:42.466 --> 00:18:43.634
[gasps]

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:47.337
Wouldn't you agree, Naruto?

00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:49.640
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:58.282
Stop. I won't let you deface the
Hokage!

00:18:58.315 --> 00:19:03.588
What do you care? They're
useless, old‐fashioned, and
totally embarrassing!

00:19:03.621 --> 00:19:07.825
Lord Seventh told me that
everyone in the entire village
is so close...

00:19:07.858 --> 00:19:09.860
they're just like family to him!

00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:12.530
What a load of crap! The
guy's all talk.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.267
[scoffs]

00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:21.806
War's not the only kind of
conflict there is.

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:27.612
We can battle and compete with
friends, and hone our skills. We
can grow stronger.

00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:32.917
Just think about all of that for
a moment. Surely you can relate,
right?

00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:43.093
[gasps]

00:19:43.127 --> 00:19:45.596
<i>(Naruto) It's true, the era in</i>
<i>which we fought is much</i>
<i>different from today.</i>

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.934
<i>But still, I don't think it's</i>
<i>fair or accurate to say these</i>
<i>kids are weak.</i>

00:19:49.967 --> 00:19:52.970
They're still young buds, just
waiting to bloom.

00:19:53.003 --> 00:19:56.306
But someday, they'll surpass us
as shinobi.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.777
<i>(Naruto) And they'll fill this</i>
<i>village with the fresh, green</i>
<i>leaves of growth...</i>

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:04.081
<i>which means fresh new hope. I</i>
<i>have faith in that.</i>

00:20:08.052 --> 00:20:09.119
[gasps]

00:20:09.153 --> 00:20:09.920
[grunts]

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.288
Heh!

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:12.222
Uh!

00:20:13.323 --> 00:20:15.726
[grunting]

00:20:19.396 --> 00:20:24.168
[panting] I gotta admit, Sarada,
I'm a little shocked.

00:20:24.201 --> 00:20:28.305
[panting] You want to keep
going or what?

00:20:31.041 --> 00:20:33.744
Eh, Huh?

00:20:33.778 --> 00:20:37.982
No way, any more and it might
kill me! But let's pick it up
again soon.

00:20:41.686 --> 00:20:44.789
[chuckles] Then it's a draw.

00:20:46.524 --> 00:20:48.225
[gasps]

00:20:48.258 --> 00:20:52.096
Ha ha! I win as always! See ya!

00:20:52.597 --> 00:20:53.831
Hmph!

00:20:54.298 --> 00:20:56.066
[panting] Hey!

00:20:57.001 --> 00:20:57.868
Hmm?

00:20:57.902 --> 00:21:00.437
Lord Seventh! I have bad news!

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.873
<i>(Moegi) It's the Great Stone</i>
<i>Faces.</i>

00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:12.683
[chuckles]

00:21:16.386 --> 00:21:18.455
[chuckles]

00:21:18.488 --> 00:21:21.358
What am I gonna do with
that kid?!

00:21:21.391 --> 00:21:26.697
One thing's for sure. He might
become a shinobi who outshines
us.

00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:28.633
Coward! Come back!

00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:31.902
I'm okay with being a
coward. I totally own it!

00:21:36.206 --> 00:21:39.510
Wait! That's kind of a
cowardly move, isn't it?

00:21:39.544 --> 00:21:42.547
But you said you were okay with
that, right?

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.084
<i>(Boruto) Fine! I guess this</i>
<i>calls for a Sexy Jutsu, then!</i>

00:21:47.117 --> 00:21:50.721
What exactly is that? I'll
pulverize whoever came up with
it!

00:21:50.755 --> 00:21:52.222
(Boruto) Hey, wait! What are you
<i>doing?</i>

00:21:52.256 --> 00:21:54.992
I still think they make a
very good duo.

00:21:55.025 --> 00:21:56.627
<i>(Boruto) Gimme a break! I'm</i>
<i>gonna die!</i>

00:21:56.661 --> 00:21:58.362
(Sarada) No you won't, you'll be
<i>fine!</i>

00:21:58.395 --> 00:21:59.129
<i>(Boruto) Stop it!</i>

00:21:59.163 --> 00:22:00.731
<i>(Sarada) Boruto!</i>

00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:51.208
<i>(Shino) For the first time, we</i>
<i>will conduct a field trip</i>
<i>outside the village.</i>

00:23:51.241 --> 00:23:53.477
<i>Everyone must exercise extreme</i>
<i>caution.</i>

00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:56.714
<i>(Shikadai) The Land of Water,</i>

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.487
<i>(Shino) If something does</i>

00:24:03.521 --> 00:24:07.324
(Boruto) Well, if I have any say

<i>liven things up.</i>

00:24:07.357 --> 00:24:13.063
Next time, on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "The Turbulent</i>
<i>Field Trip."</i>

00:24:13.097 --> 00:24:15.499
<i>(Shikadai) I got a bad feeling</i>
