WEBVTT

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:10.077
(suspenseful music)

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.046
(groaning)

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.120
But why?

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.991
(groans) No, don't do it!

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.728
(grunts confusedly)

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.762
Why, you.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.432
No way, Tosaka, why?

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.937
I made an extract
from the tranquilizer

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.739
that Orochimaru created.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.009
And as expected, it works.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.946
You mean, you took
the injectors.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.649
(chuckles)

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.985
(suspenseful music)

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.620
This is becoming a real pain.

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:58.025
(laughs) And now you're
going to become my prey.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.364
(suspenseful music continues)

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:07.534
Okay, Wasabi, Namida,
just stay back, you guys.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.940
My, my, your love for
your team is beautiful.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.508
And it's thanks to that,

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.111
that I'm going to get to
stalk my pray once again.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:22.015
But this time, I'll
protect them for sure.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.951
Well, I hope you're
going to make this

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:25.752
at least a little exciting.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:29.957
The anticipation
is making me drool.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.060
(air whooshing)

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.066
(groaning)

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.103
(chuckling)

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.375
(suspenseful music continues)

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.848
I'm sorry to say it, but,

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.483
your friends aren't
going to be coming

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.051
to save you this time.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:02.322
I see, this means
that you're their-

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:04.525
(giggles)

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:13.433
(Opening theme music)

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:29.349
(Opening theme music)

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:43.423
(Opening theme music)

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.500
No way, so this whole
thing being a mission

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.569
was a lie from the very
beginning. (groans)

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:59.773
[Tosaka] I simply had no
choice but to join up with you.

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.775
I had dispatched
some men ahead of me,

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:05.045
but unfortunately they were
captured at the border.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.814
(groans)

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:10.450
(giggles) But everything
ended up all right.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:15.622
After all, I was able to
observe Jugo up close.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:17.124
(groans) What was that?

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:19.426
You were after his
Curse Mark all along.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.864
Exactly, Jugo's Curse Mark
is undoubtedly the original.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.499
It's very rare.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:28.969
We tried so hard before and
had such little success.

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.471
And now, finally!

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:34.074
Boruto, you must've sensed it

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.610
when Jugo underwent Curse
Mark transformation.

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:40.147
The infinite power and
potential of the Curse Mark.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.049
It's just awe-inspiring!

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:44.251
On top of that,

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.587
there's still so much we don't
know about the Curse Mark.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.158
It's... It's the very best
research subject ever!

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.160
So you seriously believe

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:55.963
you can just use Jugo
however you want?

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:57.965
Well, you said it
yourself, Boruto,

00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:59.967
Nothing wrong being a dreamer.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.969
You see? I'm no
different than you.

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:03.470
What'd you say?

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:07.407
I have a dream, to create the
ultimate Curse Mark weapon.

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:10.143
And to do that, it was
absolutely essential

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:12.312
that I get a sample from Jugo.

00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:16.083
(groans) And that's the
reason you got close to him?

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.452
It wasn't only that! (chuckles)

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.453
Listen to this,

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.055
I even set up the
bait to lure him out.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:25.826
The bait?

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:26.960
You mean?

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.996
Yes. I was the one
who infected the birds

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.964
with a new type of Curse Mark.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.100
Imagine all the
trouble I went through.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.770
Now you know just
how passionate I am

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.071
about all my research.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:39.573
Stop messing around.

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:42.943
You don't know how hard Jugo
tried to save the birds!

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:45.913
All my efforts are about
to come to fruition!

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:48.315
With a sample from Jugo,
I'll be able to complete

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.951
the most powerful
Curse Mark weapon!

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:52.419
It's just so thrilling!

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:56.056
The power of science will
finally control the Curse Mark.

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:59.860
(suspenseful music)

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:04.565
-(whistling)
-(groaning)

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.903
Can you please cut this
conversation short, Doctor?

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:12.439
I'm sorry, I simply
get carried away

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.608
when I talk about
the Curse Mark.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:16.076
We couldn't care
less about that.

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.813
All we're concerned with
is the bounty on that guy.

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.315
Why, you!

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:24.251
We'll get the boat ready so
we can set sail immediately.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.653
Doctor, you bring
Jugo when you're done.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.356
Yes, I'll head out soon.

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:33.961
(chuckles) Well, you heard it!

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:36.063
I no longer have
any need for you.

00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:37.998
Oh, wait, I know!

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:40.868
Hey, Boruto, first,
how 'bout this?

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.504
I'll show you guys
my final test.

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:45.639
(groans)

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.445
(groans)

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:54.948
This is a very special
formula I developed.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:56.483
(rock music)

00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:59.353
(explosion booms)

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:02.122
-(metal clangs)
-(grunts)

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.057
C'mon, let's do this!

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:06.527
Here ya go!

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.065
Hey, is that all you've got?

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.968
Water Style, Suireiha!

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.839
(chuckles) But the
friends you came to rescue

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:20.641
are wide open right now.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.312
Water Style, Water Wall!

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.783
(grunts)

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:31.084
-Sumire!
-Please stop,

00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:32.953
at this rate, you're gonna be-

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:34.288
Aw, how touching!

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.423
But you should just
ignore those impediments

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:39.259
and then you can focus
everything on fighting.

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:41.628
I won't ever abandon my friends.

00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:43.931
Your friends? (laughing)

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.332
That's just so lame,

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.701
being strong yourself's
all that matters!

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.104
That's the reason why
I seized the power

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:52.573
of the Curse Mark!

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:55.108
Now come on, hurry up and
call your summoning, already!

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.711
Just forget about
your useless friends.

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:05.319
Summoning!

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:09.323
Nue!

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.827
(growls)

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.796
My chakra isn't-

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:16.830
Come on, are you kidding?

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:18.599
What's that supposed to be?

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:22.069
Make me feel at least a
little excited to fight.

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:24.972
(air whooshing)

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:30.544
Now, which one of you
shall I taste first?

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.248
Damn it, she's so fast,
I can't follow her moves.

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:36.316
Please be careful, Miss Karin.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.519
Sumire said that girl's
bite will infect you

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:39.987
with the Curse Mark.

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:44.525
I think that I'm going
to start with you.

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:51.098
-(air whooshing)
-(gasps)

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:58.338
-Damn it, Cha!
-(explosion booms)

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:03.744
I can make out her moves at
least a bit with my Sharingan.

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:07.781
Those eyes really are a
nuisance, but it's all right.

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:11.618
I'm going to sprinkle a whole
lot of spice on you now,

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:13.320
and it's gonna burn!

00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:16.924
-(grunts)
-(growls)

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:20.127
You were way bigger the
last time we fought.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.830
A little runt like you
is just no fun at all!

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:26.633
(grunts)

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.435
I'll flatten you.

00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:29.236
Nue!

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:34.074
-(rock music)
-(grunts)

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:37.978
(air whooshing)

00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.315
(chuckles wryly) You
missed entirely. (grunts)

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:44.852
-(breathing heavily)
-(growls)

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:47.154
This is all so boring.

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:50.958
(sighs) Fine, that's
it, I'm done with you.

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:53.460
I'm gonna erase you completely.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.029
(screeches)

00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:02.803
(breathing heavily)

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:04.037
Namida!

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.342
(groans) That was annoying.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.544
(grunts)

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:16.250
Thank goodness, you're better!

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.919
The serum, it's finally
starting to work.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.587
Thanks so much, Sumire.

00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:22.990
And now it's our turn
to protect our friend!

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:25.259
Yeah, that's more like it.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:28.362
Looks like things are
finally getting exciting!

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.664
(growling)

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:34.501
(heavy rock music)

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:38.105
My, my, just how long
can you keep this up?

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.207
At this rate, my chakra will-

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:45.913
Got it!

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:48.348
I'm able to use my jutsu
to sense her chakra.

00:10:48.382 --> 00:10:49.616
Which means-

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.052
Now I can sense where
she's gonna be coming from!

00:10:53.654 --> 00:10:56.623
You're almost ready to eat now.

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:58.725
-The right!
-(grunts)

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.530
From here on out,
no more biting.

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:07.467
(chuckles)

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:15.475
-(grunts)
-(explosion booms)

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.178
(groans)

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:19.213
Sarada!

00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:22.783
(air whooshing)

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:23.984
I'm not done eating!

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.390
(groans)

00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:34.161
Let me go!

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.996
You okay, Sarada?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.065
Miss Karin, amazing.

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.268
C'mon, we have to stop her.

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:43.337
(groans)

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:47.241
Quick, bite my arm.

00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:49.676
You're almost out of
chakra now, aren't you?

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.078
But-

00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:53.814
Biting me will repair all of
the damage you've sustained.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.250
That's what my
special ability is.

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:57.784
Wait, hold on, if I do that,

00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:00.621
it means that you're gonna be
sharing your chakra with me,

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:02.256
isn't that right?

00:12:02.289 --> 00:12:04.925
If you do that, and you
run out of chakra, then-

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.693
Oh, don't be so naive!

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:10.430
Listen, The Chakra Chain
that I'm using right now

00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:12.599
isn't going to be able
to hold her forever.

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:15.469
And if I run out of chakra,
then she'll get us both.

00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:19.773
(laughing) I'll get a
taste of you real soon!

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:21.408
We can't waste any more time.

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:24.444
Sarada, you're gonna have to
hit her with all of your power.

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:27.381
That's the best plan, it's
the only way to defeat her.

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:30.117
(uplifting music)

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.054
A long time ago, your mother,
Sakura, saved my life.

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:37.991
When you go home, tell her,

00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:40.661
That I've repaid my debt to her.

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:46.099
(uplifting music continues)

00:12:46.133 --> 00:12:51.038
-(grunts)
-(air whooshing)

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.076
From above!

00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:58.645
Bon appetite to me!

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.515
Damn it, Cha!

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:08.155
-(explosion booms)
-(uplifting music continues)

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.971
Sharingan and strength.

00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:26.206
Well, you're
definitely their child.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.709
Let's get back to the village.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:31.712
(groans)

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:36.083
Mr. Jugo!

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:39.353
[Tosaka] Good, it looks
like the compound's working.

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:40.787
Damn it!

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:42.623
What the hell are
you doing to him?

00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:45.826
I injected him with the
opposite of a tranquilizer.

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:48.762
It's more like a trigger
for the Curse Mark.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:52.099
So he should be going on a
violent rampage quite soon.

00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:53.600
Wait, he's what?

00:13:53.634 --> 00:13:55.802
But if that happens, then
no one's gonna be safe,

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:57.070
not even you!

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:59.473
But it's necessary,
the final test,

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.608
is to see Jugo in
full-power mode.

00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:04.478
Come on, quit talking
nonsense, would ya?

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:08.182
Mr. Jugo! (groans)

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.785
I can't believe that
you're still so feisty.

00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:13.153
(grunts)

00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:15.155
Damn it, I can't move.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:17.791
I gotta do something
or this'll be bad!

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.626
Just behave, you two, alright?

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.564
You're both witnesses to an
extremely important experiment.

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:27.034
(groans)

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:35.142
-(crickets chirping)
-(feet pattering)

00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:39.746
I found you, Konohamaru Sensei.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.616
Mitsuki, that's great.

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:44.451
Let's rendezvous
with the others.

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:45.252
Right now, they're-

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.921
No, we have to hurry downriver.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:49.590
Wait, what do you mean?

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:52.893
We have to go stop those guys
from the investigative team.

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:55.028
They have a boat, it's
anchored downriver

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:57.030
and acts as their home base.

00:14:57.798 --> 00:14:59.199
It's not only the birds.

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:01.969
The damage has spread to
some of the villagers, too.

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.072
We have to make sure
we stop the infection

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:06.640
from spreading any further.

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:08.642
I think that at their base camp,

00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:11.478
we should be able to find
a way to save everyone.

00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:17.150
-(grunts)
-(intense music)

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:20.120
(sighs)

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:25.125
(sighs) This is boring.

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:29.630
I thought I'd get a little
more excitement from this.

00:15:29.663 --> 00:15:34.535
-(yelps)
-(grunts)

00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:38.005
Damn it, how is
this guy so strong?

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:41.241
All of you guys are
such lightweights.

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:43.177
I don't think you can
entertain me at all

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.879
with weak jutsu like those.

00:15:45.913 --> 00:15:48.849
Well, if I can't have any fun.

00:15:48.882 --> 00:15:52.085
(grunts confusedly)

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:53.587
Just stay down!

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:56.023
(growls)

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:57.257
Damn it, so annoying!

00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:00.327
(grunts)

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:07.568
Come on, not that again.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.105
(grunts) Where did they go now?

00:16:18.946 --> 00:16:22.382
(sighs) We have to do
something right now.

00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:23.417
But what?

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:25.652
Hey, Sumire.

00:16:26.787 --> 00:16:28.021
Do you think there's a way

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:30.090
that you can turn
Nue giant again?

00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:32.492
So sorry, guys.

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:34.895
But I don't think that Nue's
chakra has recovered enough

00:16:34.928 --> 00:16:36.897
to do that quite yet.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.066
There's a lot of
chakra right here.

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:41.034
No, Wasabi, I couldn't.

00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:43.403
I can't extract chakra
from my friends.

00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:45.506
We can only defeat that
guy's crazy strength

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:48.008
with something
that's even stronger.

00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:51.111
I think that a giant Nue
would be able to do that.

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:54.915
No, I can't, I can't!

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:56.750
[Namida] We have faith in you!

00:16:57.818 --> 00:16:58.852
Namida!

00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:01.355
I know that we're gonna be okay.

00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:04.024
Really, We aren't
worried one little bit!

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:07.094
But, I, I just-

00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:08.829
Hey, don't stress out so much.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:12.232
If we can't beat him now,
we're goners anyway, right?

00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:15.469
So, I want you to give this
all you've got, Sumire!

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.274
Nue!

00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:26.079
(heavy rock music)

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:31.418
Nue!

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:41.428
(chuckles)

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.466
Hey, you guys? Thank you.

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:51.772
(heavy rock music continuing)

00:17:51.805 --> 00:17:54.174
(grunts confusedly)

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.410
(breathing heavily)

00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:58.712
Saves me the trouble
of hunting you down-.

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:03.750
Just what do you think
you're going to do

00:18:03.784 --> 00:18:05.452
in that sorry state?

00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:07.588
(growls)

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.760
(laughing) So you
finally showed up!

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:16.330
(growling)

00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:21.602
You're getting me all excited
for this fight, however,

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:25.439
With the power I have,
I'm not gonna lose.

00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:31.578
And I'm gonna
crush you! (grunts)

00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:34.548
-Nue!
-(growling)

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:36.650
(groans)

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:38.986
Damn it!

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.122
(growling)

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:44.892
Go, Nue.

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:47.728
Why, you! (gasps)

00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:52.766
-(groans)
-(rock music continues)

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:07.614
-(sighs)
-(growling)

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.284
Nue, no, stop!

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.189
Nue, why?

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:17.891
(grunts confusedly)

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:19.159
[Namida] Thanks, Sumire.

00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:23.430
Wasabi, Namida!

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:27.868
You did it, Your power
was awesome, too, Nue!

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.636
(gasps) Something wrong?

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:32.739
(sighs)

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.076
(groans)

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.548
(chuckles)

00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:44.518
(door creaks)

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.020
Hey, just what do you
think you're doing in here?

00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:49.756
How long are you gonna- (gasps)

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.525
(groans)

00:19:51.558 --> 00:19:53.894
Alright, just what's
going on, here?

00:19:53.927 --> 00:19:55.529
This wasn't part of the plan!

00:19:55.562 --> 00:19:58.899
(sighs) What a bunch
of stupid fools.

00:19:58.932 --> 00:20:00.400
What's that?

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:02.569
(groans)

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:07.708
Damn it, there's
no choice, fire!

00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:11.612
-(air whooshing)
-(yelling)

00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:14.781
(bodies thud)

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:16.717
No way, it can't be.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.552
(chuckles wryly)

00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:20.020
Ta-da!

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:23.090
Actually, I'd already
perfected it, (chuckles)

00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:24.791
what do you think?

00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:26.894
This is the ultimate
Curse Mark Weapon,

00:20:26.927 --> 00:20:29.763
made from the data
that I got off Jugo!

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:31.098
Isn't it so wonderful?

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:37.704
-(birds cawing)
-(intense music)

00:20:38.805 --> 00:20:40.040
What's going on?

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.110
The birds are way noisier
than usual. (gasps)

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:48.081
Hey, don't we need to
get to the village now?

00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:50.184
The sky is starting
to get brighter.

00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:52.753
The wild geese could
migrate anytime!

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:54.655
If you're right, this is bad.

00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:57.858
The Curse Marks haven't all
been extracted yet, right?

00:20:57.891 --> 00:21:00.160
I'll make sure, I'll
go to the lake now.

00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:03.730
The Curse Mark could spread
through the whole world.

00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:07.601
That's the one thing we have
to prevent, no matter what.

00:21:07.634 --> 00:21:10.637
(suspenseful music)

00:21:11.572 --> 00:21:12.840
-All right.
-Damn it,

00:21:12.873 --> 00:21:14.541
You realize that
this only happened

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:17.377
because you interfered
with my research.

00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:19.713
(grunting)

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:20.747
Boruto,

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:24.218
Would you like to
see the results

00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:26.286
of my research firsthand?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.289
(groans)

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:33.927
Take Jugo and escape, go on!

00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:36.363
Suigetsu, but you'll-

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:39.099
Oh, right, if I
remember correctly,

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.401
you have a very
interesting jutsu, so.

00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:44.571
(yells)

00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:48.375
Damn it, come on, open!

00:21:48.408 --> 00:21:50.377
Boruto, just stop.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.245
Mr. Jugo?

00:21:51.278 --> 00:21:53.914
Just go on, get away from me!

00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:56.316
(grunts)

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:01.188
(cackling)

00:22:01.221 --> 00:22:02.589
It seems that the preparations

00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:05.259
for the final test
are complete at last.

00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:07.461
(yelling)

00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:16.270
(Ending theme music)

00:23:41.955 --> 00:23:43.257
(intense music)

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.192
[Boruto] Damn it,
what're you trying to do?

00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:47.194
[Tosaka] I want to defeat Jugo,

00:23:47.227 --> 00:23:49.596
who's undergone full
Curse Mark transformation.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.733
To prove my Curse Mark is
the best in the whole world!

00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:53.767
[Boruto] Don't get Jugo involved

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.802
in something as stupid as that!

00:23:55.836 --> 00:23:57.237
[Tosaka] I'm going to make sure

00:23:57.271 --> 00:24:00.574
that you have a front-row
seat to this excellent finale!

00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:01.842
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto,

00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:05.245
Naruto Next Generations,
"Migration Season".

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:08.749
I'm not gonna let you do that,
I'm gonna stop you right now!

00:24:11.752 --> 00:24:16.757
(Ending theme music)
