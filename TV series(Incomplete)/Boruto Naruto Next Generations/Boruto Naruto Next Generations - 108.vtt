WEBVTT

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.178
Ah, now that's the stuff!

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.380
(laughter)

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.350
You just can't help sounding
like an old man, can you?

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.353
It just means that nothing
beats relaxing like this.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.856
Miss Tenten, I really don't
think I can thank you enough

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.691
for bringing me
all of my things.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.260
Oh, don't mention it!

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.228
I was planning on
taking some time off

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.230
to go to a hot spring, anyway.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, I'm just relieved
everything's going so smoothly

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.068
with you and the two sensei.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:39.106
I mean, you know how Guy
Sensei can be, don't you?

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.075
I'm not entirely sure if
I'm fitting in with them,

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.944
but I'm managing somehow.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.479
He's the type to jump right in

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.814
without thinking at all
and stir up trouble,

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:48.982
you know what I mean?

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:52.586
Uh, yeah, I, uh,
sorta get the idea.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.121
Knowing Guy Sensei, I'm sure,

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.958
even now as we're here doing
this, something will...

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.562
(frightened yell)

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.563
Mr. Guy!

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:03.564
That was him!

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:07.267
(frightened, bubbling)

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.302
It just...

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:10.938
It appeared!

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:12.172
A ghost!

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:18.445
(opening theme music)

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:48.168
(opening theme music)

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.550
How is Guy Sensei doing?

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:04.351
He okay?

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.954
Oh, uh, he's sleeping quietly.

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:08.622
And there's something else.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.225
You need to understand
you're a bodyguard,

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:12.626
When there's trouble,

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.562
remember not to rush out
naked like you almost did!

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:16.563
I'm sorry.

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:17.531
I wasn't thinking.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.700
Besides, there's not much you
can do alone

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.235
if Guy Sensei's unconscious.

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:24.538
Especially if Kakashi
Sensei's gone off somewhere.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.672
You rang?

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:26.807
(startled)

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.275
Kakashi Sensei!

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.276
That's me.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.177
C'mon!

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.945
Don't go around
scaring us like that!

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.213
Where have you been, anyway?

00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:36.483
Oh, I went out to buy
hot spring bean jam buns.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:39.353
Please be sure to let me
know when you leave, okay?

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.688
Or else what's the point
of me guarding you?

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.490
Sorry, sorry!

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:46.827
So, earlier I heard from
one of the inn's employees

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.562
that Guy collapsed?

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.063
What's that about?

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:52.366
Well, uh...

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.834
We won't know what
really happened

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.403
until Guy Sensei
regains consciousness,

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.337
but he keeps saying,

00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.939
-it appeared!
-It appeared!

00:03:58.972 --> 00:03:59.940
[Kakashi] What appeared?

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.942
A ghost, he said.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.344
But I think, it was
probably something else

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:06.813
that he just mistook for one.

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.215
No way.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.817
Maybe a ghost really did appear!

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:12.219
Huh?

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.088
I mean, it wouldn't be unusual

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:17.224
for a place like this, right?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.627
This old building, with
its ambience and all.

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:24.097
Especially that room the
two of you are staying in!

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.034
I wouldn't be surprised
one bit if it's haunted.

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:29.303
The ghost!

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.605
There's no such thing as ghosts!

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.408
It'd be a lot more fun
if there were, though!

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.676
No, it wouldn't.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:36.810
Now, listen.

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:38.612
I'm responsible
for security here.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.215
I'm sure that I swept
the room thoroughly.

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.483
I checked the furnishings,
the appliances,

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:46.253
the attic, and beneath
the tatami mats!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.222
There was some trash,
but aside from that,

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.490
I didn't find anything unusual.

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:52.359
Well, maybe you
should look again!

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:55.095
There might be a corpse
plastered behind the wall.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.364
There is not!

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:00.567
Now that you mention it, the
bean jam buns in the room.

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:01.368
[Both] Huh?

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.203
Were all gone before I knew it.

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:05.405
That's why I went
out to buy more.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.473
It's so strange.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:10.077
I figured Guy just ate
them all, but he insisted,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.813
-I didn't eat them!
-I didn't eat them!

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.948
Maybe the ghost was
behind all of it.

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:17.818
Can you please stop
that, Miss Tenten?

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.621
Well, Guy Sensei may
be kind of a weirdo,

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.957
but still, he isn't a
prankster or a liar.

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:27.828
Hmm, you actually do
have a point, there.

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:29.563
I know!

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:30.564
See?

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:31.965
There really is a ghost!

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.966
Okay, we get it!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.368
Look, I'm gonna prove to you

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:36.436
there's no such
thing as a ghost!

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.073
All right, let me be blunt!

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:41.341
Just come clean.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.277
This inn is haunted, isn't it?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.211
(shocked)

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:46.680
Earlier in the detached
room, Guy Sens--

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.549
Our companion saw one.

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:49.516
Not only that,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.419
all of the bean jam buns
disappeared suddenly.

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.687
I'm sorry!

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.289
What a weird question.

00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:56.823
(frightened)

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:57.958
You see?

00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:59.226
She doesn't even
know what to say.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:00.961
There's no such thing as a--

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:04.298
You mean, your friend
actually saw it?

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.432
Huh?

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:06.500
Huh.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.936
Can you tell us more
about it, please?

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.370
It's okay!

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:12.940
We're actually shinobi from
the Hidden Leaf Village, so...

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:14.708
Hey, quiet down, Miss Tenten!

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:18.178
We won't cause any
trouble, I swear.

00:06:20.647 --> 00:06:24.484
This hot spring was first
built back in the feudal era.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:28.055
It was used as a healing retreat
for wounded soldiers then.

00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:30.824
In time, the wars ended,

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:33.827
and it became an
ordinary hot spring inn.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:37.764
But over time, rumors
began to circulate

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:41.301
about our guests seeing a
ghost clad in full armor.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.804
In order to stop the rumors,

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:46.306
a large-scale exorcism
was conducted.

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:49.209
Since then, we've
run our business

00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:51.311
with no problems whatsoever.

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:54.615
However, in the past few days,

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:58.185
some truly strange things have
been happening around here.

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.088
There was a plate of food
that a guest hadn't finished,

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:03.357
and I left it sitting
just right over there.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.693
But then all of a sudden,
it had just disappeared.

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:07.961
It's happened more than once.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:09.429
It's creeping me out!

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:11.231
Mm-hmm.

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.367
There'd be a room that's
supposed to be empty,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.335
and I'd hear a thud from inside

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:17.804
and find bedding scattered
all over the place.

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:20.340
Some guests said that
they saw a figure

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:23.043
that was creeping around
by the outdoor baths.

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:26.547
But when I went to
look, no one was there.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.581
Hmm.

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:34.555
It just has to be a ghost.

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:35.556
I'm sure of it!

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.757
C'mon, there's no way.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.092
An animal probably stuck
its head through the window

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:40.627
and ate the leftover food.

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.964
It's not unusual for stacked-up
bedding to fall over.

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.966
And the figure in
the outdoor baths

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.068
was probably just some
steam, that's all.

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.804
You're just trying to
convince yourself, aren't you?

00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:53.607
We'll simply verify each
incident one by one.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.476
So first, let's go and
check out the kitchen.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.612
Aw, but blaming a
ghost makes everything

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.181
so much more interesting,
don't you think?

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:07.721
Hey, what is this?

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:11.558
Why isn't it bolted down better?

00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:13.060
That's not safe.

00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:17.231
This one's the only statue
on a stone pedestal.

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:19.366
All the rest of them
are made of wood.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:21.802
Well, it's a pretty
large piece of stone.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.804
So maybe this one
just couldn't be moved

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.172
or something like that.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.476
Seems like it means
something, though.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.347
So, why don't you split this
stone with your Chakra Blades?

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.415
Maybe you'll even get cursed!

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:36.216
Stop that!

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.952
Are you being serious right now?

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:39.953
(uncomfortable chuckle)

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:40.954
Of course not!

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:42.623
Just kidding!

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:45.092
Besides, there's no way
I can cut through it.

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.694
That stone's just way too solid.

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:48.829
Seriously?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.064
Are your Chakra Blades
really that dull?

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.367
No, it's not that.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.069
I just haven't been able to
master using them quite yet.

00:08:56.103 --> 00:08:57.471
I don't know, maybe my chakra

00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:59.540
isn't actually compatible
with them or something--

00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:00.574
Hey!

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.442
Guy's awake now.

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:10.551
(cheesy harrumphing chuckle)

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.922
I did not see a ghost!

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:15.923
What?

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:17.624
But you kept groaning about it.

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:20.227
You said, it appeared, a ghost!

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.428
Not me!

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.430
There's no such thing
as a ghost, right?

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:25.599
You probably mistook
something else for one.

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.402
All right, then how do you
explain the bean jam buns

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:30.637
disappearing from
this room, huh?

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:32.005
Bean jam buns?

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.473
What about the outdoor bath?

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:34.474
Or the kitchen?

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:35.609
The bedding storage?

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:37.311
A ghost appeared in all of them!

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:39.880
And now the missing
bean jam buns.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.648
I bet the ghost's
behind that, too!

00:09:41.682 --> 00:09:42.783
No way!

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:45.018
No, that simply couldn't
be what happened!

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:47.020
Stop saying such
illogical things.

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:48.589
Illogical, huh?

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.757
It isn't very often
that we hear that word

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:52.593
come out of your
mouth, Guy Sensei.

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:55.495
You ate all the bean
jam buns, didn't you?

00:09:55.529 --> 00:09:56.530
I didn't!

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:57.764
I swear it wasn't me!

00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.066
Of course not.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.767
It was all the ghost's doing!

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.135
That's not right, either!

00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:04.004
Never mind that now, Kakashi.

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:06.206
Let's go play ping-pong.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.007
Huh?

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.408
Why now all of a sudden?

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:11.178
Because there's a ping-pong
table in the rec room!

00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:14.047
Well, I really wanted
to take a soak now.

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:16.183
But you can take a bath anytime!

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.886
I'm challenging you
to a ping-pong match!

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.288
Let me go take a quick
soak first, okay?

00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:23.624
You can just wait
right here for me.

00:10:23.657 --> 00:10:25.359
But I wanna play right now!

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:26.360
Come on!

00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:27.361
Now!

00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:29.162
So, Guy Sensei?

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:32.900
Is there a reason why you don't
want to stay in this room?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:34.868
Maybe you're scared
to face the ghost

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:37.471
who ate the bean jam buns?

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:38.872
Don't be ridiculous!

00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:41.909
Anyway, lets go play
ping-pong, Kakashi!

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:42.910
Damn it.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.645
I guess I have no choice.

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:48.382
He's really trying way too hard.

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:49.416
Huh?

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:51.818
I've known him a long
time, so I can tell.

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:55.022
Guy Sensei is really freaked
out by this whole ghost thing.

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:56.590
Wasn't it so unnatural?

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:59.226
How he brought up
ping-pong out of the blue?

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:00.294
Uh...

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.429
Well, to tell you the truth,

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:04.898
Mr. Guy always seems
to be acting unnatural.

00:11:04.932 --> 00:11:06.900
But do you really
think it's true?

00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:09.369
Is he actually that
scared of ghosts?

00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:10.771
Yes, absolutely!

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.639
Seriously, he's a scaredy-cat.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:13.874
Wait, what?

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:15.709
A long time ago, he
just blurted out,

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:19.913
taijutsu is useless against
ghosts, it doesn't work!

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:21.481
Oh, I see.

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:22.883
(chuckle)

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.485
I just thought of
something really good.

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.354
It's gonna get busy!

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:28.355
Miss Tenten?

00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:29.389
Hey!

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.625
Ah, Mirai!

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.660
Can you act as our referee?

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:35.295
Who? Me?

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:37.631
Well, Tenten ran away, so...

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:38.632
Huh?

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:39.633
Oh, but...

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.735
You'll do it, won't you?

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:46.974
Uh, sure.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.648
All right!

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:55.649
I feel great!

00:11:55.682 --> 00:11:56.917
I'm ready anytime!

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.619
For sure, I'm gonna...

00:11:58.652 --> 00:11:59.620
Huh?

00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:00.621
Point Kakashi.

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:03.790
Serving while I'm still
warming up, you coward!

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:06.360
Oh, but you said
anytime, didn't you?

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.294
Never mind!

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:09.363
The real match starts now!

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.430
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:13.534
There.

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:15.369
There.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.038
There.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.741
This really isn't the
time to be doing this.

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:21.875
[Guy] Take that!

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:23.277
[Kakashi] Okay.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.613
I really need to investigate
the scene of the crime.

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:27.814
Wait!

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:31.018
The outdoor bath, the kitchen,
the bedding storage room,

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.020
the corridor and
the detached room.

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:35.489
All the places where
the ghost appeared

00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:37.024
face the inner garden.

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:39.359
Ahh!

00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:40.627
Huh?

00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:42.229
Whose was it?

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.397
Sorry?

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.665
Whose point?

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:49.870
I think it was my point.

00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:50.871
Quiet, you!

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:52.139
I'm asking the referee!

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:56.376
Oh, well, uh, I couldn't tell.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.377
What?

00:12:57.411 --> 00:12:58.545
You couldn't?

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:02.449
That's okay.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.152
I say we just call
it a draw for today.

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.020
Wait, no, actually I was--

00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:08.922
Oh well, a draw.

00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:09.923
Too bad.

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:11.491
I was so close!

00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:12.759
Like I said, it was--

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.661
Yep, a draw!

00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:15.762
Okay.

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.297
I obliged you with a game.

00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:19.800
So I'm going to take a soak now.

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.034
Hold on!

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:22.870
Since we've already
used the baths here,

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:24.605
how about trying
out another place?

00:13:24.638 --> 00:13:25.572
Huh?

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:27.441
But the outdoor baths
here are just fine.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:30.410
I mean, it's not that
these are haunted.

00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:32.880
Anyway, let's just
go somewhere else.

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.114
Okay?

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:36.617
Sure, fine.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.018
All right, then!

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:39.353
Let's go!

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:40.354
Hmm.

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.154
What's wrong?

00:13:41.188 --> 00:13:43.056
What's with the serious look?

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.125
Well, the thing is.

00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:50.297
I just had a realization
a moment ago.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.200
All the places where the
so-called ghost has appeared

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.002
are facing the inner garden.

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:57.871
And I'm just wondering if
that might mean something.

00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.039
Hmm.

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:01.041
Is that what you
were thinking about

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.042
while you were refereeing?

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:03.877
Yeah, I'm sorry!

00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:05.879
You really take your job
seriously, don't you?

00:14:05.913 --> 00:14:07.281
Like I told you,

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.917
you don't have to stress
out about it so much.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.019
But, there a quite a few people

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:14.388
who have been troubled
by these incidents.

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:15.189
And besides that,

00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:16.557
I really just want to prove

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.026
that there isn't any
such thing as ghosts.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:21.795
And why do you want to
disprove ghosts so much?

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.163
[Mirai] Huh?

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:25.999
Is there a particular
reason for that?

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.968
Well, uh...

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.171
If ghosts really do exist, then,

00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:33.740
you'd think that my dad
would come and see me,

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:35.475
at least one time, wouldn't he?

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:36.510
Ah.

00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.179
So ghosts must not exist,

00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:41.548
and that's why my
dad hasn't come.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.551
Maybe you just can't see him,

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:47.020
but he's actually
close by, even now.

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:52.292
If I can't see him,
it's meaningless.

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:54.661
Kakashi!

00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:55.696
You coming or not?

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:57.531
Hang on.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.299
I'll be right there.

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:02.636
So this ghost thing,
let's resolve it quickly.

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:04.471
What do you say, kid?

00:15:04.505 --> 00:15:05.472
Right.

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:06.273
Kakashi!

00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:08.509
Guy, I heard you the first time.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:13.247
(uncomfortable chuckle)

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:18.285
A breeze?

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:24.124
This is a...

00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.869
What are you doing out here?

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:38.338
I'm preparing to
catch the ghost.

00:15:38.372 --> 00:15:39.373
Oh?

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:40.874
Where's Tenten?

00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:43.644
Actually, I couldn't
find her anywhere.

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.913
All right.

00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:48.882
I'm gonna uncover who
the ghost really is.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.384
Did you hear that, Guy?

00:15:51.652 --> 00:15:52.753
Okay.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.521
Show us who it is, then.

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:58.358
(sniffing)

00:15:58.392 --> 00:15:59.393
What's burning?

00:16:04.698 --> 00:16:05.699
It's coming.

00:16:06.567 --> 00:16:09.102
(frightened)

00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:14.541
It appeared!

00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:19.346
It worked perfectly!

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:20.647
Miss Tenten?

00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:21.682
What are...

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.390
(yelling)

00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:31.425
Watch out!

00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:35.996
Huh?

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.131
Oh, dear.

00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:48.375
What's your name?

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:51.011
Tatsumi, sir.

00:16:51.044 --> 00:16:53.380
So the ghost was
really you, huh?

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:55.516
I'm sorry!

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.752
Uh, so what is going on?

00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:00.554
I noticed something
a while back,

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:02.556
all of the places where
the ghost appeared

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:05.592
faced the inner garden,
so I had a hunch.

00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:08.996
I guessed that someone might
have been hiding out in here.

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:12.165
And then, purely by chance,

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:14.635
I found a secret passageway
in this building.

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:18.272
I think when the
structure was built,

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:22.476
it was added for security and
as an emergency escape route.

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.278
While investigating,

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:27.281
I discovered signs of human
activity.

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:30.284
So, I set about sealing up
all but one of the entrances

00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:32.786
that led to the passageway.

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:35.022
Then I asked the
employees of the inn

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.890
if they could help me fill up

00:17:36.924 --> 00:17:38.292
the entire passageway
with smoke.

00:17:39.193 --> 00:17:41.161
That way, we'd
force the ghost out

00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:42.429
through the only possible exit.

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:45.265
Which was the one beneath
the statue, right?

00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:49.002
But even though I put
this plan together,

00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:50.704
I certainly didn't
expect Miss Tenten

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:54.741
to show up pretending to
be a ghost the way she did.

00:17:54.775 --> 00:17:57.044
Yeah, why did you
do that, anyway?

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.780
It was just so much
fun watching Guy Sensei

00:17:59.813 --> 00:18:01.181
putting on a brave face.

00:18:01.215 --> 00:18:03.617
So I thought that I
oughta pretend to be

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:04.885
the ghost and scare him.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.453
Still, you didn't have scare us

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:08.555
right at that particular
moment, you know!

00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:11.558
Well, everybody was acting
all quiet and anxious.

00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:14.895
So I kinda figured that
it was now or never!

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.163
Oh, boy.

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:18.532
So, what are you
doing here, Tatsumi?

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:23.437
Well, you see, I
was traveling, and,

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.573
I didn't have any
money left, so I...

00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:29.576
At first, I just wanted
to find a place to sleep,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.546
so I snuck into the
bedding storage room.

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.415
And then you stumbled upon
the secret passageway?

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.818
Yes.

00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:40.787
Should we have the Land of
Steam take her into custody?

00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:41.788
Oh, please, no!

00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:43.023
Don't do that!

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:46.460
I just, I really have to
continue on my journey!

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:49.129
But you don't have
money left, do you?

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:54.868
No, but that's...

00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:56.970
You have a reason, don't you?

00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:01.808
Why don't you tell us?

00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:06.547
This whole journey is all for
the sake of my late mother.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.116
Your mother?

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:14.021
Not long ago, my mother
passed away from an illness.

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:17.658
She'd been bedridden
for a long time

00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:19.893
and couldn't go anywhere.

00:19:19.927 --> 00:19:22.896
So, I'm visiting
all the hot springs

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.065
that she dreamed of going to.

00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:27.000
I'm doing this in her memory.

00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:29.903
I see.

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:31.738
In your current
condition, though,

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:34.007
doing that alone will be hard.

00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:36.143
You're completely right.

00:19:37.244 --> 00:19:38.145
Yes.

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.247
Believe me, I know that's true.

00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:43.917
Listen, would it be possible
to take her with us,

00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.552
at least as far as we can?

00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:50.023
I'd just like for this
journey she's taking

00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:51.625
to be something that she can use

00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:53.560
to remember her mother by.

00:19:53.594 --> 00:19:56.763
I'd be happy to pay for
all of her expenses.

00:19:56.797 --> 00:19:57.764
Really?

00:19:57.798 --> 00:19:58.765
Yes!

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.900
Fine by me.

00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.435
Kakashi Sensei!

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:03.871
We'll figure out a
way to make it work.

00:20:03.904 --> 00:20:05.372
Thank you so much!

00:20:06.073 --> 00:20:07.541
Isn't that great, Tatsumi?

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.345
Thank you!

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:12.446
Thank you!

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:15.682
Oh, and by the way,
about your Chakra Blade,

00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:18.519
unless you learn to control
your chakra a little more,

00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:19.887
it'll be dangerous.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.288
I know.

00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:24.358
To be honest, I didn't realize
it was quite that sharp.

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.158
No way!

00:20:25.192 --> 00:20:26.393
Talk about untapped potential!

00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:29.396
She is Asuma's daughter.

00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:36.770
All right!

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:38.572
Well, this is
where we part ways.

00:20:38.605 --> 00:20:41.642
Aw, what's the matter
with you, Guy Sensei?

00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:44.411
You sure do look awfully pale.

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:48.482
Let's just get out of
this place quickly, okay?

00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:50.317
Huh?

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.153
It isn't about being
scared or anything.

00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:55.189
But it's dangerous!

00:20:55.222 --> 00:20:58.025
That thing, that
warrior in armor.

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:00.127
Huh?

00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:03.130
Just one look at that guy

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:05.065
who appeared in the
middle of the night

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.267
and I knew he wasn't
of this world!

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:10.003
After he wandered
around the room,

00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:12.139
he went off in the
direction of the room

00:21:12.172 --> 00:21:14.141
you were staying in
with Tenten, Mirai.

00:21:14.174 --> 00:21:16.510
And he just disappeared!

00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:19.179
An armored warrior?

00:21:19.213 --> 00:21:20.414
One of the inn's employees

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:22.382
mentioned that to
us earlier, too!

00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:26.787
But she said that a thorough
exorcism had been done!

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.989
Ha!

00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:31.525
When I did a security
sweep of the rooms before,

00:21:31.558 --> 00:21:32.526
I peeled these off.

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:35.529
I thought they were trash.

00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:36.763
Hey!

00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:38.498
You weren't supposed
to remove those!

00:21:38.532 --> 00:21:40.367
What?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.335
What's up?

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:43.303
What's with all the
freaked out looks?

00:21:43.337 --> 00:21:48.509
So, Mr. Kakashi, last night,
were you able to sleep okay?

00:21:49.543 --> 00:21:51.144
Yeah, I slept just fine.

00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:53.480
I feel so relaxed.

00:21:53.514 --> 00:21:54.882
Okay, let's get going!

00:21:54.915 --> 00:21:56.884
On to the next stop!

00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:58.051
You mean you slept through

00:21:58.085 --> 00:22:00.888
an armored warrior
wandering around?

00:22:00.921 --> 00:22:03.123
I wonder about
your mental state.

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:14.001
(ending theme music)

00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:45.158
A large boulder's
covering the hot spring!

00:23:45.192 --> 00:23:47.160
Isn't there anything
that we can do?

00:23:47.194 --> 00:23:49.029
The villagers seem
really troubled.

00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:50.831
[Choji] Sorry to keep
you waiting, Mirai!

00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:52.299
I'm here to help!

00:23:52.332 --> 00:23:53.834
[Mirai] You're, Mr. Choji!

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:56.770
[Choji] I haven't eaten potato
chips for like 30 minutes!

00:23:56.803 --> 00:23:57.771
[Mirai] Uh...

00:23:57.804 --> 00:23:58.872
[Choji] In this state,

00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:00.674
there's no way I can
move that boulder!

00:24:00.707 --> 00:24:03.544
[Mirai] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:07.181
The Steam Ninja Scrolls: Potato
Chips and the Giant Boulder!

00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:09.116
Then why are you even here?

00:24:11.652 --> 00:24:14.655
(upbeat rock music)
