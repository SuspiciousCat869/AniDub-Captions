WEBVTT

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.210
Wait, you're that
traveling performer!

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.980
-Be more careful.
-Hey, wait!

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.582
Huh?

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:21.889
Wait, this is--

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.757
(soft music)

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.425
Hey, there!

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.426
What's up?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.229
I merely wanted to
express my gratitude.

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:32.032
I have to say, you've been
awfully kind to Naruto,

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.433
even though you just met him.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:37.671
Oh, he just reminds of
someone I knew in the past.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.940
Yes, of course, I see, I see!

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.275
In the past, huh?

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.544
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.379
Oh, and by the way, do you

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.950
happen to be Sasuke Uchiha?

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.485
(suspenseful beat)

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.054
(soft music)

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.961
-(chuckles)
-Nah, just kidding!

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.964
There's no way you
could be him, right?

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:06.400
(chuckles)

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.943
(opening theme music)

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:20.047
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.568
(opening theme music)

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.177
(air whooshing)

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.980
(knocking on branches)

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.215
(air whooshing)

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.653
(birds chirping)

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.088
[Boruto] Found 'ya!

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:14.595
Oh, it's you.

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.763
(giggles)

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:26.840
-Hey, so, what is it?
-Hey, so, what is it?

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.208
-No, go ahead.
-No, go ahead.

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:30.744
-You go first, 'ya know!
-You go first, 'ya know!

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.414
(snorting)

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:37.551
(laughing)

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.086
Sorry for earlier!

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.221
And for leaving in the
middle of training.

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:47.327
No, I should be saying
sorry for hurting you.

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:49.396
Oh, don't worry about
it, it's nothing.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.132
I mean, look, I know you
didn't do it on purpose.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.568
Besides, I figure
it won't matter

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.303
if I get stronger than you.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:59.006
(lively music)

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:05.946
Okay, no more wasting time!

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.182
Let's keep on training.

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.116
(grunts)

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.084
-(chuckles)
-Yeah!

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:14.988
If we don't, then we won't
be able to beat up Urashiki.

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:16.823
Hey, you're right!

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.725
I was actually just about to say

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.727
the very same thing, ya know!

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.463
(lively music)

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.366
All right, come on!

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.968
We'd better get started, then!

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.838
(giggling)

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:34.842
(birds chirping)

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.445
I didn't sense any pretense
or reluctance in your efforts

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.582
to save Naruto during the
last battle that we fought.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.317
But still, the fact remains

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.953
that I don't know
your real identities.

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:48.121
So, why don't we make a deal?

00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:52.125
I'll agree not to delve into
your identities any further

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.095
if you give me your
intel on Urashiki.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:59.299
You know, you wash my
back and I'll wash yours!

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:05.072
If we gave you the wrong
impression, I'm sorry.

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:07.841
I guess we have a deal!

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.511
All right, then,
what about Urashiki?

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:13.847
Have you sensed his presence
since the fight earlier?

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.983
No, I haven't yet.

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:20.120
But he's here in order to
get his hands on chakra.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:24.291
And his main goal is the Nine
Tails' massive amount of it.

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:26.960
I see.

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:30.464
Sorry we lied about
being performers.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.132
We're in a position

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.801
where we can't let
anyone know who we are.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.105
That said, our wish
to protect Naruto

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:40.908
from Urashiki is genuine.

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:44.211
If Urashiki is able to
get ahold of Nine Tails,

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:47.281
there's no future
for us as shinobi.

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.282
Well, then,

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:50.684
we're just going to have
to do everything we can

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.252
in order to protect Naruto

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:55.088
and stop the Nine
Tails from being taken.

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.090
Thanks to your Sealing Jutsu,

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:59.826
we now know we can
block Urashiki's

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.495
chakra-extracting jutsu.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:05.532
Although, even so, my
jutsu's not foolproof.

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:10.971
Also, the Sealing Jutsu on
Naruto is a special one.

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:13.574
Still, when he's under
Nine Tails Transformation,

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:17.344
some of his chakra can
nonetheless be extracted.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:20.314
What other jutsu does
Urashiki possess?

00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:24.184
For one, he's able to teleport
using a special jutsu.

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:25.319
Huh?

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:27.788
Is it a type of
Transportation Technique?

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.857
If so, then that's
very troublesome.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.992
It means that we
won't be able to tell

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:33.794
where he's coming from.

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:35.128
[Sasuke] Yeah.

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:38.498
But when he uses that
jutsu, I'm able to sense it.

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:42.169
Oh?

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.072
[Sasuke] We're not
sure about this,

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.541
but he may have other
powers, as well.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:49.943
Huh.

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:53.213
So, the enemy has
unknown variables, huh?

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.949
Well, in any case,

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:58.352
we're going to need to
put together a strategy

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:01.755
to protect Naruto and the
Nine Tails from Urashiki.

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:06.360
[Sasuke] How's their
training going?

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.497
I'm not sure how
this is gonna end up.

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:13.500
Especially since Naruto
isn't that adept.

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:16.270
A Collaboration Jutsu
might not happen.

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:21.675
However, children are
unknown variables.

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.911
Boruto and Naruto are similar

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.746
beyond just their
Chakra Natures.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.816
The both of them are good,
strong, and honest kids.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.487
(Sasuke scoffs)

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.390
The thing is you really
can't give it your all

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.725
while you're training
if you're hungry!

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.328
-(laughing)
-Looks good!

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.529
Ramen again?

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.933
Yeah, but the ramen here is
seriously really awesome!

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.569
Of course, instant
ramen is awesome, too!

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:50.637
Thank you for the food!

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.706
(slurping)

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:53.740
So good!

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:57.110
And Granny Tsunade
mentioned a genin

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:58.979
who deserted the Leaf.

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:01.315
It was you, right?

00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:04.418
Why?

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:08.088
[Sasuke] Because back then, I
couldn't see another choice.

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.957
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.358
Mm-hm.

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:16.430
So, why did your friend
leave the village, anyway?

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:20.834
Wait, why do you
wanna know about that?

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:23.203
It's been bugging
me, that's all.

00:08:23.237 --> 00:08:26.240
I mean, he's a genin of
the Leaf Village, right?

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.575
So, there must've
been a big reason

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:30.344
for him to desert the village.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:36.483
He said that it was so he'd
be able to obtain more power.

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:39.219
The entire Uchiha Clan,

00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:42.122
his whole family was
totally annihilated.

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:45.559
He's the last one left,
the only survivor.

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:48.962
That's the reason
why he went out there

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.797
looking to make
himself stronger,

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:52.566
so that he can avenge his Clan.

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:53.534
That's just--

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.335
But to desert the
village like that--

00:08:55.369 --> 00:09:00.040
He said severing our bond
and the pain of solitude

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:03.243
is the thing that's going
to make him stronger.

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:06.680
That's why he severed
his bond with me,

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.582
with every one of us,

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.184
to gain more power.

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:14.188
We tried really
hard to stop him.

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.090
But still, in the end,

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:19.626
he wound up going to
Orochimaru anyway.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.729
Orochimaru?

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:24.498
You mean--

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.401
But why would you
go to such lengths

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:30.304
to bring Sasuke
back to the Village?

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:34.074
He's someone I'd finally
made a bond with.

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:35.943
What do you mean?

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:38.912
I don't actually have
any parents or siblings,

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:41.381
so I can't really say
for sure what it's like.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.618
But after being on the
same team as Sasuke,

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:48.722
I felt that maybe that's what
it's like to have a brother.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.991
That's why I've
gotta get stronger

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:53.460
so that I can bring Sasuke back.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.964
That's the reason I'm
training with Pervy Sage.

00:09:56.997 --> 00:10:00.267
I just need to beat
some sense into Sasuke

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.836
and get him to open up his eyes.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.706
And then, I gotta bring
him back to the Leaf,

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:08.308
because he's my friend.

00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:13.480
And that's the reason
why I don't have the time

00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:16.416
to be dealing with that
Urashiki guy, ya know!

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.384
Come on!

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:19.553
Let's eat up and get
back to our training!

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.289
(giggling)

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:23.824
(slurping)

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:25.559
Yeah, all right!

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:27.427
Thank you for the food!

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.964
This is really good!

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.332
[Naruto] I know, right?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.068
[Jiraiya] So, you aren't able

00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:38.105
to fight at full strength
yet, is that right?

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.341
Yeah, thanks to
your Sealing Jutsu,

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.210
he wasn't able to
steal my chakra

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:45.312
the same way he did last time.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:48.382
But, still, I haven't
replenished the chakra

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:51.218
he extracted during
our previous fight yet.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:54.588
Yes, I see.

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:57.224
[Sasuke] He could actually see

00:10:57.257 --> 00:11:00.460
that I still wasn't
at full strength.

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.129
Interesting.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.198
All right, just a
little while ago,

00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:06.800
you told me that Urashiki
has special jutsu,

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.235
isn't that right?

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:09.670
Yeah.

00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:11.171
Okay, in that case,

00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:13.340
if you can block him
from using his jutsu,

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.375
while he's busy
dealing with you,

00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:18.212
I should be able to use
my Sealing Jutsu on him.

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:21.548
And then I can blow him
away with a Toad Oil Bomb.

00:11:21.582 --> 00:11:23.483
Of course, having said that,

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.954
it appeared that he's
extremely experienced,

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:30.324
which means ordinary
tactics aren't gonna work.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:34.394
[Sasuke] If I could only
infuse my chakra even a little!

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:39.266
The reality is that we don't
have much of a countermeasure.

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:40.300
Right.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:44.004
(dramatic music)

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:58.952
The view from up here
is truly incredible,

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:01.455
but it's probably time
for me to get moving.

00:12:01.488 --> 00:12:03.657
(air whooshing)

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.493
(dramatic music)

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:17.738
Soon, I'll have all of
the Nine Tails' Chakra.

00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:21.341
(giggling)

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.416
Aw, come on!

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:32.152
You're not even trying to
sync up with me, are you?

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:35.822
You're still just infusing
your chakra all willy-nilly!

00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:36.857
Huh?

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.592
No, I'm doing it,
I'm telling you!

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:40.994
[Boruto] Let's just try again!

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:43.630
(clattering)

00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:45.999
(grunting)

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:54.474
-(popping)
-(gasping)

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:56.710
(thumping)

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:01.181
(sighing)

00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:01.982
Damn it!

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.251
How are we supposed to do this?

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:07.621
It's supposed to work if we're
doing it like the Rasengan!

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:10.390
(Naruto grunts)

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.994
(wind blowing)

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:22.736
That's it!

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:23.937
Hey, Boruto!

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:25.939
C'mere, give me your hand.

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:27.374
(chuckles)

00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:30.611
-What for?
-Don't worry about it!

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.614
What are you doing, anyway?

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:37.818
Why did you draw
the Leaf symbol?

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:39.353
We should both visualize

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:42.089
concentrating our
chakra right there.

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:43.457
Oh, I get it!

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.493
The two of us just have to
focus on infusing our chakra

00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:47.561
on one target!

00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:48.729
That's right, ya know!

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:50.898
-Now, let's go!
-Right!

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:52.833
(lively music)

00:13:52.866 --> 00:13:55.235
(grunting)

00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:14.655
(groaning)

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:16.590
No good!

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:18.559
I'm out of chakra!

00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:19.560
Ah!

00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:21.395
-Yeah, but--
-(both chuckle)

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:23.130
-We're close!
-We're close!

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:24.565
Just a little bit more!

00:14:24.598 --> 00:14:27.167
I didn't feel any
resistance that time.

00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:30.404
You sure come with good ideas,
and that was a great one!

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:33.473
-(giggling)
-Of course it was!

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:34.741
[Sakura] There you are!

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:35.742
Huh?

00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:37.511
[Naruto] Oh, hey, Sakura!

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:43.483
All right, you,
I've got a question.

00:14:43.517 --> 00:14:44.484
Huh?

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:45.519
What's up?

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.989
Okay, the guy you're
with dropped this

00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:51.191
when I ran into him earlier.

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.594
Huh?

00:14:54.795 --> 00:15:00.200
I can only read some of it,
but I can make out "Boru,"

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:04.671
"Sasuke," "borrow
from," "love, Sarada."

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.507
[Boruto] Oh no, this is bad.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.978
That's probably a note that
Sarada wrote to Sasuke!

00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:13.514
I don't understand
it all but look here.

00:15:13.547 --> 00:15:17.017
That word there, it definitely
says Sasuke, doesn't it?

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.887
Do you know something
about Sasuke?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.021
Oh--

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:23.357
All that we really
know about you two guys

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.759
is that you're nameless
traveling performers

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.160
who haven't even performed!

00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:29.696
So, just who are you
and why are you here?

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.064
Hey, c'mon Sakura,

00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:33.700
there's no need to ask so
many questions all at once.

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:34.968
Besides, there's no way

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:36.737
that he could know
anything about Sasuke!

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.105
You stay out of this, Naruto!

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:41.141
All right, look, then
just answer me this,

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:43.443
do you know Sasuke or not?

00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:44.611
Do you?

00:15:44.645 --> 00:15:46.580
No, I don't think so.

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:47.614
I just--

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:51.985
How can I talk my way
outta this, ya know?

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:55.022
Hey, can I see
that for a second?

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:56.823
(playful music)

00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:59.993
Oh, maybe it's someone
else named Sasuke?

00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:01.562
I'm not sure about that, though.

00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:05.032
Oh, man, you had me
going for a second.

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:06.433
(Boruto giggles)

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.468
Oh, but that's not--

00:16:08.502 --> 00:16:10.637
(playful music)

00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:13.807
We really are just a couple
of traveling performers.

00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:17.311
Seriously, believe me, we
don't know your friend at all!

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:20.981
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:25.185
Okay, thanks, sorry
for bothering you.

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:28.121
Sakura, you--

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:31.491
[Boruto] Sakura's trying
to get Sasuke back, too,

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:32.759
just like Dad is.

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:38.966
But I can't tell them the truth!

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.701
[Sakura] I guess
I'm just gonna have

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:42.970
to ask him directly, after all.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.739
(bird cooing)

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:46.974
Ah!

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.610
I'm totally wrecked
from today, ya know!

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:51.745
[Shikamaru] Hey, Naruto!

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:52.746
-Mm?
-Mm?

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:54.314
[Naruto] Shikamaru!

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:55.983
Hey.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.719
What are the two of you
guys up to right now?

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:00.020
Oh, we were just--

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:02.222
Oh, rehearsing a performance!

00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:04.992
-Yeah?
-So, how's it going?

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:09.763
Well, it's been going
really great, right?

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:10.764
Yeah!

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:12.299
Well, that's good to hear.

00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:15.435
So, anyway, are you guys
gonna have dinner here, too?

00:17:16.503 --> 00:17:18.238
Nope, that's not for us!

00:17:18.272 --> 00:17:19.473
We're always gonna choose

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:21.542
to have ramen over
barbecue, ya know!

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:22.543
What?

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:23.810
We had ramen earlier!

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:25.946
Please, I beg you,
no more for a while!

00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:27.114
What?

00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:29.016
What's the matter
with ramen, huh?

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:30.951
You're really gonna
eat ramen again?

00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:31.952
So, what?

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:33.687
Don't you feel
bad making him eat

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.355
the same thing all the time?

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:36.490
Mm-hm.

00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:39.760
It is tough to eat
ramen every day.

00:17:39.793 --> 00:17:41.762
What's wrong with that, huh?

00:17:41.795 --> 00:17:43.363
(groaning)

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:46.133
(playful music)

00:17:50.037 --> 00:17:52.472
Don't worry, just treat them!

00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:55.342
Choji's with us, so it's
gonna cost a lot anyway.

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.744
Okay, we'll have
the prime sirloin

00:17:57.778 --> 00:17:59.880
and deluxe kalbi
for six, please!

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.081
All right!

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:04.751
-(food sizzling)
-(cheerful music)

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:06.820
Wow, this is so good!

00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:08.822
I was getting bored
of ramen, ya know!

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:12.025
Come on, I can eat
ramen for every meal!

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:15.896
Listen, if you go too slow,
Choji'll eat everything.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:18.732
Yeah, he's right, we
gotta eat our fill, too!

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:22.469
(munching)

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:28.475
[Boruto] I guess he's always
had a healthy appetite.

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.679
-Naruto.
-Mm?

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:34.815
If something's up, tell us,

00:18:34.848 --> 00:18:37.584
before things turn
into a real drag.

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:38.585
Yeah.

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:40.621
Don't worry, I know that.

00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:42.489
(scoffs)

00:18:42.523 --> 00:18:45.058
(soft music)

00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:51.532
So that I can bring Sasuke back.

00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:55.135
I just need to beat
some sense into Sasuke

00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:57.471
and get him to open up his eyes!

00:18:57.504 --> 00:19:00.874
And then, I gotta bring
him back to the Leaf,

00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:03.710
because he's my friend.

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:06.313
(soft music)

00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:14.588
(air whooshing)

00:19:16.023 --> 00:19:18.625
-(groaning)
-Didn't work, Huh?

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:19.626
Damn it!

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.695
We can't get it to break.

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:23.730
(air whooshing)

00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:25.132
-Hm?
-Huh?

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:28.001
(chuckling)

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:29.236
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.673
He's here!

00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:34.074
It's him!

00:19:34.107 --> 00:19:37.611
I figured that it was about
time to harvest your chakra.

00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:39.112
We won't let you!

00:19:39.146 --> 00:19:41.882
This isn't gonna go
down like last time!

00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:43.817
-Are you kidding me?
-C'mon!

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:44.952
(grunting)

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:47.454
You really are quite an idiot!

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:49.223
-(air whooshing)
-Ah!

00:19:49.256 --> 00:19:52.693
Don't charge in, or you'll
get caught like the last time!

00:19:52.726 --> 00:19:54.027
Yeah, I know that, but--

00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:56.563
We've gotta be really cautious!

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:57.598
Okay!

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.901
(chuckling)

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:03.737
(fire whooshing)

00:20:06.573 --> 00:20:09.309
(fire striking)

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:14.815
-(electricity buzzing)
-Ah!

00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:18.185
(electricity buzzing)

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.454
[Boruto] Ah!

00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:25.893
I'm definitely going
to take it this time.

00:20:25.926 --> 00:20:28.595
(lively music)

00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:32.499
Go!

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:33.734
Get away!

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:36.370
(lively music)

00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:38.805
(groans)

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.040
Damn it!

00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:50.384
No, stop!

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.753
[Jiraiya] Fire
style, flame bombs!

00:20:53.887 --> 00:20:55.822
(fire whooshing)

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.491
(metallic clunk)

00:20:57.524 --> 00:20:59.226
(chuckling)

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:03.163
(electricity buzzing)

00:21:03.197 --> 00:21:06.233
So, tell me, how does
it feel to be attacked

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.836
by a jutsu that
was taken from you?

00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:11.605
And I've got a lot
more left, too!

00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:14.041
(grunting)

00:21:16.877 --> 00:21:18.011
You're too slow.

00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:23.250
-(striking)
-(grunting)

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.453
-Pervy Sage!
-(Urashiki chuckles)

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:28.088
Oh, no, you don't!

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:29.423
(air whooshing)

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.524
I can see it.

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:34.728
(lively music)

00:21:41.168 --> 00:21:43.337
Don't you fools get it yet?

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.173
My eyes are able to
see into the future.

00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:50.544
Now, let's end all
this, shall we?

00:21:50.577 --> 00:21:53.580
(suspenseful music)

00:21:56.517 --> 00:21:58.218
(chuckles)

00:21:58.252 --> 00:22:00.621
Just give it up, already.

00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:13.734
(closing theme music)

00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:26.647
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.722 --> 00:23:43.557
(lively music)

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.692
[Naruto] Do you
believe that Urashiki

00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:47.094
can actually see the future?

00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:49.263
[Boruto] It makes sense if
he has a jutsu like that

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:51.231
in addition to his
Transportation Technique.

00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:54.301
[Jiraiya] Regardless of who
this Urashiki guy might be,

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:57.004
I've never even heard of a
jutsu that would give someone

00:23:57.037 --> 00:23:58.739
the ability to see
into the future.

00:23:58.772 --> 00:24:01.975
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:03.477
"The Power to See the Future."

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.247
How is Urashiki able to
evade our attacks so easily?

00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:10.651
(dramatic beat)

00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:15.489
(singing in Japanesee)
