WEBVTT

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.845
<i>We passed the Academy's</i>
<i>graduation exams,</i>

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.348
and now me and my friends are on
<i>the path to becoming real</i>
<i>shinobi.</i>

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.521
And finally... it's time for our
<i>first mission!</i>

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.997
(KONOHAMARU) Hey! This is your
first mission as genin.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.701
So listen up and I'll tell you
how it works.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:38.772
This is where all ninja, whether
jonin, chunin, and genin,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.273
receive their
mission assignments.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.478
As you probably already know,
behind every ninja mission, is a
requester in need of assistance.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:50.216
Missions can range from conflict
resolution between nations to
finding lost possessions.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.788
I'm sure we'll be able to handle
whatever kind of mission gets
thrown our way!

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.891
Isn't every mission ranked
before it's assigned?

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:03.129
I understand they're ranked high
to low, from level S to level D.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:08.001
And that the administrators
assign missions to teams
according to their abilities...

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:09.970
[chuckle] Exactly right.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:10.571
(SARADA) [chuckle]

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.073
Impressive. You have a lot of
knowledge.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.641
Everyone should know this stuff.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.143
Alright!

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.780
How about we start off with the
highest ranked mission

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.783
and show everybody just how
awesome Team 7 is!

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:26.787
[chuckle] I'm sorry to have to
dampen your enthusiasm...

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.423
But you're just a newbie, and
newbies are broken in slowly,

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:33.293
starting with C or D ranked
missions to start with.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:34.127
[exhale]

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.563
Well, I guess that's how it is.

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:39.833
This is our first mission, and
if it's gonna be something at
that level...

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:43.604
let's wrap it up quickly and get
that reward from our requester.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.238
Is that how it works?

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.741
Yeah... Piece of cake, I'll
handle it myself!

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.544
(NARUTO) <i>"Piece of cake," you'll</i>
<i>"handle it yourself," huh?</i>

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.180
Lord Seventh...

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.685
No mission is "a piece of cake"
and the sooner you learn that
the better.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:45.759
(BORUTO) <i>Why are we here?</i>

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:50.096
It's a tradition. The Hokage
himself will assign your
first mission.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.098
You should feel honored to
receive it.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.299
Yes, sir!

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:56.603
Now then...

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:59.740
Team 7's first mission... is to
expel bandits.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:01.808
(KONOHAMARU) <i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:03.510
[grunt]

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:11.417
(SHIKAMARU) <i>At the border</i>
between the Land of Fire and the
<i>Land of Wind</i>

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.154
<i>is a small village called the</i>
<i>Green Banks.</i>

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.455
<i>They requested this mission.</i>

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:18.058
This area over here is dotted
with farming villages.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.894
They've maintained their way of
life for generations.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:25.298
But they had a bad harvest this
year due to a serious drought.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.668
So, the problem for Green Banks
is,

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.470
neighboring villages have
started stealing food from their
storehouses;

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:32.639
and they want us to stop them.

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:36.777
So the villages have a conflict
and they need to get it
resolved.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.644
Yeah...

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.346
We have to stop some farmers
from getting into a fight?

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.283
I'd say this assignment's a
piece of cake.

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.051
Don't act like a smug know it
all!

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:49.289
You guys need to take
your missions much more
seriously, do you understand?

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.757
"You guys"?!

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:54.561
Maybe he has a knack for things,
but he's reckless and stupid,

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:56.229
so please don't lump me in with
him.

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.330
Hey, don't be a jerk!

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.632
What did you say?!

00:04:58.665 --> 00:04:58.965
[grunt]

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.068
That critique still had a touch
of admiration in it.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:03.136
Hey! Everybody calm down!

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.571
Anyway...

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:10.210
Even if you've been assigned a
D‐rank mission, it's your duty
to take it seriously.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:14.380
If you don't, you're gonna get
burned. And work as a team!

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.416
Hm!

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.752
Do your best and don't give up!

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.257
Boruto...

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.459
You're going on your first
mission!

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.596
You seem pretty happy, Big
Brother!

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.603
Hm? Oh, you think so? Uh! Hey,
Mom. I wanted to ask you... What
was your first mission like?

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:39.139
Huh? My first mission?

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:45.846
Let me think... I guess what I
remember most is feeling so
nervous the whole time.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.082
What do you mean by "nervous"?
Like nervous with excitement?

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:54.354
It wasn't like that. We were
still at war. It was a very
different time back then.

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:57.991
A lot of the missions tended to
be dangerous.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:02.428
That's why I wasn't really
excited about going on my first
mission. You know?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.430
Hmmm!

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:07.433
Oh no! I've gotta go.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.572
Alright, well I guess I'm off!

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:12.839
Be careful out there.

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.208
Bye‐bye, Big Brother! Good luck
with the mission!

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.042
G'bye!

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.713
I'll be back before ya know it!

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:23.083
<i>I'm gonna show that stupid old</i>
<i>man once and for all!</i>

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.952
<i>A mission like this is a piece</i>
<i>of cake for me!</i>

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.895
Okay, it's about time to get
going.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:42.936
Before he left, I gave
Konohamaru all the details we
have about the situation.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.907
If you ask me... This whole
thing sounds a little
suspicious.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.074
Oh!

00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:49.042
That reminds me!

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.978
Isn't Shikadai going on his
first mission too?

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:52.913
[chuckle] Yeah.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:56.517
Hard to believe we've both
reached the age

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.419
where we're worrying about our
sons' first missions.

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.487
[chuckle] <i>What a drag.</i>

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.158
(CHO‐CHO) [chuckle] <i>That's so</i>
<i>like you, Madame!</i>

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:07.628
(MADAME) [chuckle] <i>"Madame"</i>
<i>sounds just lovely!</i>

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.495
Oh, Cho‐Cho! You are such a
charmer!

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.464
Damn, this is what they call a
guarded escort?

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:14.100
This is definitely not what I
pictured.

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:15.602
I guess we're her bodyguards?

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:19.973
What we really are is following
around a rich lady while she
goes shopping.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:24.177
(MADAME) So cute! Where shall we
go for a break soon, Cho‐Cho?

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.848
I just happen to know a little
shop down there and it'll be
perfect.

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:31.317
Plus they make these sweets and
ah‐ They're Devine!

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:33.253
Oh my, then we absolutely must
go!

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.990
What if we don't get there
before they're sold out‐ they
make a limited amount.

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:38.592
Really? Oh no.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.061
Hey, you two, let's get a move
on!

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:43.597
Yeah, stop slacking off, you
guys! Hurry up!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.166
Chubs is completely getting
carried away with this mission.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.235
Damn it, this assignment is
really such a drag!

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:53.439
I know Shikadai will be
just fine. He's probably doing a
great job.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.542
Yeah... Well, I hope so.

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:04.484
Can we talk?

00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:05.586
Yeah, what's up?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.954
I just want to be clear from the
start that you are not

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.591
to do anything that will leave a
mark on my record.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:13.093
Huh?

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:17.230
I don't want you creating any
roadblocks on my path to
becoming the Hokage.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:21.902
I don't want your failures as a
ninja to ever find their way to
my record!

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:22.836
Shut up!

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.272
Why are you giving me attitude?!

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:29.442
You two really get along.

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:30.611
Are you kidding me?!

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:34.180
How 'bout we stop for a little
break.

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:42.656
Team 7... before we start this
first mission, there's something
I need to tell you.

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:46.092
<i>Lord Hokage already told you</i>
<i>this...</i>

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:50.897
But what's most important to the
<i>success of any mission is</i>
<i>teamwork.</i>

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:51.598
[groan]

00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:54.801
We've heard that lecture
already. It's getting boring.

00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:59.272
Stop complaining for once and
just let Sensei talk.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.641
Alright, alright.

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:04.344
What's also important is to
respect each other's skills and
worth..

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.713
And there's one more thing...

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:10.216
That is truly the most crucial
part of any mission.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.817
Hm?

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:16.089
Whenever you encounter danger on
your own, don't try to resolve
it by yourself.

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:18.925
The four of us always have to
work as one team,

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:22.863
or the three of you have to
figure out a unified plan
together.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:26.332
But never take any action on
your own, you understand?!

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:30.904
You better listen carefully,
Boruto. All this applies
directly to you.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:33.273
Uh?! What makes you think
that?!

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:37.210
Because everybody knows that
you're the most reckless person
on our team!

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:37.711
What?!

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:39.846
Actually, I agree with her on
that point.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.382
[grunt] You're on her side now,
Mitsuki?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.084
[chuckle] Understood?!

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.653
Yes, sir!

00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:49.255
Hm?!

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.857
[grunts]

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:52.859
Uh...

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:00.667
[sigh] Really?

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:02.102
[sighs]

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:08.441
If you can't tell one type of
danger from another, then you've
got a long way to go.

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:10.143
<i>Okay, break time's over!</i>

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.277
[grunt]

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.882
That's it straight ahead!

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.197
Our destination is just on the
other side of this bridge.

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:35.736
But it appears that we can't
cross it.

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:47.147
<i>So this is the only bridge</i>
<i>here...</i>

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.796
I believe they're the shinobi
from the Hidden Leaf... Lady
Kiri.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:03.930
I see.

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:08.802
[sigh]

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.804
They're just a bunch of kids.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.674
Can they be any good?

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:16.342
I've heard they definitely have
the right skills.

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.178
[sigh]

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.213
Lower the bridge.

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:31.224
Wow‐ That's really cool!

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:34.761
<i>So, the drawbridge can only be</i>
<i>controlled from that side.</i>

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:42.603
Did you come here from the
Hidden Leaf Village?

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:43.203
That's right.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.271
Let me welcome you and thank you
for coming.

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:46.039
Huh?

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:47.641
<i>What's that?</i>

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:48.775
(VILLAGER A) <i>Oh...</i>

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:52.679
It's where they collect the toll
from people who want to cross
over the bridge.

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:53.279
A toll?

00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:56.650
(VILLAGER A) Our poor village
has few profitable resources.

00:11:56.683 --> 00:12:01.655
Our previous leader planned the
<i>bridge and personally</i>
<i>oversaw it's construction.</i>

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:06.860
Thanks to his foresight, our
village is doing better now than
ever before.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.229
It sounds like he was great
leader.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:12.465
Indeed he certainly was.

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:15.602
He considered all the people in
the village his family,

00:12:15.636 --> 00:12:17.971
and he never stopped working to
help us.

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:22.709
He would have given his life to
protect the village. He was that
<i>great a man.</i>

00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:23.810
[gasp]

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:28.014
You called him your "previous"
leader. Did he retire recently?

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:32.786
I'm afraid he passed away
suddenly, three months ago.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.855
<i>His daughter took over his</i>
<i>position.</i>

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:36.422
Hmmm.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.825
Three months ago, huh...

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:42.629
Isn't that right around the
same time the village started
getting attacked?

00:12:42.663 --> 00:12:45.465
Yes... After the new village
head took power,

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:49.302
the neighboring villages started
treating us with blatant
contempt.

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:52.005
There's been a lot of talk about
<i>it.</i>

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:52.839
Hmmm.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.852
Come this way please...

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.864
This is Lady Kiri. She is
the head of the Green Banks
Village.

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:20.466
But she's still just a kid.

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:22.102
Shhh!

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.805
Are all of you from the Hidden
Leaf?

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:25.405
(KONOHAMARU) <i>Yes...</i>

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:29.142
I need you to answer a question
before the mission starts.

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:32.746
Since you sent these mere
children to fulfill our
request...

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:35.148
...is the Hidden Leaf short on
manpower?

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.082
What‐!

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.652
I can assure you that all of
them are skilled.

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:42.889
I'll believe you. I just hope
that statement doesn't become a
lie.

00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:46.627
Let me go over the request one
more time.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.327
Yes.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:52.533
This year's harvest was very
meager. And our village wasn't
the only one to suffer.

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:57.671
The drought affected the entire
region. And now we are all
dealing with the results.

00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:01.875
People from the Pale Blue Valley
have repeatedly come to our
village

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:04.711
in order to steal provisions
from our storehouses.

00:14:04.745 --> 00:14:07.147
Yes, we're aware of that.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.850
And we know our mission is to
stop it from happening...

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:12.953
and make sure they never attack
here again.

00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:14.788
(KIRI) <i>That's what it was</i>
<i>originally.</i>

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:15.355
Uh?!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.357
"Originally"?

00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:18.925
Mm.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.929
Until recently, we were able to
thwart the enemy on our own.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.230
However...

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.132
<i>Now they've hired shinobi.</i>

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:27.601
[gasp]

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:30.436
Could you guys excuse us
for just a moment?

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.937
Hm?

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:35.942
[grunt] Hey, what are you
doing?!

00:14:36.777 --> 00:14:37.410
Let's go.

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.946
(BORUTO) [struggling] <i>C'mon!</i>
<i>Man!</i>

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:45.886
This makes our mission a B‐rank
or higher...

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:48.622
It'll be too complicated for the
genin to handle.

00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:56.362
I wonder what's gonna happen
now?

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.932
I doubt we'll be expected to
complete a mission

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.867
that suddenly includes fighting
shinobi.

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.769
Why would you say something like
that?!

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:07.373
We've come all the way out here.
We can't just turn and run home,
it'll look so uncool!

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:12.579
You're right. I agree it won't
look good if we end up quitting
partway through the mission.

00:15:12.613 --> 00:15:16.717
If a mission's been assigned
then it must be completed. Am I
right?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.151
So we have no choice.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.656
That is right! We all need to
work together to convince
Konohamaru Sensei

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:24.725
to let us finish our mission!

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:25.291
(GUARD) <i>Ahhh!</i>

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:25.659
[wincing]

00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:25.959
[gasp]

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:26.627
What was that?!

00:15:26.993 --> 00:15:27.427
Over there!

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:31.197
[gasps]

00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:36.436
[gasps]

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:44.878
[heavy breaths]

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:46.012
[grunt]

00:15:47.848 --> 00:15:49.015
[grunts]

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.217
[grunt] He's strong!

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.887
[grunts]

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.022
Boruto! It's not worth it!

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:58.424
You've got no backbone.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.059
[nervous inhale]

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:06.032
[heavy breathing] Are you...
from the Hidden Leaf?

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:07.033
[grunt]

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:08.602
[grunt]

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:09.469
(HIDARI) <i>Ashimaru!</i>

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.037
Ahhh!

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:14.474
[grunt]

00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:21.948
I just stood there. I couldn't
do anything...

00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:27.220
Turning back now is no longer
possible. It would disgrace the
name of the Hidden Leaf...

00:16:29.055 --> 00:16:31.091
We need a doctor, and quick!

00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:33.527
[gasps]

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:39.499
Your enemy attacked. But didn't
go for the storehouse.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.735
[gasp]

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:43.369
So what's going on then?

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:46.873
I need the truth. Will you be
completely honest with me from
now on?

00:16:46.907 --> 00:16:49.543
[confused chattering]

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:52.813
There's nothing for you to
fear. I'll handle the
situation.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:56.416
Lady Kiri, just give us the
order and we'll take up arms as
well!

00:16:56.449 --> 00:17:00.987
No way! Why do you think I asked
the Hidden Leaf shinobi to come
to us?

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.055
I just want‐

00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:04.090
I already told you I'd handle
this!

00:17:05.926 --> 00:17:07.127
Now come with me.

00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:09.730
You, too.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.399
Guess this mission's really on
now.

00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:15.969
I'm gonna get a chance to show
my stuff.

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:19.372
How can you be so calm when you
were just attacked a couple
minutes ago?

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.542
You almost got yourself killed
back there.

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:24.310
Don't be an idiot! I was in
control the whole time!

00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:26.847
I let him get in close so I
could check him out.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.048
That's what you were doing?

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:30.383
C'mon! Learn to read between the
lines, Mitsuki.

00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:33.119
So...

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.121
What does the enemy actually
want?

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:37.123
[sigh]

00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:43.597
Until you tell us the truth, we
won't be able to put together a
strategy to help you.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:49.135
We'll accept the mission, you
have my word. So please, tell us
everything.

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:51.171
[sigh]

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:55.075
It's the deed to the bridge.

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:57.443
That's the real reason they keep
coming.

00:17:57.744 --> 00:17:58.078
[gasp]

00:17:59.613 --> 00:18:02.415
Unless I turn the deed over to
them, they'll just keep
attacking our village.

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.751
And that piece of paper is worth
all this trouble to you?

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:10.323
Of course, it is! That bridge
was constructed by my father!
I'll never give it up.

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:11.024
[growl]

00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:12.526
Boruto!

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.461
Very well. And who else is aware
of this?

00:18:15.862 --> 00:18:16.763
[sigh]

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:21.367
Lady Kiri... Are you the only
one who knows?

00:18:22.636 --> 00:18:23.369
Mm.

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:28.875
(HIDARI) <i>Shinobi from the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf, huh?</i>

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:32.579
Uh, the girl acted on her own
without ever consulting any of
us.

00:18:32.613 --> 00:18:36.416
I toyed with them a little as a
way of welcoming them.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:40.053
You should've killed them all
the moment you had the
opportunity.

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:42.923
Be quiet! We may be in an age of
peace...

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:46.459
but the Hidden Leaf Village
still has many exceptionally
skilled shinobi

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:49.462
who fought in and survived the
Great War.

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:52.232
I do not aspire to cross swords
with them...

00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:54.067
So what do we do now?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.973
Humph. The only thing that
matters is that we get the deed
to the bridge, right?

00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:02.709
I have a little job for you to
<i>do.</i>

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:03.810
(IORI) <i>Fine.</i>

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:20.226
(VILLAGER C) Fire!

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:25.566
(KONOHAMARU)It's all turning
out just as we expected.

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:31.271
Yes it is. So when they attacked
earlier... they were trying to
analyze our strengths and
weaknesses?

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:34.775
Probably. And the fact that they
came back so soon means...

00:19:34.808 --> 00:19:37.811
Damn it! Means they think we
won't fight back.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:38.679
(IORI) <i>Ahhh!</i>

00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:39.813
Huh?

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.015
Somebody help me! Ah!

00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:43.116
(BORUTO) Look at that guy!

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.817
[grunt]

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:44.618
Just wait, Boruto!

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:47.453
Don't worry‐ I can take care of
this myself! [grunt]

00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:49.890
[grunt]

00:19:49.923 --> 00:19:50.857
Get outta here!

00:19:51.992 --> 00:19:53.359
Something tells me you're from
the Pale Blue Valley!

00:19:58.098 --> 00:19:59.866
Huh? You're the‐ [grunt]

00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:03.303
[pained grunts]

00:20:03.336 --> 00:20:06.339
You guys are all in on this
together?!

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:07.974
Boruto! Are you alright?

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:11.678
Didn't Sensei tell you that you
can't just go running off on
your own?!

00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:12.746
(BORUTO) <i>Shut up!</i>

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:13.246
[chuckle]

00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:16.550
What I wanna know is what's
going on with all the
villagers?

00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:17.851
It's genjutsu...

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.554
They're all being controlled by
a genjutsu.

00:20:20.587 --> 00:20:24.024
So, that mean it's not a good
idea to kill them all?

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:24.490
Yeah.

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:25.759
Well what do we do now?

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.631
First, we have to find the jutsu
user. He should be one of these
people, but...

00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:32.298
[nervous breathing]

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:37.871
What's happening?! What are you
doing?

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:38.905
Get back!

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:40.206
Hey... What's wrong?!

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.207
[grunt and struggling]

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:42.208
Iori! Ah!

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.210
Is he under a genjutsu, too?!

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:45.311
[grunt]

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:46.580
Damn it!

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:56.122
It's no use! I can't find him!

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:59.025
Don't panic! Think it through.

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:04.531
We need to find the jutsu user.
So how can we do that without
harming the other villagers?

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:07.367
I have an idea. But things might
get a little rough...

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.705
What if I suppress the force of
my Wind Style... and then use it
over a wide area?

00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:15.108
I get it! If somebody can
withstand your Wind Style...

00:21:15.141 --> 00:21:17.143
...they've gotta be a shinobi!

00:21:17.177 --> 00:21:18.945
Alright, do it Mitsuki.

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:21.948
(MITSUKI) Wind Style:
Breakthrough.

00:21:23.183 --> 00:21:27.788
Whoah! Ahhh!

00:21:32.258 --> 00:21:33.727
Where's the shinobi?

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.796
Everybody got knocked to the
ground.

00:21:36.196 --> 00:21:37.964
They got away.

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:42.402
[grunt]

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.337
The village head is missing!

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.006
He's right‐ she is!

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:46.807
[gasp]

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:51.011
Don't tell me it was that guy!

00:21:51.044 --> 00:21:55.215
If that's so, it means he was
with the enemy this entire time.

00:21:55.248 --> 00:21:56.517
How did we miss that?!

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.283
(KONOHAMARU) <i>Wait!</i>

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.351
Huh?!

00:21:59.285 --> 00:22:00.587
Didn't I tell you not to act on
your own?!

00:22:02.723 --> 00:22:03.824
