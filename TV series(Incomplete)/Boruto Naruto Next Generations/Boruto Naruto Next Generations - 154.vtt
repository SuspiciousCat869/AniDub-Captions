WEBVTT

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:10.143
(gentle pensive music)

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:14.781
[Florist] Thank you so much!

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.016
Huh?

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.456
(sighs) So busy.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:27.728
(gentle pensive music)

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:40.174
(gentle pensive music continues)

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.424
(Himawari giggles)

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:04.598
(gentle pensive music continues)

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:12.139
-(footsteps pattering)
-Hmm?

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.541
I'm home!

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.812
Well, I'm just going
to leave it up to

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.781
Himawari to decide
what she wants to be.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.217
What are you guys talking about?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.219
Hey, Himawari, welcome home.

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.154
We were just discussing
your career path.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.489
Have you ever given any
thought to whether or not

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.225
you'd like to be
become a shinobi?

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.194
Huh? I haven't
decided on anything.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.363
Oh, I see.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.065
Some members of the Hyuga Clan

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.367
have just assumed that your
going to become a shinobi.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.302
I mean, it does
kind of make sense

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:45.038
your rightfully a member
of the clan, after all.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.541
I can understand why people
might think that, but...

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.809
Himawari can decide

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.078
what she wants to be
for herself, can't she?

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.447
There's no need for her
to just follow the pack.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.449
You know, to be completely
honest with you,

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.084
I sorta thought that you
were already dead set

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.319
on becoming a shinobi, as well.

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:02.556
Oh, so, um, they're
holding one of these soon.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.958
What do you think?

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:06.326
Would you like to go?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.829
A one-day Academy trial session?

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.230
It's your chance to experience

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:12.666
what being a shinobi
is really like.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.234
Wow, what a cool idea!

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:16.570
Okay, sounds fun, I'll go.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:23.043
-(opening theme music)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:52.032
-(opening theme music)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.542
Well, first off, thank you all

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.211
for coming to the
Academy's trial session.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.346
The reason we have
this class is to give

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.016
anyone who might be interested
in becoming a shinobi,

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.084
a sneak peek into the
stuff they'll get to do

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.487
if they end up
coming here to study.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.290
Ultimately, I hope that
today will help you

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:19.560
in deciding what you
want to be in the future.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:20.627
Anyway, what do you say

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:23.230
we get you guys started
on your trial session?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.632
Do your best out
there and have fun!

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:26.733
[Students] Yes, Sir!

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.138
I, I'm Yuina Itomaki.

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:33.874
It's very nice to
meet all of you.

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:37.110
My name's Ehou Norimaki,
nice to meet you!

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.314
And I'm Himawari Uzumaki.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:43.083
I, uh, I'm still not
sure if I wanna be a-

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.018
-Did you say Uzumaki?
-Hmm?

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:47.054
The same as Lord Hokage?

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:48.889
The Hokage's my da...

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:51.959
Uh, I mean, he's my father.

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:53.327
(Ehou and Yuina gasp)

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.029
It's no wonder at all
that you're surprised.

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:57.197
The reason is-

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:58.799
Are you seriously the
Hokage's daughter?

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:01.668
Uh, Yeah. (giggles)

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:02.669
Wow, no way!

00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:03.937
I can't believe I actually

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.707
get to go through the
trial session with you!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.476
I'm looking forward to
working with you both today.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.611
(hands clap)

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.347
Right, now, all of you are
going to get to experience

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.016
a variety of different
Academy classes.

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:22.322
(birds twittering)

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.591
This is the training ground

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.027
where we determine your
physical abilities.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.428
(students gasp)

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:31.098
Now, listen, this isn't
meant to be a competition.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:34.735
Each of you simply try to reach
the goal at your own pace.

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.637
All right, ready?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.071
Begin!

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.007
(Himawari grunting)

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.208
(Ehou grunting)

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.242
Huh?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.947
Uh-huh, wow, all
right, I've got this!

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.150
(Himawari grunting)

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:52.052
Hey, pretty good!

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:53.554
You too, Ehou!

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.624
(Ehou grunts)

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.826
(Himawari swooshes)

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.295
(Himawari and Ehou grunt)

00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:03.063
-(Ehou panting)
-(Yuina grunts)

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.932
Himawari, you're amazing!

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:06.834
You came in first.

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.535
Ehou was really fast, too.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.537
I was surprised how fast.

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:11.638
(Ehou groans)

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:14.041
Man, you're the daughter
of the Hokage, after all!

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.409
Let's go one more time!

00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:16.476
Hey, come on.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.745
Didn't I say this
isn't a competition?

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.480
Still, I must say,
the both of you

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:22.282
look like you've been
training quite hard.

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:24.885
(chuckles) Well, yeah, of
course it looks like that.

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.286
'Cause I mean, after all,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.156
my grandpa does oversee my
training every single day!

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.124
Well, all right, then, you guys.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.933
Do you think you can do this?

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.435
-Awesome!
-(Himawari and Ehou gasp)

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:43.737
I definitely haven't
learned how to do that yet.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.305
Well, all that you need to do

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.809
is to focus infused chakra
onto the soles of your feet.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.043
All right!

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:52.613
(Ehou grunts)

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:53.914
(Ehou thuds)

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:56.483
Aw, come on!

00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:58.051
Okay, I'll try it, too.

00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:05.559
(Yuina grunts)

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.961
It's really hard to do that.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:09.997
All right, let me try.

00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.274
Ah.

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:26.813
(Ehou and Yuina gasp)

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:27.948
(Himawari yelps)

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.349
(Himawari thuds)

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:31.752
I guess I can't
do it, after all.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.588
To tell you the truth, I'm
rather relieved that you can't.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.690
The reason is because
then we instructors

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:39.059
wouldn't have much of
anything left to teach you.

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:42.629
(students laughing)

00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:45.199
(rock music)

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:59.546
(rock music continues)

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.091
Ehou is amazing, too,
but I can't believe

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.694
that you know Shuriken
Jutsu, Himawari.

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.629
(giggles) Oh, sometimes I train

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.631
with my big brother, that's all.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.634
All right, I've decided
that you're worthy enough

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.135
to be my rival, Himawari.

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:23.437
(laughs) What's that about?

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.672
I swear I'm not
gonna lose to you.

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:28.542
I mean, you're gonna become
a shinobi too, aren't you?

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:29.343
Huh?

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:31.812
Actually, I haven't decided yet.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:36.517
Huh?

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.219
Huh?

00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:41.588
(sighs) Are you being serious?

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.059
I actually lost to
someone like you?

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:50.898
(footsteps tapping)

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.132
Huh?

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:58.005
Now we're going to switch
up the venues a bit

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.774
and let all of you take
part in a simple mission.

00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:02.209
All right!

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:04.478
Hey, let's all do our best to
make this mission a success!

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:06.413
Look, don't get
ahead of yourself.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.215
I'm gonna be the
one who stands out.

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:09.016
Huh?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.317
I came to this session

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.619
with my mind already made
up to become a shinobi.

00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:14.021
There's no way I'm gonna lose

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.956
to someone who hasn't
decided on anything!

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:17.524
Hey, that's enough.

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:18.725
For this trial mission,

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.228
teamwork between the three
of you as a squad is crucial.

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:24.398
The way that you're
behaving, you won't succeed.

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:25.666
Fine.

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.270
The trial mission's
about to begin.

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:33.373
I'm going to head out shortly
so that I can observe.

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:34.308
Just imagine!

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:35.742
There's a chance that
Naruto's daughter

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.544
will attend the Academy one day.

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:39.947
It leaves me at a
complete loss for words.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.315
First there was Boruto

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:43.617
and now possibly his sister
coming to the Academy!

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.653
Nothing could please us
more, wouldn't you say?

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:47.654
(sighs) You know what?

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.189
You're really lucky.

00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:50.457
It's just that as their teacher,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.292
you have the good luck
of getting to interact

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:54.962
personally with all
of the students.

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:57.030
(sighs) But as their principal,

00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:59.233
I don't even get to teach
any classes whatsoever,

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.301
so I'm kinda stuck here.

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:04.071
Uh, well, uh, sir, would
you like to come along too?

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.473
And observe the mission
together with me?

00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:07.541
[Principal] Really?

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:11.512
Well, all right, you ready?

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:13.614
Ehou's pretty amazing, huh?

00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:16.550
I mean, he already knows
he wants to be a shinobi!

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:18.218
Uh, yeah.

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:21.388
I guess that's why his
reflexes are so good.

00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:22.623
(Yuina laughs)

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:23.624
On today's mission,

00:10:23.657 --> 00:10:26.560
you're going to be
searching for a lost cat!

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.529
A lost cat, seriously?

00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:29.396
The information we have

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:31.098
indicates that it
ran into the park

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.466
somewhere right over here.

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:35.569
So, you three are going
to go in to search for it.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.173
But this park is seriously huge.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.909
Now, these are signal flares.

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:43.343
If you run into some difficulty

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:45.112
and decide it's going
to be impossible

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.680
for you to continue
with the mission,

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:49.683
then just use these and
we'll step in immediately.

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:53.420
Although, doing so will mean
that you all fail the mission.

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:56.924
So if we use this,

00:10:56.957 --> 00:11:00.127
that means it's all
over and we fail, huh?

00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:03.630
All right, the three of you

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:07.601
must work together on this
mission and do your very best.

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:08.602
[Ehou and Yuina] Ma'am!

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:10.170
Ah, yes, ma'am!

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.179
How are we supposed to
search this whole place?

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:22.249
Yeah, seriously, this
place is so huge.

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:25.252
I wonder if we can
find any clues to help.

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:26.520
Ah.

00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:28.689
[Himawari and Ehou] Huh?

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.329
(bushes rustling)

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.363
Found 'em.

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:40.200
[Himawari] Are those...

00:11:40.234 --> 00:11:41.668
Animals can leave
all kinds of tracks

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.904
and signs behind when
they're moving around.

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:45.706
You're amazing, Yuina!

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:47.107
Now, since it's someone's pet,

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.576
I'm sure that it's really
scared to be out here.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.513
So, to protect itself,
it'll probably take shelter

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:54.982
and hide in a dark
or isolated place.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:59.052
Incredible, Yuina, you
really know your stuff.

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:01.255
(chuckles) Well, I
did make up my mind

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:03.857
to become a shinobi in
the future, too, so-

00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:05.225
(Himawari gasps)

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.794
So, so, I've just studied
up on a whole lot of things.

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.029
Oh.

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:10.664
Okay, let's go.

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:11.698
Mm-hmm.

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:15.169
(footsteps pattering)

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:16.203
Oh.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:19.740
(Himawari gasps)

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:24.478
(teachers swooshing)

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:34.087
(Ehou groans)

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:37.191
Let's see, here.

00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:39.493
I wonder how they're
doing so far?

00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:42.362
(bushes rustling)

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.101
Huh?

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:53.507
[Himawari] I'm the only one

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.310
who hasn't made up my mind
about what I want to be.

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:57.311
[Ehou] Hey!

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:58.278
Huh?

00:12:58.312 --> 00:13:00.681
If you don't wanna help
us search, then leave.

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:04.618
Listen, the two of us
want to become shinobi,

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:06.186
so we wanna show all the sensei

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.788
everything that
we're capable of.

00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:10.057
Huh? I'm sorry.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.192
Himawari, it's just...

00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:15.596
Ah, oh no! (gasping)

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:16.730
What happened?

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:19.066
I think the rock that I
just threw may have hit it!

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:20.300
[Himawari and Yuina] Huh?

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:23.537
(swarm buzzing)

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.773
(students screaming)

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:31.111
-(students screaming)
-(swarm buzzing)

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:34.848
We'll be fine if we
can keep our distance!

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:36.049
-Hey, don't!
-But!

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:38.085
Come on! Just outrun 'em!

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.655
(swarm buzzing)

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.800
(bushes rustling)

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.903
Oh, good, we
managed to get away.

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.337
Oh, yeah.

00:13:58.472 --> 00:14:00.374
You were gonna use the
flare, weren't you?

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:03.043
Uh, I just thought it
would have been so horrible

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:04.978
if we ended up
getting hurt out here.

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:07.447
Whatever, this may
be a game to you,

00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.916
but I'm dead serious.

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.384
So, do not you even think

00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:12.753
about using it for
something as minor as that.

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:15.856
I know they've already seen
that I'm suited to be a shinobi,

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.858
so don't you dare
interfere, got it?

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.159
(Himawari grunts)

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:21.161
I just can't go on a mission
with somebody like you

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.797
who doesn't have their heart
set on becoming a shinobi!

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.032
(Himawari gasps)

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:28.235
Yuina, it's just us two now.

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:29.570
But, Ehou?

00:14:29.603 --> 00:14:30.971
It's fine, come on.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.642
(Yuina sighs)

00:14:37.678 --> 00:14:40.514
(Himawari sighs)

00:14:51.825 --> 00:14:54.394
(footsteps crunching)

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:55.429
Huh?

00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:01.368
Huh? Mr. Principal!

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:03.770
(sigh) Oh dear, it seems

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:06.006
the three-man squad's
been broken up.

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:09.276
(Himawari sighs)

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:12.913
I realize that maybe I haven't
been putting enough thought

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:15.015
into anything up until now.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.986
(Principal sighs)

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.154
So, it's time for me to decide

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:23.423
just what I'm going
to do, isn't it?

00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:27.160
Then, I'll become a shinobi!

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.998
You can take part in
this trial session

00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:32.766
even if you haven't
reached a decision

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.601
about anything just yet.

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:36.036
[Himawari] Huh?

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.572
It's only natural to feel
some doubt and uncertainty

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.374
when you're still
unsure about what path

00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:43.110
you might really
want to take in life.

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:45.812
One of the reasons we hold
trial sessions such as this one

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:48.582
is to motivate you into
thinking about all the options

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.083
that are available to you.

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.586
The options?

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.455
For now, why don't you just try
completing the trial session,

00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:57.391
and then you can
think more about it.

00:15:57.424 --> 00:16:00.594
It won't be too late
for you even then.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.329
Um, I understand.

00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:05.232
Okay then, I'll keep at
it until the very end.

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:08.135
Besides, I'd feel awful if I
were to give up on a mission

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:10.370
when I'm still in
the middle of it.

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:14.174
(chuckles) Spoken just
like Naruto's child.

00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:17.177
It seems that you've
inherited his gutsiness.

00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:20.180
His gut, gutsy what?

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:22.149
Uh, hold on, what is that?

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:25.819
It just means it's
very important

00:16:25.853 --> 00:16:27.221
that you never give up.

00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:28.922
Hmm.

00:16:28.956 --> 00:16:31.225
All right, now that
that's decided,

00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:32.993
I have to go
complete the mission

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:35.529
and then make Ehou
take back what he said.

00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:36.730
Ah, hey, hold on.

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:39.900
It's still a three-man squad,
so be nice and get along.

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:43.036
(chuckles) Oh, right.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.439
Okay, I gotta get going now.

00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:49.476
Right, just be careful,
okay? (chuckles)

00:16:51.545 --> 00:16:52.513
(cat yawns)

00:16:52.546 --> 00:16:54.014
[Yuina] Is that the kitty?

00:16:54.047 --> 00:16:56.650
Yeah, it looks like
we finally found him.

00:16:57.551 --> 00:17:00.254
That means we've
completed the mission.

00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:01.655
Yeah, but was it really okay

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.625
for us to just leave
Himawari behind like that?

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:05.492
Oh, just shut up!

00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:07.261
It doesn't matter
if she isn't here.

00:17:07.294 --> 00:17:08.996
Let's just get him quickly.

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:11.865
(cat yowls)

00:17:11.899 --> 00:17:12.933
-(Ehou grunts)
-(Ehou and Yuina thud)

00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:13.901
-(cat meowing angrily)
-You got him!

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:15.035
All right, let's get back.

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:16.170
-(boards cracking)
-(cat yowling)

00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:18.472
-(Ehou and Yuina scream)
-(board clattering)

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:20.007
(Himawari swooshes)

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.409
I gotta catch up with
those guys, and fast!

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.747
But where? Where are they?

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:29.917
(Himawari gasps)

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.986
(birds twittering)

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.989
(Ehou groaning)

00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:39.793
It's impossible to climb
up out of here that way.

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:41.028
Why'd this happen?

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.663
We caught the cat
and everything!

00:17:42.696 --> 00:17:44.464
What do we do now?

00:17:44.498 --> 00:17:46.166
How could this happen?

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.235
If Himawari were
here along with us,

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:49.436
I really don't think
that this would've-

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:51.038
Are you trying to say
that this is my fault?

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.840
[Himawari] Hey,
are you guys okay?

00:17:52.873 --> 00:17:54.274
[Ehou and Yuina] Huh?

00:17:54.308 --> 00:17:56.643
Did you get hurt when
you fell in there?

00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:57.778
It's Himawari!

00:17:57.811 --> 00:17:59.847
What's she doing here?

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.148
Hold on for a sec!

00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:02.316
I'll go look for something

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:04.451
that you can use
to climb back up!

00:18:04.484 --> 00:18:05.519
[Ehou] Wait!

00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:07.087
We don't need your help!

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:09.289
(Himawari gasps)

00:18:09.323 --> 00:18:12.593
I'd rather die than accept
help from someone like you!

00:18:12.626 --> 00:18:14.061
(Himawari sighs)

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.062
What does it matter?

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:16.263
We already failed the mission.

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:18.665
But now there's a chance
for us to save it.

00:18:18.699 --> 00:18:20.601
Shut up! Just shut up!

00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:23.303
I just don't want her
help, and that's that!

00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:24.137
You hear me?

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.906
I'm not gonna accept your help!

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.708
I don't even care
about the mission!

00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:29.776
What a big pain,
it's all over now.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.479
Are you seriously gonna give up?

00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:33.614
(Ehou gasps)

00:18:33.647 --> 00:18:36.049
You told me earlier not to
use that, no matter what.

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:40.521
Uh, well, that was,
um, it's different.

00:18:40.554 --> 00:18:41.488
Didn't you already decide

00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:43.257
that you want to
become a shinobi?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.759
And now you're just
gonna give it all up?

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:46.760
(Ehou gasps)

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.129
Well, I, I mean it's just...

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:51.131
Look, even I can't...

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:53.300
No, I don't really
want to give up.

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:56.136
Then don't.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.738
You can just choose not to.

00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:01.108
Himawari.

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:06.013
(Yuina chuckles)

00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:08.148
Look, Sensei told us
that this is a mission

00:19:08.182 --> 00:19:10.150
for a three-man squad, right?

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:13.987
So, if the three of us just
work together, we can do it.

00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:16.456
Yeah, that's what
we were told, but-

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.891
Let's try our best.

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:20.527
Come on, we've all
gotta move as one!

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:21.562
Ah, okay.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:24.798
[All] Ready, go.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.033
Ready, go.

00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:28.202
Ready, go.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.205
Ready, go.

00:19:31.238 --> 00:19:33.974
Awesome, we'll complete this
mission, no matter what!

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.209
[Ehou and Yuina] Yeah!

00:19:37.044 --> 00:19:39.012
[All] Ready, go.

00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:40.247
Ready, go.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.216
Ready, go.

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:44.418
Ready, go.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:49.656
(students panting)

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.691
We did it.

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:53.861
-We made it out!
-(cat yowls)

00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:56.463
Yeah, we actually
pulled it off, you guys!

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:57.931
So, um, listen.

00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.166
Huh?

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.635
Sorry about everything
that I said.

00:20:01.668 --> 00:20:03.570
Uh, Ehou.

00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:06.507
Anyway, now you can just hit
me until you feel better.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.307
Huh?

00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:08.775
I'm not asking, I'm telling you!

00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:09.877
No. I don't wanna.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.045
I already forgot all about it.

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:14.748
No way, that doesn't sit
right with me, you hear?

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:15.816
Come on!

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:17.885
Yuina, what am I
supposed to do here?

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:20.587
(Yuina laughing)

00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:21.588
[Ehou] Hit me!

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:23.624
[Himawari] Ah, no.

00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:25.926
[Ehou] Come on, come at me.
[Himawari] Ah, I can't do that.

00:20:25.959 --> 00:20:27.461
I almost stepped
in, but in the end,

00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:29.730
they managed to turn the
mission into a success.

00:20:29.763 --> 00:20:32.299
[Instructor] All three of
them have a lot of potential.

00:20:32.332 --> 00:20:35.469
Yeah, looks like it. (chuckles)

00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:40.507
(upbeat music)

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:43.110
All three of you really
outdid yourselves today.

00:20:43.143 --> 00:20:45.012
So, job well done, guys.

00:20:46.213 --> 00:20:48.749
[Students] Thank you very
much for the opportunity.

00:20:48.782 --> 00:20:51.985
(students laughing)

00:20:54.288 --> 00:20:56.089
[Himawari] Being a
shinobi's so fun!

00:20:56.957 --> 00:20:59.159
So, what happened during
the trial session?

00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:01.662
We were all really focused
on the mission's success,

00:21:01.695 --> 00:21:04.932
and it felt super great when
we managed to complete it.

00:21:04.965 --> 00:21:06.133
So, does this mean

00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:08.035
that you've decided
to become a shinobi?

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:11.271
Mommy, Boruto, I think

00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:16.977
I really wanna learn
about all kinds of jobs!

00:21:17.878 --> 00:21:19.246
Huh?

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.715
I mean, there are a whole
lot of other kinds of things

00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:23.016
that people can do, right?

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.785
There are places
like the flower shop

00:21:24.818 --> 00:21:26.086
and the ninja tool shop.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.454
There are people who draw things

00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.723
and also people who
protect the village.

00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:31.758
Oh, and people at
the post office.

00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:33.327
So, just what are
you telling us?

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.795
That you've already decided

00:21:34.828 --> 00:21:36.597
you don't want to
become a shinobi?

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.764
No, it isn't that.

00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:40.200
I kind of wanna think about
what other things I can do

00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:42.102
besides being a shinobi.

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:44.905
I wonder what would
be a good fit?

00:21:44.938 --> 00:21:47.040
I mean, I really do
like to draw a lot,

00:21:47.074 --> 00:21:49.176
and I also like to
cook stuff, too.

00:21:49.209 --> 00:21:50.444
But, at the same time, I like

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:53.046
being active and
moving around, as well!

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.848
Yeah, it's tough.

00:21:54.882 --> 00:21:58.652
I wonder what you're gonna
be best suited for, Himawari?

00:21:58.685 --> 00:21:59.720
Oh, yeah, big brother,

00:21:59.753 --> 00:22:02.122
I want to study about
lots of other things, too!

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.590
So, will you help me?

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:04.091
Uh, okay.

00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:07.694
(Himawari giggles)

00:22:11.698 --> 00:22:16.670
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.056
(somber music)

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.125
[Mitsuki] Yes, it was
raining that night.

00:23:45.158 --> 00:23:46.727
Mikazuki led me to him

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.162
and that was the
first time we met.

00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:53.567
His name, where he came from,
if he's a bad person or not,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.170
none of that mattered
in the beginning.

00:23:56.203 --> 00:24:00.507
Mikazuki took a liking
to him as well, but...

00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:04.044
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:04.077 --> 00:24:05.646
Mitsuki's Rainy Day.

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:08.615
Maybe we weren't actually
meant to meet, after all.

00:24:11.885 --> 00:24:17.090
(closing theme music)
