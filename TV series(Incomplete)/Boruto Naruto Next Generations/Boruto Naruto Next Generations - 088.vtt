[BORUTO] <i>Damn it! I can't use</i>
<i>jutsu like this.</i>

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.758
Sorry, it's all my fault.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.927
Hey, Old Man! What's the
deal?!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.829
Now that you've captured us...

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.631
just what are you gonna do
with us?

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.366
Why, nothing!

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.102
I just want to keep you out of
the way...

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.337
so you don't make trouble until
the plan's been completed...

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.338
that's all.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.375
Yes... We don't like
troublesome brats.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.644
Till we do something about those
Fabrications

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:44.745
or whatever they are...

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.047
we can't stop Old Man Ohnoki.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:55.222
Ah, ha! You can see the
village now.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:59.059
None of you will be harmed as
long as you behave and-

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.539

Wait, what's going on? It's

Just what is the meaning of all
this, Kirara?

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.425
You'll have to ask Lord Ku
himself about it.

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:20.133
(CURIOUS)

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.072
(BOWING)

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:38.051
I welcome you home, my Master.

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:39.987
We ran into some small
obstacles...

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.457
but now the plan is going
smoothly.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.726
Going smoothly, eh?

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.296
Yes. The production of
Akuta is proceeding faster...

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.331
than our original estimate.

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:54.134
And the problems that had arisen
have all been dealt with-

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.870
[OHNOKI] Then why is there no
one in the village?!

00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:00.107
And why are there Akuta out
walking through the streets?!

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:02.109
Master...?

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.111
Tell me...

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:10.317
What the hell were you thinking
with all of this, Ku?!

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.221
The situation changed greatly
while you were gone, Master.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.123
<i>That's why we've now</i>
<i>taken control...</i>

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.091
<i>of the Hidden Stone Village.</i>

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.261
<i>[OHNOKI] Taken control?!</i>

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:26.099
The Akuta Plan is a measure to
be used only in an emergency!

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:31.071
Why did you feel you needed to
take control of the village?

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:35.809
Because the transient lives
that we'd been given...

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:37.778
are just about to run out, sir.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.012
Can't be!

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.649
The deterioration wasn't
supposed to occur this soon!

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:44.418
I've enacted countermeasures.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.954
What?!

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:48.789
We've already secured several
humans...

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.991
whose hearts will soon
become ours.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:54.294
Is he saying that he's gonna
transplant the hearts...

00:04:54.328 --> 00:04:55.963
taken out of living people?

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:57.197
What?! No way!

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:59.833
I mean, if they do something
like that, then...

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:01.502
what would happen to the
human donors?

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:02.402
What is going on?

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.105
Wasn't the whole point of
creating you Fabrications...

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.208
...in the first place
to maintain a peaceful world?

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:11.078
All we need now is your final
approval, Master.

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.081
There's no way I would ever
allow such a thing!

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:17.284
This is just a necessary
sacrifice for the greater good!

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.453
You reached the same conclusion,
Master--

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.789
What are you saying? The whole
point of our plan...

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.159
has always been to prevent the
sacrifice of young lives!

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:29.663
What you're suggesting we try to
do is the exact opposite

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.331
of what my plan is all about!

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:34.334
But Master... in order to
continue with the plan,

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:37.070
the strength that we possess
is essential.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:40.374
[KU] <i>Not a minute can be wasted.</i>

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:44.244
(SHOCKED) I'll think of another
solution.

00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:48.382
Anyway, go release those in
custody immediately.

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:51.752
I'm sorry, but I cannot leave
you in command any longer.

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:56.423
Please, wait.

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:58.725
What is it now?

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.162
There was a time, Master, when
you explained to me...

00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:05.098
...that we Fabrications were to
be your arms and your legs.

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:07.968
<i>That to create the ideal</i>
<i>world...</i>

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.070
<i>we'll be the substitutes</i>
<i>who'll do the work.</i>

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:14.107
<i>So now, when those arms and</i>
<i>legs</i>

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:15.175
<i>are about to disintegrate...</i>

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.979
<i>...who will take our place</i>
<i>to fulfill your dream?</i>

00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:21.381
We have nothing more to talk
about!

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:25.085
Master, does this mean...
that you're telling us to die?

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:26.753
(CURIOUS)

00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:29.089

(ANGRY GROWL)

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.901
Oh my, now he's done it...

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.769
Is this really alright, Lord Ku?

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:47.074
The Master's wish is supposed to
be our wish, as well.

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:51.044
The Master is temporarily not in
his right mind.

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:52.279
Nothing has changed.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.481
We're back together with the
Master once again.

00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:57.117
Begin preparations for the
transplants.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.585
[KOKUYOU] <i>What about them?</i>

00:06:58.619 --> 00:06:59.620
[KU] <i>Do as you please.</i>

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.089
Quit messing around!

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:03.824
You know too much.

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:07.995
Every hindrance, no matter how
small, must be eliminated.

00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:11.265
Wonderful! Because I
just found something pretty!

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:13.433
(SCOFFING HARRUMPH)

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:14.668
I thought that...

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:18.272
the Old Man created you guys to
protect humans, didn't he?!

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:20.574
So why are you planning on
hurting them, then?!

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.577
It's not our place to
think about such things.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.845
How can you say that?!

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:27.981
I'm certain that you guys must
have a will- and a heart, too!

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:31.652
A heart? No,... we
have no such thing.

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:37.391
And that's why we Fabrications
are far superior to you humans.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.459
(FRUSTRATED)

00:07:39.493 --> 00:07:40.627
(WORRIED)

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.499

(EXCITED)

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:10.991
The Akuta are guarding the
captive Hidden Stone Shinobi...

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:12.993
so they're shorthanded.

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.095
Let's get out of here while we
still can!

00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:25.472
Well, it looks like...

00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:28.108
I'm gonna get to pay you back
properly now.

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:30.644
So, you returned to look for
your final resting place?

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.113
I shall be glad to assist you!

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:36.083
Alright, it's about time we turn
the tables on this guy.

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.219
(SIGH) I guess the majority
has spoken.

00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:42.289
Boruto and Sarada, you
get going and find Mitsuki.

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:44.291
He oughta be over in
their hideout.

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:46.293
Just don't be reckless,
Shikadai.

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:49.630

Very cute.

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:19.793

in a real battle.

I just love pretty things!

00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:03.103

would look far better on me

Shut up! Like I'd just
give 'em to you!

Ah... Then I have no choice but
to take them from you.

00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:14.481
You see, all pretty things
belong to me.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:15.415
Hold on...

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:20.787

for close combat.

I was looking forward to this.

have to offer...

This is all thanks to the data
from your heart, Mitsuki.

any jutsu...

it's her duty to pay it back

I'd say you did a lot more than
just double right now...
