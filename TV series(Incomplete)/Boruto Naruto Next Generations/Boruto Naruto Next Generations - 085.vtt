Damn it... I can't just be here
relaxing like this.

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:00.521
How long do we have to stay
here?

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:01.288
[OHNOKI] <i>Like I said...</i>

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:02.956
(CURIOUS)

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.025
<i>...in order to get out of</i>
<i>here...</i>

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.393
<i>you must find your "Heart</i>
<i>Stone,"</i>

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.996
<i>...the one that's yours</i>
<i>and yours alone.</i>

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.097
<i>But that's only possible-</i>

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.832
"...for those with the will to
train."

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.901
That's what you were
gonna say, right?

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.802
<i>[OHNOKI] All that you have</i>
<i>now...</i>

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.971
<i>is the desire to leave this</i>

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.407
However, if you realize
or learn something...

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.642
while you're here...

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:24.645
then you'll be able to obtain
the Heart Stone.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.146
Ugh, that's so lame...

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.850
Who ever thought up a stupid
rule like that, anyway?

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.486
It seems to me that you
have a bad habit of...

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.323
only looking at things on a
surface level.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.092
<i>Well,... I suppose that</i>
<i>can't be helped.</i>

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:41.662
After all, you didn't come to
this place...

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.830
with the intent to train.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:45.432
(STANDS UP)

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.434
Yeah, it's fine. Just go to
sleep, Old Man.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.276
Damn it! Why'd I have to stumble
into this stupid place.

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:01.148
Who's there?!

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.986
I'm the one who should be saying
that!

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.156
This is sacred Hidden Stone
land.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.490
Which means that trespassers...

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:13.994
aren't welcome here, Boruto
Uzumaki!

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.263
How do you know who I am?

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:19.166
Stop pretending! How could you
possibly forget...

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.168
the Stone's Genbu Shinobi
Trio...?

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.971
...and the impression we made at
the Chunin Exams?!

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.408
Oh, that's right...

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:31.211
Come to think of it, there were
those three guys who got knocked

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:32.646
out in the first round.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.047
What was that?!

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.518
All right, I'm going to make you
take those words back right now!

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:38.318

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.569
Set a trap in advance with these
rocks, did ya?

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.970
Very smart, Boruto!

00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:59.273
[BORUTO] Your nose is bleeding.

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:01.275
[OHNOKI] Hey, Boruto.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:02.910
(STUNNED)

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:04.144

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.549
L- Lord Third! This... this is
such an honor!

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:11.652
And to be able to meet you here,
of all places!

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.154
Hey, come on! You're only
talking to Old Man Ohnoki.

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:16.490
How dare you speak so insolently
to the legend

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:17.824
of the Hidden Stone!

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:19.960
Hey, wait a moment. Aren't
you...?

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.296
I'm Sekki of the Genbu Shinobi
Trio, sir!

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.831
Yes, of course, that's right!

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.501
But what exactly are you
doing here?

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.736
Thank you so much for asking,
sir!

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.840
I've been training here in the
Sanzu Plain all by myself,

00:04:32.873 --> 00:04:35.642
searching for my very own
Heart Stone!

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.845
Ah, yes! I see, I see!

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:41.315
And, uh is your search going
well so far?

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:42.983
[SEKKI] Oh, yes, of course!

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.153
(STOMACH GROWLS)

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.525
You spent three days and nights
without food or water...

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:52.860
and didn't find it?

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:54.795
So what happened to all
your food?

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:56.496
I brought a whole lot with me,
but...

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.533
I'm afraid I ate it all
on the first day.

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:00.300
Nice goin', bud.

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:03.170
[SEKKI] So, Lord Third,...

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:05.973
What are you doing here with
someone like Boruto?

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:06.974
(ANNOYED) Okay.

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:08.008
(CONSIDERING)

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:12.279
I'd be happy to tell
you all about it if he won't.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.816
This old man you have so much
admiration for got my friends-

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.651
[SEKKI] -out of danger?

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.987
He must've saved your friends
from some terrible fate, right?!

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.155
No way! That isn't what happened
at all!

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.892
Just leave it to the legend of
the Hidden Stone!

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.660
Man, he's so cool.

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.661
(ANNOYED)

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:28.996
(UNCERTAIN)

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.468
Listen, Boruto...

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.669
(ANNOYED) Hm?

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:36.603
Earlier, why didn't you--?

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:40.507
Because there's just no point in
telling the truth...

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.808
to a guy like that.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.144
I mean, just look at him...

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:47.147
(STOMACH GROWLS)

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:50.150
I never imagined that trying to
find my Heart Stone...

00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.586
would prove to be so
difficult...

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:55.122
He's never gonna find it, the
guy's completely hopeless.

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.295
[OHNOKI] Rest assured, Sekki.

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.864
You must not despair.

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:06.867
Boruto will help you locate your
Heart Stone.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.236
I'll what?! Don't volunteer me
for stuff!

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.471
Will he actually be of
any use, though?

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:13.740
Are you kidding me?! Just shut
up!

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:15.809
If Sekki finds his Heart
Stone...

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:18.512
we may be able to exit along
with him.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.381
So either you help him,...

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:23.817
or we're going to end up dying
here.

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.986
Ugh, you gotta be kidding me.

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.061
[SEKIEI] Seems her flesh is
deteriorating...

00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.430
faster than anticipated.

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:38.232
Earlier, the Doctor said to
me...

00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:41.802
if he can clone my heart, the
problem might be solved.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.570
[SEKIEI] Is the analysis going
well?

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:46.807
It seems that the Curse Mark
on my heart is strong...

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.809
so it's going to take time.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:52.746
Although, it should only take
one or two more examinations.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.884
Mitsuki,... you coming here is
going to be our salvation!

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:01.989
All of us... owe you our lives.

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:03.790
What problem is that?

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:05.659
Extremely high-level
technology...

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:08.328
was used in the construction of
Mitsuki's heart.

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:11.765
Furthermore, a troublesome Curse
<i>Mark is in the way.</i>

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.501
Look, are you going to be able
to replicate it or not?!

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.136
Tell me the truth!

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.107
Possibly. But doing so will
require a certain part.

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:22.142
What is it?

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:26.280
What we're going to need is a
human heart.

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:29.249
One for each for you including
<i>Sekiei and the others...</i>

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.952
Which means five all together,
then...?

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:34.054
But the Master most likely won't
authorize...

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.990
the sacrifice of human
lives for this.

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:38.192
We would be wise to remember...

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.994
...that the whole reason we were
created was to protect humans,

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.996
who are weaker than us.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.131
But that means...

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.668
eventually, Lord Ku, you and the
others will...

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:50.304
(SIGH) So you're
saying unless we survive...

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:52.806
...we aren't going to be
able to follow through...

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.008
with our job of protecting
humans.

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.878
But still... taking anyone
from the Hidden Stone

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:00.147
would be far too conspicuous.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.615
What else can we possibly do?

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:06.486
(RUNNING)

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.454

Who are you?!

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.261
(CONSIDERING) Nope, that wasn't
it.

00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:48.996
Does this thing even really
exist?!

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.732
It's hard to believe that such a
special stone...

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:53.667
is just lying around here!

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.969
It's not just about its
appearance, y'know, Boruto?

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:58.305
The hardship that you endure...

00:08:58.338 --> 00:08:59.973
and the effort you put into
finding the Heart Stone...

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:01.975
are what gives it value.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:03.810
The effort I'm putting in,
you mean.

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:05.579
C'mon, don't get so riled up!

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:10.317
(SIGH) (DRINKS)

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.086
Hey, stop! Go easy on the
water, would ya?!

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.557
I know! But they say that thirst
makes you lose your

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.758
concentration.

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:20.928
Listen, you've really gotta quit
making excuses for everything!

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:23.997
(SIGH) We're never gonna get out
of here....

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:30.737
Nope... This one's not it,
either!

00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.107
Hey, how about this one? It's
sparkly and looks special.

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:36.643
That isn't even close to it!

00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:38.011
Hey!

00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:39.980
Didn't I say it's not
about how it looks?!

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.815
Dude, what's with the stuck-up
attitude?

00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:43.817
You just have to pick one of
these

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:45.385
to be your Heart Stone, right?

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:48.322
The shape, or the effort, or
whatever...Just do it.

00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:50.257
My late granny used to tell
me...

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.660
that you'll know the real one
when you hold it in your hand.

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:54.761
No matter what...

00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:57.865
I'll find my Heart Stone, and
become the Tsuchikage!

00:09:57.898 --> 00:10:00.367
Seriously? You wanna become
Tsuchikage?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.136
Don't you think that you're

jutsu or infuse chakra here.

If I didn't get dust in my eye
just now, you'd be dead!

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.040

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:43.310

Are you okay, old man?
What happened?

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:13.574
I dozed off on a boulder and
almost fell, and then...

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:15.809
I don't think that we should
leave you alone anymore!

Cut it out, Boruto. You're only
gonna make it worse doing that!

(RELAXED SIGH) You're very good
at that!

00:11:38.632 --> 00:11:41.335
Well, my granny also had issues
with a bad back.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.837
I'd give her a back rub every
night.

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:45.272
Yeah, you mentioned your granny
before...

00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:49.843
Granny was always worried that I
still hadn't found

00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:53.514
my Heart Stone. Before she
died...

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:55.315
...I really wish that...

Oh, my, my! It's been ages

It's as though I've grown
feathers and could fly away!

Calm down! Take it easy, old

Just what could they be hiding,

Accept your fate. If you're a

00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:07.307
See, Granny? I did it! I
finally found my Heart Stone!

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:11.478
The stone's glowing!

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:15.282
(GASP)

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:18.018
That path must be the way outta
here, Lord Third!

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:21.488
Hey, Sekki, hold up! Wait!

00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:24.658
This way, Boruto!

00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:33.166
Whoa, we really made it out!

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:37.938
Of course! Why, did you doubt
we would?

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:40.307
(RELIEVED SIGH) Thank
goodness!

00:20:40.974 --> 00:20:43.544
Hey, Lord Third!

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:47.147
Uh... Boruto? Lord
Third!

00:20:48.315 --> 00:20:51.018
I don't think that guy's gonna
lose his way anymore.

00:20:51.051 --> 00:20:52.586
What do you say, Old Man?

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:53.887
(affirmative) Mhm.

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:56.156
So, what are we gonna do now?
Got a plan?

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.192
(CONSIDERING)

00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:02.462
Master Ku.

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:04.865
Kontsuchi has now regained
consciousness.

00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:10.270
And there are shinobi gathering
at the Tsuchikage's Office.

00:21:10.304 --> 00:21:13.006
It won't be long until they
figure out the situation...

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.609
with Kurotsuchi.

00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:17.144
[KU] <i>Wake those two up.</i>

00:21:18.645 --> 00:21:21.014
It looks like we're going to
have to take control...

00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:24.151
of the Hidden Stone Village.

00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:27.487
Boruto,... you're missing the
entire point of all this!

00:21:28.856 --> 00:21:32.125
We don't have any desire to hurt
anybody.

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.795
All that we want to do is create
a world...

00:21:34.828 --> 00:21:36.864
where everyone can live happily.

00:21:36.897 --> 00:21:38.665
You really expect me to believe
that?

00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:41.969
Look, Boruto...

00:21:42.002 --> 00:21:44.004
...bear with me just a little
longer.

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.140
