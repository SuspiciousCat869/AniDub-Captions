00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.153
[groaning]

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:26.593
Potato chips... soda... cream
puffs! [groaning]

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:29.263
<i>Sweet bean dumplings!</i>

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.397
[groaning]

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.967
Could you knock off your
annoying mumbling, already?

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.771
How much longer are we gonna
have to keep walking until we
reach this Ryuchi Cave?

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.773
[exasperated sighs]

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:43.610
And why do we have to go through
all of this just to get to this
place?

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.012
It's to find Mitsuki.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:51.385
The only one who can analyze
this snake is the White Snake
Sage of Ryuchi Cave.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.389
That's why we have to do
whatever it takes to get there,
y'know!

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:59.593
So what's this Ryuchi Cave place
like? Or do I want to know...?

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:03.931
Orochimaru told us it's a place
of this world, while at the same
time...

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.499
not of this
world.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.769
It's a secluded site where Sages
live and undergo rigorous
training.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.739
(SHIKADAI) <i>It's said, going</i>
there out of curiosity angers
<i>the White Snake Sage...</i>

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:15.108
and you won't make it out alive.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:18.045
[chuckle] Guess there's no
telling what we might stir up...

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.980
[chuckle] Wait, what?

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:21.548
Hm?

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.116
Footprints.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:28.589
It's kinda hard to believe that
there are others besides us
who'd even want to come here...

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.224
Wait, hold on...!

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:33.861
I think these footprints...
actually belong to us!

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:37.464
What?! Listen, don't you think
that we ought to turn back?

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:41.435
Orochimaru said only those who
seek it will be able to find
it.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:45.772
If our will is strong, I know
we'll get to meet the White
Snake Sage.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:46.740
[groans]

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.142
[exasperated sigh]

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.048
Oh, so they're going to keep
going...?

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:58.218
It seems they're not simply
lost.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:00.554
We can take care of this
quickly.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:04.391
Alright, then. Let's go check
them out for ourselves.
[licking]

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:10.764
Uh... you guys...? What's that
light over there?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.403
Do you think it could be
Ryuchi Cave? [grunt]

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.271
Hey! Boruto!

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.144
Uh...?!

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.553
[gasps]

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:39.459
I gotta say, this is not what
I'd pictured...

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.062
[gasps]

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.063
Someone's coming!

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.131
Stay alert, guys!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.269
Hm?

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:52.206
We've been expecting all of you
to arrive.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.242
I welcome you to Ryuchi Cave.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.743
Huh?!

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:53.627
Welcome. You may call me
Tagorihime. All of you must be
exhausted.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.664
So, please take advantage of
this place to relax and get
some rest.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:58.198
Mmm...!

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.434
Actually, my feet were getting
really tired!

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.136
And something smells totally
delicious!

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.906
Wait, just a second. Is this
really Ryuchi Cave?

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.408
Yes, Of course!

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:11.445
So somewhere in here, there's a
person called the White
Snake Sage, right?

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:12.279
Yes, there is.

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.750
Master White Snake Sage is
within the temple deep inside
Ryuchi Cave right now.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:17.518
So, listen...

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:22.656
we came to see the White Snake
Sage cause we have something
really important to ask!

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.960
Why, of course. I understand
completely. I'll go and make the
arrangements, so please...

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.829
wait here for just a moment.

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:33.333
In the meantime, please...
partake of the feast that we've
prepared.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.103
Yes! They have food here!

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.305
You sure that it's okay to
eat?!

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.307
Yes! Please, help yourselves!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.275
Alright!

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:42.943
Ha ha ha!

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:44.978
It's my policy to not hold back
when invited!

00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:47.447
Yeah, let me at it! I'm
starving, too!

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.116
Hold up a sec, you guys.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.151
Huh? What's the matter, Boruto?

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:53.921
Did you guys forget everything
I said?!

00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:57.724
I literally just told you what
kind of a place Ryuchi Cave is!

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:00.827
These are special dishes
prepared for our esteemed
guests.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.763
They're here simply to
welcome you.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.965
No, but... We gotta see--

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:07.134
What's wrong with taking a
little break?!

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:12.139
Yeah, rumors are only rumors,
right? Besides, Tagorihime
doesn't seem so bad.

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:13.907
Don't you agree, Sarada?

00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:16.610
Huh? Well, uh...

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:19.980
I guess that I don't see
anything too unusual right
now...

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:21.081
[sniffing]

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.285
Yeah! The food even smells
great! I think that everything's
okay here!

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.088
They did this for us. Let's
rest and enjoy!

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.090
But listen, you guys, uh...

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.526
Whatever! I'm gonna dig in now!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.260
[chuckling]

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.131
Damn it... There's simply no
stopping Cho-Cho when she gets
like this...

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:39.433
You're taking too much!

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:40.067
Huh?!

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:43.070
[sigh] But only a little break,
okay?

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.945
[groaning]

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.581
Now, don't be shy! Please, help
yourselves!

00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:55.949
[gulp]

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:58.585
After you meet with Master White
Snake Sage...

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:02.956
I'm certain you'll be able to
learn the whereabouts of your
friend Mitsuki.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.759
So, please! Go ahead and eat,
Boruto!

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.094
Uh, yeah...

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.767
Wait... Did you just say
"Mitsuki?"

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.668
[chuckle]

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:18.105
But how do you even know about
Mitsuki?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.776
[grunt] Cho-Cho, Inojin! Drop
it!

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:23.644
Huh...?

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:28.749
You just mentioned Mitsuki's
name. But I never actually said
it out loud.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:31.785
[chuckle]

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:36.757
You're very sharp for a human.
You really should've just taken
a bite of the damn food!

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.762
[gasps and groans]

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.767
Ahhh!

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.768
Ah! Awww...

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.571
No way! Ugh, that's so gross!

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:53.507
[cackling]

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.682
[gasp] What is all this?!

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:06.653
Just when I thought that I'd get
to eat the fresh chakra of
children for a change...

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:07.754
(TAGITSUHIME) <i>You lost!</i>

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.224
Huh?!

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:11.491
(TAGITSUHIME) <i>They didn't</i>
<i>succumb to your temptations.</i>

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:18.165
Yes, I'm well aware. Our job is
to weed out all of those who
wander into Ryuchi Cave.

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:20.701
(TAGITSUHIME) <i>Of course... But</i>
<i>unfortunately...</i>

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:25.639
<i>Master White Snake Sage only</i>
<i>allows us to eat those who</i>
<i>fail our tests.</i>

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:30.410
Those who come here have given
themselves up to sheer madness
in search of power.

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:35.582
Don't be foolish enough to
assume that you'll make it all
the way to meet with Master...

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:37.284
White Snake Sage...

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.921
They're gone!

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:42.656
Not even a trace left!

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.759
It looks like the rumors about
this place were true...

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:50.297
Can you guys imagine what
would've happened to us if we'd
actually eaten all of that...

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:50.764
rotten food?

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:53.934
I bet they planned on paralyzing
us and then eating us.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:54.902
What?! No way!

00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:55.736
Bleh! Gross!

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:57.037
[worried groan]

00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:58.305
Huh?

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.111
They said that the White Snake
Sage is in the temple deep
inside...

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:06.180
Does that mean it's
over there?

00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:09.516
Alright, I'm going in! Just you
wait, White Snake Sage!

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.051
Hey! Wait, Boruto!

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:14.087
[groan] Damn it!

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:18.325
I'll just get hungrier if I have
to run! Oh, man... Ughhh!

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:19.493
[groan]

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:29.570
Sarada! Shikadai! Inojin!
Cho-Cho?!

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:33.073
Where did everybody run off to
now?! Damn it!

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.176
Huh...?!

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:40.113
Hey! Hold on!

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:46.053
I said, hold on! [gasp]

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.058
[gasp]

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:56.063
[gasp] Hm? [grunt] Damn it!
[heavy breathing]

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.100
[gasp]

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:02.269
[gasp]

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:07.107
Agh! Really?! [grunts]

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.279
Why you-! [straining]

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.048
Damn it! It won't budge!

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:30.364
Huh? What is this all about? Mm.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.744
Wait, is this a...?

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:44.745
(ICHIKISHIMAHIME) <i>You're right!</i>

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:45.746
Mm!

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:49.349
Hey, who are you? Eh...! Uh...

00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:50.484
Where are you?

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.687
My name is Ichikishimahime.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.760
Are you with the lady from
earlier? Where'd you take
Sarada and-?! Uh...! Um...

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:00.627
(ICHIKISHIMAHIME) <i>Who knows?</i>

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.764
You're the only one that I'm
interested in right now.

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:05.933
Come on. Come and play with me!

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:07.668
What?! Play?! Uh...!

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:11.738
If you fill in all the spaces in
that boulder, I'll let you out
of here.

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:15.108
All the stones you need are
right here in this room.

00:11:15.142 --> 00:11:17.845
If you can do it, then you win
the challenge.

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:20.347
Is the way I came in the only
exit?

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.817
Oh, and you better not be trying
to trick me like that other lady
did.

00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:30.123
No way! I'm really honest, so
you can believe me when I say...
It's useless to try to kill me.

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:34.494
Solving the puzzle is the only
way out of here. Simple, right?

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:38.799
You can try to fill in the
spaces as many times as you'd
like.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:41.268
Just keep going until you can't
anymore.

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:43.937
<i>As long as you want!</i>

00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:46.273
You really think I'd just give
up...

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.842
...on something this simple?!

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.111
I don't enjoy chakra that's
fresh...

00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:54.648
I prefer chakra that's weak and
just about to fade away.

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.550
I drink it all up!

00:11:56.583 --> 00:12:00.587
I'll give you this much: you
sure are creepier than the last
one!

00:12:00.621 --> 00:12:04.925
(ICHIKISHIMAHIME) Well, at least
I'm honest! [giggle]

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.061
[grunt] There's no way I'm gonna
get eaten.

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:38.525
Come on!

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.894
Just one more space!

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.797
But I can't find a stone that's
the right size!

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.799
You ready to give up now?

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:46.700
Never!

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:54.508
It's no good!

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.310
Ughhh...!

00:12:57.978 --> 00:13:02.149
Have you lost hope already?
There's still lots of time.
Despair at your own pace!

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:05.519
Ugh! I can' be wasting so much
time here like this...

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:09.356
I gotta see the Sage, to find
Mitsuki!

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:12.459
Is that the reason why you came
to Ryuchi Cave?

00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:16.029
So you're not here to acquire
the power of the Sage?

00:13:16.063 --> 00:13:18.832
No, I don't care about that kind
of stuff.

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:23.770
I see... Almost every other
human who comes to Ryuchi Cave
is after the Sage's power.

00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:27.341
I just wanna know where my
friend Mitsuki is, that's all.

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:35.249
Mitsuki... where are you now?
What are you doing?

00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:38.151
Aw, man... I still don't get it
at all...

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:39.319
[grunt]

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:43.690
Oh. Oops.

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:47.094
Uh...!

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:52.332
[gasp] Of course!

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.140
Oh, but... that won't work. You
tried that stone before, didn't
you?

00:14:00.174 --> 00:14:04.511
I did. It didn't fit then, but
maybe if I try this!

00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:10.083
That's it! It's finished!

00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:16.623
How did you know?

00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:20.494
I just tried thinking outside
the box. If the shape doesn't
fit...

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.864
then make a shape that does
fit! Right?

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:29.102
What's in front of your eyes
isn't everything. You only think
it's everything.

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:32.940
Some things can't be seen unless
you change your thinking and
perception.

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:36.176
That's something Mitsuki
made me realize!

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.515
[chuckle] You're correct. Well,
I guess you're going to be
difficult to eat.

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:48.188
Hate to tell ya, but I'm not
gonna get eaten today!

00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:49.389
[hissing and biting]

00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:50.090
[pained grunt]

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.392
[pained grunt]

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.094
[grunt]

00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:58.799
What did you just do? [pained
grunt and struggling]

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.801
I am Tagitsuhime.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:06.373
You must really be something if
you got past the trials that the
other two set for you.

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.207
[pained grunt]

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:10.944
[pained groans] This is so
uncool!

00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:14.147
You'll face me, Tagitsuhime,
next.

00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:17.284
I shall give you a test to
evaluate your heart.

00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:21.288
Of course, if you can't endure
it, then I can just eat you!

00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:26.159
[heavy breathing] I have to see
Mitsuki again- and I will!

00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:30.330
There's no way I'll let
myself get eaten here! [gasp]

00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:31.465
Sarada?!

00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:33.867
I know you're doing this for
Mitsuki's sake...

00:15:33.901 --> 00:15:39.006
but have you ever stopped and
thought about us, the ones who
get dragged along with you?

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:39.640
[pained grunt]

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:44.611
It's cause of your selfishness
that the rest of us are always
getting into trouble, Boruto.

00:15:44.645 --> 00:15:45.946
Is this genjutsu?

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:51.451
[pained grunts and groans]

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:55.122
I wish that you could put
yourself in our shoes for once!

00:15:55.155 --> 00:15:59.560
We abandoned our original
mission, and now we're gonna be
Rogue Ninjas, too.

00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:01.161
This is all
your fault.

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:04.831
You sure know how to hit me
where it hurts the most...

00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:09.469
It's possible that Mitsuki got
sick and tired of you and
decided that he should leave.

00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:12.272
You may say that Mitsuki is a
precious friend...

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:14.975
but you're the only one who
actually believes that.

00:16:15.008 --> 00:16:19.546
Mitsuki left the village of his
own free will. It was his
choice, right?

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.550
So, you're gonna ignore
Mitsuki's wishes and chase him
down anyway?

00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:26.753
[pained groans]

00:16:26.787 --> 00:16:30.490
What'll you do after you bring
him back? Are you gonna try to
understand him from now on?

00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.559
Isn't that just a convenient
excuse?

00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:37.030
Why try to understand an
outsider, anyway? What's most
important is you, right?

00:16:37.064 --> 00:16:41.201
Look, the simple fact of the
matter is that people's hearts
can change.

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:44.338
And even if you actually did
understand him, maybe in
reality...

00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:47.307
all of it was nothing
but a big lie?

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:50.477
This whole thing began because
of your own egotistical desires,
right?

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:53.847
How long will you keep on
plaguing everyone around you?

00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:55.516
<i>Just stop already.</i>

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:57.150
[grunt]

00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:09.363
[chuckle] I think Ryuchi Cave
really needs to figure out how
to mind its own damn business.

00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:09.696
Uh...!

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:20.541
To be fair, though, all of you
have a point. I realize that
what I'm trying to do isn't
easy.

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:22.643
But, it's because of that...

00:17:22.676 --> 00:17:28.315
That I... wanna confront Mitsuki
with absolutely everything
I've got.

00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:33.720
(TAGITSUHIME) [grunt] Guess
that's all we can do...

00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:37.124
Huh? [gasp]

00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:40.527
[gasp] Huh?

00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:44.631
Where am I?

00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:48.335
The entrance to Master White
Snake Sage's temple.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.137
You! Are you--?!

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:55.375
Please, wait. I acknowledge that
I've lost. You feel normal now,
don't you?

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:57.678
Uh...!? Oh...

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.483
Those who come here usually seek
to acquire the Sage's power.

00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:04.384
To be frank...

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:09.957
it's hard to believe that you
could make it all the way here
without possessing such a goal!

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.791
[nervous breath]

00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:13.460
Well, it's too bad!

00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:16.663
If I'd been able to break your
heart, then I could've eaten it
all up!

00:18:16.697 --> 00:18:17.531
Mm...!

00:18:18.632 --> 00:18:21.168
[chuckle] Listen, that's just
not gonna happen.

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:25.906
Well, go ahead. Your friends are
waiting for you inside there.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:29.610
You've undoubtedly earned the
right to meet Master White Snake
Sage.

00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:31.512
Mm. Alright!

00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:39.086
<i>What impressive willpower!</i>
<i>Although...</i>

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:43.323
<i>...if this Mitsuki becomes an</i>
actual enemy... what will you do
<i>then?</i>

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:47.361
[gasp]

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:52.366
Inojin, Sarada, Cho-Cho,
Shikadai!

00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:53.534
[groggy moans]

00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:54.935
Sarada!

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.303
[groggy moans] Boruto!

00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:58.338
[groggy moans]

00:18:58.372 --> 00:18:59.606
Are you guys okay?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.543
(WHITE SNAKE SAGE) They haven't
been harmed in the slightest...

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:06.079
[gasps and groans]

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.096
Are you the White Snake Sage
then?

00:19:24.965 --> 00:19:26.600
Muhh-huh.

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:31.471
My name's Boruto Uzumaki. And
I've come here to ask you a
favor.

00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:38.645
Oh, I know! My ears hear
everything that occurs inside
Ryuchi Cave.

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.347
She's hard to understand, huh?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.348
Shhh!

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:44.818
Then I won't bother explaining.
[gasp]

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:47.321
I want you to analyze this snake
for me.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.556
Why me?

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.358
Orochimaru sent me here.

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:57.397
Orochimaru, huh? Seems he's
softened up, then hasn't he?

00:19:57.431 --> 00:19:58.332
[groan]

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:03.337
So filled with greed, such is
man. Crawling in the darkness...

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.040
that is the true form that man
takes.

00:20:07.074 --> 00:20:13.680
All those who come here to see
me... have abandoned everything
<i>in pursuit of sheer avarice.</i>

00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:19.186
I'm different than all those
othe
r
guys. I just wanna find

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:22.322
That is not a task that is left
to me.

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:27.794
The trials you passed were for
the purpose of me seeing if I
should teach you Sage Art...

00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:29.096
understand?

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.332
That's all I know. There's
nothing else I could tell you.

00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:35.969
All of us have gone through a
huge amount to get here!

00:20:36.003 --> 00:20:39.940
So there's just no way that
we're gonna take no for an
answer!

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:41.975
Aren't Sages supposed to know
things?!

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:43.677
Help us, Granny!

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:48.982
You're going to be a real pain,
aren't you?

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:51.318
Look, I'm begging you! Please
help!

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:56.790
Very well, if you're absolutely
certain that you want me to
analyze that snake, I will-

00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.692
but only on one condition.

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.360
What's that?

00:21:00.394 --> 00:21:05.165
Deep inside Ryuchi Cave there
lives a giant snake named
Garaga...

00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:06.800
that's been giving me
trouble.

00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:09.169
So you want me to take it down?

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:11.939
Wait, Boruto! We're talking
about a giant snake!

00:21:11.972 --> 00:21:13.640
Yeah, so what?! Who cares?!

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:14.441
But, we...!

00:21:15.809 --> 00:21:18.645
Just forget it, Inojin. At this
point, it's too late to stop
him.

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:25.152
I want you to bring Garaga's
Reverse Scale to me. Doing so
will make him tame once again.

00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:29.790
I understand. But if I bring it
back, then you'd better do what
I'm asking.

00:21:29.823 --> 00:21:32.793
Garaga lives down in the
deepest...

00:21:32.826 --> 00:21:38.565
harshest recesses of Ryuchi Cave
in a nest that's simply teeming
with giant snakes.

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:39.967
You still wanna do it?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.102
Yeah, of course I want to!

00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:50.777
Was it really okay to make them
a promise such as that one?

00:21:50.811 --> 00:21:56.350
They're going up against Garaga.
Do you really think they'll come
back alive?

00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:57.150
[gasps]

00:21:57.184 --> 00:21:59.553
So, you mean, in other words...

00:21:59.586 --> 00:22:02.122
[cackle] Exactly!

00:23:41.522 --> 00:23:44.691
(CHO-CHO) <i>So um, this reverse</i>
<i>Scale... Just what is it,</i>
<i>anyway?</i>

00:23:44.725 --> 00:23:48.328
(INOJIN) A scale on the
underside of a dragon's chin
that grows in the opposite...

00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:51.999
<i>direction than the rest. You</i>
know the old saying, don't you?
<i>If you touch it...</i>

00:23:52.032 --> 00:23:53.534
<i>you incur the</i>
<i>dragon's wrath!</i>

00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:57.337
(CHO-CHO) <i>There's a giant snake</i>
with one of those? That sounds
<i>super dangerous!</i>

00:23:57.371 --> 00:24:00.340
(BORUTO) <i>No biggie! This is just</i>
<i>like a video game.</i>

00:24:00.374 --> 00:24:04.444
You take down a monster boss and
you get a special item. That's
<i>it!</i>

00:24:04.478 --> 00:24:08.448
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
Generations: "Incurring Wrath"

00:24:08.482 --> 00:24:11.118
Let's get it real
quick and clear
<i>this level!</i>
