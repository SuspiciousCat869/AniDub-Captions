(OROCHIMARU) <i>Mitsuki...</i>
<i>Mitsuki... Mitsuki...</i>

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.546
(LOG) <i>Mitsuki! Mitsuki!</i>

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.347
<i>Mitsuki!</i>

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.981
[nervous breath]

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.018
Since you're still a child, it
may be difficult for you to
understand.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.620
Eventually you'll realize
he's wrong!

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:21.688
But you need to stop Orochimaru!

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:26.460
Mitsuki... don't believe him- he
thinks he can deceive you
because you are a child.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.661
Now come to me.

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:29.796
No!

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.497
[quivering]

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.332
Mitsuki...

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.133
Mitsuki!

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.434
Now!

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.103
[quivering]

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.275
[quivering] Since I'm only a
child...

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:45.245
...I don't... really care about
that either way...

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:48.081
As for me, I'll make my own
decisions.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.283
[gasp]

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.086
<i>As for me, I'll make my own</i>
<i>decisions.</i>

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:02.729
I see... so even I'm able to
dream...

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:46.733
[chattering]

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.235
(BORUTO) <i>Huh?!</i>

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.771
You've really never had a dream
before now?

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:51.471
No.

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.308
Wow, you are super strange, you
know that?

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.045
So... what am I supposed to do
here?

00:02:58.078 --> 00:03:01.415
I can't just tell you. You have
to make the choice.

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.751
You told me you wanted to eat
something for once! That's why
we're here.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:09.389
Hey, can you guys hurry up and
decide? We're not getting any
younger over here ya know.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.961
So you're having the same thing
I am?

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.129
That's right. I want what you
want.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:18.732
Can you not creepy smile when
you say stuff like that?

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.134
You sure are upfront, Mitsuki.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.470
Don't you ever feel like
rebelling a little?

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.940
Like rebelling?

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:30.110
Yeah! You know... like when you
just want to go against what
your parent is telling you?

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.447
Not really sure... guess not.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.847
Hmmm...

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.715
Oh...!

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:35.949
Hey!

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:38.318
Hey! You guys are late.

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:39.586
Eh...? Uh...

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:42.322
Peep!

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.559
Inojin... on your a...
shoulder...

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.295
I'm sorry, but can we not talk
about it?

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:52.165
No way, you have to hear this
one. This is a classic...

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.602
Yesterday, we had a mission that
<i>took us to a poultry farm.</i>

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:58.238
[clucking]

00:03:58.272 --> 00:03:58.605
Hmmm?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.307
<i>Hey, look!</i>

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.607
Huh?

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.443
It's an egg! It might've just
been laid...

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:06.547
Mmmm... What do you think? An
omelet or sunny-side up?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.781
You can't eat it!

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:08.448
Huh?!

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:09.349
Wait, what...?

00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:11.718
Hey look... It's hatching...!

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:17.357
Peep!

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:18.358
Oh!

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:20.694
[crowing]

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:22.963
Peep, peep! Peep!

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.766
And then that little chick
totally bonded with him!

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.202
Oh what did I do to deserve
this?!

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:28.769
Peep!

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:29.703
It's imprinting.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.138
What'd you call me?!

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:33.707
Imprinting's when a chick
hatches out of its egg...

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.678
and it believes that the very
first thing it sees is its
parent.

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:40.781
And it immediately forms a bond
with what it's seen.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:43.116
<i>It's called the "imprinting</i>
<i>effect."</i>

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.486
So the first thing it sees gets
imprinted in its heart...

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:52.125
That's so interesting!

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.128
Doesn't that just sound so
sweet, Daddy Inojin!

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:57.497
Guys, give me a break, would
ya?!

00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:58.498
[chuckle] Come on...

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.835
We're helping with security for
the Five Kage Summit today.

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.605
So eat up and let's get to work,
already!

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.073
Yeah, okay...

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:13.280
In all honesty, we should've
reconvened right after
Momoshiki's attack...

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.449
but it got pushed back a little.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.185
So I apologize to all of you
for that.

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:21.154
The attack threw all of the
villages into chaos.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:24.057
The Otsutsuki Clan issue is our
main agenda now, right?

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:26.793
Yeah, and considering the
importance of the topic...

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:31.131
we've asked the previous Kage to
join us for this discussion.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.201
But please, let's not stand on
ceremony right now.

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.570
Shall I peel one for you?

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:38.238
Oh! Sure, thank you.

00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:41.108
Hey, wait. Where's Third
Tsuchikage Ohnoki?

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:46.113
About that... We were still
together when we entered the
Hidden Leaf Village, but then...

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.281
When I realized...

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:52.352
So the legendary Ohnoki has gone
senile, has he? [laughter]

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:54.555
And knowing the way that Ohnoki
is...

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:58.358
it's entirely possible that he's
disintegrated a building or two
by now!

00:05:58.392 --> 00:06:02.296
Well, I guess that it can't be
helped. He's probably out
sightseeing.

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:07.634
I'll send someone out to go
and look around for him. Can we
start without him, Kurotsuchi?

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:09.336
Yeah, please go on ahead.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.072
Ugh, seriously, that damn old
geezer...!

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:16.944
[chattering]

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.179
[yawn]

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:20.848
Hey! Stay on your toes.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:25.052
I know, but come on, this is
dull! We're just standing here
keeping watch.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:29.289
Mitsuki, do you have any
interesting stories to share
that'll help me stay awake?

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:29.990
[sigh]

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.361
Well, I don't know how
interesting this is... but can I
ask you something?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.062
Sure.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.368
Boruto... have you ever had the
uneasy feeling that perhaps
your own thoughts...

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.937
...might not actually be your
own?

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:45.606
What are you talking about?!

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.341
That chick from earlier...

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:50.310
...thought that Inojin was its
parent.

00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:55.215
Or maybe it's more accurate to
say it was forced to believe
that...

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.753
Like it's caught in a genjutsu
it can't break out of...

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:05.125
And if so, then maybe the
feeling I have of wanting to be
with you guys...

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:09.730
Maybe... I'm being forced to
feel that way, too...

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.566
Just a thought I had.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.037
Okay, listen... First of all,
we're people, we aren't chicks,
right?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.139
There's just no way you've
been "imprinted."

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:21.108
I see...

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.277
Yes, you're right!

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:29.550
What about you? You have any
interesting stories?

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:33.487
Hmmm... Ah! Oh, yeah...

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:40.127
Actually, my dad asked me this
really weird question
yesterday...

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.795
Oh, yeah? Lord Seventh did?

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:47.234
Yeah, he asked me if I knew what
the hardest rock in the whole
world is.

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:49.503
The hardest rock in the
world...?

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:53.173
You mean like what the Great
Stone Faces are carved out of?

00:07:53.207 --> 00:07:56.109
No, that isn't actually what I
meant. But still...

00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:59.413
it's like the most precious
treasure to a shinobi.

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:03.050
Do you have any idea what it
might be, Boruto?

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:06.153
Hmmm... Must be a diamond,
right?

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:08.789
There's no way the answer's
something that simple!

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:11.291
I guess not...

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:14.561
Aw man! Now that I remembered
his question, it's really
bugging me.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:15.329
Hm?

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:15.863
Huh?

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:16.463
[chattering]

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.397
Let me see...

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.566
I wonder if something
happened...

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.734
I don't know...

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.103
I think I'll go over and ask
them.

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:30.711
Hey, you know... you should try
to listen to Mitsuki's troubles
a little more seriously.

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:32.613
But I do listen to him!

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:36.750
If you keep taking his concerns
so lightly, he might stop liking
you.

00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:40.787
[chuckle] Oh, come on, that's
never gonna happen. I mean,
we're really good friends!

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:41.722
You know that!

00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:45.125
I sure hope you don't
regret this one day...

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:48.362
It seems that this man is lost
somewhere in the village.

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:52.232
They want us to help with the
efforts to look for him.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:55.369
Ohnoki of the Land of Earth,
huh...? Hey, wait a second!

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.738
Isn't that guy the Third Lord
Tsuchikage?!

00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:59.540
Whoa! This is perfect timing!

00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:01.542
Huh? What's that mean?

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:04.945
The Tsuchikage is from the
Hidden Stone Village, right?

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.314
Which means he's an expert
on rocks!

00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:10.784
Don't you get it? He must know
the answer to the question...

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:12.953
"What's the hardest rock in the
world?"

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:17.357
[chattering]

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:20.127
So he's really over a hundred
years old...?!

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.229
Even if he's the Third
Tsuchikage...

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:25.966
finding a frail old man like him
shouldn't be hard at all. Right?

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.968
So you guys really don't know?!

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:32.172
He's Ohnoki the Fence-Sitter, a
famous hero from the Fourth
Great Ninja War.

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:37.544
He's able to wield the powerful
Particle Release Jutsu. It's
this super-rare Kekkei Touta.

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:38.712
Huh...

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.549
This old man? Really? Huh?!

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:43.951
Hey! Stop!

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.987
What's your problem, old man?!
Give it back!

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:50.891
Heh! This drawing...

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.327
...doesn't look a thing like me
at all!

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:56.163
Sir, are you... Ohnoki?!

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:01.935
And you are Boruto Uzumaki,
right?

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:04.304
Wait, how do you know my name?

00:10:04.338 --> 00:10:09.109
[chuckle] I had my fair share of
looking after your father,
Naruto.

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:13.480
And you... are Sarada of the
Uchiha, aren't you?

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.115
Mhm!

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:17.551
And you must be... um...

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:19.386
My name's Mitsuki.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:20.287
I see!

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:25.559
Everybody's been out looking for
you, Ohnoki, sir. The Five Kage
Summit's underway and-

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:29.329
[growl] So what! I don't care
one whit about that meeting!

00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:31.298
It's so boring!

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:33.534
Yeah, you say that, but, uh...

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:37.304
Look, if you insist on trying to
take me back there...

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:42.276
I'll turn you all to dust with
my fearsome Particle Style and-
Ow!

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.945
Ow, that smarts...

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.314
That's the "fearsome" Particle
Style?

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:48.081
No way.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.286
Particle Style's s'posed to make
whatever it touches disintegrate
at the atomic level.

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:55.722
My back... My poor back...

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.357
Here you go!

00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:00.360
Aaaahhh!

00:11:00.394 --> 00:11:02.729
Now let's get going and return
to-

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.965
Oh hey, so by the way, old
man...

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.433
Yes, what is it?

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:07.000
Hey! Boruto!

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:11.104
Do you happen to know what the
hardest rock in the entire world
is?

00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:14.074
What? Really? You don't even
know what that is?

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:17.277
So you do know! C'mon, please!
Tell me what it is!

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:20.981
Ehhh... Well, I wonder if I
should...

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.550
Pretty please! I'll do anything
to find out!

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:25.953
Oh, you will? Alright, then...

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:31.191
Instead of taking me into
custody, if you show me around
the Hidden Leaf Village...

00:11:31.225 --> 00:11:34.094
...then I'll consider telling
you the answer.

00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:35.562
Really?!

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:36.163
Boruto...!

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:40.467
Yes, you should heed the request
of an old man whose days are
numbered.

00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:42.870
If Boruto wants to, I don't
mind.

00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:44.872
What, Mitsuki?! Not you, too!

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.341
Yes! Alright!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:50.077
I'm gonna show you around this
whole place!

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:17.971
[chewing]

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:23.277
Are you sure about this? Is it
really okay to just ditch the
Five Kage Summit?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.980
In all likelihood, they're
talking about nonsense anyway.

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:29.783
(DARUI) <i>There was another one,</i>
<i>right...?</i>

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:31.952
...who said he was Otsutsuki?

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:35.088
Yes. The one with the fishing
rod.

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:38.158
We should have a subjugation
force dispatched at once.

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:42.763
Sasuke's already gone after him.
It would be unwise to act with
too much haste.

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:44.665
But even aside from those
three...

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:48.168
we should assume there are
unknown others in the Otsutsuki
Clan.

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:50.571
Maybe we shouldn't be meeting
together like this...

00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:53.440
just sitting around making dull
conversation...

00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:57.311
This kind of thing is just the
reason why it's essential to
meet.

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:01.982
You're peeling that orange so
carefully,

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.751
I kinda have a thing about stuff
like this...

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:09.389
How can you remain so calm? We
could suffer another attack at
any moment!

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:12.926
Well, according to Sasuke's
intel...

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.229
the Otsutsuki Clan's ability to
move through dimensions requires
an enormous amount of energy.

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:20.667
It's safe to assume that we have
at least a little more time
before they can attack again-

00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:23.470
How can you be so easygoing?!

00:13:23.504 --> 00:13:28.008
Just eat the whole thing, peel
and all! It's more nutritious!

00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.810
I'm very particular about
things, so...

00:13:29.843 --> 00:13:33.280
Hey! Can we stop trivializing
the situation we're dealing
with?!

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.450
Look, what's the point of
panicking about it right now?

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.719
When you've gained as much
experience as we have...

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:41.755
you come to learn that you don't
have to jump at every little
thing.

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:47.261
Another nightmare like Kaguya's
attack is enough to make anyone
nervous, of course.

00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:50.330
But nothing is gained by being
unsettled all the time.

00:13:50.364 --> 00:13:52.799
No, I- Listen, I'm not being
"unsettled!"

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:58.505
But you- and Ohnoki, too- don't
seem to have a real sense of the
danger that we're facing here!

00:13:58.539 --> 00:13:59.239
Speaking of which...

00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:03.243
I remember how Grandpa Ohnoki
always had just the right turn
of phrase...

00:14:03.277 --> 00:14:06.847
...like how he told us that we
all already possess the...

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.482
"strongest thing in the entire
world."

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.484
[chattering]

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:15.322
I can't even see what's right in
front of me with these things in
the way.

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:17.991
Oh, stop complaining!

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:22.763
You must always heed the words
of an old man whose days are
numbered.

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:24.598
Yeah, so you keep saying...

00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:28.569
Hey... tell me the truth: is
this geezer really a legendary
shinobi?

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.170
[exasperated sigh]

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.809
You know, we really should start
heading back soon...

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:38.111
Okay! Okay!

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:46.820
(CONSTRUCTION WORKER) [gasp]
<i>Watch out!</i>

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:47.187
Huh?!

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.995
Particle Style...

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:57.130
...Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.434
[gasps and worried cries]

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:01.635
Hey! Are you okay?!

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.572
No way! That was... Particle
Style...

00:15:05.606 --> 00:15:09.076
[heavy breathing]

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:12.379
Wow, awesome! That was super
amazing, y'know!

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.580
[pained groans]

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:17.751
Huh? Hey, old man! Old man?!

00:15:20.988 --> 00:15:23.323
(KOZUCHI) <i>Grandpa! Grandpa</i>
<i>Ohnoki! Wake up!</i>

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:27.761
C'mon, Grandpa Ohnoki, wake up!

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:31.765
[gasp] Kozuchi...

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.102
So you're still alive then...?

00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:38.972
But I thought you had...

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:40.741
(BORUTO) <i>Old man...?</i>

00:15:42.543 --> 00:15:43.310
Are you okay...?

00:15:52.653 --> 00:15:54.988
Forgive me for before...

00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:56.123
Sure...

00:15:57.357 --> 00:15:59.593
[chuckle] But that Particle
Style of yours was incredible!

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.996
And I guess I should say
I'm sorry we doubted you...

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.399
Ah, don't worry about it.

00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:06.433
By the way...

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.601
Hmmm?

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:11.071
Earlier... I could have
sworn you said "Kozuchi..."

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:16.743
Ah... Yes, Kozuchi is- Well, he
was my grandchild...

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:21.748
He was... a very smart boy...

00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:27.120
He died?

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:32.759
He was just about the same age
as you youngsters...

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:38.599
Well, it doesn't matter; it's
all in the past.

00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:44.304
Even if the Five Great Nations
have a strong union... you can't
protect everyone.

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:48.308
That is simply reality.

00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:54.348
<i>Now, then!</i>

00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:55.148
Huh?

00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:58.485
You've all been very good to
me...

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:02.256
So I suppose that I should give
you the answer to your
question...

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.392
What's he doing now?

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:06.159
Who knows?

00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:12.165
(OHNOKI) <i>Choose. Which of these</i>
<i>is the hardest rock in the</i>
<i>world?</i>

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:15.068
Seriously? It's one of these
rocks?!

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.504
Well? Do you know what the
answer is?

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:19.373
Hmmm...

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:22.576
None of them seems to be
particularly special...

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:24.311
Hmmm...

00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:27.581
This one...

00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:28.649
I'll pick this one.

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:30.317
Well, Mitsuki?

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:38.192
No, thank you. I'm good.

00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:42.229
The two of you... are you sure
about your choices?

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:43.297
Mhm!

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.098
Uh... yeah?

00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:49.436
The both of you are... [chuckle]
completely incorrect!

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:50.037
[embarrassed chuckle]

00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:53.874
Ah! I knew it! I figured it
was the other one all along!

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:57.477
And that rock... is incorrect as
well.

00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:58.312
Huh?!

00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:02.115
The hardest rock in the world
is...

00:18:05.152 --> 00:18:08.255
...the bedrock that you have
inside you...

00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:09.122
Huh?

00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:15.596
Whatever adversity you face, no
matter what, your bedrock never
shatters.

00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:21.001
So... the answer is, your will,
your bedrock. The hardest rock
in the world.

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:24.905
Oh! So that's it. Now I get it.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:31.245
All three of you... no matter
what hardship or sorrow you
encounter from here on out...

00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:34.648
...you must never discard your
bedrock, your will.

00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:36.650
[chuckle] Right!

00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:39.419
So that's what the world's
hardest "rock" is, huh...?

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:42.823
Yeah! Of course! I mean, I knew
that all along! So...

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:45.459
Yeah, right. Stop lying!

00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:48.595
I really did know! But you
didn't even have a single clue
about it at all!

00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:49.496
Just say that again!

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.031
Hmph! Whatever!

00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:55.068
Hey! Boruto! Hold up! Where do
you think you're going?!

00:18:55.102 --> 00:19:00.374
Seems to me your bedrock, your
will, might be a little shaky.

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:04.311
This thing called "will" is...
complicated.

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:08.982
It's something that you aren't
able to acquire without
sacrifice.

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:12.586
You need to have faith in order
to get it.

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:15.122
Getting my own will...

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:20.761
But then how can I really be
certain that the will I obtain
is genuinely my own?

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:25.132
That is a very difficult
question to answer...

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:27.334
So just...

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.335
Just what?

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:36.877
<i>If you find that you keep on</i>
hitting a wall... but you also
<i>keep on clinging to it...</i>

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:41.315
Then perhaps that's a sign...
that it's indeed your true will.

00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:44.985
[grunt]

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.488
I gotta play this like I figured
out the answer by myself...

00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:51.191
so don't say anything to my
dad... okay?

00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:55.596
Say anything? Why, I posed that
same question to Naruto myself.

00:19:55.629 --> 00:19:57.764
[chuckle] No kidding, really?

00:19:57.798 --> 00:20:02.002
Man, my Dad! He was acting like
he came up with the question
himself.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:06.240
I had a whole lot of fun
sightseeing, thanks to the three
of you.

00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:11.979
If you ever find yourselves in
the Land of Earth, I hope
you'll come and pay me a visit.

00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:17.351
Of course, it goes without
saying that I mean only if I'm
still alive at the time.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.452
[chuckle] Okay...

00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:21.889
Well! We'd better escort you to
the Hokage's Office...

00:20:21.922 --> 00:20:26.159
Before that... I want to eat
another stick of those
dumplings.

00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:28.128
After all, I am...

00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.998
...an old man whose days are
numbered, is that it?

00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:35.302
[chuckling]

00:20:38.805 --> 00:20:43.277
I guess that what my dad asked
me was only a silly trick
question.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.181
We wasted our time thinking so
hard about it. Am I right,
Mitsuki?

00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:49.349
You think?

00:20:49.383 --> 00:20:49.616
Huh?

00:20:51.852 --> 00:20:54.521
I thought it was quite a good
answer.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.133
[gasp]

00:21:12.005 --> 00:21:14.508
[gasp] Hm?

00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:18.745
[exhale]

00:21:55.816 --> 00:21:59.820
The Five Kage Summit's over now.
You think that we'll ever be
relieved?

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:01.255
I sure hope so!

00:22:01.288 --> 00:22:02.422
[gasps]

00:22:02.456 --> 00:22:03.123
[grunts]

00:22:04.358 --> 00:22:05.125
[gasp]

00:23:45.025 --> 00:23:48.929
(SARADA) <i>So this is where</i>
Mitsuki lives, huh? Did you know
<i>Boruto?</i>

00:23:48.962 --> 00:23:50.964
(BORUTO) <i>I heard he lived</i>
<i>alone, but...</i>

00:23:50.998 --> 00:23:56.036
(SARADA) <i>We never heard him</i>
talk very much about his parents
<i>or about what his life was...</i>

00:23:56.069 --> 00:23:58.205
like in his home village, did
<i>we?</i>

00:23:58.238 --> 00:24:01.308
(BORUTO) Yeah... Even though we
were together all the time...

00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:06.346
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: Mitsuki's Will"</i>

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.117
(SARADA) <i>We really didn't know</i>
all that much about Mitsuki, did
<i>we?</i>
