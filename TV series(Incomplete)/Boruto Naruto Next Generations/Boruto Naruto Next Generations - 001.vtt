00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.679
<i>(BORUTO) The age of shinobi</i>
<i>is over.</i>

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:26.059
I can't believe
you went this far, Kawaki.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.094
I'm going to send you
to the same place

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:31.164
I sent the Seventh Hokage,
Boruto.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.900
Guess this was
the only possible outcome...

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.101
That's right.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:39.305
The age of shinobi is over!

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:45.746
Even so...

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:56.923
I'm still...

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.358
...a shinobi!

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.432
<i>This story begins</i>
<i>several years earlier...</i>

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.718
[surprised murmuring]

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.752
Hey!

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:08.822
[grunts]

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.266
Wait up, Boruto!

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.135
Is it really that bad?!

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.638
Yeah, it's bad.
It's really bad.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.543
What kept you so long,
Lord Hokage?

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.178
You don't have much time left
at this point.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.146
It's tomorrow, huh...?

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.515
Please hurry...

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.317
...or won't be done
by the entrance ceremony.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.488
Guess I'm gonna be here
all night again.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.561
[relieved sigh]

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.830
I barely made it!

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:52.766
The limited edition
green chili burger!

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.435
It's the last day
they're serving it!

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.604
Why do I keep hanging out
with you?

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.507
‐ You don't want yours?
‐ I didn't say that.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.780
[biting and chewing]
Mmm!

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.281
[shocked]
Spicy!

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.616
What is in this?!

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.483
So good right?

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:12.252
I don't believe this.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.054
You know, you're impossible...

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.421
[sipping and gasping]

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.190
I gotta say,

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:18.992
this train is
really convenient.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.596
I hardly have to walk at all,
now that we've got this.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.831
Yeah, the Hidden Leaf Village
is getting

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:26.499
more and more modern.

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:27.501
Hmmm.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.002
But of course,
starting tomorrow,

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.203
we still have to attend

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.305
that old‐fashioned
Ninja Academy.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.208
What?! That's tomorrow?!

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.910
There's a lot of stuff
to get ready.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.211
Didn't you do any of it?

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.445
Uh...

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.681
(SHIKADAI)
I mean, didn't your dad

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:41.882
tell you about it?

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:43.149
[annoyed groan]

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:44.250
Maybe...

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.352
[sigh]
Boruto... listen.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.588
Don't go doing anything

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.190
that's gonna
embarrass your dad, okay?

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.025
'Cause it'll make me
look bad, too.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:52.993
Seriously?!

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.494
You may not know this...

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:57.998
but your mom always tells me
to watch out for you.

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:58.732
[mouth being stuffed]

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.634
She does?

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.037
See... It's like this train.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.238
Hmmm?

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:06.472
If it stays on the tracks,

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:09.209
it gets to
its destination easily.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.111
So just sit tight
till you get there.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.613
What're you talking about?

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:15.716
I'm only telling you
that you should behave.

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:16.717
See ya.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.119
Don't be late
on the first day!

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.554
Ah, Shut up!

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:30.931
Hmph!

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:35.368
This has nothing to do
with Dad at all.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.402
You'll see!

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.838
I'll show you one day!

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.040
(CONDUCTOR)
Where are your parents?

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:41.274
That's dangerous!

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:44.277
Oh! Sorry, man!
My bad! 'Kay, bye!

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.013
Whoah! Phew. Huh?

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.784
[sipping]

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:51.852
[grunt]

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:54.888
(BULLY A)
Denki, this is all you've got?

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.256
Isn't that enough?

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.091
Well, yeah kinda,
but maybe not... Right guys?

00:05:58.124 --> 00:05:59.492
Right, guys?

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.328
Yeah! You see, we wanna
have some fun, too.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.163
(DENKI)
Huh...?

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.131
Yeah! Huh... Ahhh!

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.299
[gasp] Huh?

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:07.033
What the‐‐?!

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.071
Sorry. I guess my hand
must've slipped.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.272
What did you say?

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.240
You crazy?!
You wanna get hurt?!

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.176
Tell you what,
give him back his wallet,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.811
and I'll let this slide.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.980
‐ Huh?
‐ Come down and say that!

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:20.714
Hmph!

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:25.586
A ninja?!

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:26.352
Uh oh!
[pained grunt]

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.453
Omph!

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.055
What the‐‐!
Are you kidding?!

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.725
Who gives a crap
about ninjas?!

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.695
[grunting and tripping]

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:38.665
‐ Here.
‐ [startled]

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:39.666
Y‐You...

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.201
Look, kid,
don't be so uncool...

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.669
Huh?!

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:45.939
Hey, aren't you guys done
messing with that kid yet?

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:46.372
[gasp]

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:46.907
Hmmm?

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:48.875
What do you
think you're doing?!

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:49.976
Come on,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.712
‐ we'd better get out of here.
‐ Okay!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.951
[grunt]

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.397
[heavy breathing and
relieved sigh]

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.299
Hey, you doing
okay over there?!

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:15.736
No, I'm not okay!

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:17.470
Now more of them

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:19.105
will just come
after me tomorrow!

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:19.205
Hm?

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.943
That money was just
spare change for me...

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:24.845
Whoa, hold on,
are you kidding me...?

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:25.512
[sigh]

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:26.713
Doesn't it piss you off?

00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:28.982
You gotta teach 'em a lesson!

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.250
I can't.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.285
I'm not strong like you...

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.319
Huh?!

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:35.121
I saw what you did back there.

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:36.790
You know ninjutsu, right?

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.158
Do you go to
the Ninja Academy?

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.726
Oh, uh, no...

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.394
Well, I start tomorrow.

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:42.963
What? Tomorrow?

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.364
That's when I start, too.

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.332
Oh? Really? Cool!

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.534
Nice to meet ya!

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.673
(DENKI)
It's what my father wants.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.107
To inherit his company,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.977
he said I gotta learn
academics and ninjutsu.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.244
Oh man, that sucks!

00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:59.780
So what's the name of
your business?

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:00.446
[sipping]

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.748
The Kaminarimon Company.

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:03.016
[spitting]

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:06.019
That's the biggest company
in the whole village!

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.487
Can I put in a pre‐order

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.422
for when the next release
comes out?

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:10.724
Sure...

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:13.459
Still, I don't get it...

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.929
Why's he so hung up on
you learning ninjutsu?

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:18.932
(DENKI) My father was shinobi
in the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.734
He believes
his achievements in battle

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:22.669
led to his success
in business.

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:25.238
So, he has great faith
in ninja.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.541
But do you want
to become a ninja?

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.309
Not really...

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.378
Then don't pay
any attention to him!

00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:33.580
I couldn't do that.

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:35.048
I've never disobeyed him...

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.249
Ah, give me a break!

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.183
At least you get to
see him at home!

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:38.451
Huh?

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:40.721
My stupid old man
only thinks about work

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:42.322
and ignores his own family.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.990
Oh. Really?

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:48.328
So whenever I disobey my dad,
he isn't around to punish me!

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.563
Hmmm...

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:55.736
Look, seriously,
who cares what your dad says?

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:58.104
Just do whatever you want
and teach him a lesson!

00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.506
Teach him a lesson...?

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.241
Yeah! That's what I always do!

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.509
You see, I have a secret plan.

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:04.010
I'm right in the middle of it,

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.446
but keeping it hidden
from my mom is really hard.

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:07.714
And‐‐ [gasp]

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:09.349
‐ What time is it?
‐ [gasp]

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.617
It's about seven o'clock...

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:12.085
Ahhh! My mom's gonna kill me!

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.587
Huh?

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.022
I thought you didn't
get punished for disobeying...

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.423
Mom's a different story.

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:20.026
She's really scary
when she's mad!

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.594
'Kay, bye!

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:24.397
Denki, never let anyone
pick on you!

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.366
Teach 'em a lesson!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.100
Okay!

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:27.868
[chuckle]

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:32.906
Whoa...

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:35.742
Huh?

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:48.855
[gasp and chuckle]

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.261
Teach 'em a lesson...

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:56.296
[chuckle]

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.767
I'm home!

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:05.572
Boruto, you said you'd be home
for the celebration dinner.

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.473
Oh. Sorry, Mom.

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:09.676
Shikadai wouldn't let me go...

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.978
Well, Shikadai has a good
head on his shoulders,

00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:14.515
but you on the other hand,
tend to get into trouble.

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:16.850
‐ Trouble!
‐ [giggles]

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:18.752
So what're we having
for dinner tonight?

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.687
Guess what!
I helped make it!

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:22.122
(BORUTO) Oh, yeah?
I can't wait!

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.324
Boruto, wash your hands!

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.325
(BORUTO)
Okay!

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.331
(BORUTO and HIMAWARI)
Woah!

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.833
[chuckle]
I can't believe

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.868
you're already starting
at the Academy tomorrow...

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.369
‐ [excited sigh]
‐ I met your father

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.004
when we were at the Academy.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:40.507
I've heard that
a hundred times, ya know.

00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:41.908
He was always
causing mischief,

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:44.678
so people treated him
like a problem child.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.647
But he was actually very cool.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.114
(BORUTO) I've heard that
a hundred times, too!

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:48.949
[chuckle]

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.150
(HINATA)
I thought for sure

00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:51.885
your father would
be home tonight...

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:53.587
(BORUTO)
Yeah, what's new...?

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.455
He just keeps ignoring
you and Himawari!

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.456
[moaning]

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.558
(HINATA)
Don't complain.

00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:59.025
This village stays safe

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.863
because your father and
many others protect it.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:04.665
Let's just enjoy our meal.

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:06.833
There's not even an enemy

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.469
for them to protect us from
anymore.

00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:10.804
Look, Boruto...

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.740
fighting isn't
the only duty a ninja has.

00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:15.776
The Hokage has a lot to do

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:19.012
to make sure people can
live safely in peace.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.747
(HINATA) You're going to
learn that starting tomorrow

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:22.683
at the Academy, too.

00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:24.851
It's something
that's very important.

00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:29.289
Hmph!

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:30.891
So uncool...

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:44.004
[pained grunt]

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.340
Denki, you're the heir to
the Kaminarimon Company!

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.309
General Studies aren't enough!

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:50.176
But, Father...

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:51.812
I just‐‐

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.514
‐ (DENKI'S FATHER) Pitiful...
‐ [gasp]

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:54.715
(DENKI'S FATHER)
I know you had a run in

00:11:54.748 --> 00:11:56.650
with some bullies
again today.

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:59.052
How can you ever an end
to this type of behavior

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:01.454
unless you get trained
at the Academy?!

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:02.723
<i>I...</i>

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:04.324
<i>Who cares what</i>
<i>your dad says?</i>

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:08.461
<i>Just do whatever you want</i>
<i>and teach him a lesson!</i>

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.097
So I just have to get strong.

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:13.433
Is that what you
want me to do?

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.434
That's right.

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:17.604
If I prove it to you,

00:12:17.638 --> 00:12:19.540
then you'll let me study
whatever I want to?

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.174
If you prove it.

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:24.077
[sigh]

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.517
I need strength.

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:33.787
I don't have
any kind of power.

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:45.331
Then I'll just have to prove
that I have it, right...?

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:47.100
Prove my strength.

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:53.406
No, no, no, no, no!

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.274
Move, dude!

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:55.742
This is bad!

00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:56.843
<i>You're gonna be late!</i>

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:58.044
<i>(BORUTO)</i>
<i>Yeah, I know!</i>

00:12:58.078 --> 00:12:59.580
<i>Will you be able to</i>
<i>make it?</i>

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.615
<i>(BORUTO) No worries!</i>
<i>I got this!</i>

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:03.850
Ahhh!

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.652
I'm just kidding!

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:08.021
[grunts]

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:08.622
[chuckle]

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:09.823
Sleeping in,

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:11.725
then taking the train
to school!

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:15.829
Ninja Academy,
this is going to be so easy.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:20.033
And look at that!
Here comes my ride!

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.238
Oh look, it's Denki.

00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:32.112
Hmmm?

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:38.519
Hold on... What's that?

00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:43.924
[groan]

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:45.859
Wait, where'd he go?

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:50.130
<i>Ahh! He's taking</i>
<i>the train too!</i>

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.033
I think he and I
are gonna get along!

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:55.468
What did you wanna
talk about, Denki?

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.237
What? You want revenge?

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.573
You called us out,
so let's do this!

00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:01.608
What's the deal, huh?

00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:02.843
Hey...

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:06.446
Oh! Lucky!

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:07.447
‐ Look!
‐ Hmmm?

00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:11.918
There's some here, too.

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:14.788
This looks sketchy.

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:16.056
So what if it does?

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:17.724
Let's just grab what we can.

00:14:17.758 --> 00:14:19.392
I mean, what could it hurt?!

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.361
Yeah! That's right!

00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:22.629
What?! Omph!

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.039
<i>(DENKI) You guys are</i>
<i>so simpleminded.</i>

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:35.041
It's Denki!
Why that‐‐!

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.443
What're you thinking?!

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:38.645
Just knock it off!

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:40.280
What's going on?!

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:42.883
This is one of
our company's prototypes.

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:45.519
But there were a lot
of problems with it...

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:46.587
[gasps]

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.954
(DENKI)
It's defective.

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:49.823
Just like you guys.

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:51.191
What're you saying, huh?

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:53.860
We were just having
a little fun with you!

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.328
A little fun...?!

00:14:57.764 --> 00:14:59.199
You see that?

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.536
I put another defective car
on the same track.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.970
But it's empty.

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:05.271
You get it now?

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.843
Just a little collision
of defective goods...

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:10.577
Nothing important...

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:11.745
[gasps]

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:13.714
Y‐You've gotta be
kidding, right?

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.115
(BORUTO)
Hey, knock it off!

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:20.253
What are you doing here?

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:21.955
I just happened to see you.

00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:24.591
Aren't you going to
the entrance ceremony?

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.593
Who cares about all that?

00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:28.729
I need to show father
my power.

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.230
And prove that I'm strong.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.965
I think you've made
your point!

00:15:31.998 --> 00:15:33.534
No, not yet.

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:34.868
I must prove

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:37.604
that I'm strong
beyond any doubt.

00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:38.572
[pained grunt]

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.073
<i>It's happening again.</i>

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:43.176
Denki, just stop this!

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:45.579
You're going to have
to make me stop.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.749
Oh, the first railroad switch
is about to pass by.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.884
‐ It's all yours.
‐ Wha‐‐?!

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:51.652
[grunt]

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.689
Ughhh!

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:56.557
Too bad.

00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:00.994
What on earth
happened to you, Denki?

00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:04.364
My father's word is absolute.

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:05.098
What's that?!

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.035
I have to have his approval.

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:10.436
Or else I...

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.772
Forget about that!

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:12.773
You don't need approval!

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.307
Can't you do anything

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.943
without worrying about
what other people will think?

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:18.845
Make your own decisions!

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:20.046
[gasp]

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.449
[pained groan]

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.384
Hey, what's the matter?!

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:25.418
(BULLY A)
Hey!

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:26.853
‐ [whimpering]
‐ What're you doing?

00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:28.655
‐ Look ahead!
‐ It's coming, man!

00:16:28.689 --> 00:16:30.023
The other train!

00:16:34.528 --> 00:16:36.563
[gasp and grunt]

00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:39.600
Why...?

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:42.202
Why did I do this?!

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:45.071
[chuckle]
I'll take care of it!

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:51.211
[deep inhale and exhale]

00:16:51.244 --> 00:16:52.746
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:57.584 --> 00:16:58.785
Let's do this!

00:16:58.819 --> 00:16:59.520
‐ Right!
‐ Right!

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.023
Huh?

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.390
[gasp]

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:16.770
Denki!

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.017
[confident grunt]

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:31.952
Boruto!

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:34.821
[determined yell]

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.761
[straining]

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:45.866
[straining]

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:48.001
Wow! Nice one, Denki!

00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:49.035
Yeah, except I can't hold on!

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.036
Huh?!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.271
(DENKI)
[straining]

00:17:51.304 --> 00:17:53.173
(BORUTO)
Hang on just a little longer!

00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:54.775
You can do it, Denki!

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:56.610
[straining]

00:17:56.643 --> 00:17:58.111
‐ Ahhh!
‐ Ahhh!

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:01.481
[whimper and gasp]

00:18:05.018 --> 00:18:06.553
[relieved sigh]

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.989
We're okay now, guys...

00:18:09.022 --> 00:18:11.024
What?! Speak for yourself!

00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:13.159
It was kinda fun, though.

00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:14.895
‐ Uh... No, it wasn't! Hm?
‐ No, it wasn't! Hm?

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.130
(BORUTO) Relax,
I was just kidding!

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:18.164
(BULLY B)
It's not funny!

00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:19.499
[chuckling]

00:18:21.835 --> 00:18:22.536
[gasp]

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:27.073
[gasps]

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:28.074
What do we do now?!

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.375
It's falling apart!

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:32.378
Let's jump to the other one.

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:33.146
Huh?!

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.481
Let's go!

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:36.449
You're right.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.383
Come on! Go!

00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:38.752
(BULLY A)
Yeah! Go! Go!

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:39.553
(BORUTO)
Hurry!

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:42.956
[grunts]

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:44.157
C'mon!

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.794
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:51.798
Sorry, but we've got
somewhere we need to go!

00:18:51.832 --> 00:18:53.333
Yeah, Denki's right.

00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:54.535
But we're never
gonna get there

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.570
if we just stay on
these tracks!

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.043
Cho‐Cho Akimichi.

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:04.077
Here.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.612
Wasabi Izumo.

00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:06.346
(WASABI)
Here!

00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:08.882
Boruto Uzumaki.

00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:12.619
Boruto Uzumaki!
Are you here?

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:14.220
Did he say Uzumaki...?

00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:15.822
Wait, that Uzumaki?!

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:17.023
‐ What's the matter?
‐ [yawn]

00:19:17.057 --> 00:19:18.491
<i>Dammit, Boruto...</i>

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:20.827
<i>‐ Even I made it on time.</i>
<i>‐ Where is he?</i>

00:19:20.861 --> 00:19:22.428
That's so like him.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.267
‐ Hey. You listening, Sarada?
‐ Hm?

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.335
You just stay put, alright?

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:31.972
You have a nice, warm,
welcoming speech to give.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.206
And it's just about time.

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:33.940
[annoyed grunt]

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:35.942
Huh?

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:42.415
[gasps]

00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:56.362
[relieved sigh]
We made it.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.139
Boruto Uzumaki...

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:08.441
has arrived on the scene,
ya know!

00:20:11.612 --> 00:20:12.946
B‐Boruto...

00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:15.916
[gasps]

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.451
Damn it...

00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:20.754
One hell of a way
to embarrass your dad...

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:25.358
(SHIKAMARU) Alright,
don't just stand there.

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:26.793
Clear these students out!

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.195
[gasp]

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.065
[grunts]

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:33.299
Time out!

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:35.536
I'm sorry,
Big Brother Konohamaru.

00:20:35.569 --> 00:20:38.171
Funny, but you don't even
look a little bit sorry...

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:41.041
And starting today,
you'll call me Sensei!

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:43.343
Huh? Well that
just sounds weird...

00:20:43.376 --> 00:20:44.611
(KONOHAMARU)
What do you mean, weird?!

00:20:44.645 --> 00:20:47.981
(BORUTO) Oh! Hey!
Denki, you doing okay?

00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:48.849
We made
the entrance ceremony!

00:20:48.882 --> 00:20:50.416
What?!

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.986
You got another kid involved
in this madness of yours?!

00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:54.621
(BORUTO)
So what? We're fine!

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:56.322
(KONOHAMARU)
What's "fine" about all this?

00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:57.724
(BORUTO)
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:57.758 --> 00:20:58.458
You are so‐‐!

00:20:58.491 --> 00:21:00.794
<i>Boruto Uzumaki, huh...?</i>

00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:02.763
(BORUTO) Also, I'm never
gonna call you Sensei!

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:04.097
(KONOHAMARU)
What's with your attitude?!

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.498
Look, Boruto,
why don't you try

00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:08.334
‐ listening sometime!
‐ (BORUTO) Ow, ow, ow!

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:18.011
They drove off the tracks with

00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:21.782
that Thunder Rail prototype
and hit a Great Stone Face.

00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:24.985
I mean, no one was hurt,
so everything's okay, but...

00:21:25.018 --> 00:21:26.052
[chuckle]

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:28.254
Sorry...

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.356
[chuckle]
Well, this is from

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.526
the president of
the Kaminarimon Company.

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:33.994
‐ Hm?
‐ (SHIKAMARU) He wants to pay

00:21:34.027 --> 00:21:35.862
for all the repairs and
damages to the village.

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:37.230
Hm?

00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:39.365
(SHIKAMARU) Seems Boruto
stuck up for his son.

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:40.667
They're classmates.

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:42.569
So despite everything
that happened,

00:21:42.603 --> 00:21:44.705
he's quite grateful to Boruto.

00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:47.574
He says that his son has
changed because of him.

00:21:47.608 --> 00:21:48.609
Hmmm...

00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:52.012
I see...

00:22:05.526 --> 00:22:08.128
[sigh] Man, I wonder
what's gonna happen

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:10.631
to my easy life at
the Academy now...

00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:11.364
Hm?

00:22:11.397 --> 00:22:13.433
Hey, long time no see!

00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:15.335
Oh, good morning, Boruto!

00:22:15.368 --> 00:22:18.471
[chuckle] Well,
my suspension's finally done!

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:20.406
It really should've been me
who was punished

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.242
for everything that happened.

00:22:22.275 --> 00:22:24.210
So why'd you take
the blame for me?

00:22:24.244 --> 00:22:26.346
Hm? Oh, that?

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:28.615
Eh, it's no big deal.

00:22:28.649 --> 00:22:28.715
Huh?

00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:30.751
Hey, come on!

00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:33.419
We arrived at the entrance
ceremony with a bang!

00:22:33.453 --> 00:22:34.755
So, thanks!

00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:35.789
No...

00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:38.491
Thank you, Boruto.
For everything.

00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:43.163
Huh? What's wrong?

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:45.465
Nah, it's nothing at all.

00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:48.869
<i>But I wonder what</i>
<i>that glow was...</i>

00:22:48.902 --> 00:22:50.637
Oh! Good morning!

00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:51.404
Mornin'...

00:22:52.472 --> 00:22:54.407
(CHO‐CHO) Huh, is that
the new kid?

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.443
Dunno... Mr. Kaminarimon
should be careful.

00:22:57.477 --> 00:22:58.845
Stupidity's contagious.

00:22:58.879 --> 00:22:59.445
Hm?

00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:00.446
Wait, so you...

00:23:01.047 --> 00:23:02.282
That's right.

00:23:02.315 --> 00:23:04.284
‐ I'm in the ninjutsu course.
‐ [grunt]

00:23:04.317 --> 00:23:05.952
You're taking it for your dad?

00:23:05.986 --> 00:23:07.153
Oh, no.

00:23:07.187 --> 00:23:09.856
I think ninjutsu is
awesome now.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.325
I'm so excited to
learn new jutsu...

00:23:12.358 --> 00:23:14.327
and then try to combine
them with science.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.762
Wow, really?

00:23:15.796 --> 00:23:19.966
If that's what you want,
then I think that's great!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.834
(CHO‐CHO)
Denki!

00:23:20.867 --> 00:23:21.902
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:23:21.935 --> 00:23:24.337
Hey, can I take a look at
your homework?

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.772
Yeah, sure!

00:23:25.806 --> 00:23:26.072
[chuckle]

00:23:26.907 --> 00:23:27.908
But what do you do

00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:29.543
instead of homework
after school?

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:30.811
(CHO‐CHO)
Did you just...

00:23:30.844 --> 00:23:34.480
Is that really something
you'd ask a lady?

00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:36.349
<i>(BORUTO)</i>
<i>Whatever path I choose,</i>

00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:39.452
<i>it won't have anything</i>
<i>to do with my dad.</i>

00:23:39.485 --> 00:23:41.087
<i>I'll walk my own path.</i>

00:23:43.323 --> 00:23:45.091
<i>'Cuz this...</i>

00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:46.593
<i>is my story!</i>

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:50.631
(BORUTO) From this day on...

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:53.166
I'm going to be
the star here!

00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:56.803
(INOJIN) Hmph... Riding on
the Hokage's coattails...

00:23:56.837 --> 00:23:58.539
(INOJIN)
Oops, did I accidentally

00:23:58.572 --> 00:24:00.206
say that out loud just now?

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.609
(CHO‐CHO) I know you've been
like this for a long time,

00:24:02.643 --> 00:24:05.111
but why do you always
shoot your mouth off?

00:24:05.145 --> 00:24:06.246
(INOJIN) Oh, sorry.

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:07.380
If I offended,
I take it back...

00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:08.882
although...

00:24:08.915 --> 00:24:12.318
(BORUTO) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:12.352 --> 00:24:13.887
The Hokage's Son!!

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.723
(INOJIN) I just don't think
you're worthy of my trust.
