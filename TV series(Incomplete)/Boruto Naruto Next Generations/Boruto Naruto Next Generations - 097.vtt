WEBVTT

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.079
(intense music)

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.453
Partial expansion! Jutsu!

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.322
(explosion)

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.290
(shouting)

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.526
Hey don't damage
the power plant.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.027
Yeah, I know that.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.564
No you don't!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.168
Dammit!

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.303
Cho-Cho, they're all yours.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.337
Okay.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.475
(intense music)

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.313
Shikadai, I've got this.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.516
(screaming)

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.851
Dammit!

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.085
Take this!

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.660
Shadow Paralysis
Jutsu, complete.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.397
(intense music)

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.901
(crash)

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.603
(screaming)

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:10.637
Dammit!

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:15.542
Thank you.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.284
Shikadai, that was
way too aggressive.

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:27.254
Thankfully I got there
in time, but just barely.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.622
Maybe you shouldn't
push yourself

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.958
to only use Shadow Paralysis.

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.492
Yeah, sorry.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.729
I'll go and make sure
there's no damage.

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.000
Seems like Shikadai
was kinda impatient.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.103
Yeah, he's been a
little bit off lately.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.771
[Shikadai] I've
got to get better

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.540
at using Shadow Paralysis Jutsu.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.513
(Japanese intro music)

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:12.232
(Japanese intro music)

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.983
(Japanese intro music)

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.969
(Japanese intro music)

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.053
(Japanese intro music)

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:21.034
(Japanese Intro music)

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.046
[Shikadai] I'm home.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.783
Uh, are you really
going out this late?

00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:39.586
Well, I was asked to attend
the Feudal Lord's banquet.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.155
Some VIPs from the Land
of Wind are here, so.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.091
Ugh, what a drag, huh?

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:45.659
It really can't be helped.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.529
I mean I have to go and
support Gaara, after all.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.963
Huh?

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.198
Who's here?

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.000
Its Lord Enchu.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.668
Ah, really?

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.003
That old man?

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:01.441
Temari's been invited
to the banquet,

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.442
so I don't understand

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:04.978
why you aren't going to
attend along with her?

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:06.280
Tonight's guests
of honor are the

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:09.249
Land of Wind's Feudal
Lord and politicians.

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:11.251
Temari's related
to Lord Kazekage,

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.620
so it's only natural
that she attend.

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:16.089
You are Lord Hokage's chief aid.

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:19.326
The fact is, you're
essential to this village.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.328
Listen, I'd be
totally out of place

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.330
at a fancy banquet
like that one.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.465
Oh, it seems you have forgotten.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.801
Back when you two
were to be married?

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:30.103
You must remember what happened.

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.272
All that gossip
from the Hidden Sand

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.074
that you were an
unworthy upstart

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.277
who stole they're princess
away from their village.

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:39.112
Those were just silly rumors.

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.247
Please don't bother
getting offended

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.249
over something like that.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.152
The start of a rumor
is insult enough!

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.956
It's proof they're looking
down on the Nara Clan.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:49.923
(scoffing)

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.458
If this is how it is,

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.160
I should have made
you a politician

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:54.995
back when I had the chance.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.630
I don't have any
interest in politics.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.766
The whole thing's way
too much of a drag.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.872
That attitude is why your
son's been adversely affected.

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:08.976
How long does Shikadai intend
to play it safe as a genin?

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.479
I heard he's far from
mastering Shadow Jutsu.

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.082
Listen, I'll have you know
that Shikadai's assessment

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.618
actually went up during
the last Chunin Exams.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.821
As for the Shadow Jutsu,
he's training diligently.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:21.822
In time,

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.323
Shadow Jutsu are synonymous

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:26.260
with taking responsibility
for the clan.

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:28.695
Don't you think it's an
embarrassment for him

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.531
to remain so unskilled?

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:33.934
Since the war, many
clansmen have retired.

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:36.303
From now on, it's up
to you and your son

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.806
to take the lead and
energize our Clan.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.276
Yes, I understand
that all too well.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.912
But that burden
is for me to bear.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.514
There's no need to
push it on to Shikadai.

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:48.649
Ha!

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:52.152
Make sure you don't forget
your true mission in life.

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:56.523
Shikadai.

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:58.525
So, you're back?

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:59.593
Yes, sir.

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:02.462
I have high hopes for
you and your future.

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:05.199
Don't end up becoming
like your father.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.837
Hey, Dad.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.438
I didn't know you were home.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.707
How come you didn't tell
him off more than that?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.777
That old man thinks he
can say anything he wants

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.978
just because he's an elder.

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:19.146
It's not right.

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:20.948
We owe Lord Enchu.

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.550
We've been indebted to
him since my dad's time.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.486
Look dad, I'm.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.088
Don't be so impatient.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:31.458
Just do things at your own
pace and it'll work out fine.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.727
(groaning)

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:40.067
(groaning)

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:42.970
Hey, what's the matter Shikadai?

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:46.473
Another mess up with his
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu.

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:47.441
Again?

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:49.810
That's four mess-ups
in a row now, isn't it?

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:50.811
Shut up.

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:52.179
Aww.

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.314
It's really not like you to
mess things up, Shikadai.

00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:56.149
And you've also
been oddly obsessed

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:58.285
with that one Jutsu lately.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:00.621
Hey, come on, I have not.

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:04.091
You used to leave that kind
of stuff to me and Cho-Cho.

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:05.993
Is the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:08.495
the only one that you can use?

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:09.830
No way! Of course not!

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.999
You used to be really
good at Wind Style

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:13.000
in the past, right?

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:14.334
Oh, yeah.

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:16.670
Your mom is Lord Kazekage's
older sister, isn't she?

00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:18.939
Oh, uh I can't use it anymore.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.474
What's that mean?

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:21.475
Look, it doesn't matter.

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:24.978
Right now, I have the
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu.

00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:27.915
A Secret Ninjutsu passed
down for generations.

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.416
I'm actually jealous

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.452
you can use a technique so
rich in tradition and history.

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:35.289
My family doesn't have
anything like that.

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:37.257
It's just a drag, that's all.

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.159
There's too much obligation.

00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:40.327
To tell you the truth,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.863
I'm jealous of
your family, Denki.

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.631
My family's no fun either.

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:47.467
The company became really
successful under my Dad,

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.970
so there's a lot of pressure
on me to keep it going.

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:52.639
Oh, I see.

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:53.807
So in other words,

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.310
it seems that the both of
us are in the same position,

00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:58.645
caught in the middle
of family affairs, huh?

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.685
Some inspectors from
the Land of Wind

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.787
are going to arrive here soon.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.722
Why are they coming here anyway?

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:11.992
To examine the Leaf's
electric power technology.

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:14.862
They're planning to build
an electric power plant

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:15.829
in the desert soon.

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:17.497
A power plant?

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:18.999
You mean like that
place we just guarded

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:20.467
on that recent mission?

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:21.502
Yes.

00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:22.369
In fact, that facility

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:24.605
is on the itinerary
for them to see.

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.907
Everything is going to be
pretty hectic around here

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.141
for a little while.

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:31.678
All right, so what's
our mission then?

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:32.679
Just stand by.

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:34.515
What? Stand by?

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:35.949
Like a break?

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.150
It's not really a break.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.285
If something happens,

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:40.420
we have to be ready
to jump into action.

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:42.256
It's just that since
our team's been

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.625
a little off our game lately.

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:45.826
Oh, I see.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.461
You reap what you sow, huh?

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.630
Hey, how come you're
all looking at me?

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:52.299
But come to think of it,
it's kind of strange.

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:55.402
Our team's the only one
that's been put on standby.

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:58.071
How much of everyone's
trust have we lost?

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:01.475
Well, we just have to
keep doing our best.

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:03.610
We'll win back their
trust eventually.

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:05.045
All right.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.984
Dammit!

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:12.186
[Enchu] Shikadai!

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.220
Huh?

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:16.156
Lord Enchu.

00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:23.163
So, you've been ordered
to stay on standby.

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:23.997
Huh?

00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.799
I put in a request.

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:29.670
I asked the Feudal Lord to
pull you from the vanguard

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:30.904
for the time being.

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:32.773
But why would you do that?

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:36.844
You want to take your father's
place and responsibility

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:39.246
of restoring the
clan's prestige.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.316
But things haven't been
going to well, have they?

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:46.820
You seem to be trying your
best, but at this rate,

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:50.090
it's only going to have
the opposite effect.

00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:54.328
In fact, you'll just make
your father lose face.

00:09:55.362 --> 00:10:00.567
And so, Shikadai, I want
you to go into politics.

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:05.439
Our Feudal Lord Ikkyu has
been looking for candidates

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:08.642
that he can develop into
skilled politicians.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:12.079
So, I've arranged for
you to go study with him.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.581
Study to be a politician?

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:17.251
Is that why we were
pulled from active duty?

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.853
Currently, Shikamaru
is carrying the weight

00:10:19.887 --> 00:10:22.990
of the the entire Nara
Clan all by himself.

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.224
I know that.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.498
I realize that you're
making an effort but still,

00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:35.536
it takes a long time to
master Shadow Paralysis Jutsu.

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.306
It's just like shogi.

00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:41.942
At times, you can't
break through

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.678
a predicament with
a frontal attack.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.980
You must use your pieces wisely.

00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:50.551
And sometimes, a new
strategy might be necessary.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.323
I'll make the arrangements.

00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:59.960
It'll be a good way to be
useful to your father, right?

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.662
It's just all so sudden.

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:02.863
For me, being a ninja.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.032
You can still be one.

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.267
Two years.

00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:10.737
For now, just go and
study for two years.

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:15.275
Being mentored by the
Feudal Lord is prestigious.

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:16.310
So then?

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.079
Just one thing.

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:21.081
If I agree to do this for you,

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:25.652
will you stop interfering
with my father going forward?

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:28.555
Very well, then.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.072
I think that I might
become a politician.

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:46.306
A politician?

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.079
But why now all of a sudden?

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:56.049
Don't tell mem did Lord Enchu?

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:59.753
Well, yeah, Lord Enchu was
the one who brought it up.

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:02.756
But still, I made
up my own mind.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.427
Hmm.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.498
What about being a ninja?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.302
I'll take two years
off for the time being.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.239
I'm thinking that it's
a good way to advance.

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:23.744
Are you sure this is
really what you want to do?

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:25.712
I am.

00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:32.986
I understand.

00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:35.923
Now, hold on a second.

00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:38.559
This is the path he's
chosen for himself.

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:41.628
He should do things
the way he wants to.

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:42.729
Dad, you?

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:43.931
On one condition.

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:45.799
Do this for yourself.

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:47.768
Talk it out with
your friends first.

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:48.702
Yeah, okay.

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:53.740
(upbeat rock music)

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:11.592
(upbeat rock music)

00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:20.601
[Denki] Shikadai?

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:21.602
Huh?

00:13:28.876 --> 00:13:30.611
I'm sorry to bug you.

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.045
No, it's all right.

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.213
What about you?

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.616
Were you okay
coming out this far?

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:36.917
Oh, sure.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.385
This is the place, right?

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:41.355
The power plant that you
and your team protected?

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:43.724
Well, I don't know if
I'd call it protecting.

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:48.562
Come on, what are
you talking about?

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:49.530
Thanks to you guys,

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:52.332
we managed to avoid even
more serious damage.

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.841
The energy generated by the
wind mills is stored here

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.576
and then sent to the village.

00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:05.212
What's that?

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.447
We linked that windmill
to the underground turbine

00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:09.883
for monitoring purposes.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:11.919
If that windmill is turning,

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:14.621
it means the system
is working normally.

00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:16.790
So then, right now?

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.025
Yeah.

00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:23.263
I was involved in
designing this system.

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.933
So making sure that it's
running the way its supposed to

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:27.868
is part of my job too.

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.436
Wow.

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:30.771
You're amazing Denki.

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:32.339
Oh, no, not at all.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.475
I think that you guys are
way more amazing than I am.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.012
I mean, Shikadai, I
could never do something

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:41.615
like your Shadow
Paralysis Jutsu.

00:14:41.648 --> 00:14:43.684
Denki.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.920
I'm gonna quit being a
ninja and be a politician.

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.055
What?

00:14:48.088 --> 00:14:49.890
Where'd that come
from all of a sudden?

00:14:49.923 --> 00:14:52.926
I guess, it's a
family situation.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.561
You understand that, right?

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:57.798
In my position, I just
have no other choice.

00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:59.032
But Shikadai.

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:01.702
Huh?

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:02.736
What's that?

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:06.807
Not good.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.043
There's a reverse flow of
energy in the storage battery.

00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:12.145
If we don't stop
it, it'll explode!

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:17.484
(electricity buzzing)

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:20.921
Oh, no, it's not working.

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.723
It won't accept my input.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.192
Is there any other
way to stop it?

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:27.594
If we can directly
access the main system.

00:15:28.662 --> 00:15:30.364
You sure about that?

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:33.600
This whole thing could
explode at any second but,

00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:35.736
you just stay back, Shikadai.

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:38.639
Right now, I've
got to do this.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.878
(electricity buzzing)

00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:46.313
Don't be reckless, Denki.

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:49.082
Even if your doing it for the
sake of your dad's company.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:50.751
For the sake of my dad?

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:51.885
What are you talking about?

00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:53.554
I'm here because I wanna be.

00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:55.088
It's of my own free will.

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:58.091
This is an important place,

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.527
and it's connected to the
future of the village.

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:02.930
Right now, the only one who
can really protect

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:04.264
this place is me.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.001
Denki!

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.703
I'm okay.

00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:12.072
Shikadai, earlier you asked

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:15.209
if I understand the position
that you've been put in.

00:16:15.242 --> 00:16:17.177
It's true, at first I was caught

00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:19.146
in the middle of
my family's issues.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:22.916
But even situations like that

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.853
can be changed to
the way you want.

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:27.554
After becoming a ninja,

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:30.791
I learned that from Boruto
and all the rest of you guys.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.727
Situations can be changed.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.362
[Denki] I won't
hold myself back.

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:38.532
I'll do whatever I can to
the very best of my ability.

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.901
One day, I'll be
the ninja president

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:42.069
of the Kaminarimon Company.

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:48.308
All right, that should do it.

00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:51.445
Huh?

00:16:51.912 --> 00:16:53.881
It didn't work.

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:55.582
The wiring must
be cut somewhere.

00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:58.318
The turbine that generates
energy isn't working.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.088
At this rate, it'll. -

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.094
You said the turbine and that
windmill are linked, right?

00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:09.196
That's right, but.

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.265
In other words, if
we make it spin,

00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:13.233
the turbine will run, right?

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:15.569
Logically speaking, yes.

00:17:15.602 --> 00:17:16.770
If we restart the system

00:17:16.803 --> 00:17:18.405
at the same time the
turbine's moving,

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:21.542
we can avoid an explosion
caused by the reverse flow.

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:23.911
But unfortunately,
there's no way for us

00:17:23.944 --> 00:17:26.213
to make that giant
windmill move.

00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:28.182
Don't worry, just
leave that to me.

00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:30.083
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?

00:17:30.117 --> 00:17:32.886
I don't think it's strong
enough to turn the windmill.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.720
No.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:37.157
What I'm going to
use is this one!

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:39.760
What are you doing?

00:17:39.793 --> 00:17:40.894
Go Denki!

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:42.563
You just focus on
restarting the system.

00:17:42.596 --> 00:17:46.733
Yeah, but, using Wind
Style to turn the windmill?

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:48.735
I swear, I'm gonna make it work.

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.039
I'm on it.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.040
Here we go.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.608
Wind Style!

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:57.845
Air Current Dance!

00:17:57.878 --> 00:18:00.581
(wind noises)

00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.651
(grunting)

00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:09.590
(grunting)

00:18:14.962 --> 00:18:16.163
Amazing.

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:20.300
Yes!

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:26.073
(upbeat rock music)

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:36.984
We did it!

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:41.722
Yeah, looks like we
got it to work somehow.

00:18:41.755 --> 00:18:43.457
Nice one, Shikadai.

00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:48.428
(screaming)

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:50.464
(crash)

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.135
What?

00:18:57.371 --> 00:19:00.307
Shadow Paralysis
Jutsu, now complete.

00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:06.880
I guess I worried too much

00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:09.416
about doing things
for my parents' sake.

00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:13.253
A little while earlier
when you told me

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:16.790
that you're gonna become
a ninja president one day,

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.192
I got really ashamed of myself

00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:20.994
cause I still haven't done
everything that I can do.

00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:25.199
I'm not gonna
become a politician.

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:28.735
Also, I won't hold
myself back anymore.

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:29.736
Shikadai.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.205
Huh?

00:19:31.238 --> 00:19:34.374
It seems that you
can be a real drag.

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:35.843
Shut up.

00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:38.312
(laughing)

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:45.919
I've decided not
to be a politician.

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:47.588
Huh?

00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:50.023
What happened now?
What changed your mind?

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:53.527
I understand.

00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:58.031
If you made that decision
yourself, that's fine.

00:19:58.065 --> 00:20:00.200
What? Come on, that's really
good enough for you?

00:20:00.234 --> 00:20:01.702
Shouldn't we all talk about it?

00:20:01.735 --> 00:20:03.637
[Shikamaru] Shikadai thought
about it all on his own

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.740
and then he decided to
change his mind, that's all.

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.776
Is that right?

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.011
Yeah.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.514
Dammit, you two are so.

00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:15.916
I also have a
question for you, Mom.

00:20:15.949 --> 00:20:16.917
What is it?

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.851
You're so serious.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.553
I just wanted to
ask if you could

00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:21.855
teach me how to do
Wind Style properly.

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:23.924
Do Wind Style?

00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:25.559
Yeah, I didn't
wanna use it before

00:20:25.592 --> 00:20:28.662
'cause I didn't want Dad
to lose face and feel bad.

00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:30.631
Hey listen,

00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.866
kids shouldn't be worrying
about stuff like that.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.002
Yeah, I know.

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:37.571
From here on I'm gonna
do everything that I can.

00:20:37.604 --> 00:20:40.240
Increasing the number of my
pieces, even by a little,

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:42.576
is sure to benefit
the Nara Clan.

00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:45.612
Look at you all high and mighty.

00:20:45.646 --> 00:20:46.613
[Enchu] Coming in!

00:20:46.647 --> 00:20:47.748
Huh?

00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:49.016
Oh, how fortuitous.

00:20:49.049 --> 00:20:50.717
All of you are here.

00:20:50.751 --> 00:20:52.653
Perfect timing.

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:55.556
Shikadai, I brought the forms

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:58.192
you'll have to submit
to the Feudal Lord.

00:20:58.225 --> 00:21:01.028
Oh uh, I don't think
I need those anymore.

00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:02.896
I see, you don't need them.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.131
Huh?

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:07.701
I've changed my mind
about going into politics.

00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:09.703
What are you telling me?

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:10.804
Now listen.

00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:12.706
The Nara can't have
you and Shikamaru.

00:21:12.739 --> 00:21:14.508
Basically, you wanna make sure

00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:17.377
that the rest of the village
doesn't look down on us, right?

00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:20.914
With dad's Shadow Jutsu
and mom's Wind Style,

00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:22.683
I'll master whatever I can use

00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:26.320
and I'll exceed your
expectations, Lord Enchu.

00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:28.021
Fine then!

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:29.456
Do as you please.

00:21:29.489 --> 00:21:31.425
I wash my hands of you!

00:21:36.063 --> 00:21:38.432
Seems Lord Enchu's
lost face too.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.367
All right, I'm
gonna tell everyone

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.536
I changed my mind
about quitting.

00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:45.906
You'd better let Boruto
know as soon as possible.

00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:47.274
Nah, it's okay.

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:51.311
He can be a real drag, so
I didn't tell him anything.

00:21:55.649 --> 00:21:57.518
Dammit, what's up with him?

00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:01.321
Okay, now how am I gonna
explain this to them.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:03.423
What a drag.

00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:06.760
What?

00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:13.967
(upbeat outro music)

00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:30.651
(singing in Japanese)

00:22:43.597 --> 00:22:46.767
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:00.614 --> 00:23:03.984
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:15.329
(upbeat rock music)

00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:27.574
(upbeat rock music)

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.080
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:46.793
Team seven will be going on
a joint mission with Team 15.

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:48.729
I'm gonna be leading both teams.

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.364
What do we need two teams for?

00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:52.466
To investigate and
try to find the cause

00:23:52.499 --> 00:23:53.901
of aggressive wildlife.

00:23:53.934 --> 00:23:55.169
Aggressive wildlife?

00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:57.738
I've received reports of
birds going into a frenzy

00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.640
and attacking people.

00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:02.609
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:02.643 --> 00:24:05.345
The Cursed Forest.

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:07.748
We don't need to combine
teams for something like that.

00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:10.317
Team seven will
wrap this up quick.

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:15.455
