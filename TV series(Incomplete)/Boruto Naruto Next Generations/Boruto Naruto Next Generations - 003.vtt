WEBVTT

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:19.802
<i>(Shino) All right, everyone.</i>

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:22.905
<i>Today you'll start practicing</i>
<i>with shuriken.</i>

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:27.109
I know you're all beginners, but
that's okay.

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:30.779
That's because you're at the
Academy to learn.

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:33.015
Now, please be extremely
careful,

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:36.919
so that you don't end up hurting
yourselves or hit your
classmates.

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:38.120
[grunts]

00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:39.054
[grunts]

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.359
[grunting] Yeah!

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:46.294
They're not listening at all.

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:47.563
Hmph!

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:52.100
Oh, dear, I just can't seem to
get this right.

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:56.038
It would be much better for me
if I was drawing. Hmph!

00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:00.943
Yeah, I'm with you there. We've
already been doing this kinda
stuff at home.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.512
Hmph!

00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:08.050
Hah!

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:15.123
Since secluding myself and
immersing myself in training, my
shuriken technique's perfect!

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:16.992
He's good.

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:18.060
Mhm.

00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:21.597
[gasps] Wait! Shikadai and
everyone else is watching!

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:24.032
[weak grunt]

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.477
[embarrassed laughing] Guess my
hand must have slipped! That is
so weird.

00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:38.180
<i>(Boruto) Outta the way!</i>

00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:39.014
Huh?

00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:40.415
This is how I do it!

00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:43.752
[gasps] Hey! Isn't that really
dangerous?

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:49.091
Demon Wind Shuriken! Go!

00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:53.295
Hmm. That shuriken is so
unsteady! With my kick I will...

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:54.496
Metal!

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:05.007
Oh, uh, L‐L‐Leaf Hurricane!
[yelling]

00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:08.410
[yelling]

00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:11.046
[grunts]

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.516
[heavy breathing] Are you all
right?

00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:15.551
[grunts] Uh, y‐yes.

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:18.821
You're Metal, right?
I'm sorry about that.

00:02:18.854 --> 00:02:22.024
Was this supposed to be
another one of your pranks?

00:02:22.057 --> 00:02:22.725
Uhh.

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:24.326
Where'd you even get that thing?

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.563
(Inojin) You aren't supposed to
<i>use a Demon Wind Shuriken</i>
<i>yet.</i>

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:30.165
I don't know, I found
it in a locker, so...

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:30.733
<i>(Iwabe) Hey!</i>

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:31.867
Hmm?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.603
That's my Demon Wind Shuriken!
You can't just take it!

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.506
Oh, that was yours, huh?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.807
<i>(Shino) You guys...</i>

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:39.908
Hmm?

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:42.611
All of you come to the teacher's
office after class.

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:44.446
<i>(Boruto) But!</i>

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.313
<i>(Shino) No but's.</i>

00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:46.849
<i>(Shikadai) Even us too?</i>

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:48.216
(Inojin) We didn't do anything!

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.119
(Shino) It's called "collective
<i>responsibility."</i>

00:02:51.153 --> 00:02:53.922
This should have been a piece of
<i>cake!</i>

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:59.194
<i>But I couldn't. When I get</i>
<i>nervous, I always mess up!</i>

00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:49.572
I pulled my share of pranks when
I was young, too. So I do
understand.

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:52.541
But still, you guys
fool around too much.

00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:55.243
Only one person
was fooling around.

00:04:55.277 --> 00:05:00.248
[sighs] Listen, you're setting a
bad example for your classmates.

00:05:00.282 --> 00:05:03.519
I'm assigning you some volunteer
work outside of class.

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:05.921
Uh, does that include me?

00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:07.122
And me?

00:05:07.155 --> 00:05:09.457
<i>(Shino) You two will supervise</i>
<i>the others. Understood?</i>

00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.759
[groans]

00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:13.762
Why do I have to?

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.899
To begin with, it's against the
rules to bring unauthorized
weapons to school.

00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:17.666
[groans]

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.702
[sighs]

00:05:22.738 --> 00:05:24.873
[groans] This?

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:29.177
That's right. The one that you
crashed into and damaged with
that train.

00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:32.380
(Site Leader) Oh good, I've been
<i>waiting!</i>

00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:36.118
You're the students from the
Academy, right? Shino Sensei
told me to expect you.

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.921
These repairs require
great care and attention.

00:05:38.954 --> 00:05:43.559
<i>(Site Leader) Just think of it</i>
<i>as part of your ninjutsu</i>
<i>training and do your best!</i>

00:05:43.592 --> 00:05:44.459
Kay.

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:46.829
Looking forward to helping out!

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:58.106
[groans] Isn't there some
ninjutsu we can use to fix this
all at once?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.243
By all rights, you should be
doing this by yourself.

00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:02.745
[sighs]

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:06.414
I'm guessing that all of this
work is more of a drag for you,
Class Rep.

00:06:06.448 --> 00:06:09.618
[chuckles] It's okay, I like
doing construction work.

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:16.058
Besides, working to fix a
Hokage's Great Stone Face is an
unbelievable honor.

00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:19.562
Yeah, you definitely got that
right, Miss Class
Representative.

00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:22.497
[nervous groan]

00:06:22.531 --> 00:06:27.936
Repairing the Great Stone Faces.
<i>I just can't mess this up.</i>

00:06:34.643 --> 00:06:37.379
[sighs]

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:39.715
<i>(Boruto) I bet I could do this</i>
<i>by myself.</i>

00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:41.483
<i>(Shikadai) Wait, Boruto!</i>

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:45.654
[grunting] Hah, yeah!

00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:47.990
Hold up! Don't charge in alone!

00:06:48.524 --> 00:06:50.392
<i>(Boruto) No, no, no!</i>

00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:53.428
And we were at a good
spot in the level too!

00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:55.330
Yeah, you ruined it, Boruto.

00:06:55.363 --> 00:06:57.365
Uh, sorry. [chuckles]

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.234
<i>(Sumire Kakei) Everyone!</i>

00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:01.403
Let's please try to keep our
breaks short, okay?

00:07:01.436 --> 00:07:02.571
My bad!

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:04.507
Let's get this
finished up soon!

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.141
Yeah, okay!

00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:09.645
Actually I think that we've
managed to get most of the
work done already.

00:07:09.678 --> 00:07:11.647
It's just your part
that's left, Metal.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.583
Whoa, hey there, Metal. Metal!

00:07:14.617 --> 00:07:17.419
[grunting]
<i>(Shikadai) Metal!</i>

00:07:17.452 --> 00:07:18.020
Huh?

00:07:19.688 --> 00:07:20.923
[gasps]

00:07:23.058 --> 00:07:24.492
Huh?

00:07:25.794 --> 00:07:27.095
Come on!

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:28.597
[grunts]

00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:35.003
Aw, come on!

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:40.676
Hey, you okay up there, Class
Rep?

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:41.910
<i>(Sumire Kakei) Yeah!</i>

00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:44.880
Oh, no. Man, we really
did it this time.

00:07:44.913 --> 00:07:47.916
[gasps/sobbing]

00:07:50.252 --> 00:07:52.688
<i>(Boruto) [sighs] I'm so tired.</i>

00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:54.489
Today sure was a rough one.

00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:56.692
Whose fault was it that we were
there in the first place?

00:07:56.725 --> 00:08:00.529
[chuckles] Oh, hey guys, how
about we stop for burgers?

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.498
<i>(Boruto) I have some sweet</i>
<i>coupons we can use!</i>

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:10.172
[sighs]

00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:12.575
(Boruto) Hey Metal, don't be so
<i>down.</i>

00:08:12.608 --> 00:08:15.778
Don't waste your energy trying
to make it all perfect.

00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:18.446
His face isn't perfect in real
life, either.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.115
But, but...

00:08:20.148 --> 00:08:24.787
You know, just working hard
doesn't mean that you're doing
it in the right way, Metal.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.189
Sometimes you make things worse.

00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:29.491
<i>(Shikadai) And end up skipping</i>
<i>over what's important.</i>

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:30.693
[sighs]

00:08:30.726 --> 00:08:34.630
Listen, you make mistakes when
you're feeling nervous, right?

00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:37.332
[gasps] How did you know that?

00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:40.202
You really think it wasn't
obvious to everyone?

00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:44.673
Anyway, even with stuff like
that, you're way too honest. To
a fault.

00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:46.542
I'm too honest?

00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:49.612
No matter how hard you train by
yourself "in seclusion."

00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:53.181
Unless you overcome that
nervousness, it's completely
useless!

00:08:54.349 --> 00:08:58.621
Oh I didn't...I didn't
realize...

00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:03.559
Well my house is that way so...

00:09:06.795 --> 00:09:09.464
Metal...

00:09:09.497 --> 00:09:12.735
Shikadai, did you have to
be so harsh with him?

00:09:12.768 --> 00:09:14.603
[chuckles] You're one to talk.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:19.207
To be honest, I think Metal
works harder than anyone else.

00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:22.077
Hmm.

00:09:26.915 --> 00:09:28.551
[grunts]

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:32.621
All right! Just what did you get
up to in school today?!

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.658
Nothing! It was all Boruto!

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:38.794
I just happened to get caught up
in it, that's all!

00:09:38.827 --> 00:09:42.565
Why are you making these
excuses?! What are you, a
coward?!

00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:43.932
Ow, mom, stop!

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:46.134
Hey, I'm home.

00:09:46.869 --> 00:09:48.871
Hmm, what's up?

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:51.439
You get into trouble, Shikadai?

00:09:51.473 --> 00:09:55.544
No, Dad, I didn't do
anything. I mean, not really.

00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:58.514
See if you can talk some sense
into him, Shikamaru.

00:09:58.547 --> 00:10:02.651
He keeps getting into
trouble at the Academy.

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:07.455
At this rate, you aren't going
to become a great ninja.

00:10:07.489 --> 00:10:11.927
Well, on the plus side, this is
another way you learn at the
Academy.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.161
[gulping]

00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:15.598
[sighs]

00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:19.602
Just consider getting scolded as
part of becoming a great ninja.

00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:23.839
I want you to know that there's
no such thing as being a perfect
kid.

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:25.240
Huh?

00:10:25.273 --> 00:10:29.444
Listen, you make mistakes when
you're feeling nervous, right?

00:10:29.477 --> 00:10:33.916
Anyway, even with stuff like
that, you're way too honest. To
a fault.

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:35.784
[sighs]

00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:41.690
I guess my son's like everyone
else. He'll get scolded and
lectured, and grow up.

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:45.528
Otherwise, he'll be someone who
feels no remorse when he's
wrong.

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:49.965
Someone who isn't able to say
he's sorry and who's all rotten
inside.

00:10:49.998 --> 00:10:51.166
[sighs]

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:54.737
Shikadai, did you have to
be so harsh with him?

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.643
Yeah, Dad. You're right.

00:11:00.676 --> 00:11:06.448
[chuckles] You see? Don't worry,
Temari. Our son gets it.

00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:10.619
Anyway, I'm really hungry. Let's
eat already!

00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:12.420
Huh?

00:11:12.454 --> 00:11:14.857
Shikamaru. You are far too easy
on that boy.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.993
And that's the reason he's
always getting into such
trouble.

00:11:18.026 --> 00:11:21.697
[sighs] And now I'm
getting scolded.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.068
[grunts] I'm telling you this
for the sake of the entire Nara
family...

00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:28.537
and you're sitting there giving
me attitude?!

00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:30.706
<i>[gasps] What a drag!</i>

00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:35.811
Let me guess. You two were just
thinking, "what a drag," right?

00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:36.945
<i>[gasps]</i>

00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:40.282
No dinner! For either of you!

00:11:40.315 --> 00:11:42.250
[gasps]

00:11:45.187 --> 00:11:49.858
(Shikadai) [stomach groans] Damn
<i>it, Dad. Learn to read the</i>
<i>situation.</i>

00:11:49.892 --> 00:11:54.697
You know when she's like that
she doesn't budge at all.

00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:01.704
Oh I didn't, I didn't realize...

00:12:01.737 --> 00:12:04.740
(Shikadai) I didn't know he was
<i>so sensitive about it.</i>

00:12:05.974 --> 00:12:09.177
I said too much, didn't I?

00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:12.214
I'll apologize tomorrow.

00:12:13.048 --> 00:12:15.150
<i>(Shikadai) What a drag.</i>

00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:21.757
[yawn]

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.993
Damn it. You don't
have a care in the world.

00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:25.928
Hmm?

00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.229
Oh!

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:30.966
Metal, about yesterday.

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:32.701
[gasps]

00:12:32.735 --> 00:12:37.205
<i>(Boruto) That's like that time</i>
<i>with Denki...</i>

00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:39.875
Hmm?

00:12:39.908 --> 00:12:41.009
[gasps]

00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:43.812
Metal? Wait up! Hmph!

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.180
Shikadai!

00:12:46.114 --> 00:12:49.051
[grunts] Hey, Metal, I wanna
talk to you.

00:12:49.084 --> 00:12:51.019
[grunts]

00:12:51.053 --> 00:12:53.221
Hmm, Metal?

00:12:55.223 --> 00:12:58.193
[yelling]

00:12:58.827 --> 00:13:00.763
Hey! Metal?

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:02.230
[grunting]

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:05.200
[grunting/panting]

00:13:08.136 --> 00:13:09.204
[exhales]

00:13:11.907 --> 00:13:18.246
Witness my true strength. This
is what I am like when I am not
nervous.

00:13:22.484 --> 00:13:26.555
Metal, so you were mad about
what I said yesterday.

00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:29.725
Just wait! I don't blame you for
getting mad.

00:13:29.758 --> 00:13:33.796
I was a little...No I was way
too harsh with you.

00:13:34.062 --> 00:13:35.397
Whoa!

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:37.032
[grunts]

00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:40.235
<i>Oh man, if I get hit it's game</i>
<i>over!</i>

00:13:40.268 --> 00:13:43.606
Hmph! Come on. Get up and fight
me.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:46.474
Hey Shikadai! You okay down
there?

00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:49.612
You're fighting Metal?

00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:51.780
I don't know what's going on,
but he isn't himself.

00:13:51.814 --> 00:13:55.450
Get in the way and you will get
no mercy either.

00:13:55.483 --> 00:13:56.952
Metal...

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:02.490
<i>It's the same.</i>

00:14:02.525 --> 00:14:05.027
Hmm? What's up, Boruto?

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.295
Uh, you guys. Wait
you can't see that?

00:14:07.329 --> 00:14:09.031
What're you talking about?

00:14:09.064 --> 00:14:11.133
[inhales]

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:14.069
Never mind! Metal's lost
it. What do we do now?

00:14:14.102 --> 00:14:18.140
I don't know. But if we do
nothing, something bad's gonna
happen.

00:14:18.173 --> 00:14:19.307
Huh?

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:25.080
[gasps]

00:14:25.113 --> 00:14:26.782
[yells]

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:32.087
A perfect throw!

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.489
When he's not
nervous he's amazing!

00:14:34.523 --> 00:14:36.224
[grunts]

00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:37.560
[grunts]

00:14:37.593 --> 00:14:40.162
Hey, Shikadai, he's seriously
strong!

00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:41.864
So you got a strategy
for us or what?

00:14:41.897 --> 00:14:47.035
Calm down! Just give me a chance
to think! Let me see...

00:14:48.103 --> 00:14:50.105
Run away! [screams]

00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:51.874
[grunts]

00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:00.282
[scared groans]

00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:06.388
Come out! It is useless to hide.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.257
Man, he's scary!

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:10.726
Shh! Be quiet!

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:12.828
We can't just keep running away
from him.

00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:14.930
What! You were the
one who told us to run!

00:15:14.963 --> 00:15:19.167
Relax, it's okay. I've got a
plan all figured out this time.

00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:20.803
We'll counterattack.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.505
Hmm?

00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:26.474
Listen, Boruto. If you don't
want it to be game over, don't
charge in all by yourself.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.243
Huh?

00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:33.916
With a strong enemy, pooling
your strength can let you win.
And it makes games more fun.

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:35.584
Where are you?

00:15:39.888 --> 00:15:40.422
Huh?

00:15:40.823 --> 00:15:42.525
[grunting]

00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:43.425
Huh?

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:45.594
[yelling]

00:15:46.294 --> 00:15:47.262
[grunts]

00:15:47.295 --> 00:15:49.264
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:50.098
[grunts]

00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.070
[grunts] You won't escape!

00:15:56.138 --> 00:16:01.577
[grunting]

00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:04.580
Oh, so close!

00:16:04.613 --> 00:16:10.352
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, a
ninjutsu where whomever the
shadow touches becomes immobile.

00:16:10.385 --> 00:16:14.056
But it seems, there is a limit
to its reach.

00:16:14.089 --> 00:16:16.458
Ninja Art! Super Beast Scroll!

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.094
[gasps]

00:16:19.127 --> 00:16:24.867
[grunting]

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:29.237
<i>What? But he did not move</i>
<i>closer!</i>

00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:30.338
Hmph!

00:16:30.372 --> 00:16:33.509
<i>And the shadow has not touched</i>
<i>me!</i>

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:35.578
[gasps]

00:16:37.646 --> 00:16:38.514
[gasps]

00:16:40.282 --> 00:16:43.318
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu is now
complete.

00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:45.721
What is going on?

00:16:45.754 --> 00:16:49.157
And that, my friend, is a
Transformation Jutsu.

00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:52.394
What? But how? What was that
shadow?

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.299
It was two snakes that I drew.

00:16:57.332 --> 00:17:01.436
[angry grunt]

00:17:01.469 --> 00:17:05.340
I will never forgive you for
tricking me!

00:17:05.373 --> 00:17:08.010
[grunts] How is he so strong?

00:17:08.043 --> 00:17:09.211
[yelling]

00:17:09.244 --> 00:17:12.581
<i>(Shikadai) If he keeps this up</i>
<i>the jutsu won't hold!</i>

00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:14.917
<i>Sorry Metal.</i>

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.485
Hey, Boruto, you have to knock
Metal out!

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.322
What? And how exactly
do I do that?

00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:22.124
<i>(Shikadai) I don't know, punch</i>
<i>him!</i>

00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:24.292
<i>(Boruto) Huh? You punch him!</i>

00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:25.227
Hurry it up!

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.428
Should I do it?

00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:31.233
[screaming]

00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:34.302
Damn it! All right, fine, I'll
do it!

00:17:34.336 --> 00:17:36.438
Then do it already!

00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:43.445
[screaming]

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.381
Huh?

00:17:46.414 --> 00:17:52.688
[yelling]

00:17:52.721 --> 00:17:54.222
[grunts]

00:17:54.256 --> 00:17:55.423
Metal? Aw man!

00:17:55.457 --> 00:17:58.293
Metal! Hey, are you okay?

00:17:58.326 --> 00:18:00.529
[groans]

00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:04.900
Uh.

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:08.436
[groans] What did I just do? Ow,
ow, ow!

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.905
Thank goodness.

00:18:09.938 --> 00:18:12.340
Well, looks like you're
back to normal.

00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:13.842
Huh?

00:18:13.876 --> 00:18:17.045
I'm sorry for yesterday. I
didn't mean to make you feel
bad!

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:18.847
Oh, no, it is okay!

00:18:18.881 --> 00:18:23.552
You had every right to
be angry. I'm really sorry.

00:18:23.586 --> 00:18:29.024
<i>(Shikadai) By the way, when</i>
you're not nervous, your power's
<i>are really amazing.</i>

00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:32.027
Thanks, Shikadai.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.565
[grunts] You know, I think you
guys really should train more
seriously.

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.333
(Metal) Especially you, Boruto.

00:18:38.366 --> 00:18:39.267
What, me?

00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:41.236
[chuckles] Well that's blunt.

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:42.738
[sighs]

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:48.243
Oh! Class is about to start!
Come on, let us go!

00:18:48.276 --> 00:18:51.313
Yeah, all right. Guess I'll
take class seriously then...

00:18:51.346 --> 00:18:53.782
Yeah, me too.

00:18:54.482 --> 00:18:57.119
Gentlemen! You must hurry!

00:18:57.152 --> 00:18:58.621
We're coming.

00:19:03.325 --> 00:19:05.427
<i>(Boruto) I'm home.</i>

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.896
Welcome back, big brother!

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.098
[chuckles] Hey,
Himawari! How are you?

00:19:10.132 --> 00:19:14.903
Welcome home, Boruto. You're
just in time! Dinner is almost
ready.

00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:19.775
Good. I actually used my brain
in class today so I'm really
hungry.

00:19:20.509 --> 00:19:22.377
Just today?

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:28.050
Oh, I just meant that we had
lots of hard stuff to learn
today so I uh...[laughing]

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:29.985
Let's play after dinner!

00:19:30.018 --> 00:19:34.322
Oh, the thing is I actually got
to do some studying later on.

00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:36.091
[sad sigh]

00:19:36.324 --> 00:19:37.693
Hmm.

00:19:37.726 --> 00:19:39.261
Uh.

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.667
Hmm?

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.370
Hey, Mom? That uh, thing with
your eyes. It's called the
Byakugan, isn't it?

00:19:48.403 --> 00:19:50.272
Huh?

00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:56.344
Yes, that's right. Myself, your
uncle, well, the entire Hyuga
Clan has that ability.

00:19:56.378 --> 00:19:58.146
Why? What about it?

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.082
Oh, nothing.

00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:04.152
I just wondered what kind of
stuff you can see with it.

00:20:04.186 --> 00:20:06.722
Lots of things!

00:20:06.755 --> 00:20:10.258
You can see far away, through
objects, and other people's
chakra, too!

00:20:11.193 --> 00:20:12.661
<i>Chakra?</i>

00:20:12.695 --> 00:20:15.631
(Boruto) Was that stuff chakra?

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:20.836
I was wondering, um...

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:22.137
Huh?

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.338
<i>(Naruto) I'm home.</i>

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:25.541
Daddy!

00:20:25.574 --> 00:20:28.143
Oh good you got to
come home early today!

00:20:28.176 --> 00:20:31.647
Yeah, finally finished an
all‐nighter.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.317
Well, dinner's ready. Would you
like some?

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.621
Thank you, but I'm
going to bed.

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:42.758
All right. Well then, have a
good night!

00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:48.363
He isn't even gonna eat the
dinner that Mom made for us?

00:20:48.396 --> 00:20:50.799
Stupid old man...

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.676
Here I come! I'm gonna get ya!

00:21:00.709 --> 00:21:04.146
Nice, Boruto!
Inojin, finish 'em!

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:04.647
I'm on it!

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.514
<i>(Metal Lee) Ah!</i>

00:21:05.548 --> 00:21:06.982
Huh?

00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:10.218
I was looking for you! And here
you are, just skipping class!

00:21:10.252 --> 00:21:13.221
(Metal Lee) I am reporting this
<i>to the teacher!</i>

00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:14.957
[groans]

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:19.294
Hey, Metal, did you know?
Playing this game will help
improve your teamwork skills.

00:21:19.327 --> 00:21:22.297
And not only that, it
will also help you relax.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.568
Maybe it will even be able to
help you get rid of your
nervousness.

00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:26.635
Huh?

00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:28.671
<i>(Boruto) Try it out!</i>

00:21:34.476 --> 00:21:36.745
All right! Get 'em, Metal!

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:39.281
Yeah! It's up to you now!

00:21:39.314 --> 00:21:40.182
What?

00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:41.584
You can do it, Metal!

00:21:41.617 --> 00:21:42.551
[groans]

00:21:42.585 --> 00:21:44.452
(all) All right! Finish him!

00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:46.889
If you talk like that I will get
nervous!

00:21:50.693 --> 00:21:56.064
[screams] You broke my handheld!
[screams]

00:21:56.098 --> 00:21:57.733
I am sorry, but when
I get nervous...

00:21:57.766 --> 00:22:00.002
You gonna get me a
new one or what?

00:22:00.035 --> 00:22:03.005
He really is way
too honest, y'know?

00:22:03.038 --> 00:22:07.342
At least I know now that both
of us wont end up rotten.

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:08.310
Hmm?

00:22:08.343 --> 00:22:09.645
Hmm.

00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:13.448
[chuckles] Damn it, everyone is
such a drag!

00:23:50.513 --> 00:23:52.548
That last yakisoba
bun is mine!

00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:56.318
Normally, a gentleman would
agree to defer to a lady.

00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.286
Yeah well, maybe if
you were a "lady..."

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.889
What is that supposed
to mean?!

00:24:00.923 --> 00:24:04.326
Stop right there! After class
I'll prepare a battleground for
you.

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:10.666
<i>(Boruto) Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations: "A</i>
<i>Ninjutsu Battle of the Sexes!"</i>

<i>this!</i>
