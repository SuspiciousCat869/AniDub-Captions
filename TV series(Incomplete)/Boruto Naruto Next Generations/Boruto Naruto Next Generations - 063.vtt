WEBVTT

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:14.248
(BORUTO) <i>Where am I?</i>

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.017
Boruto!

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.452
(BORUTO) <i>Sarada...?</i>

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.319
You're awake!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.121
[gasp]

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:29.730
[roar]

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.533
Wait, why isn't Dad attacking?

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.736
Naruto could easily obliterate
that thing if he wanted to.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.972
But it would take out everything
around him in the process.

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.708
(BORUTO) <i>To protect everyone...!</i>

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.385
Dad, no!

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:53.720
Where's my dad?

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:59.593
Uh... Lord Seventh... protected
all of us... He...

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:01.762
(HIMAWARI) <i>Mommy!</i>

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:02.563
Hm?

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:03.730
Himawari!

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.700
(SAKURA) <i>Hang in there, Hinata!</i>

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.201
[gasp]

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.536
(HIMAWARI) <i>It's me! Can you hear</i>
<i>me?</i>

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.238
[heavy breathing] Mom!

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.574
Big Brother!

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:15.509
Are you okay, Boruto?

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.378
I'm totally fine! But what
happened to Mom?

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.582
She'll be fine. It's okay.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.017
(BORUTO) <i>What happened, Mom?!</i>

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:25.586
How'd you get hurt?!

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:28.789
She charged right in after
him...

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:29.890
[gasp]

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.292
Why?! That's crazy!

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.662
Your dad had collapsed, and they
were going to take him away,
so...

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.731
She tried to get Naruto back...

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:39.266
[quivered breath]

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:46.974
[crying]

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:50.511
[gasp]

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:54.715
So what happened to dad?

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:59.152
To protect everybody else in the
village, he took the brunt of
the enemy's attack.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.792
You remember what Naruto always
<i>said, right?</i>

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:10.731
He believed that it was his duty
<i>to protect everyone in the</i>
<i>village, no matter what.</i>

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:04.411
[groan] Where's everyone else?

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.716
Mitsuki is still in critical
condition...

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:16.690
<i>In the midst of all that</i>
chaos... I guess they stole his
<i>chakra...</i>

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:21.428
<i>Shizune and her team are</i>
treating him. They haven't left
<i>his side.</i>

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:26.099
And everybody else is just
fine... all thanks to Lord
Seventh...

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:28.535
Oh, I see...

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.543
Boruto...

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:38.345
[groans and chattering]

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.013
Hm! Boruto!

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:42.616
Oh, thank goodness! You're
actually okay!

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.518
We were all so worried!

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.888
Oh, thanks... Uh, I'm totally
fine.

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.990
I think Lord Hokage is, too.

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:53.126
Yeah... [gasp]

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.718
[groans and chattering]

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.720
[quivered breaths]

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:22.389
What happened to everyone?

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:25.025
They ended up getting caught in
that last explosion...

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:28.028
But luckily their injuries
aren't very serious.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:32.533
And that's all thanks to Lord
Hokage. It's a miracle things
weren't any worse!

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:34.334
[quivered breaths]

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:34.701
Huh?!

00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:35.135
Hey, Boruto!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.707
Hmmm... There aren't enough
hospital rooms. So we're gonna
need to-

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:53.520
You think it's okay to let him
go off alone?

00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.722
Well, I wonder what's gonna
happen now...

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:56.390
Whattya mean?

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:00.894
Back when Boruto defeated you in
your match, frankly, I was
amazed.

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:04.898
But who knew he was using a
forbidden Scientific Ninja Tool?

00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:07.467
[grunt] So heavy!

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:11.271
Ughhh... Anyway, they totally
messed up our Chunin Exams.

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:13.707
They'll probably have to do it
over, huh?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.109
Yeah, who knows...?

00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:18.879
Although, if I get to battle
that super handsome guy again...

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.281
I guess it wouldn't be all that
bad!

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:26.019
Is that really all you can think
about right now? That's pretty
shallow, you know!

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.655
You mean what happened to Lord
Hokage?

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:33.594
I guess that I just have faith
that someone like Lord Hokage
wouldn't ever let guys like...

00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:34.595
that beat him!

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:35.729
Am I right, Shikadai?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.565
Uh huh. Yeah, you're right.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.003
[groans and chattering]

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.005
[heavy breathing]

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:47.341
[laughing]

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:52.112
I'm amazed that you endured this
long! [chewing and swallowing]

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:11.265
[laughing] After this, it's
over!

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:18.338
Let's do it, Kurama! You'd
better not be out of shape now.

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:21.074
Ha! Don't be foolish! I'm always
ready to go!

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:22.876
Right!

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.379
Hahhhhh!

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:28.382
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:32.553
[pained grunt and groan]

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:37.891
[pained groans]

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:39.026
Ugh, man...

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:40.394
Uh... [grunt]

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:46.266
[chuckle] Like I told you! I'm
gonna show everyone the results
of my training!

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:52.539
You just watch...

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.343
I'll definitely show you what I
can do in the second round!

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:59.279
No matter what, I'm gonna make
sure you acknowledge me!

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.717
Do not lose to Shikadai!

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.120
Uh...

00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:13.560
[chuckle] Like I'd lose!

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:15.262
Huh?

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:16.730
[inhale]

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:21.702
I'll be watching.

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:25.372
[chuckles] Huh?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.275
Dad, did you see me?!

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.544
I actually won!

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:43.557
[nervous breath]

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:45.726
[nervous groan]

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:48.996
Well, explain yourself. Go on.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:57.738
I just wanted Dad to acknowledge
me... and to treat me like I'd
come into my own...

00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:00.073
But in the end... it turned
out...

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.209
...to be the exact opposite!

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:10.083
[nervous groans]

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.519
[nervous breath]

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:13.554
Are you done?

00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:21.562
I couldn't do a thing. Not a
single thing...

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:25.098
[angered breaths] Damn it!

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:26.400
[grunt]

00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:36.109
(NARUTO) <i>You're no longer a</i>
<i>ninja either...</i>

00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:43.550
He's completely right, ya
know...

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:55.028
[groggy groans and gasp]

00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:56.263
Mommy!

00:09:56.964 --> 00:09:59.032
Oh, thank goodness!

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:03.237
Naruto... Where is Naruto now?

00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:04.538
[sighs]

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:06.607
[sighed groan]

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.674
(SASUKE) <i>Don't worry.</i>

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:08.375
[gasps]

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:12.513
Naruto's okay.

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:14.014
[sighs of relief]

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.251
Leave the rest to me. I'll
handle it.

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:25.726
[gasp] Maybe Dad is--!

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:29.329
[gasp]

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:36.103
Of course he isn't here...

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.118
That's Grandpa's photograph,
it's up on the wall here.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.454
Boruto! Boruto!

00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:55.923
Just let me go, Mom!

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:59.026
I'm gonna go over there and beat
that loser up!

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:03.397
Boruto! Your father has to work
very hard for the people of the
village.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.134
And what about us, huh?! Aren't
we part of the village, too?!

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.003
When you're Hokage, it's okay to
just ignore your family?!

00:11:10.037 --> 00:11:14.374
Look, I understand, but it
doesn't mean that your father's
forgotten about you two!

00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:18.111
I've heard that lame excuse so
many times that I've lost count!

00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:21.014
Enough, already! I'm just so
sick and tired of it!

00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:21.715
Boruto...

00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:27.354
(BORUTO) <i>And, when Dad was a</i>
<i>kid, Grandpa Hokage wasn't</i>
<i>even alive!</i>

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:33.760
So I guess Dad's just lucky that
he never had to experience the
"joy" of having a parent around!

00:11:33.794 --> 00:11:35.696
It's no wonder he doesn't care!

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:36.330
(HINATA) <i>Boruto!</i>

00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:40.033
Why does my dad have to be the
Hokage?!

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:45.339
He just sits there at his desk
all day, acting bossy!

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.842
Literally anybody at all could
do that job!

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.578
I know...

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:54.248
...that it's really hard not
having your father around on
important days.

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.717
[sigh]

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.019
But still, it's different with
you.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.655
You still have a father who's
actually here.

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:22.976
Man, I am so... uncool.

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:25.546
Hm?

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:42.362
(SAKURA) <i>You remember what</i>
<i>Naruto always said, right?</i>

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:47.134
He believed that it was his duty
<i>to protect everyone in the</i>
<i>village, no matter what.</i>

00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:55.409
I just... I just didn't really
get it 'til now. [chuckle]

00:13:14.595 --> 00:13:16.730
[grunt] This is so uncool.

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:20.901
No, it's me... I'm uncool.

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:22.870
(SASUKE) <i>You got that right.</i>

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:24.872
What? Sasuke?!

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.974
At the Exams, everyone scorned
you.

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:31.411
You were stripped of your
headband and can't even call
yourself a shinobi right now.

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:35.148
On top of that, your father's
gone.

00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:37.084
Frankly...

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:42.789
Without the sister who adores
you and the mother who worries
so much about you...

00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:46.293
...you'd be just like how Naruto
used to be back then.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.561
[sigh]

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:54.301
What you need to know now isn't
the current Naruto, but the
Naruto who made it this far.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.272
So, my Dad...

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:02.543
Can you tell me what he would've
done?

00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:12.386
I guess that means... it's not
just his weaknesses you're
interested in now...

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:17.724
Well, then, you should just ask
him yourself.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:19.593
We're saving him.

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:22.763
[gasp] My dad is alive?!

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:28.569
I'm able to sense his chakra. I
can't tell if he's hurt or not,
but at the very least...

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:29.536
he's still alive.

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:32.039
[elated sigh of relief]

00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:34.708
(DARUI) <i>If you're gonna go</i>
<i>rescue the Hokage...</i>

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:35.542
[gasp]

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:41.448
...I hope you'll let all of us
pitch in and help, too!

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:42.382
[awed breath]

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:46.520
After all, the Otsutsuki Clan
can't be ignored.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.889
Our sworn friend's been
kidnapped so standing around...

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:51.525
would disgrace the Five Kage's
name.

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:55.262
Let's do it! Let's make those
guys regret that they ever made
us their enemy.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.997
Wow!

00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:07.708
What exactly was written in the
scroll?

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:11.845
It contained a warning that
there would be pursuers coming
to this land...

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:15.916
<i>...because Kaguya stopped</i>
<i>supplying chakra to the</i>
<i>Otsutsuki Clan...</i>

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:20.921
She was making preparations to
attack them once they arrived.
That's the gist.

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:25.926
I see... So what they're after
is a massive amount of chakra,
then?

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.562
So that's why Eight Tails was
targeted...

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:33.634
Which means the reason the
Hokage was taken was to extract
the Nine Tails from him.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.235
That seems pretty clear to me.

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:40.607
But for them to time their
attack right when they did...
The Chunin Exams are crucial...

00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:42.009
and those two ruined them!

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:46.647
I was attacked by the one that
plucks away chakra.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.084
That is a dangerous power. And
so, I won't let you use it.
[chuckle]

00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:53.887
[pained groans]

00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:57.925
(GARRA) <i>He's able to steal</i>
<i>chakra and jutsu with that</i>
<i>fishhook of his.</i>

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.594
If our enemy is the Otsutsuki
Clan...

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.030
...then business as usual isn't
gonna work.

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:05.899
Yes, we have to be prepared for
the worst.

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:13.640
We must not let the Divine Tree,
which steals chakra from people,
regenerate ever again.

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:18.579
(SASUKE) <i>The one called Kinshiki</i>
<i>has the ability to make</i>
<i>weapons from stolen chakra.</i>

00:16:18.612 --> 00:16:21.682
<i>He attacks with ferocious</i>
<i>power and speed.</i>

00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:24.117
The other one is called
Momoshiki.

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:26.386
Fire Style Bullet: Homura!

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:31.425
(SASUKE) <i>He absorbs his foe's</i>
<i>jutsu with the Rinnengan in</i>
<i>his palm...</i>

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:35.495
and he returns it with an even
<i>greater intensity.</i>

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:41.001
Using jutsu against Momoshiki,
is just going to rebound back
against you.

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.669
[nervous inhale]

00:16:43.704 --> 00:16:45.706
Well, that's troublesome...

00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:49.543
We'd better brace ourselves.
This one's gonna be really
tough.

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:51.378
Where is Naruto now?

00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:54.748
The scroll revealed the location
where those two can be found.

00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:59.686
Naruto is probably there with
them. I've already analyzed it
with my Rinnegan.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.755
Then I guess we'd better get
going!

00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:07.828
What are you waiting for,
Boruto?

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:08.695
Uh...!

00:17:10.964 --> 00:17:13.333
You actually intend on bringing
him along?

00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:15.469
Hey, c'mon! You're joking,
right?!

00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:17.971
I agree that would be far too
dangerous.

00:17:18.005 --> 00:17:21.675
Absolutely. There's no doubt in
my mind that he should stay
home-

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.777
(SASUKE) <i>I'm not joking.</i>

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.647
Remember, he is Naruto's son,
after all.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.415
And my pupil.

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:29.349
[gasp]

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.423
There's a reason why I'm taking
him.

00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:38.392
A reason?

00:17:43.797 --> 00:17:46.466
Maybe... I should...

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.068
I'm saying it's okay.

00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:50.504
<i>Listen carefully, Boruto.</i>

00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:51.672
[gasp]

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:55.475
Those guys are dangerous. But
knowing that...

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:58.245
...there's still a reason why
I'm bringing you along.

00:17:58.612 --> 00:17:59.513
Huh...?

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:04.751
If enough of us should fall
victim to them. Or in the
worst-case situation...

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:06.353
if we're driven into a corner...

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:14.862
If that time comes, you must
take over. That's why I'm
bringing you.

00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:18.365
[gasp] But if someone as strong
as you...

00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:20.701
You're actually quite a strong
shinobi.

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.003
I may have lost to him...

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:27.674
...but if you put your mind to
it you might be able to surpass
him.

00:18:27.708 --> 00:18:29.343
No, I can't!

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:30.410
Yes, you can.

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:31.211
[gasp]

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:35.849
I know, because you're a worse
loser than Naruto ever was.

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:38.352
What are you talking about? A
loser?!

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:40.721
(SASUKE) <i>I just mean you hate to</i>
<i>lose.</i>

00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:41.855
Uh...!

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:43.657
I know that you can do it.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.859
Trust your teacher.

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:49.863
[gasp and sigh] Okay, then! I'll
go!

00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:53.534
No. Hold on a second. There's
still something that's missing.

00:18:57.671 --> 00:19:00.073
But... isn't this...?

00:19:01.608 --> 00:19:04.578
You know, I threw that headband
away once.

00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:07.748
...But your father.... He kept
it safe for me.

00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.684
We made a promise a while
back...

00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:14.988
That I'd hold onto it till the
day we could have a real fight.

00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:17.224
<i>I'm giving it to you.</i>

00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:44.218
[grunt]

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.558
Okay, then. If he has your
authorization...

00:19:51.592 --> 00:19:55.329
I guess we have no choice but to
take him along, Sasuke.

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:55.929
Mhm!

00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:58.932
Hm!

00:19:58.966 --> 00:20:00.400
Alright, let's go!

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:10.077
Dad, please...

00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:11.378
...take me, too!

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:16.383
Sarada... Once I go, you'll be
the only one here with the
Sharingan.

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:19.353
Stay with Kakashi and Shikamaru.
Protect the village.

00:20:21.522 --> 00:20:26.593
I got it. But be careful, okay,
dad? And you'd better come back
soon!

00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:27.694
That's the plan.

00:20:29.463 --> 00:20:32.533
Leave everything here to us.
Just focus on bringing Naruto
back home safely.

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:36.170
[groan]

00:20:40.007 --> 00:20:42.176
Shikadai... Listen...

00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:45.879
I get it. You've got something
that you need to do right now.

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:46.580
Uh...!

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:49.249
Explanations are a drag. Just
get it done, alright?

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.853
I'll listen to what you have to
say when you get back.

00:20:52.886 --> 00:20:53.654
Uh...!

00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:56.390
[chuckle] Okay!

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.129
We'll use this to get to them.

00:21:10.137 --> 00:21:11.471
(HINATA) <i>Boruto!</i>

00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:11.805
(HIMAWARI) <i>Big Brother!</i>

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:12.172
Hm?

00:21:14.007 --> 00:21:15.075
(BORUTO) <i>Mom...!</i>

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:17.077
[pained breath]

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:19.346
Boruto...!

00:21:25.219 --> 00:21:26.220
[gasp]

00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:34.361
Naruto... No way...

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:36.363
I'm gonna go now.

00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:49.676
You take care of your dad. He's
in your hands, Boruto.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.677
Got it!

00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:55.482
Now you're finally acting like a
shinobi. Let's go!

00:21:55.516 --> 00:21:57.751
Sarada, Shikadai, take care of
everyone!

00:22:05.526 --> 00:22:06.994
<i>Just hang on, Dad...</i>

00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.562
<i>I'm coming for ya!</i>

00:23:44.157 --> 00:23:46.293
(NARUTO) <i>You see... we ninja...</i>

00:23:46.326 --> 00:23:49.196
<i>...don't like to make things</i>
<i>easy, ya know?</i>

00:23:49.229 --> 00:23:54.535
(MOMOSHIKI) <i>You ninja are merely</i>
fodder. Stop resisting! Just let
<i>us extract your chakra!</i>

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:56.637
(NARUTO) <i>There's no way that's</i>
<i>gonna happen.</i>

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:02.075
<i>I plan on wrapping this up</i>
<i>quickly so I can hurry back</i>
<i>to him...</i>

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:07.181
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations:</i>
<i>"Rescuing Naruto!"</i>

00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:09.249
(NARUTO) <i>...after I defeat you,</i>
<i>that is!</i>
