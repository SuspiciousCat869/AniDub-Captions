WEBVTT

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:16.583
[chuckles]

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.389
I'm afraid it got a little
scorched.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.592
Don't worry, it's fine.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:28.695
I kinda like it when it's a
little on the charred side.

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:29.963
Do you want some of this?

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.765
Uh? Mhm.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.170
[inhales] I'm out of here!

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.206
You're not putting on your
headband?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.309
[chuckle] I don't want anybody
to see me wearing something
that uncool.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.211
[sighs]

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.716
Back in our day, we couldn't
wait to wear our headbands,
nothing made us happier.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.317
Times have changed.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.385
[giggle]

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:55.055
I don't think that's what's
happening here.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.494
[giggle]

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:08.201
Lord Seventh. Sorry but it's
time.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.304
I guess relaxing is just out
of the question these days.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.507
You said you wanted to see him
off today...

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.877
so I went ahead and shuffled
your schedule around to make
that possible.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.045
[chuckles] And I'm grateful you
did.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.216
You also have seven meetings and
you committed to observing a
training session.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.284
Prepare yourself!

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:26.319
Guess I have no choice.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.389
Okay Hinata. See you later
then.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:15.495
Morning!

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.632
Hey, Denki! Your new outfit
looks great! It really suits
you!

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:19.966
[chuckle] You think?

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:24.971
Hey Sarada, so which team do you
think the two of us are gonna
be on?

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.708
I don't know, Cho‐Cho. At this
point we can't even be sure
we'll wind up on the same one.

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:30.443
We're so amazingly in tune with
each other.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.647
There's no way in the world
we'll ever be separated!

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.515
[chuckle]

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:38.852
Besides, what would happen to
your legendary...

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.955
Now that sounds interesting!
If that's the case, we should
team up Shikadai!

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:45.058
Listen, the Sensei get to
decide who teams up together.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:50.430
Anyway, I'd hate to be on a team
with someone like you who leaves
everything to chance...

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.833
and always acts without a plan
for success. Eh.

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.770
Haven't you ever heard of the
phrase "playing it by ear"
before? [grunts]

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:59.640
You're too close. You're
spitting on me.

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:05.345
We get no choice. Just is what
it is. We just have to be
ready for it.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.248
Sensei is here!

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.950
Uh, we've been waiting for
you!

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:10.851
Whoa!

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:12.252
[horrified]

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.787
[gasps]

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.688
[gasps]

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.891
I personally taught each of
these new recruits myself.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.662
And I am confident that they are
ready to be sent off into the
world now.

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:22.763
[students talking]

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.598
Huh? [grunts]

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.833
Ugh! That was gross!

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.702
The whole thing was your
fault, you know.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.037
<i>(Boruto) I couldn't help it. I</i>
<i>got pushed!</i>

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:33.907
<i>(Sarada) Save your excuses!</i>

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.141
<i>(Boruto) What do you mean by</i>
<i>that? You're the one who's</i>
<i>face...</i>

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.843
Attention, everyone!

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:47.020
Although all of you here may
have just graduated, that alone
only crosses off one checkmark.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:51.057
He says that now but he cried
more than anybody else at that
ceremony.

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:52.225
I know, right?

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.359
What was that?

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.529
Eh, nothing at all, Sensei!

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.999
Your training days are not yet
over.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:02.836
And don't think my watchful
eyes will stop following you
once they are.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:04.605
<i>(Students) Yes, sir!</i>

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.407
One more thing before I
announce the teams.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.243
Sumire, what is a three‐man
squad?

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.678
Huh? Oh, uh.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.316
It's a team comprised of three
shinobi brought together to
complete missions.

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.019
You got half of the answer
correct!

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:23.389
A three‐man squad is a
team responsible for each
other's lives.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:26.192
Why's that? Because that defines
a team.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:30.230
Teamwork makes the
difference between life and
death.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:31.965
<i>(Shino) From this moment as</i>
<i>ninja...</i>

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.404
you will form relationships that
will accompany you for the rest
of your life. Never forget that.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:43.644
All right. When I call your
name, you will go quietly to
the other room.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:46.179
Denki Kaminarimon!

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.047
Sir!

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.515
<i>(Shino) Metal Lee!</i>

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:49.182
Yes!

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.984
<i>(Shino) Iwabe Yuino!</i>

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:51.818
Sir!

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:54.888
(Shino) You three will comprise
<i>Team 5!</i>

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.422
We did it!

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.524
We're a team!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.626
<i>(Shino) Wasabi Izuno.</i>

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.326
Yes, sir!

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.995
<i>(Shino) Sumire Kakei.</i>

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:02.563
Yes, sir!

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.765
<i>(Shino) Namida Suzumeno.</i>

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:06.266
Yes, sir!

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.334
The three of you will comprise
Team 15!

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.638
[crying]

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:14.474
We are in big trouble if you're
gonna cry that hard every time
something happens to us.

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:15.776
<i>(Shino) Houki Taketori.</i>

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:16.409
Yes, sir!

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:17.844
<i>(Shino) Hako Kuroi.</i>

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:18.378
Uh‐huh.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:19.746
<i>(Shino) Renga Kokubo.</i>

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.480
Yes, sir!

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:22.983
(Shino) You three will comprise
<i>Team 25!</i>

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:24.217
So this is it, guys.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.952
Just don't hold me back.

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:27.654
<i>(Shino) Enko Onikuma.</i>

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:28.388
Yes, sir!

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:29.756
<i>(Shino) Doushu Goetsu!</i>

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.123
Yes, sir!

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:31.992
<i>(Shino) Tsuru Itoi.</i>

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:32.693
Yes, sir!

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.595
<i>(Shino) You are Team 40!</i>

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:35.095
Hm!

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:43.136
The only ones left to place
now are the six of us.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.273
Well, as the saying goes the
last one to get picked always
gets the worm.

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:49.009
Literally, no one says that.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:51.111
Isn't this exciting, Boruto?

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.613
Uh. I guess so.

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:56.517
Let us continue on.

00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:00.253
I knew it. It's Cho‐Shika‐Ino
again.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:04.290
It's Ino‐Shika‐Cho. And I'm
already tired of correcting
you all the time!

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:07.728
It's gonna be a drag to be on
the same team as our dads
were.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.864
We come to the last team.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.033
Only you students are left so
you will have to be on the same
squad.

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:14.868
[disappointed sigh]

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:19.472
From now on your official
designation is, Team number 3.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:22.442
Really? We're not going to
be Team 7?

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.646
And I will lead your team! Get
ready to work!

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.314
You're gonna lead us, Big Bro
Konohamaru?!

00:07:28.348 --> 00:07:31.217
Would you just call me
"Sensei" already?!

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.554
Um, Sensei? Huh!

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.389
What's the big idea there,
Sarada?

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:39.893
<i>(Sarada) We're supposed to put</i>
<i>our hands in the lives of our</i>
<i>other team mates.</i>

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:40.627
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.230
If that's supposed to be the
case, compatibility and
balance are crucial.

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:47.768
Just like without balance a
shuriken will never fly
straight.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.775
(Sarada) Balance is what makes a
<i>shuriken fly straight and fly</i>
<i>true.</i>

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:59.713
I can acknowledge that Boruto
has skills, but our
compatibility is another matter.

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:03.950
Ah, come on. It's more fun when
you don't know where you're
gonna end up, don't ya think?

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.219
If you can't understand the
beauty in that, Sarada...

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:09.022
then I sure don't wanna be on
the same team as you!

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:09.556
[gasp]

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:14.194
So basically, what you want is
to be on a team where it's easy
for everyone to get along.

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:14.961
Is that it?

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.098
I officially request a
transfer to another team!

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:20.667
Sarada. Don't be so hasty.

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:22.536
I am not being hasty at all!

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:25.005
The fact is, I plan to become
the Hokage!

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:28.241
I can't waste any time taking
silly detours.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.343
[sigh]

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:33.647
If you're really that adamant,
then both of you come with me!

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.083
(Boruto) A "direct appeal?" What
<i>exactly is that?</i>

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.654
It's this. Here.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.189
So we just have to give that
scroll to Lord Seventh...

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:46.026
and he'll reappraise the team's
compatibility?

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.595
Think of it fundamentally as a
relief measure.

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:51.364
You just take it and hand it
directly to Lord Seventh.

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.933
Great! Thank you for all of your
help!

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:56.703
[gasps] Hey, Sarada! Don't try
to beat me there!

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.777
So, it's happened again this
year.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.778
Yep!

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.716
Wait up, Sarada!

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.986
I already told you I'll submit
it by myself!

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:16.790
Ahh!

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:19.359
Who does she think she is?!

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.262
There have always been genin
unhappy with their team...

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.198
complaining about their
grouping.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:29.135
Still, the number of changes
made as a result of a direct
appeal have been...

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.605
That number would be zero.

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:34.575
You think I'll just let you do
what you want?!

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:36.810
You better stay out of my way!

00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:40.747
[stunned] What the heck? Look
at your eyes! Is that the
Sharingan for real?

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:43.550
That is none of your business!

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:46.052
Man! You gotta let me see it,
c'mon!

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.594
Just showing me won't wear it
out or anything, will it?

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:55.361
Ugh! You are so annoying!

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:58.431
[grunting]

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:00.200
<i>(Boruto) Shadow Paralysis?!</i>

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:04.204
I wondered who was making all
that noise. And here you are.

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:07.007
We're here because we have a
request for Lord Seventh.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.710
We don't want to be together
on the same team!

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:13.179
Ah, what a drag, not this
again.

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:16.249
Unfortunately, Lord Seventh is
out. Sorry.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:21.054
[grunts] We have to appeal
directly to him, please tell
us where he is!

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:26.026
He's on official business. I
can't tell you where, so give
up.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:26.927
[grunts]

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:32.232
[chuckles] On the other hand,
do your best.

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:37.738
"Can't disclose his
location?" Why not?

00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:43.844
Who knows? But stuff like this
happens and when it does I don't
get to see my dad for a while.

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:46.547
So, you go through this a lot,
huh?

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.151
Hey, let's call a truce for
now so we can focus on finding
my dad. All right?

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:54.955
But how are we supposed to
find him? Do you have any
ideas where he could be?

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.623
I couldn't begin to guess.

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:58.091
<i>(Mitsuki) Boruto! Sarada!</i>

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:58.925
Huh?

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.629
Perhaps this might help you
find him?

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.431
It's a copy of Lord Hokage's
schedule for today.

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:07.834
Wow. Where'd you get that,
Mitsuki?

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:12.906
I was able to sneak a quick look
at his schedule while you two
were arguing on the rooftop.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:14.908
Impressive work, Mitsuki!

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.764
All right it's time to give me
all you got!

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:43.303
Try to stop me now!

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.211
[grunts]

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:52.979
Ah!

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:56.249
[grunting]

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:04.390
It'll take a lot more to
protect the village than that!

00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:08.795
Okay. Give it another
try.

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:11.397
Welcome back.

00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:12.866
How did it go?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:16.503
Notify the Hokage's escort.
They're headed that way.

00:12:16.537 --> 00:12:20.406
It seems we're getting a
direct appeal this year, too.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.576
Right.

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:25.812
I can't recall. Who was the
escort captain for today
again?

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.181
[chuckles]

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:32.519
Well, it looks like Boruto and
his friends drew a really bad
opponent. [chuckles]

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.227
They may be newbies, but we
were specifically told not to
go easy on them.

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:48.068
Here we go again. Time really
flies.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.972
Captain Mirai, ma'am. What're
your orders?

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:55.542
Break them in! Let's just
torment them a little bit!

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:03.483
[panting] I can see
the bridge now!

00:13:03.517 --> 00:13:05.318
All right! He's gotta be
close!

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.589
<i>(Mirai) Get back!</i>

00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:09.289
[gasps]

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.159
Unauthorized persons are not
allowed beyond this point.

00:13:15.596 --> 00:13:18.699
Oh hey, it's just you, Big Sis
Mirai.

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:22.302
We came all the way out here
because we need to see my dad
right away.

00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:24.404
And we have to meet with Lord
Seventh in person...

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:27.073
so we can present this direct
appeal to him.

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:31.277
My orders are to admit
absolutely no one through.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.280
If that's how it is then we'll
have to get past her by force.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:38.018
Yeah, but she's a chunin.
She'll beat us in a
straight‐forward attack.

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:40.020
I believe Sarada is correct.

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:43.624
Then what do you suggest we
do?

00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:46.026
Our only chance is to make the
most of each of our areas of
expertise...

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.761
and fight as best as
we can.

00:13:47.794 --> 00:13:49.329
Our areas of expertise?

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:52.899
Yeah, you and Mitsuki use every
skill you've got to distract
her.

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:56.670
While you're doing that, I'll
use my Sharingan to find out
what her weakness is...

00:13:56.703 --> 00:13:58.572
and then we can try to exploit
it.

00:13:58.605 --> 00:13:59.472
Understood.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.575
Well, Boruto?

00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:03.744
Are you in on the plan or not?

00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:06.547
Yeah, fine, whatever. Let's do
this

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.015
They just don't learn.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:11.885
Hmm.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.625
[grunting] Ahh!

00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:21.027
Boruto! Hmph.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:22.095
[grunts]

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:31.972
[grunting]

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:34.875
Wow! Didn't know you had that
up your sleeve!

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:42.315
It's not fair You'd already
laid a trap!

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:45.085
Attacking without even
checking first.

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:47.654
Tell me how in the world did
you became genin?

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.356
Mitsuki! Just hang in there!

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:52.492
Go! I'm fine!

00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:57.297
Lesson in pain. Coming right
up!

00:14:57.898 --> 00:15:01.602
[grunting]

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:05.138
<i>[grunting]</i>

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:07.140
Shadow Clone...

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:08.609
Boruto, get out of the way!

00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:09.576
Huh?!

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.476
Too slow!

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:12.145
[grunts]

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:14.548

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.886
Well, I didn't know your eyes
had awakened!

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.221
[grunts]

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:25.225
What is this thing?! [yells]

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.960
[grunting]

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.529
[yells]

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:33.834
Even though you may possess the
Sharingan, it seems you're still
no match for me at your level!

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:34.935
Sarada!

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:36.737
[grunting]

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.338
Uh!

00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:39.840
Sarada, come on, don't let her
trick you!

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:42.308
What happened? Did I?

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:43.076
Damn it!

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:44.410
[gasps]

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.513
Sarada! One more time!

00:15:46.547 --> 00:15:48.381
Don't tell me what to do!

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:51.417
[grunting]

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.419
I'm trying, I'm trying.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.722
It's not working. This isn't
good.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:16:02.295
[grunting]

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:04.364
Now do I have your attention?

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:07.367
I'm telling you for the last
time to stop and go home.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.235
[panting]

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:12.606
It's no good. I can't find any
weaknesses.

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:15.275
I can't believe this.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:17.511
Stop feeling sorry for
yourself!

00:16:17.544 --> 00:16:22.148
I don't have an answer. I've
analyzed the situation and
don't see a solution.

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.585
Then just quit trying to
analyze your way out of this.

00:16:24.618 --> 00:16:27.921
Didn't you say you were going
to make a direct appeal, no
matter what happened?!

00:16:27.954 --> 00:16:31.858
Why do you always have to give
me grief about every single
thing I do?

00:16:31.892 --> 00:16:35.061
Seriously? That's usually my
line!

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:37.764
Looks like you're fighting a
losing battle here.

00:16:37.798 --> 00:16:40.000
[gasps] Konohamaru Sensei?

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:43.136
Konohamaru? So this is your
team, huh?!

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.939
Couldn't you just go a
little easier on them, Mirai?

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:47.908
Do you know her? Who is she?

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:52.445
She's the grandchild of the
Third Hokage, and she's also an
expert bodyguard.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:56.149
And on top of all of that, she
happens to be my cousin!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:17:01.221
But anyway, she's not an
opponent for inexperienced
genin to cut their teeth on.

00:17:01.254 --> 00:17:06.660
I hope that's not the best your
team can do. Or you're gonna get
seriously hurt in every mission.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.764
I'm actually doing them a
nice, big favor. Now they'll
know where they stand.

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:14.267
I hate to admit it, but she
just might be right about us.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.170
You're willing to give in that
easily?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:20.774
Mitsuki, what're you thinking
about all this?

00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:23.309
They are too concerned with
fighting effectively.

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:26.580
They don't realize they're
canceling out each other's
strengths.

00:17:26.613 --> 00:17:28.849
Hm. He's exactly right.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:32.185
Canceling each other's
strengths?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:37.658
Boruto, you're too concerned
about Sarada's moves. It's made
you lose your usual spontaneity.

00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:41.862
<i>(Mitsuki) Sarada, you usually</i>
balance your use of shuriken and
<i>taijutsu well.</i>

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:44.665
<i>But I think you're relying too</i>
<i>much on the Sharingan.</i>

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:49.135
We're naturally such opposites
to begin with.

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:53.073
Maybe the problem is we tried to
get in synch too fast without
thinking it through.

00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:56.877
So, what you're saying is, we
should just play this battle
by ear?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.181
Hey Mitsuki! Can you hold up
the bridge just a little
longer?!

00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:03.850
Mhm. But you might want to
hurry.

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:06.252
I'm beginning to lose my
footing.

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:10.323
Well, whatever happens, let's
just make sure we give it all
we've got, okay?

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:10.791
Hmph!

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:13.459
They're still not giving up?

00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:15.596
They may be losing, but I like
their fighting spirit.

00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:17.363
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:22.836
[grunting]

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.372
That wasn't bad.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:27.874
[grunts]

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:29.209
[grunts]

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.881
[grunts]

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:37.150
Hm?

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:41.221
I'll admit you have nice aim.
But it's not good enough yet!

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:43.690
[gasps]

00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:47.460
[grunting]

00:18:47.928 --> 00:18:48.929
Hmph.

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.330
[grunts]

00:18:50.363 --> 00:18:51.264
[gasps]

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.299
Haa!

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.136
Boruto! Keep at it!

00:18:57.771 --> 00:18:58.639
Really?!

00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.306
Huh? Hm!

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.112
[grunts]

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.849
[grunts] Ahh!

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:15.989
[grunting]

00:19:16.022 --> 00:19:19.926
Sarada! Boruto! That was a
brilliant way to play it by
ear.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.365
Keeping your clones hidden until
the very end of the battle.
That's what sealed the victory!

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:26.332
Hmph.

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:37.210
You knew exactly how difficult
it would be for us to submit a
direct appeal...

00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:38.979
and yet you still let us try it.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:43.049
That was actually really mean
of you. Damn it, Konohamaru
Sensei!

00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:47.888
[laughs] It's easy to team up
with the people you get along
with.

00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:52.425
However, true character is
formed by overcoming
confrontation and hardship.

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:54.628
That's makes you worthy of being
a genin.

00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:57.397
Confrontation and hardship
just create detours.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.066
Years ago, Lord Seventh had a
saying.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.539
He would tell us, "There are no
shortcuts to becoming the
Hokage!" So what now?

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.474
[sigh]

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.546
It's your move. Do you still
want to submit that?

00:20:15.616 --> 00:20:18.652
Are you seriously that against
teaming up with me, Sarada?

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:21.421
'Cause I'd be more than happy
to be on your team!

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:23.289
What an interesting way to put
it.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:29.295
The minute you become a burden
to us, this team is disbanded!

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.463
Hmm.

00:20:32.032 --> 00:20:35.368
Well then, I guess you've made
up your mind. The direct
appeal is unnecessary.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:40.440
Not quite. I'm still going.
I'd like to make a request to
Lord Seventh!

00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:41.675
Huh?

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:49.415
[panting]

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:57.190
We don't know exactly when,
but the Hidden Leaf may be
attacked again.

00:20:57.223 --> 00:21:01.394
You'll need to focus. To
protect the village with all
you've got!

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.764
<i>(Sarada) Lord Seventh!</i>

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:07.500
How are you here? This area
should be off‐limits!

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:09.335
What happened to Mirai?!

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:11.605
We came to give you a direct
appeal.

00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:16.042
What?! No way! Are you here
because you want to change
teams?

00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:16.910
<i>(Sarada) No!</i>

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:17.944
Well, what is it then?

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:22.583
I only ask that you please
give us the number 7 for our
team!

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:25.051
I don't really care what number
we wind up with.

00:21:25.085 --> 00:21:28.221
But I guess it's true that one
could be pretty fun.

00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:30.156
I agree and second their
request!

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.060
We'll inherit Team 7's name,
and then we'll out shine them!

00:21:38.498 --> 00:21:43.637
[chuckles] All right, then this
is officially the birth of the
new Team 7!

00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:45.806
Yes, sir!

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.343
<i>You were all such a handful.</i>

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:56.416
But I'm confident you'll be able
<i>to overcome every struggle you</i>
<i>will eventually face.</i>

00:21:56.449 --> 00:22:00.721
<i>You were my students and I'll</i>
<i>always believe in you.</i>

00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:09.663
Hey! When is someone gonna
come back here and let me
down?!

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:49.029
<i>(Orochimaru) I am Orochimaru,</i>
<i>and I am your parent.</i>

00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:50.130
<i>(Mitsuki) You're my parent?</i>

00:23:51.932 --> 00:23:53.466
(Orochimaru) Which is the reason
<i>that you're very special to</i>
<i>me...</i>

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:56.302
<i>and why it's important we</i>
<i>retrieve your memory.</i>

00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:58.004
(Mitsuki) How are we going to do
<i>that?</i>

00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:02.208
(Orochimaru) Since you are just
<i>a child, you should listen</i>
<i>obediently to me.</i>

00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:07.480
<i>(Mitsuki) Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations: The</i>
<i>Path Lit by the Full Moon.</i>

00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:11.852
<i>Who am I? That is all I wanna</i>
<i>know.</i>
