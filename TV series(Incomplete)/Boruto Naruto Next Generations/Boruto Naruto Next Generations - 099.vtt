WEBVTT

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.143
(snarling)

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.018
He's the monster I
ran into before...

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.357
(angrily yells)

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.298
This is bad.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.267
If he lands even
one of those hits,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.068
it could be enough to kill us.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.272
We have to notify Konohamaru
Sensei right away!

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.806
(chuckles)

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.276
I'm gonna kill you both now!

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.645
(chuckles)

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.446
I'm gonna get you first!

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.481
Oh no!

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.020
I'm gonna get you first!

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.055
Big bro!

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.057
Damn it, I told you to contact
me

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.292
if you encountered trouble!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.734
Boruto!

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:48.936
That was a close call.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.571
Thank you, Mitsuki!

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.973
(Jugo roars)

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.677
I'm really gonna
enjoy killing you!

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.580
It looks like we're
hardly having any effect.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:00.581
This is bad...

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.783
Full Curse Mark Transformation.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.551
Curse Mark Transformation?

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:07.721
Right now, he's being controlled
by homicidal impulses.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.424
But in any event, we're too
close to the village here.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.759
C'mon, we're going to
have to draw him away!

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.464
(grunts)

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.633
(chuckles)

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.970
(roars)

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.007
(yells)

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.493
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.601
Did that work?

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.272
(yells)

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.042
Are you okay, Sarada?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.210
Yeah, thanks!

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.479
But his strength is no joke.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:08.582
Damn it!

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.583
Hold on!

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.984
You guys provide backup.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:18.458
(laughs)

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:19.493
No!

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:25.465
(laughs)

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.767
It's all over for you!

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.437
He's... absorbing my chakra!

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:33.574
No way!

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.608
Stay back!

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:41.748
I'll protect them,
no matter what!

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.289
(yells)

00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:50.324
Rasengan!

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.167
(pants)

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.972
Sensei!

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:17.117
(sighs)

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.790
This is our chance to stop him!

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:24.791
No, Boruto.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.026
Come back!

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:27.961
Sarada!

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:28.996
Yes, sir.

00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:32.499
(groans)

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.068
(pants)

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:37.137
No, please, just
stay away from me!

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.274
Boruto!

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.910
You know that we're not
authorized to fight him, right?

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.845
Come on, it isn't
time to bring that up.

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:48.048
If we ignore this, then more
people are just gonna get hurt!

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.083
And besides, if Jugo
is injured right now,

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:52.986
we may be able to
actually stop him.

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.124
I'm not letting you get away!

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.162
(gasps)

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:11.972
There!

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.881
His body is going
back to normal now.

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:23.884
It appears that the
Curse Mark has subsided.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:26.453
But we can't let our
guard down just yet.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:32.759
Wow, it's actually really
quiet and peaceful out here.

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:35.996
I wonder why he came
to this place...

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:37.664
Big brother!

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:41.001
(groans)

00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:50.611
There has to be a
reason behind all this.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:00.954
So what are you doing now?

00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:02.789
I want to compare
Jugo's affliction

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:04.791
with what's making
the birds rampage

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:06.660
and discover if
it's the same thing.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.397
Still, to find the
natural habitat

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.467
of the Wild Leaf Goose
here, of all places...

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.768
The Wild Leaf Goose?

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.571
It's a rare bird that's in
danger of going extinct.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:21.008
I've never seen this many
together in one place before!

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:24.611
(grunts)

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:29.249
(Tosaka exclaims)

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.451
So are you still
looking to fight us?

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.491
(bird caws)

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:41.128
No, stop!

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:50.270
Hey, what are you
doing to that bird?

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.741
Its Curse Mark disappeared!

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:55.909
What's going on?

00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:57.744
Aren't you the one
who's been spreading

00:07:57.778 --> 00:07:59.580
the Curse Mark to all the birds?

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:00.914
(pants)

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:03.717
Mr. Jugo, answer me!

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.254
I've got nothing at all to say
to anybody who kills birds.

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:09.122
What are you talking about?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.798
Hold on, that's...

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.032
Your kunai.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.975
That's 'cause...

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:31.912
(huffs)

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:33.947
Hey, wait!

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:35.916
[Sumire] Konohamaru Sensei!

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.784
(grunts)

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:39.019
Big brother!

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:49.930
(grunts)

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:52.399
What happened to all
of you out there?

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:56.136
It appears that your jonin
has become terribly exhausted!

00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:57.871
You see...

00:08:57.905 --> 00:08:59.406
It was nothing at all.

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:02.109
I'm really sorry if we
caused you to worry.

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:04.878
Oh yes, I see.

00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:06.313
That's good to hear.

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.755
Why didn't you tell
him what's going on?

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:16.557
I just don't wanna
make him worry,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.026
especially not before
we know all the facts.

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:24.598
It appears to me that his chakra

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.600
was extracted during the battle.

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.035
Are you gonna be okay, then?

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.038
I should recover after four
or five days of resting.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.240
Sorry, not great timing, is it?

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:35.909
(chuckles) Don't
sweat it, we're on it.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:37.544
But still, couldn't
you have been infected

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:40.214
with the Curse Mark when you
were fighting against Jugo?

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.082
I mean, I thought the whole
idea was that the birds

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:44.551
get the Curse Mark
through their injuries.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:47.955
Mr. Tosaka, you were examining
Jugo earlier, weren't you?

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:49.089
Did you find out anything?

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:51.058
I doubt we need
to worry about him

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.926
being infected with
the Curse Mark.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.494
What do you mean?

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:57.331
Well, you see...

00:09:57.364 --> 00:10:00.133
Earlier, I was able to take
a sample of Jugo's blood.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.603
And then I compared
it with blood

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:04.238
taken from the infected birds.

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.073
And it appears that
the two Curse Marks

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.975
have a different
genetic make-up.

00:10:09.243 --> 00:10:11.945
Which means the birds' Curse
Mark didn't come from Jugo,

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:13.280
is that what you're saying?

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.583
Well, I have to say that
I'm not a Curse Mark expert,

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.051
so I can't be entirely sure.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.920
But regardless of the
Curse Mark's source,

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.723
it's gonna be bad if
Jugo goes berserk again.

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:25.459
Do you think it's okay to
leave him alone, Sensei?

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.427
Uh, about that...

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:29.796
(groans)

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.964
Tell me, Mitsuki.

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.900
Do you know what
this device might be?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:35.435
I found it on the
ground near Jugo before.

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:38.805
It looks like it was made

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:40.908
at Orochimaru's
research facility.

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:43.577
Although, I'm not exactly
sure what it does.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.078
It's a tranquilizer.

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.880
And it's a very strong one, too.

00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:48.916
You licked that
thing, didn't you?

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:51.218
I think it's medicine
to temporarily suppress

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:52.986
the Curse Mark's power.

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.924
Okay, here's what we'll do now.

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.926
Team 15 will return
to the village.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.762
Report on the situation
and request backup.

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:02.963
[Team 15] Yes, sir.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.933
Team 7 will stay and
keep an eye on Jugo.

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:07.901
Also, there may be more
of those tranquilizers

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:09.903
that suppress the Curse Mark.

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:12.039
If you have a chance,
get ahold of them.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.607
Understood.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.042
Don't take any chances.

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:17.211
And avoid combat at all costs.

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.446
We still don't know just
what Jugo's been up to

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:20.881
out there in the forest.

00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.749
So we'll do our
best to find out.

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:30.290
So what do you think he's doing?

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:32.659
(bird caws)

00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:37.764
You think... that it
could be connected

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:39.933
with the Curse
Mark on the birds?

00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:42.269
(grunts)

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:52.913
I can't believe it!

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:53.747
That's incredible!

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.119
There you go.

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:11.665
(both gasp)

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:15.035
Are you okay?

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.470
Can you hear us, Jugo?

00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:19.072
Are you actually able to extract

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:21.608
the Curse Mark from those birds?

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:23.877
(heavy breathing)

00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:25.946
He's enduring so much pain.

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:28.282
The love he has for
them must run deep!

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:33.921
(Jugo grunts)

00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:36.590
This is beginning
to look very bad...

00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:37.758
What do you mean by that?

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:41.628
Jugo's body isn't
able to fully control

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:42.896
the Curse Mark's power.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.398
That's horrible!

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.267
He can't suppress the power
of the birds' Curse Mark.

00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:50.003
And it's running rampant
inside of his body.

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.411
(heavy breathing)

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:00.147
I'm really sorry we didn't
trust you, Mr. Jugo.

00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:02.482
Leave now.

00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:06.987
(heavy breathing)

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.460
This is the place from before...

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.434
Don't, Boruto.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.635
But why not?

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:23.871
(Jugo groans)

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.906
Mr. Jugo, I don't understand.

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:27.908
Why won't you let us help you?

00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.743
We want the same things, right?

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.044
Just go!

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:33.146
Get away from here!

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:33.947
Now!

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.916
No way, we can't just leave you

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:36.884
when you're in that condition!

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:39.620
This doesn't... concern you.

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:41.889
C'mon, please, just let us-

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:44.925
[Jugo] I don't want
to hurt anyone!

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.593
Hey, you sure you're all right?

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:48.061
(loud boom)

00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:49.463
(Jugo laughs)

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.031
I'll kill you!

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:54.935
I'll slaughter you, all of you!

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:56.904
It's made so he's trapped
once he's undergone

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:59.239
Curse Mark transformation.

00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:00.040
(laughs)

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:01.275
Come over here!

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:03.043
(growls)

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:05.913
Jugo sure seems like he's
in a lot of pain now.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.648
(snarling)

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:15.989
(heavy breathing)

00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:19.092
I told you to leave.

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:21.662
You have medicine to
suppress the Curse Mark.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.233
If the time between your
homicidal episodes decreases,

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:28.902
if worse comes to
worst, we should be able

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:30.771
to use the medicine on
you ourselves, right?

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:32.005
No, you can't.

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.974
Just leave me alone.

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:35.909
Yeah, fine.

00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:37.778
All right, just suit yourself.

00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:39.179
Boruto!

00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:43.016
If that's the case, then we'll
just do whatever we want!

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:48.589
Even if you say not to,
we're still gonna help you

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:49.723
to save the birds.

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:52.092
And we'll stop you when
you get outta control, too.

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:53.460
That's our mission.

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:57.164
Suit yourself.

00:14:58.098 --> 00:14:59.800
We'll pay you back double

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:02.002
for doubting you
in the first place.

00:15:09.977 --> 00:15:12.513
(bird caws)

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:22.256
Wait, why'd you bother to
check that bird just now?

00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:24.691
It wasn't even acting
strange or anything.

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:29.263
Hey!

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:31.498
Please, come on,
don't ignore us!

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.935
I was checking for a Curse Mark.

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:36.570
You mean you can
really tell whether one

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.939
has a Curse Mark or
not just by looking?

00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:41.108
You can tell by their eyes.

00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:43.911
If they're red, they
have a Curse Mark.

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.780
Seriously, you can
tell just from that?

00:15:46.813 --> 00:15:49.082
It could be in its
incubation period.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:50.651
Incubation period?

00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:51.718
Yes, that's right.

00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:54.121
It's the time between
when the infection starts

00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:56.423
and the symptoms
begin to appear.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.126
Actually, it's possible
that this unknown Curse Mark

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:01.461
displays the same
property as well.

00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:03.597
So, if we simply look
for red-eyed birds,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.466
maybe we can capture them
before they go into a frenzy.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.668
Is that correct?

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:11.171
And if so, then they can be
saved without injuring them.

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:15.342
(smirks)

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:20.247
You're an expert on birds,
isn't that right, Mr. Tosaka?

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.449
Have you been able to
find any clues so far

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:25.786
about what could be causing
the Curse Mark in these birds?

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.020
The cause, huh?

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:31.758
Well, you know, only
Wild Leaf Geese live here

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:33.794
because this species of birds

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.797
has a strong
territorial instinct.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.299
I think that provides
a strong clue.

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:40.934
You're saying that
Wild Leaf Geese

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:42.736
have distinct
habitats, is that it?

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:45.739
By investigating where the
infected birds came from,

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:48.275
we may be able to
learn the cause.

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:50.444
Leave it to the expert, I guess!

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:53.780
I want to do my very best
to save the birds, too.

00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:55.082
All right.

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:57.484
You can just leave it to
me to discover the source!

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.660
What are you doing here?

00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:11.198
(gasps)

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.567
Based on that headband of yours,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.436
I'm guessing that you're
Hidden Leaf shinobi.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.771
That's right, we are.

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:19.740
This is Land of
Rivers territory.

00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:22.609
Shinobi from other villages
are forbidden to enter.

00:17:23.777 --> 00:17:26.280
We're very sorry, we didn't
realize where we were.

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:28.549
Yeah, we were just asked
to come to this area

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:31.451
on a mission to study
the birds that live here.

00:17:31.485 --> 00:17:32.452
What?

00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:33.387
You guys were too?

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.822
You mean the Land of
Rivers was also...?

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:37.024
That's right.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.426
We don't know why, but
the number of incidents

00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:42.629
of birds going wild has
been on the rise lately.

00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:43.830
You three.

00:17:43.864 --> 00:17:45.832
If you have any
information about it,

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:47.634
will you please
share it with us?

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:51.305
Information, huh?

00:17:52.773 --> 00:17:54.775
Well, we just started
investigating,

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:56.910
so don't have
anything to share yet.

00:17:56.944 --> 00:17:58.445
I see.

00:17:58.478 --> 00:17:59.446
All right, then.

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:02.683
If you learn anything,
please just let us know.

00:18:08.622 --> 00:18:11.091
Why didn't you tell
those Land of Rivers guys

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:12.092
about me before?

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:14.127
I don't know.

00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:16.296
Well, anyway, we
can't save the birds

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.498
if you aren't around
to help them out.

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:22.469
Come on, let's
just keep on going!

00:18:31.512 --> 00:18:33.780
(groans)

00:18:33.814 --> 00:18:34.615
Mr. Jugo!

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:37.985
Get away!

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.787
Hurry!

00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:41.922
Get far away from me!

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:43.156
Run!

00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:44.758
Wait, come back!

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.993
Mr. Jugo!

00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:51.498
(labored breathing)

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:52.499
Mr. Jugo!

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:53.667
The tranquilizers!

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:56.670
(groaning)

00:19:07.514 --> 00:19:08.649
Oh, this is bad.

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.450
What do we do?

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:12.419
We've gotta stop him,
it's the only way.

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:14.955
But right now, Jugo's
too dangerous for us!

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.924
(groaning)

00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:19.159
Yeah, but still... we have to!

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:25.499
(yells)

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:33.140
Let's get into the cave!

00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:52.993
I can't allow you
to stay with me.

00:19:56.797 --> 00:19:58.298
But, Mr. Jugo...

00:19:58.332 --> 00:19:59.800
Didn't I already tell you?

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:01.468
We're gonna do whatever we want!

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:04.605
And all we wanna do
is help you, Mr. Jugo.

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:05.939
You can't.

00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:07.241
Just go.

00:20:07.274 --> 00:20:09.643
Look, we're not able
to save the birds.

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:12.079
But you can help them!

00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:14.781
Besides, if the Curse Mark
takes control of you again,

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:16.650
who's gonna be there
to help the birds

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:18.652
if there's no one to help you?

00:20:22.823 --> 00:20:24.291
Listen, don't worry!

00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:26.793
It's gonna be easy, no
matter how many times

00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:28.295
you go into a rampage.

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:33.333
Boruto...

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:35.135
I'm counting on you.

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:38.338
Just leave it to me, ya know?

00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:46.079
It looks like we're
gonna reach the village

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:47.781
by the end of the day.

00:20:47.814 --> 00:20:49.349
I think you're right, let's
hurry!

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:52.019
(exclaims)

00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:55.088
What have we here?

00:20:55.122 --> 00:20:58.759
What are shinobi doing
in a place like this?

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:00.661
What village are you guys from?

00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:06.934
It's proper manners to
introduce yourself first.

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:09.403
Careful, she blocked
your attack, big brother.

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:12.072
You're right, that
means she's pretty good.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:15.642
I'm just dying to test
your skills against mine!

00:21:17.978 --> 00:21:19.746
(giggles)

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.747
What are those?

00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:21.982
What are they doing?!

00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:23.650
All right.

00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:26.620
Now, it's time for me
to have a little fun!

00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:28.322
(giggles)

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.732
Didn't find any leads, huh?

00:21:38.765 --> 00:21:42.236
I checked everything that I
could think of, but still...

00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:45.405
Do you know of any
other times in the past

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:47.908
when a Curse Mark has
spread as widely as this?

00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:49.710
I've never heard of
anything like this.

00:21:49.743 --> 00:21:51.912
I tried investigating the
cause in the beginning

00:21:51.945 --> 00:21:53.313
but also found nothing.

00:21:53.347 --> 00:21:56.683
I wonder... if this means
something unusual's going on.

00:22:02.289 --> 00:22:04.758
The target has been confirmed.

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:06.660
I'll continue to
observe for now.

00:23:44.124 --> 00:23:46.426
[Boruto] I heard that
goose lost the genes

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.128
that gave him the ability to
fly.

00:23:48.161 --> 00:23:51.265
Doesn't it really all depend
on how hard he tries to fly?

00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:52.799
[Jugo] There are some things

00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:53.934
that effort alone can't
accomplish.

00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:55.569
Some paths are
simply predestined.

00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:58.071
Like it is for me, because
of this Curse Mark.

00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.240
But it's different
for the birds.

00:24:00.274 --> 00:24:03.110
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:03.143 --> 00:24:04.912
"The Predestined Path".

00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:06.813
[Jugo] The birds have a future.

00:24:06.847 --> 00:24:08.615
I'll make sure of
that by saving them.
