WEBVTT

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.347
[Boruto] There aren't
enough Great Stone Faces!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.683
Dad is missing, as so
are Old man Kakashi

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.318
and Granny Tsunade's!

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:23.457
And also

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.493
The New City is gone

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:29.830
and the rest of the village
looks different, too!

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.699
Before we entered
that weird dimension,

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.168
he told us...

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.705
Anyway, I'm off to harvest
the Fox's Chakra now.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.942
(hums grimly)

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.477
(hums questioningly)

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.948
(Opening Theme Music)

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.318
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:18.438
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.283
Thought so.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:32.553
(hums questioningly)

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.354
Warning, warning.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.190
We have deviated a great amount

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.959
from our target
Temporal Transfer.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.561
(yelps) It talked!

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:43.497
We did not arrive
at the targeted

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.799
Temporal Transfer
coordinates set by

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.001
Master Urashiki Otsutsuki.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.471
You said Temporal
Transfer, right?

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:54.408
This village is the
Leaf in the past, then?

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:56.810
It's the past?

00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:58.045
Correct.

00:02:58.078 --> 00:03:00.047
Around the time that
the Fifth Hokage,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.649
Tsunade, came into power.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.017
Wait, the Fifth?

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.221
[Boruto] Wait, are you serious?

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.056
[Karasuki] Yes, I'm serious.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.592
[Sasuke] Where's Urashiki?

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.328
You said we deviated from
the target coordinates.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.930
Are we in a different
time than him?

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:20.501
Master Urashiki set the
Temporal Transfer target

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:24.171
to when Naruto Uzumaki
was just a young child.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.441
However, due to a malfunction
in the Transfer Space,

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:29.810
we've arrived at a
slightly earlier period

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:32.746
than what was
originally plotted.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.817
Additionally, I calculate that
Master Urashiki Otsutsuki,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.318
who was separated from us,

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:40.420
will arrive a few days from now.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.790
In just a few days, huh?

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.092
I knew it.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.693
Urashiki really
was after Naruto.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:47.728
Huh?

00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:51.465
To harvest the Fox's chakra.

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.501
Which means that he
planned to come to the past

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:57.437
to drain chakra from a
young and weak Naruto.

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.439
(grunts in surprise)

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:02.042
Fortunately, we
managed to arrive here

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.410
before he did.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.014
Going after Dad as
a kid isn't fair!

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:09.683
Anyway, we have to find my Dad

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:11.051
before Urashiki can get to him

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.819
and make sure we keep him safe,

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.421
isn't that right?

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.056
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.458
Now then, please
allow me to advise you

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.694
on a few precautions
that you must follow

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:21.962
as people from the future

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.364
while you're here in the past.

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:26.967
Seriously, who the
hell are you, anyway?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.336
Aren't you part of
Urashiki's gang?

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.538
I'm Karasuki, the Noble Device

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:33.173
for Temporal Transfers.

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:35.175
The concept of being
part of a "gang"

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:36.944
is meaningless to me.

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:40.047
Therefore, I have no
loyalty to Urashiki.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.750
My duty is to carry out
Temporal Transfers as requested,

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:47.321
and to relate any necessary
precautionary measures.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.089
It's hard to
understand you when you

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.358
talk all formal
like that, turtle.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.927
What "precautionary measures?"

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.463
First of all, while
you're here in the past,

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.198
if you encounter
people that you have

00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:01.201
a deep connection
with, the best practice

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:03.070
is to try your
hardest to make sure

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:06.073
they don't discover
you're from the future.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:07.908
If they find out
our real identity

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.676
and interfere, what'll happen?

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.311
Then you may very well end up

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:13.080
influencing the future in ways

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:16.083
you didn't intend
or can't anticipate.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:19.086
In the worst case situation,
a single action of yours

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.221
could alter the future entirely.

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:24.825
So I advise you to act
with extreme caution.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:26.593
Oh, wow.

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.328
[Karasuki] As you
proceed, remember that

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:30.364
you could cause a
person or object

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:33.433
that should exist in the
future to cease being.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.470
(hums grimly)

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.306
Well, this all sounds
like a piece of cake!

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:43.076
I'm kinda getting
pumped up, here!

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.413
I mean, we're in the Leaf
village before I was born!

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.149
(wind blowing)

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:55.789
I really don't understand
your taste in clothes, Sasuke.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.090
[Sasuke] Get over it.

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:59.326
You're not supposed to
exist in this world.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.429
It'll be bad if someone
sees you wearing a headband.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:04.831
(sighs in annoyance)

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.800
All right, I get it.

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:08.202
Where's Karasuki?

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.671
Since he doesn't have
enough chakra right now,

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.172
he went inside his shell.

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.708
So I went ahead and
tucked him into my pouch.

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.010
I see.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.681
Amazing!

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.154
This is like a completely
different village!

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.457
Hey, let's go to Thunder Burger!

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.660
I want to see what their
burgers are like in this time!

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:35.429
Too bad it doesn't exist.

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:36.430
What?

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:37.431
No Thunder Burger?

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:38.465
(grunts in surprise)

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.670
(footsteps tapping)

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.944
Who would've thought
Ichiraku was so tiny?

00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:51.945
(laughs) Wow!

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.181
Seriously, it's so small!

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:55.649
I can't believe it!

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.284
That's what it was like?

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:59.186
(chuckles)

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.655
Hey, quiet down, Boruto.

00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:03.657
Sorry, it's just weird!

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.192
(sighs)

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.827
Look, never mind that.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.463
Let's just find Naruto
as soon as we can.

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:13.033
Our goal is to protect Naruto
from Urashiki, remember?

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:17.171
Where do you think Dad could be?

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.339
Do you have any idea, Sasuke?

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:22.042
Back in this time, he
would either be at home

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:25.279
or Ichiraku, and we just
saw that he's not there.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.649
(grunts in surprise)

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:29.816
Hey, look.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.151
Isn't that...

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:34.188
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:35.923
Sakura. This is not good.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:36.924
Uh, excuse me!

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.292
Can I ask you something?

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.327
(Boruto yelps)

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.529
What do you think you're doing?

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:43.530
(gasps)

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:44.665
What's wrong?

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:46.934
I mean, wouldn't Sakura
know where Dad is right now?

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.069
Karasuki told us that
we need to be cautious

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:50.404
while we're here.

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:51.438
Yeah, but...

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.774
Excuse me, did you
have a question?

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:54.808
(both grunt in surprise)

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:56.076
Uh, no, uh-

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.679
It was nothing, just
a mistake on our part.

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:04.718
(hums in confusion)

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.588
There are too many people
we know here in the village.

00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:10.557
You've gotta think before
you act from now on, got it?

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:12.492
Yeah, okay, but Sasuke,

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:14.628
if we're supposed to be
here to protect my Dad

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.231
as a kid from Urashiki,
then sooner or later,

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:19.833
we're gonna have to
meet him, aren't we?

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.602
It's a pain, but
once we find Naruto,

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.904
we'll keep an eye on
him from a distance

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.339
'til we need to act.

00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:28.308
What? We came all the way to
the Leaf Village in the past,

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.612
but we have to sneak
around and stay hidden?

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:34.181
If there's any chance that
we might alter the future,

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:36.016
we have to be very careful.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:37.651
(groans in annoyance)

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:38.685
So boring.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.922
(impact landing)

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:43.090
(body thudding)

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:45.926
[Boruto And Naruto] Ow!

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.428
Damn it, watch where
you're going, you know!

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:49.396
[Naruto] What?

00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:51.365
I oughta be the one
saying that, you know!

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.800
Don't stand around if you
aren't paying attention

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.235
to what's going on!

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.770
Seriously?

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:58.505
What's your deal?

00:08:58.539 --> 00:08:59.506
(groans)

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.774
(gasps)

00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:03.043
(groans)

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:06.547
Dad?

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.581
Huh?

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.823
"Dad?"

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:18.825
What are you even
talking about, kid?

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.060
Damn it!

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.329
[Jiraiya] Naruto!

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:24.431
Just forget him!

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:25.566
Come on, let's go!

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.935
They're right on our tail!

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:29.169
It's him!

00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:30.938
The guy from the photo!

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:34.408
-Dad's master!
-(screaming)

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.542
Oh, yeah, right!

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:36.510
I almost forgot!

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:38.946
But this entire thing is
completely your fault,

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:40.180
Pervy Sage!

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:42.950
Someone's after you?

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:44.218
Yeah, that's right!

00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.687
Then just leave it to us!

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.055
Are you sure?

00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:50.257
Huh?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.594
Thanks, we'll leave
it to you! (chuckles)

00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:57.331
You're not getting
away, you peeping toms!

00:09:58.465 --> 00:09:59.466
Huh?

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.268
Peeping what?

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:02.069
That idiot!

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.203
Hey, just hold on!

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:05.072
You're making a
big mistake, here!

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.474
The culprits are an
adult male and a child.

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:09.810
And besides, what's that
you're holding in your hand?

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:11.545
(yelps)

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.580
Why that old geezer!

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:17.084
Ah, good.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.819
I think we gave them the slip.

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:20.220
Man, you're such a perv.

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:22.956
Always sneaking a
peek, Pervy Sage!

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.092
Hey, this is just
research so I can

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.094
write an accurate
novel, that's all!

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.629
Yeah, right, whatever.

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:31.431
I'm sick and tired of being
punished by Granny Tsunade

00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:32.833
because of you!

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.668
Fine then, let's just go.

00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:35.936
Onto the next peep-

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.305
I mean, the next place
to do some research!

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:41.942
(both grunting in surprise)

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.077
(both groaning)

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.813
And what exactly are
the two of you up to?

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:47.814
(fist smacking)

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:50.817
(both groaning anxiously)

00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.086
(impacts landing)

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.223
[Naruto And Jiraiya] We're
really, really sorry.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:58.959
We're begging you, Lady Tsunade,

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.828
please be kind
enough to forgive us!

00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:04.698
Well that takes care
of you two idiots.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:06.433
Now, you two...

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:07.367
Wait, just hold up!

00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:08.936
We're not peeping
toms, I promise!

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:11.939
After talking to these
two, I already know that.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.073
My name's Tsunade.

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:14.675
I'm the Fifth Hokage.

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:15.776
(inhales sharply)

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:17.344
And I don't recognize
the two of you.

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.413
What business do you have here?

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:20.414
(gulps nervously)

00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:22.049
We're performers.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.952
We go from village to village

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:26.954
and we provide entertainment.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.088
Oh, yeah?

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:30.290
Traveling performers.

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:31.091
Huh?

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:35.095
(all humming in confusion)

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:37.965
-(snaps fingers)
-(ball popping)

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:39.499
(all gasping in awe)

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.935
We aren't shinobi,
but nonetheless,

00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:44.805
we do use just a little
ninjutsu in our act.

00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:47.074
(hums affirmatively)

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.209
Ninjutsu, huh?

00:11:49.243 --> 00:11:52.045
Something's not quite
right here, you know?

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:54.381
(hums thoughtfully)

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.817
Do the two of you know
anything about the incident

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.552
that occurred here yesterday?

00:11:58.585 --> 00:11:59.553
Huh?

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.955
No, we don't know anything.

00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:05.592
You see, a genin
deserted the village.

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:09.429
A genin deserted?

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:10.497
That's right.

00:12:10.531 --> 00:12:12.966
And that's why the
village is currently under

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.434
an emergency alert.

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:19.673
I don't expect you to understand

00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:21.341
the ins and outs of all this,

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:23.343
but with the village
in this situation,

00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:25.546
you'll have to be
monitored for a while.

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.547
What?

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.447
Seriously?

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:29.550
I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid that we can't

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:31.485
trust you two just yet.

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:35.088
The same as anyone with even a
hint of suspicion about them.

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:38.559
That said, we can still
be easygoing about it.

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:40.961
Understood?

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:42.829
Yeah, understood.

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:44.965
And that means, Jiraiya, Naruto,

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:46.333
I leave them to you.

00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:48.669
[Both] Huh?

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:49.803
Got a complaint?

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:51.338
You bet I do, you know!

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.208
Yeah! I can understand giving an
assignment like this to Naruto,

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.543
but why do I have to do it, too?

00:12:56.577 --> 00:12:57.711
Besides, I'm busy!

00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:59.613
I wouldn't mind if they were
pretty girls or something,

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:02.082
but keeping an eye on
this runty little brat

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.951
and his weird-looking
youngster friend?

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.552
(huffs in annoyance)

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:06.553
(grunts in surprise)

00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:07.688
Hey, mister!

00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:09.089
Yeah, what?

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.824
(smoke puffing)

00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:12.593
Does this change your mind?

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:16.964
(screams joyously)

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.332
Yeah, okay!

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.936
(chuckles lasciviously)

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.439
That kid's just showing off now!

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:29.309
You can use
Transformation Jutsu, too?

00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:31.812
Uh, just a little.

00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:33.080
Traveling performers have to

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:35.048
keep people
entertained, you know?

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:36.817
(sighs in exasperation)

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.685
Anyway, it's in your hands now.

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:39.720
Hey, hold on!

00:13:39.753 --> 00:13:41.822
If I have to keep
on eye on them,

00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:43.223
then what'll happen
to my training?

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:45.959
Look, we can train any
time, so just bear with it!

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:47.694
It's only for a
little while, right?

00:13:47.728 --> 00:13:48.862
Yeah, but-

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:50.497
Can't you just do what
you're told, Naruto?

00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:52.833
When I was your age,
I was way better

00:13:52.866 --> 00:13:54.101
at obeying orders, you brat!

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:55.469
Yeah, right!
Whatever, old man!

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:58.405
I wish I could see how
you really were back then!

00:13:58.438 --> 00:13:59.740
Oh, just shut up!

00:13:59.773 --> 00:14:02.609
I swear I heard something just
like that before you know?

00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:05.445
[Naruto] I'm tired of
listening to you all the time!

00:14:06.713 --> 00:14:08.215
(Boruto chuckles)

00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:10.817
Boy, that sure was
nerve-wracking.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:11.952
Damn it!

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:14.087
Thanks to you two, I
got more work to do!

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.088
What did you say?

00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:17.558
Look, in the first place, Dad-

00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:18.825
(hums in confusion)

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:20.694
I mean, you guys
were being stupid!

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:22.095
That's why all this happened!

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:24.565
I told you, that
wasn't my fault!

00:14:24.598 --> 00:14:26.700
It was all Pervy Sage's-

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.602
Hold on, where'd Pervy Sage go?

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:31.205
[Jiraiya] Then how about
we get some tea, huh?

00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:32.539
-(hand slapping)
-(grunts in pain)

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:33.507
Is that a no?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.809
Is he really one of
the Legendary Sannin?

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:37.344
Do we have the right guy?

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:40.180
Yeah, I'm sure that
he is, I think.

00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.082
(sighs)

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:44.184
Man, he just never learns.

00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:46.587
Why don't you just give it up?

00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:49.089
Just be quiet, would you?

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:51.558
Like I said, this is
really important research

00:14:51.592 --> 00:14:53.093
that I'm doing here.

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:54.228
Okay, never mind!

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.563
Just train me
already, all right?

00:14:56.597 --> 00:14:57.698
You want to train?

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:58.699
All right, fine.

00:14:58.732 --> 00:14:59.700
What?

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:00.734
Really?

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:04.204
Keep an eye on these two guys

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.540
and make sure they don't
try anything funny.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.275
That's your training, 'kay?

00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:09.610
Huh?

00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:11.945
You were gonna dump
them on me all along!

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:14.214
Quiet! Just hurry up
and do as I say!

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:16.416
I'm busy, you hear me?

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.217
Hey!

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:18.819
You can't just take off!

00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:20.354
Where are you going, you know?

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:23.724
I guess in the end, the
guy's just an old perv.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.494
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:30.497
Can't believe I gotta
keep an eye on these guys.

00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.833
Guess this all sort
of turned out okay.

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:35.035
We get to stay close to him now!

00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:37.671
(grunts in surprise)

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:38.705
Hey, come on!

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.276
(hums questioningly)

00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:43.310
Hey, Sakura!

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:46.213
[Sasuke] I've gotta
keep my distance.

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:49.550
Oh, but there's no need to
stay hidden anymore, right?

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:51.952
Sakura and I are too close.

00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:54.221
If we get involved with
more people we know,

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:56.690
then we could affect the future.

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:59.092
Okay, but, uh...

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:01.361
Don't leave Naruto's
side even for a moment.

00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:05.332
I'll keep watching, but I'll
be doing so from a distance.

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:08.068
(sighs)

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:11.038
Lady Tsunade filled
me in, but are they-

00:16:11.705 --> 00:16:12.673
Hey, wait!

00:16:12.706 --> 00:16:14.541
You're the one from before!

00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:16.076
(hums questioningly)

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:18.679
Are you saying that
you know this guy?

00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:19.847
Sorry about earlier.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.416
I just mistook you for
someone else, you know?

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:23.450
You know?

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:25.686
(laughs)

00:16:25.719 --> 00:16:27.421
Wow, you sound just like Naruto!

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.222
[Both] Huh?

00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:30.090
We're nothing alike, you know!

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:32.492
Yeah, I can tell you're
totally different.

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:35.429
[Both] No way, we're
not alike, you know!

00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:36.530
(laughs)

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:38.365
All right, can you stop
joking around now, Sakura?

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:41.101
Come on, I should be the
one saying that, you know,

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:42.803
you peeping ninja.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.271
Peeping ninja?

00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:45.205
Did you-

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:47.808
Uh, it's nothing,
really, I swear!

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.209
(growls angrily)

00:16:49.243 --> 00:16:55.749
[Boruto] Wow, Sakura as a kid is
almost exactly like Sarada.

00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:58.719
Listen up, you gotta stop
blabbing about everything!

00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:01.622
Hey, what happened
to the other guy?

00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:04.691
I heard there were two people
you were keeping an eye on.

00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:05.826
Huh?

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.095
Oh no, where'd
that other guy go?

00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:11.298
Oh, uh, he just had
something else to do.

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:12.099
Oh, come on!

00:17:12.132 --> 00:17:13.834
Give me a break here, will ya?

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.335
I'm the one who's
gonna get punished!

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.804
We gotta go and
find him right away!

00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:19.940
Don't worry, it'll be just fine.

00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:22.543
He isn't gonna go
too far, trust me.

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:23.610
(groans in distress)

00:17:23.644 --> 00:17:26.346
How am I gonna explain
this to Granny Tsunade?

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.549
Can you handle monitoring them?

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:29.950
Are you sure about this?

00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:31.952
I'll be just fine, really!

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:34.488
Watching a brat like him
will be a piece of cake!

00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:36.823
Brat? Speak for
yourself, all right?

00:17:36.857 --> 00:17:38.091
What?

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:39.826
You two really are alike.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.696
[Both] I told you, we're
not alike, you know!

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:43.830
Yep.

00:17:43.864 --> 00:17:45.699
Okay, I've had enough,
I'm going home.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:46.700
Huh?

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:47.868
But Sakura!

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.337
Didn't you come to help
me keep an eye on them?

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.472
[Sakura] Since you two
seem to be getting along,

00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:54.808
I guess I wasted
my time worrying.

00:17:54.842 --> 00:17:55.943
See ya!

00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:58.078
(sighs) Man, so
much happened today.

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.246
I'm exhausted.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:01.348
I'm gonna go and look
for a place to stay.

00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:04.351
Hey, where do you think
you're going, kid?

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:06.086
-(groans anxiously)
-I mean, it's bad enough

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:07.754
that I lost track
of the other guy.

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:11.592
There's no way I can afford to
let you out of my sight now!

00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:15.229
(birds calling)

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:18.198
I don't want Granny Tsunade
to yell at me again.

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:20.634
I really can't have
you running away,

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:24.071
so you're gonna have to stay
here at my place for tonight.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:27.941
Oh yeah, sorry, but I didn't
catch your name before.

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:30.077
Oh, it's Boruto.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.712
Nice to meet you, Boruto.

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:34.715
My name's Naruto Uzumaki.

00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:37.184
Cool, yeah.

00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:39.419
(door creaking)

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:42.456
(footsteps tapping)

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.627
So this is where my
Dad lived as a kid?

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.830
[Naruto] Don't pay any
attention to the mess, okay?

00:18:49.863 --> 00:18:53.100
(footsteps tapping)

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.702
(door closing)

00:18:58.438 --> 00:19:00.073
You live alone?

00:19:00.107 --> 00:19:01.175
(grunts affirmatively)

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:02.809
I've always lived
by myself, you know?

00:19:02.843 --> 00:19:04.578
I never knew my mom and dad.

00:19:07.114 --> 00:19:08.815
(stomach growling)

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:10.083
(both grunting sheepishly)

00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:13.086
(both laughing)

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.488
I guess my stomach's telling me

00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:17.090
it's about time to have
a little dinner, huh?

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:20.694
And since you're my guest,
I'm gonna make you a feast!

00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:22.196
A feast?

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.834
(groans in disappointment)

00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:28.302
A feast, huh?

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:30.938
All right, it's finally ready!

00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:33.807
My favorite ramen
from my special stash.

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:36.043
And there's more if
you're still hungry.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.080
I guess childhood favorites
really stay with you.

00:19:40.113 --> 00:19:41.815
[Naruto] You say something?

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:43.417
Nope.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.218
(hums curiously)

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:46.053
Well, thanks for the food!

00:19:47.454 --> 00:19:49.423
(blowing on ramen)

00:19:49.456 --> 00:19:52.326
(slurping loudly)

00:19:57.731 --> 00:19:58.699
What's wrong?

00:19:58.732 --> 00:20:00.434
It's gonna get cold.

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:01.702
Thanks for the food.

00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:04.404
(blowing on ramen)

00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:06.073
(slurping quietly)

00:20:06.106 --> 00:20:08.675
This stuff's
actually pretty good!

00:20:08.709 --> 00:20:09.676
(chuckles)

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.944
I know, right?

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:13.580
(soft music)

00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:25.692
(sheets rustling)

00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:27.594
Um, are you still up?

00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:29.696
Yeah.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.098
Hey, so is the other guy

00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:33.066
that you're traveling
with your dad?

00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:37.070
No, he's actually my master.

00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:38.338
That's what I thought.

00:20:38.372 --> 00:20:40.340
You don't look like him at all.

00:20:40.374 --> 00:20:43.443
So tell me, what's your
real dad like, then?

00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:46.346
Well, my dad is...

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.949
He's amazingly strong,
and it seems like

00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:51.485
practically everybody
depends on him.

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:54.588
He's really busy and doesn't
get to come home a lot.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.591
Is that right, huh?

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.093
But even when he is home,

00:21:00.127 --> 00:21:03.564
he's so exhausted that
he's pretty much useless.

00:21:03.597 --> 00:21:04.565
Oh yeah?

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:05.599
Like how?

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.936
Well, for example, one
time on my little sister's

00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:10.737
birthday, we got
her a special cake,

00:21:10.771 --> 00:21:13.674
but my dad was so tired,
he dropped the whole thing

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:15.275
before we could even eat it!

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:16.076
(laughs)

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.211
Yeah, you're right!

00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:19.413
Man, he's totally useless!

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.081
(laughs)

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:24.818
But you know, it kind
of seems to me like you

00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:28.722
enjoy talking about
your family a lot.

00:21:33.994 --> 00:21:36.096
Even if your dad's
the way he is,

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:37.464
you don't hate him, right?

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:41.435
(soft music)

00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:51.812
(chuckles)

00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:52.813
Nah.

00:21:52.846 --> 00:21:54.581
I don't hate him at all.

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:13.467
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:22.976 --> 00:22:26.313
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:42.389 --> 00:23:45.692
[Sakura] Naruto, Lady Tsunade
has issued a direct order

00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:47.694
for all the genin to assemble.

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:49.096
[Naruto] Another annoying order?

00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:50.831
[Boruto] Hey, so besides you,

00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:52.566
who else is coming, Sakura?

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.834
[Sakura] Uh, let's see.

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:55.802
Neji's team, and
Ino's team, and...

00:23:55.836 --> 00:23:57.337
Well, you don't know them.

00:23:57.371 --> 00:23:59.406
[Naruto] I'm getting tired
of just watching you,

00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:00.607
so we'll go, too!

00:24:00.641 --> 00:24:04.678
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:05.879
"Genin Assemble!"

00:24:05.913 --> 00:24:08.081
A direct order for all
the genin to assemble?

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:09.583
I wonder what it is.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:14.721
(singing in Japanese)
