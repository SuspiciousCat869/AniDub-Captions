WEBVTT

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.277
[chuckle]
Perfect form!

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.478
[chuckle]

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.281
Looks like you're real
fired up, Big Brother!

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.683
I am!

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.351
Watch out, Byakuya Gang!

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:21.287
No matter what jutsu you throw
at me, I'll pulverize you!

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.689
<i>(NEWSCASTER)</i>
<i>We interrupt this newscast</i>

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:23.657
<i>to bring you</i>
<i>breaking news...</i>

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.991
<i>We are outside of</i>

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.527
<i>the Kaminarimon Company</i>
<i>headquarters</i>

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.361
<i>where a crowd is</i>
<i>quickly gathering.</i>

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.097
<i>These protestors are</i>
<i>accusing the giant corporation</i>

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.966
<i>of corrupt practices.</i>

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.602
[shouting]

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.971
May justice fall upon this
corrupt company!

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.006
Let true justice prevail!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.107
[shouting]

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.243
I wonder what brought this on.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:47.347
We've never treated any of
our employees unfairly.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.816
Do you think it could be...

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.417
What the heck's going on?

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.854
Mom, why are they protesting?

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.989
Mmmm...
Well, those people are angry

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:58.324
because they believe
Mr. Kaminarimon's company

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.293
did bad things,
so they're speaking up.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.462
Isn't that your friend's
company, Big Brother?

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.731
They wouldn't do
anything bad, right?

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:05.799
That's true.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.534
Of course they wouldn't!

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:11.271
Don't tell me...the Byakuya
Gang is behind this too!

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.707
If they are involved,
that's not good.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.876
If this disturbance continues,

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.611
then the chaos
will surely expand

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.745
from inside the village!

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.014
Damn it!

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:24.217
This is going beyond
just the Byakuya Gang.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.986
I'd say it's going
really well.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.556
It's still on a small scale,
but protests are breaking out,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.757
just like we expected.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:32.893
And more and more people

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.995
are helping us
to avoid capture now.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.997
Things are
looking good for us.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.565
Couldn't have gone better.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.466
You see,
if you're clever enough...

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.268
you can figure out
what moves people

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.571
and easily manipulate them.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.840
The trick is to
serve them up a villain...

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:50.811
which might be dissatisfaction
with life or daily stress.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:54.948
Everyone just needs something
to focus their anger on.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.417
Ultimately,
my ninjutsu is one that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.886
deceives and manipulates
the mind.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.188
We still have to do
our final plan.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.858
Who knows what will happen?

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:07.427
But we are noble thieves,
correct?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.665
So these lies... They're all
to save the people, right?

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:12.933
You better believe it!

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.167
Of course!

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.837
It's all for the sake of
true justice!

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.045
Anti‐capitalist protests?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:05.579
Yeah.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.981
Poor people are really mad.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:11.184
They're directing their anger
at the wealthy corporations.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:14.254
These protests are
unusually widespread.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.622
So what's the cause?

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.124
It seems like
there's an agitator.

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:19.526
If you look at the timeline,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.427
it all began when
that gang of robbers

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.864
started hanging out
in the village.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.666
The Byakuya Gang?

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.301
I can't imagine those guys
aren't involved.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.336
But I don't really
understand it.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.405
What would be the purpose
of their involvement?

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.674
What's in it for them?

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:35.642
If they create unrest
in the village...

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.210
wouldn't it make it
easier for them

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.613
to find opportunities
to steal more stuff?

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.748
The thing is...
after their last job,

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:45.085
the Byakuya Gang stopped
their activities abruptly.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.920
It was rather strange.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.221
[sigh]

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:51.491
I agree. That's definitely
weird all right.

00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:54.060
I'll go ahead and make contact
with the other villages.

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:57.230
I'll ask about what the gangs
movements have been recently.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.299
But if there's a way
that we can avoid it,

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:03.369
we'd rather not add work
to your already full plate.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.438
But any kind of unrest
in the village...

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.974
is already...
my responsibility.

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:08.074
[exhale]

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.412
Well, I think that you've been
doing a damn fine job.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.014
I'll still have
the Police Force

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:16.182
continue their investigation.

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:17.851
Yes, please do.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.154
[heavy breathing]

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.989
Hey! Have you guys
seen the news today?

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:25.526
It's only getting bigger.
Look.

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.826
Hm?

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.762
Damn it, not here too!

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.566
There's never been
anything like this before.

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.467
It's like the Byakuya Gang's
turned into

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.936
saviors of justice.

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.471
There's no way we can fight
the Byakuya Gang,

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.407
let alone an angry crowd
of protesting citizens.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.543
I don't get it!

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:44.277
How come
those awful robber guys

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.412
have become super popular?

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.549
They think they're
fighting for justice!

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:50.150
They can make
any excuse they want,

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.186
but when all is said and done,
those guys are stealing!

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.888
Right, Shikadai?

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:55.622
Huh?

00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:58.825
Yeah... That's right.

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.128
Wow, how come you're all
scatterbrained and stuff?

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:03.429
Did something happen?

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.899
[sigh]
No, nothing happened.

00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:11.471
Hey! Hold on!

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:12.639
Weren't we gonna
have a meeting

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:14.474
to talk about
our next mission?

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:17.511
Sorry, but we'll have to do it
another time.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:18.979
‐ Huh?!
‐ [groans]

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:31.558
<i>Then I'll just make</i>
<i>this move here.</i>

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:33.426
<i>That same play again?!</i>

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.562
<i>'Cause my decoy move</i>
<i>always works.</i>

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:36.997
<i>You fall for it every time.</i>

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.464
<i>Really?</i>

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:42.168
<i>Well, it's not like</i>
<i>I'm doing it on purpose.</i>

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:43.604
Shikadai...

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:45.772
<i>GEKKO) You always</i>
<i>do well by me, son.</i>

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:52.713
The place where I belong...
is the Byakuya Gang.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.181
That's how I've decided
to live my life

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:56.517
ever since that day.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:04.958
[sigh]

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.459
All right, I'm going.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:08.394
Be good and wait for me, okay?

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.329
[chuckle]

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.531
Sure, Dad!

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:12.866
Be careful...my darling.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.602
Don't worry. It's going to be
an easy mission.

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:18.371
I'll be back home
by tomorrow night.

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:20.340
Besides,
I've got a trusty partner.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.576
[laughing]

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:27.981
You love your dad a lot,
huh, Ryogi?

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:28.949
Yeah!

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:29.583
[chuckle]

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.184
Your dad is great.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:35.455
He has a wonderful job and
he helps all kinds of people.

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.891
Do you think I can become
just like Dad someday

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.225
when I grow up?

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.861
Yes, of course.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:41.895
You bet.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.801
How come Dad's not home yet?

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:51.805
He did tell us yesterday that
he'd be home by now, right?

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:52.939
[gasp]

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.040
That must be him!

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.443
Welcome home!

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.280
(RYOGI'S DAD)
Ryo...gi...

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.515
[gasps]

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:03.483
Dad?

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:05.986
My darling!

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.253
What happened?

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:11.024
It's me! Can you hear me?!
Please answer me! Please!

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.859
Uhm... Mom, wait...

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:14.260
(RYOGI'S MOM)
Please wake up!

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:18.231
There's...
someone behind you...

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:20.266
Huh?

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:28.174
Please, Mom...you gotta...
get away...

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.184
[quivering breath]

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.987
Ahhh!

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.055
[grunt]

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.069
(GEKKO)
Ryogi, you're awake now.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:56.837
Huh?

00:08:57.437 --> 00:08:58.605
[gasp]

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.912
Uncle...Gekko?

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:07.080
Don't worry.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:10.584
I killed the man
who was trying to attack you.

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.786
[gasp]
What about Mom and Dad?!

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:15.922
I'm sorry.

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:19.192
I just wasn't strong enough
to protect them.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.226
[gasp]

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.095
Their funeral's already over.

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:30.637
[emotional breaths]

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.874
[crying]

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.542
What do you want to do now?

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:41.381
[crying]

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.916
(GEKKO)
Do you want to come with me?

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:45.619
Huh?

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.890
(GEKKO)
It'll be okay.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.759
I'll teach you everything
about the man your dad was.

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:55.829
Whaddya say?

00:09:57.463 --> 00:10:01.234
[sniffling and
quivering breaths]

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:01.968
Mhm.

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.411
Why did you bring me
all the way out here?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.547
Just be patient and
give it some time.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.216
They'll all be gathering here
very soon.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:17.283
Who's gathering?

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:19.686
Huh?!

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:20.987
[gasp]

00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:30.430
So, are you gonna tell me
how it went?

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.699
It went flawlessly, Boss.

00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:34.100
You're the Boss?

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.636
Who's the kid?

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:38.171
He's going to be
observing our work.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.273
At least for now, anyway.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.474
Did you say work?

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:42.709
That's right.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.711
Your dad and I
had another job...

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.547
besides our regular
shinobi work

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.414
that we were assigned to.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:49.750
We did it in secret

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:53.053
and always referred to it
as our "real job."

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:54.821
My dad did too?

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:57.157
We are the Byakuya Gang.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.794
We crush the powerful and
save those who are weak.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.330
We are society's
noble thieves!

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:05.331
uhhh

00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:11.404
Wow!

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:14.140
We really scored big again,
Boss!

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.476
So you guys
went around stealing?

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.344
You and my dad
were really thieves?

00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:20.380
Hey, c'mon,
I already told ya.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.348
We call ourselves
noble thieves.

00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:24.851
Listen, the loan shark
we stole all this stuff from

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.753
did a buncha dirty things
to get rich

00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:29.222
so there's no need for us
to feel bad.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:29.890
[uncomfortable]

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:31.424
It's blood money...

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:35.028
stolen off the backs of
powerful and wealthy people.

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.763
Those are
the only kind of people

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:38.632
noble thieves deal with.

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.667
Ryogi... I want you
to listen well.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.168
Over time,

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.738
as your dad and I went about
our shinobi missions,

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:46.540
we began to question
some things.

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:47.808
Like what?

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:50.343
Basically,
we ninja are just servants

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.279
for the people above us
who hold all the power.

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.782
No matter how much
strength we possess,

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.652
we only save those
that we are ordered to save.

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.921
And that's the reality.

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.923
But that doesn't excuse this!

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.758
This is an important
reformation

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:07.327
that your dad and I
started long ago.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.532
Reformation?
My dad never mentioned that.

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.967
You probably can't
understand it yet.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.803
However, once you cross
a dangerous bridge,

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:18.271
you're bound to make enemies.

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:19.039
[startle]

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:28.214
So the person who killed
my mom and dad was...

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.149
Yeah...

00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:30.884
Unfortunately,
I'm sure your dad

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:34.588
didn't want his family to get
entangled in all of this.

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:35.722
[notice]

00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:37.223
Oh, you're back.

00:12:43.564 --> 00:12:44.765
Here you go.

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:46.600
We managed to locate
and bring back

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:49.102
all of the loot
they swindled from you.

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:52.906
O‐Oh!
How can we ever thank you?!

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.474
Uh Lord Gekko?!

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:56.943
Do you understand?

00:12:56.977 --> 00:12:58.945
We rob the rich
and give to the poor

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:01.147
for the sake of justice.

00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:04.117
Your dad also used to say
something very wise.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.120
Ninja who blindly swear
loyalty to the nation...

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:08.855
have difficulty
actually hearing

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:11.091
the voices of those
who really need saving.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.727
They're just used
by the powerful.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.663
They're nothing more
than pawns!

00:13:16.697 --> 00:13:17.898
They're pawns...

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.868
You have amazing potential.

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:24.337
It's time you join
the Byakuya Gang.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:26.973
Who, me?

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.278
Yes. You can help us.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.315
We'll change
this rotten reality together.

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:37.618
Thank you so much!

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:38.552
[chuckle]

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:39.853
Your dad is great.

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.054
He has a wonderful job,

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:44.190
and he helps
all kinds of people.

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:45.191
Hmmm

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:56.369
Oh, there you are.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:02.509
Were you thinking back to
your past and reminiscing?

00:14:02.543 --> 00:14:03.276
A little.

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:05.078
I see.

00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:06.880
You must only do that
in moderation.

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:08.381
Tomorrow night,

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:11.384
we will be undertaking
the final stage of our plan,

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.318
so be ready.

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:15.055
Hmmm?
What's that?

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:19.793
Ah, w‐well, this is, uh...

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.596
something I borrowed
from a friend.

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:25.031
Oh, you got it
from a friend, huh?

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:28.168
I can't believe you actually
made friends with somebody!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.235
I'm sorry.

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:30.671
[chuckle]

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.205
What are apologizing for?

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:34.340
You should see that
as a good thing.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.209
I'm sure if your dad
were alive today,

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:38.178
he'd be very happy
to hear that.

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:40.446
Yes...

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:43.517
Turn in early tonight.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.518
Understood.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.689
Hmph...
He made a friend.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.056
That's interesting.

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:52.492
No matter.

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:55.562
Everything will be settled
by tomorrow night anyway.

00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:07.407
Hmm?

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:12.779
Hey!
It's been a while.

00:15:12.813 --> 00:15:13.413
[affirmative]

00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:16.416
I'm sure you've been
waiting for me.

00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:17.518
Huh?

00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:19.252
Don't be
so full of yourself.

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:21.387
I was just sitting here
practicing.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.725
So I could kick your butt in
the next Shogi match we play.

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:25.759
Yeah?

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.427
I'd like to see you try that.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.430
You can talk a good game,
but let's see how you play.

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:31.832
Who's talking now?

00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:33.600
You better not
start crying later.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:45.746
Wow, you're right.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.914
Looks like you have
gotten better.

00:15:47.948 --> 00:15:49.783
I hope you're not
just sayin' that.

00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:50.717
[chuckle]

00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:52.218
Truth is...

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:54.721
we won't really know
until this match is over, huh?

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:09.002
Man, this is so fun...

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:10.270
I can't believe

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.939
you actually made friends
with somebody!

00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:15.308
So this is what it's like
to have a friend...

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.516
We should go.
It's getting dark.

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:24.618
Oh...hold on.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:25.351
Hmm?

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:34.160
Ah!

00:16:34.194 --> 00:16:36.262
You're so prepared.

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:37.831
Well, I want us
to finish this,

00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:39.833
no matter how long it takes.

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:42.202
Finish, huh?
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:51.912 --> 00:16:52.613
Uhh!

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:55.481
Checkmate.

00:16:56.717 --> 00:16:57.984
You did it.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.386
You really got me this time.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.522
Damn...

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:04.558
I don't suppose...
there are any take backs?

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:06.860
Well, those are the rules.

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:09.530
But I guess I could
consider it...

00:17:09.563 --> 00:17:10.964
Huh? You mean for real?

00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:12.599
On one condition...

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:16.002
If you answer one question for
me completely and honestly.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.739
What? You'd be fine
with just that?

00:17:18.772 --> 00:17:19.472
Yeah.

00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:23.610
You're...

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.213
...with the Byakuya Gang,
right?

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:32.519
What's this all about?

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:35.121
I don't have any idea
why you'd bring them up.

00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:38.992
You can stop pretending.
It's a real drag.

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:40.393
Do you happen
to remember that time

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:43.697
we were playing Shogi
and Boruto showed up?

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.567
Anyway, so are the things
this Mister Katasuke

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.769
keeps in his lab
always this interesting?

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.540
Someone who is brand new
to the village...

00:17:53.574 --> 00:17:56.042
wouldn't have any knowledge
of Mr. Katasuke's lab.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.578
In other words,

00:17:57.611 --> 00:18:00.380
you had already cased
the village a couple of times.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.482
Go on,
you can just admit it.

00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:04.651
Hold on for a second,
Shikadai!

00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:07.153
That's why you think I'm with
the Byakuya Gang?!

00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:10.023
You've got a seriously wild
imagination there, buddy!

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.825
[laugh]

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:14.427
Don't you think you might be
overreaching a bit?

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.397
Me? A member of
the Byakuya Gang?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.999
I mean,
it's a whole other story

00:18:19.032 --> 00:18:20.200
if you got proof...

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:22.936
All right then.

00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:24.170
It's clear you have no basis

00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:25.772
on which to make
this crazy assumption.

00:18:25.806 --> 00:18:28.942
You really think I'd accuse
you if I didn't have proof?

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:30.711
[exhale]

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:32.946
That lamp you brought brought

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:34.347
was on the list of
stolen goods.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.481
[shocked]

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:37.651
You brought it from
your hideout, right?

00:18:37.684 --> 00:18:40.153
That was pretty careless
of you, don't you think?

00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:45.659
There's no way it it could've
been traced already!

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:46.392
Uh...

00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:54.334
[awkward chuckle]

00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:56.236
I'm a little embarrassed

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:58.138
I fell for your trick
so easily.

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:02.275
Oh man, what an awkward
Shogi match.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.645
Just so you know,
I didn't want to believe it.

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:09.149
And if I am wrong,
then I'm really sorry, but...

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:10.817
So what are you
going to do next?

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:13.754
Are you planning on
turning me in to the Leaf?

00:19:13.787 --> 00:19:15.021
I won't.

00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:16.356
Don't worry.

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:19.159
I wouldn't do anything
like that.

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:21.928
And I never told anybody
about you either.

00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:22.829
[shocked]

00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:24.097
I just don't want you

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.433
continuing to do something
so stupid!

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:30.136
Something so... stupid?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.673
Yeah.
I mean, think about it.

00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:34.875
It doesn't matter
what you call yourselves...

00:19:34.908 --> 00:19:36.342
"noble thieves" or whatever...

00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:39.345
a few guys won't be able to
change the world!

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:41.081
I told you that already!

00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:42.883
If you're not the one
who holds real power,

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:46.352
then everything you do
will turn into one big drag!

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:48.689
You'll only get crushed in
the end, or at the very least,

00:19:48.722 --> 00:19:51.124
you'll end up becoming
somebody else's pawn!

00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:52.358
[shocked]

00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:54.795
A pawn?

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.898
I'm telling you, to wake the
hell up!

00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.367
You need to forget about
this stupid noble thief act!

00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:05.038
I see you clearly now,
Shikadai.

00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:07.173
You don't
understand me at all.

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.009
You never did.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.744
Ryogi, wait!
Hold on.

00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:14.447
We do have the power
to change the world.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.885
And even if I die as a pawn,
at least I'll have no regrets!

00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:19.620
Ryogi!

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:25.425
You made the wrong move.

00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:28.361
You're too easy, Shikadai.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:29.730
Are you gonna run away?!

00:20:29.763 --> 00:20:30.764
No.

00:20:30.797 --> 00:20:31.898
I'm going to fight,

00:20:31.932 --> 00:20:34.267
as a member of
the Byakuya Gang.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.002
You're the one
who's running away.

00:20:38.004 --> 00:20:39.372
You think I'm...?

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:41.274
You think there's only
so much you can do

00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:43.443
and you just accept that,

00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:45.411
so you never try to improve.

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:47.614
You shut up!

00:20:47.648 --> 00:20:49.750
You've never been serious
about anything.

00:20:49.783 --> 00:20:51.317
Not even once.

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:54.621
It's ironic you accuse others
of the very same thing.

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:56.790
But I guess if you grow up
without a care in the world,

00:20:56.823 --> 00:21:00.460
in a peaceful village
like this, everything's okay.

00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:03.029
But I'm different
than you are!

00:21:03.063 --> 00:21:03.764
Ryogi...

00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:07.267
See?

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.335
You're still doing it
even now.

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:11.337
You're a full‐fledged shinobi,

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.907
but you aren't even
trying to capture me.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.142
You're all talk and no action.

00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:17.010
Ryogi!

00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:18.679
Ice Style: Mangehyo!

00:21:21.147 --> 00:21:22.716
There's nothing you can do...

00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:27.821
Don't go!

00:21:27.854 --> 00:21:30.757
Ryogi!!!

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.462
It's too bad, Shikadai...

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:37.998
You...

00:21:39.065 --> 00:21:40.466
You were the only one...

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.543
Shikadai...

00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:56.316
We've been waiting for you!

00:21:56.349 --> 00:21:58.719
The time has come at last.

00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:02.322
We'll proceed with
"The Crest of Night Strategy."

00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:03.857
Our final job.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.360
We will show our path of
true justice to the world.

00:22:09.062 --> 00:22:10.030
Yes, sir.

00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:46.593
(GEKKO)
Ryogi, who would've thought

00:23:46.627 --> 00:23:49.763
that the plan you came up with
would get us this far?!

00:23:49.796 --> 00:23:52.198
Even if we leave things
as they are now,

00:23:52.232 --> 00:23:54.500
chaos will grow by itself!

00:23:54.535 --> 00:23:56.402
No one can change
the flow of things

00:23:56.436 --> 00:23:58.204
once they are set in motion.

00:23:58.238 --> 00:23:59.773
Let's go, everyone!

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.908
(RYOGI)
For the sake of true justice!

00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:05.445
(BORUTO) Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:05.478 --> 00:24:07.748
"Go! The Crest of
Night Strategy"

00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:10.551
(RYOGI) Shikadai, you won't
make a move anyway.

00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:13.186
Even if you do, you can't
do anything about it.
