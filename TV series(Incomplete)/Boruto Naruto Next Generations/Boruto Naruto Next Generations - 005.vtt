Shut up! Gimme a
break, would ya?

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:48.682

to suck up to me all the

<i>After all, the Hidden Sound</i>
<i>Village was established by a</i>

<i>destroy the Hidden Leaf.</i>

Hey, Boruto, did you say you
know that transfer student?

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.713
Yeah, I kinda met
him this morning.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:43.917
He stopped this troublemaker in
the village before we had a
chance to.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.253
So that must mean that he
is pretty skilled, then...

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.090
Just what sort of jutsu
is he able to he use?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.958
I dunno.

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:56.029

him so I can find out just how
strong he really is.

you the truth, he's

Nice to meet you, Mitsuki!

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:28.995
Of course. Nice to
meet you, Boruto.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.898
Just feel free to ask me
anything you want to know, okay?

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:34.200
Oh, anything?

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.036
Yeah, of course!
Anything at all!

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:42.275
Well then, why is it that we're
the only students who don't
have a classroom?

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:43.710
Uhh...

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.546

00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:51.317

to a certain someone.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.819
[groan]

00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:01.227
Boruto's always dozing off
in class, so how does he
know how to do all that?

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:05.298
He's just got a knack
for it, that's all.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:10.637
Heh. That was a pretty simply
problem... 'least for someone
of my abilities.

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:15.008
It's correct. But now use the
formula that I taught you

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:20.046
No way! Doing it like this
is a million times faster,
and it's more accurate, too!

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.285
But never mind about that! Give
us a problem that we can really
sink our teeth into!

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.420
Oh‐ho, really...?

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:35.962
As requested. Here's something
with more meat for you to chew
on.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:39.733
Let's see if your method can
solve this problem, Boruto.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.302
[grunts]

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.805
You're a sore loser,

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.239
Huh?

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:51.377
Here, look... Try this. You can
calculate it as an equation of
motion.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.315
And this way, you can
factor in air resistance.

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.951
See? Easy!

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:00.153
Oh! I get it now!

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:03.924
Mitsuki, I didn't ask you
to solve this problem.

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.527
But Boruto was having
a hard time with it.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.063
We're supposed to teach each
other when someone doesn't
understand, right?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.867
Yes, but it's meaningless if
they can't solve it themselves!

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.069
[groan]

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:21.608

enough. Go back to your seats.

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:28.849

strength, no one's close to you!

Okay! Next!

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.411

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:58.004

Are you all
right, Iwabe?
[coughing]

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:06.980
Why did you stop me? I
was nearly on the verge

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:09.983
[gasp] What?

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.184

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:16.590
Listen, just apologize
to Iwabe, all right?!

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:20.827
But why? You heard him.
He said no holding back.

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.195
It doesn't matter.
You went too far!

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.365
And I really don't like
that kind of fighting!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.668
Oh really, you don't?

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:28.802
Of course not.

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:34.040
I see. Well, I don't
want you to dislike me.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:39.212
I guess I overdid
it. I'm sorry.

(Shino)
Sorry this is rather
out of the blue...

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:56.196
It's fine! Since retiring,
I'm pretty free!

00:09:56.229 --> 00:10:01.134
Anyway, that's beside the point
I heard about the new kid from
the Hidden Sound,

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.970
specifically that
he's very peculiar...

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.371
Yes, he is...

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:08.975
And I heard that you've already
got a few troublemakers in your
class.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:11.377
I guess you just
have all the luck!

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:16.850
I know... Maybe I'm just
not suited to be a
teacher... The reason is‐

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:18.819
What are you talking
about, "maybe?"

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:22.989
Everyone in the village
knows that you're
definitely not suited for it!

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.190
[gasp]

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:30.096
Even so, I truly believe you've
been working your hardest.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.364
Do you really think so.

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:35.168
Look... whether one is suited
or not isn't what matters.

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:38.071
You can't give up over
something minor like that.

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:44.010
You just have to figure out
how to connect with your
students in your own way.

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:48.281
So, don't give up... and
do it in my own way...

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.417
Hey, Pops, another order
of fish cake, please!

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.492
Yes, it's me.

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.529
I'm fine.

00:11:02.563 --> 00:11:09.035
Everything's going smoothly.
Things are quite interesting
here, that's for sure.

00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:15.475
Oh, him? We've met. But we
haven't talked very much, yet.

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:23.750
I can't wait...
I'll soon find out...
...if he's my sun.

Good morning, everyone!

He really went overboard!

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.919
[chuckle]

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.722
Shino Sensei actually
made all of this?

00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:04.224
I think it's a little bit
misguided, though...

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:07.460
All right! Here's to deeper
friendships, everyone!

00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:13.399
So what are we supposed to do?

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:18.739
Who knows? But he went through
all this trouble. So I guess
we just have fun!

00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:22.543
Hey, there! So what kind
of place is the Hidden
Sound Village, huh?

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:26.212
So, in yesterday's
practice, your defensive
moves were awesome!

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.148
Do you know any
special ninjutsu?

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.952
Well, actually, I'm skilled
at various escape jutsu.

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:32.919
Wow!

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:35.522
Also Wind Style. And
Lightning Style, too.

00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:41.061
What? I thought the Hidden Cloud
specialized in Lightning Styles,
not the Hidden Sound.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.730
It sounds to me like
you're just bluffing.

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:46.733
But it's true.

00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:51.672
I was kinda worried when all
this first started, but... this
welcome party's actually kinda
fun!

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:55.141
Mhm! And it's thanks
to Aburame Sensei.

00:12:55.175 --> 00:13:00.480
<i>This is great! Mitsuki</i>
<i>is starting to blend</i>
<i>in, just as I hoped!</i>

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:05.218
You were right, Kurenai Sensei!
<i>It's just like you said!</i>

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:08.254
<i>I'll win over my students</i>
<i>in my own way.</i>

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.858
Is everything going
okay, Aburame Sensei?

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:13.960
W‐What makes you say that?

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:18.832
You've worked so hard for
Mitsuki, Actually, you've done
so much for each and every one
of us.

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:23.870
I've never been especially
good with words...

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:30.577
It's because of the Academy and
the many friends that I made
here, that I didn't end up a
loner.

00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:36.082
In a way... this is how
I'm repaying the Leaf
Village for that...

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:38.719
...by becoming an instructor.

a little present from me!

Yeah, way to
go, Shino Sensei!

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.541
I don't get it. How
is he doing this?

00:14:00.574 --> 00:14:03.577
Seems to be different than
my Super Beast Scroll.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.281
Come to think of it, Shino
Sensei's ninjutsu is...

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.917

00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:14.054

completely disgusting!

to be like this...

What's the story with that guy?

Well, compared to the
other teachers, he's
not very dependable,

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:46.112
And he's sooo not
charismatic either.

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:48.348

that about Shino Sensei.

to help welcome Mitsuki.

"disgusting" was too harsh...

What do you guys
think we should do?

00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:36.196
It'll be a drag, but we should
go and apologize to him later
on.

gonna come, too, Mitsuki?
