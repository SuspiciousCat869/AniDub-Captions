WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.941
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.711
(bird chirping)

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.584
(Mirai sighs)

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.586
What's wrong?

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.523
Oh! Nothing!

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.526
It's just that I
totally misunderstood

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.394
and thought this was
a two-day mission,

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.696
so I didn't bring
enough clothing.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.964
And I was also thinking

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.133
how I'd really like
to take a bath now.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.102
You'd better call on
your mental strength

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.303
to get over that.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.539
It's just something you
just have to deal with

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:39.339
on any long mission.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.108
You know, the big
problem with you

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.544
is that you think mental
strength is everything.

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:44.478
Now, listen up, Mirai!

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.480
Stamina is what really
counts in the end!

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.550
Just go take a dip in one
of the rivers over there!

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:50.817
Like we did as kids!

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.953
No! I can't do that!

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.756
The times have
changed, you know!

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.493
Aw, man, I seriously hate
the hair I got from my mom.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:03.764
Oh, yeah. Your hair is
unruly, just like Kurenai's!

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.568
Yeah. My mom really is the
one I take after the most.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.635
Even all my best jutsu

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:11.572
are the genjutsu that
I inherited from her.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:12.773
Huh.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:17.277
Well, we can talk about
that once we get into town.

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.312
Oh!

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.114
We're finally here!

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:24.084
The hot springs district
is straight ahead!

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.720
I bet you'll get to
take a bath there!

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.457
Then let's hurry!

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.692
Huh?

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.961
My, my! So self-serving!

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:36.363
C'mon! I can't wait
to take a nice soak!

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.737
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:00.320
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:14.194
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.539
(upbeat music)

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:26.573
Welcome, everyone!

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.209
How about some Dog Hot
Spring bean-jam buns?

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:33.080
Dogs are so passÃ©! How about
some Cat Hot Spring cookies?

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:36.416
(upbeat music)

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.452
Huh, that's weird.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:41.788
I thought that this was
supposed to be a quiet town.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:44.391
You think we'll be
able to find a room?

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.792
Oh!

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.095
Looks like there's
a festival going on.

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:49.596
Oh, there's a festival?

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.566
(dog barking)

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.967
Hm.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.302
(cat meowing)

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.471
Everyone's wearing either
a cat or a dog mask.

00:03:57.504 --> 00:03:59.673
I wonder what kind
of festival this is.

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.876
The name of the festival's
not on the poster.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.813
Strange. You'd think someone
would write it down on there.

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.215
Oh, I get it!

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.184
This is the Dog
and Cat Festival.

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:13.720
Or the Cat and Dog Festival,
as it's also known.

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:17.191
But why would there be two
names for the same festival?

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:20.194
Look at what's in the
middle of the street.

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.695
Do you know what that is?

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.798
Something to do
with the Festival?

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.200
It's a border.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.335
What? Through the
middle of the town?

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.204
The Land of Fire and
the Land of Steam

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:31.605
have a friendly relationship.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:35.342
They have no problems with each
other in their daily lives.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.044
However, the day of the Festival

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.680
is an entirely different story.

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:42.316
(dog barking)

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.919
This is the Dog Hot Springs.

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.222
Once upon a time, when this town

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:51.058
was still just a small village.

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.060
(dog barking)

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:55.729
[Kakashi] A lone dog
appeared out of nowhere,

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.699
and he told the inhabitants
of this young village

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:01.502
that they should start digging.

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:06.540
And, lo and behold, before
long they hit a hot spring!

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.677
As a result, the
village prospered.

00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:12.079
Ever since then,

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:15.048
the story of that dog being
a messenger from the Dog God

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:17.050
has been passed down
through the generations

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:18.252
by the villagers,

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:22.055
and the hot springs was
named "Dog Hot Springs."

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.591
And they lived
happily ever after.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.494
Why did you make yourself
sound like an old man?

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:30.097
Uh, just getting into the
spirit of things, I guess!

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.699
And that is the
"Cat Hot Springs."

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:33.700
(cat meowing)

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.302
Now, once upon a time-

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.138
Wait, let me be the
one to tell the story!

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:39.072
Huh?

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:40.941
Now, this happened a
long, long time ago.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:44.044
(cat meowing)

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:47.681
[Guy] Back then, out of
nowhere, a cat appeared, and-

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:49.216
Stop right there!

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.085
This is the exact same
story as before, isn't it?

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.087
Yes, but how did you know that?

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.523
I just had a
feeling, that's all.

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:57.491
Yes, but still,

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.660
there's actually more
to the whole story.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.827
According to one account,

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.797
a third god that's
neither a dog nor a cat

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.799
appeared at the end.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.868
What, seriously? A third god?

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:12.039
[Kakashi] Yes, the God of
Destruction cloaked in flames.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.941
God of Destruction?

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:16.043
Its name was-

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:17.044
(Mirai gulps)

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:18.278
Its name was?

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:20.314
Lord Nenu!

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.350
Huh?

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.653
Like, "Ne" from Neko for Cat
and "Nu" from Inu for Dog.

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:27.654
(Mirai sighs)

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:28.689
Look, never mind.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.823
It's just a silly name,

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:31.959
and it's probably not
even true, anyway.

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.360
Well, the villagers here

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.196
either believe in the
Dog God or the Cat God,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.833
and that conflict is the
basis of this entire festival.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:41.802
That's why the
festival has two names

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.637
that couldn't be
written on the poster.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.506
Oh, I see how it is.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:46.473
But I heard that lately,

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:48.475
dog and cat lovers
from other lands

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.677
are coming here for
the festival, too.

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:51.912
See?

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:54.581
(upbeat music)

00:06:57.217 --> 00:07:00.487
Dog and cat lovers from
all of the nations, huh?

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:03.223
The festival revolves
around fighting.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:05.592
Burly men draped in loincloths,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.228
bellowing out their war cries

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.797
as they crash their
shrines for dogs and cats

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.432
into each other.

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:13.467
(Mirai gulps)

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.501
[Kakashi] If you're
from the Land of Fire,

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.503
you probably
would've heard of it.

00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:17.504
It must be fate

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:19.940
that we're here on the
day of this festival!

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:21.909
So, what do you say stay

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.811
and watch the shrine
fight from some box seats!

00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:26.046
[Kakashi] You've loved
this sort of thing

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.714
ever since you were little, huh?

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.718
Wait! As your bodyguard,
I can't let you do this!

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:37.558
Hey, stop! Come on! What if
something goes wrong here?

00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:38.859
Dogs reign supreme!

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:41.828
Keep a dog for three days and
they'll cherish your kindness,

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:44.431
but a cat'll forget
even after three years!

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.465
Oh, yeah? So what?

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:47.201
At least a cat doesn't
suck up to everyone!

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.335
It's the ultimate creature,

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:50.070
standing at the
top of the world!

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:54.808
(cats meowing and dogs barking)

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:56.176
Oh, come on!

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.079
I almost lost the
you of two just now!

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:02.049
Can you please not wander
away from your bodyguard?

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:05.452
[Kiba] Yeah, that's right!
You guys're way outta line!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.355
Heaven's never created
anything better than dogs!

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.490
[Man with Dog Mask 1]
Yeah, you tell 'em!

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:13.093
[Mirai] Wow, someone's
really looking for a fight!

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.829
Without dogs, there'd be no
peace in the Ninja World!

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:16.830
What?

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:17.831
Mr. Kiba?

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:20.834
Huh? Oh, hey! If it isn't Mirai!

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:22.469
(dog barking)

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:25.772
Kiba's a great investigator
in the Leaf Police Force,

00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:27.941
an awesome Ninja Hound user,

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:31.311
and even more, he was
one of Mom's students.

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:33.814
What on Earth are
you doing here?

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.916
Oh, well, uh,

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.084
I just came here

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:38.785
and then kinda hit
it off real nice

00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:40.220
with all the dog lovers.

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:42.956
[Tamaki] They're flattering
him and it's gone to his head.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.191
It's so dumb.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:46.493
Miss Tamaki!

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:50.063
She comes from a clan of Cat
Users and is Kiba's girlfriend!

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:51.832
Uh, or so I thought.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.233
Speak for yourself.

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.769
Like you haven't become the
leader of the cat lovers!

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:56.937
(Kiba and Tamaki scoff)

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.206
Wait, what exactly
is going on here?

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:01.208
Listen to me, Kakashi Sensei!

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:04.178
See the Dog Hot Springs and
the Cat Hot Springs over there?

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.079
Well, we all decided
to talk it over

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:07.748
to see which one to
go in first, but-

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.551
Look, the majority decided
to go to the Cat Hot Springs,

00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:11.952
but you keep rehashing it!

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.787
You just can't let
it go, can you?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.922
Come on!

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:16.790
Of course, you're gonna have the
majority

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.659
if you include all of your cats!

00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:19.826
Got a problem with that?

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.827
(cats meowing)

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.462
Look, I said that I'd be okay

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.965
with going to the Cat
Hot Springs, didn't I?

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:27.100
But I hate that you
just agreed to it

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.303
even though you didn't
really want to do it!

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:31.638
Huh? But that isn't
what I'm doing at all!

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:33.307
Don't tell me those guys-

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.442
Are here on a date and they're
fighting over

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:37.311
something as trivial as this.
Whatever!

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:40.314
All right, well, if this
is how you're gonna act,

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:43.450
then I'm gonna go all in as
the leader of the cat lovers!

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:46.320
Fine, bring it on, then!
But you'd better be ready!

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:49.356
Oh, boy.

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:52.693
Not even a dog wants to be
a part of a lovers' spat.

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.061
Yeah, neither does a cat.

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.563
Um, but shouldn't we
try to do something

00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:58.065
about this whole mess?

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.601
It's turning into way more
than just a lovers' spat!

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:03.937
Well, it's really a private
matter between those two.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:06.540
You don't always have
to see eye to eye

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:07.541
when you're in love.

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:09.543
That's also a part of youth!

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.644
Oh.

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:11.678
Uh.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.283
[Guy] Ah, looks like
we struck out again.

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:17.084
Huh?

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.385
(cats meowing)

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.654
(dogs barking)

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:22.055
(crowd fighting)

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.490
Don't you think the friction

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:26.093
between the cat lovers and
dog lovers is getting worse?

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.494
I believe that's
because those two

00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:29.830
became the leaders of
the opposing groups.

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:30.831
Hm.

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:31.965
If this continues,

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:34.501
we won't be able to
find an inn for tonight.

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:35.469
(Mirai gasps)

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:38.305
And I won't be able to
take a bath! I mean, uh-

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:41.074
We have to get the two
of them to make up,

00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:42.943
or else it'll affect
my bodyguard duties!

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.077
Isn't that correct?

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.547
Well, I guess that's
true to some extent.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.548
If that's the case,

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:48.649
then resolving the conflict

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:50.083
between the cat and dog lovers

00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:52.519
must also become a part
of the mission, right?

00:10:52.553 --> 00:10:53.520
I suppose so-

00:10:53.554 --> 00:10:54.922
That's absolutely right!

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:56.456
It's just the kind of mission

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.659
that shinobi in the
full power of youth

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:00.394
must pursue with
all their might!

00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:01.562
A mission!

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.330
Yes, I understand!

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:06.466
For the sake of a nice bath,
I'll take that mission!

00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:08.302
What?

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.671
There she goes.

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:21.715
Do you really think that
I should make up with him?

00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:23.150
Yes!

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:26.253
I'm sure that after waiting
so long go to on this date,

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:28.755
you don't actually want to
spend it like this, right?

00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:29.756
It's just that...

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.592
Kiba hardly ever
gets any days off

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.926
from the Leaf Police Force,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.928
so I made him come out with me.

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:37.064
But he keeps carrying on.

00:11:37.097 --> 00:11:40.367
Well, he does things
in his own way.

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.269
I guess that...

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.371
I thought

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.773
he understood me
better than this.

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:49.610
(water splashing)

00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:56.683
A date, huh?

00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:00.921
And I was really
excited about it, too!

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.457
But the way it turned out-

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.658
I'm sure that Kiba

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.294
doesn't actually want to
fight with you either, so-

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:15.402
(bird crowing)

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:26.680
Who would've thought

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.849
that legendary Ninja
Hound user, Kiba Inuzuka,

00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:30.284
would grace us
with his presence?

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:33.053
He took part in the fourth Great
Ninja War

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.454
and is now a top investigator.

00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:36.590
Out of all the Ninja Hound
users,

00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:39.459
he's the one closest
to becoming Hokage!

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.028
(Kiba laughs)

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:43.931
C'mon, you guys! I mean,
it's all true, but-

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:45.332
I've heard that you know

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:47.334
every single walking trail
in the whole country!

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.303
Your love of dogs
led you to create

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.305
and sell your own
line of dog food!

00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:54.174
And I've heard that you even
taste-test it all yourself!

00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:56.143
[Man with Dog Mask 4]
Wow, you're amazing!

00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:57.978
Yeah, that's right!

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.380
I am Kiba!

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:03.517
(crowd cheering)

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.718
We're gonna win!

00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:07.721
As long as Kiba's with us,
we'll beat those cat lovers!

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.756
(Kiba harrumphs)

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.191
Huh?

00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:12.159
Uh-

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:15.262
Uh, come on! What do
you think you're doing?

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.732
Well, I don't know exactly!
But they really love me!

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:19.933
Shouldn't you be finding

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:22.603
some way to make up
with Miss Tamaki?

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.571
What? No! She was wrong!

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:25.973
Yeah, but even if she was,

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:28.442
it's a lot cooler if
you apologize first.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.711
Look, once dogs make
their decisions,

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:32.279
they never go back on them.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.115
Anyway, Mirai, as Kurenai
Sensei's daughter,

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.317
how are you gonna help
us dog lovers out?

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:40.654
The honor of the Ninja
World is at stake!

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:43.123
I really don't know what to say.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:46.560
Uh, what do I do? If
this keeps up, then-

00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:50.297
Wait, I know! Come to think
of it, that just might work!

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:53.667
[Tamaki] This is from Kiba?

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.635
Yes.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.236
He wanted to make up with you,

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.439
so he wrote you a letter
and had me deliver it.

00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:01.341
Huh. Really? He did?

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:05.913
Well, actually, I'm the
one who wrote that letter!

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.681
I really hate to trick her like
this,

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:10.984
but if they make up, then
the end'll justify the means!

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.721
And their relationship'll
be patched up!

00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:15.722
(Tamaki groans)

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:18.225
Hey! What the hell's this?

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.026
Huh?

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.594
Look at this part!

00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:21.595
"As a peace offering,

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.797
come with your cats to
the Hot Springs Inn,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.533
and we'll all sit around the
table and eat tangerines."

00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:29.369
But I don't understand.
What's the problem with that?

00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:31.839
Cats hate tangerines
and citrusy scents,

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.240
and he knows that!

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:35.042
Which means that this letter-

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.443
It seems like a peace offering,

00:14:36.476 --> 00:14:38.445
but it's an attempt
to harass me!

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:39.446
(Mirai gasps)

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.181
No way, really?

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:42.115
Oh, no!

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:43.884
Cats and tangerines
around the table

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:45.886
just seemed to go
together so nicely, so-

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:47.154
(paper crumpling)

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:49.790
Two can play at that game.
I'm going all out now!

00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:53.393
I'm gonna show him exactly
how vindictive cats can be!

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:55.596
Everyone!

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:56.797
(cats meowing)

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.032
(crowd cheering)

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.033
[Mirai] Oh, boy!

00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:01.635
Get ready for all-out war!

00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:02.836
Let's show all those dogs

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.304
that they're useless
without their pack

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:07.307
and also what happens
when cats get serious!

00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.243
(crowd cheering)

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:11.912
I pledge my loyalty
to you, big sis!

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:13.881
This is a cat-tastrophe!

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:17.117
(suspenseful music)

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:25.392
Get outta the way!

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.794
Move aside! Lord
Kiba's coming through!

00:15:27.828 --> 00:15:29.530
Down with the cat lovers!

00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:30.831
Dogs are the best!

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:34.735
Aww yeah! We're gonna show
you just how great dogs are!

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.036
Come on!

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:37.437
Let's do this, you guys!

00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.439
We'll show you the
true power of cats!

00:15:39.473 --> 00:15:41.608
You're outta your league, dog
lovers!

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:44.912
Ah!

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.079
Uh, Tamaki?

00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:48.582
I see now that dogs are
more important to you

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:49.583
than I am,

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.584
Kiba.

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:52.052
No, no, no, that's not true.

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:54.321
Dogs are important,
but so are you!

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:57.057
I guess you and I just
don't get along after all.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.759
Tamaki, no! That's not-

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.127
Hey!

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.863
That woman rejected Mr.
Kiba's affections just now!

00:16:02.896 --> 00:16:06.600
For Kiba's sake, we'll inflict
divine punishment on you!

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:07.968
Attack them!

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:09.002
Guys, wait!

00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:10.170
(Kiba gasps)

00:16:10.204 --> 00:16:13.173
Oh, I see. So that's
how it's gonna be, huh?

00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:14.508
Everyone, engage the enemy!

00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:16.109
[Crowd] Cats!

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:20.347
(cats meowing and dogs barking)

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:25.452
Oh, no. What do we do?

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.621
We have to talk
them out of this!

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.488
Hm.

00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:30.023
With their tempers
flaring like this,

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.860
I doubt they'll just want
to talk things through.

00:16:32.893 --> 00:16:34.528
But- But we gotta try!

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:36.897
Maybe they're just gonna
have to fight it out

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.365
until everything's destroyed.

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:41.268
Until it's destroyed?

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:44.771
[Kakashi] The God of
Destruction, cloaked in flames.

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:46.006
Flames!

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.743
Do you have a lighter
on you, Mr. Guy?

00:16:49.776 --> 00:16:51.011
A lighter?

00:16:51.044 --> 00:16:53.480
Yeah, sure. But what
do you want it for?

00:16:53.514 --> 00:16:55.482
[Mirai] I'll return it!

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:56.517
Hey!

00:16:57.818 --> 00:17:00.387
(flames lighting)

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.923
(lighter flying)

00:17:02.956 --> 00:17:05.492
Fire Style: Flint Yagura!

00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:06.493
(fire igniting)

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:07.494
Whoa!

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:08.862
What the?

00:17:08.896 --> 00:17:11.565
(fire burning)

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:17.971
(crowd chattering)

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.842
What the hell is that monster?

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.744
Whoa, what is going on here?

00:17:23.777 --> 00:17:25.312
[Mirai as Lord Nenu] All you
humans

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.648
engaging in this futile battle,

00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:29.650
my name is Nenu,

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:32.152
the flaming God of Destruction!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.855
(Mirai whimpering)

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.990
Nenu's just a superstition,

00:17:37.024 --> 00:17:38.992
but maybe these people
are devout enough

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:40.394
that they'll believe in this!

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.996
Actually, it's more
like please believe it!

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.331
Whoa, no way, it's-

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:47.134
The third god that lies
dormant in this land.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.902
[Both] That's Lord Nenu!

00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:50.771
He fell for it that fast?

00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:52.039
[Mirai as Lord Nenu] Precisely!

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.841
I am indeed Nenu!

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:56.243
And I am the god
that shall put an end

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:58.278
to the conflict
between dogs and cats.

00:17:58.312 --> 00:18:00.914
As a child is born
from two parents,

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:03.050
this town was born
under the protection

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.252
of the Dog God and Cat God.

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:09.189
However, if you choose
not to end the fighting,

00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:10.924
then my flames will cause

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.328
this village's
catastrophic destruction.

00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:18.198
Fighting will only bring
about destruction and regret!

00:18:18.232 --> 00:18:20.634
Is that what all
of you really want?

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:26.573
Good, it looks
like it's working!

00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:27.574
Huh?

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:28.709
You monster!

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:31.578
Do you really think that
you can ruin this festival?

00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:33.580
Forget it! I won't let you!

00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:34.781
No way!

00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:36.183
Please stop, Mr. Guy!

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.519
Take this and disintegrate!

00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:39.686
Dynamic Entry!

00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:42.589
(fire disintegrating)

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:45.359
(Mirai yelling)

00:18:46.827 --> 00:18:49.429
(Guy yelling)

00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:51.765
(Guy grunting)

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.701
(wall cracking)

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:57.137
(wall collapsing)

00:18:57.171 --> 00:19:00.240
(water splashing)

00:19:02.543 --> 00:19:05.479
(crowd chattering)

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:08.849
Look at that!

00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:10.651
No way! The wall's come down!

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:12.352
[Man with Cat Mask 8] The
wall that separated us

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:13.387
is no more!

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:15.989
[Man With Dog Mask
11] This is indeed

00:19:16.023 --> 00:19:18.425
the message of destruction
sent by Lord Nenu!

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:20.527
Yes, Lord Nenu has
created harmony

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:21.728
through this destruction!

00:19:21.762 --> 00:19:24.865
A sign from god telling us
to become one and get along!

00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:27.668
(crowd cheering)

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:34.708
(Guy laughing)

00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:38.712
I don't know why but I'm
feeling great about all of this!

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:41.415
(Guy laughing)

00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:45.853
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

00:19:45.886 --> 00:19:46.987
You know, actually,

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.556
I should probably
apologize to Mirai, too.

00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:55.929
And I'm sorry that I forced
you to take a day off work

00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:58.065
and then dragged you
all over the place.

00:19:58.098 --> 00:20:00.067
Hey, why don't we
go take a soak?

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.503
Sure, but, separately, okay?

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:03.504
Huh?

00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:05.372
(Kiba grunts)

00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:06.373
You silly goose!

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:08.909
I'm talking about the
men's and women's baths!

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:10.644
(Tamaki chuckles)

00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:11.845
Uh-

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:13.480
(Kiba chuckles)

00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:16.116
(dog barking)

00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:23.490
(Mirai sighs)

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:30.464
(Mirai sighs)

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:32.699
I finally got a bath!

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:36.370
You did really well!
Great job on your mission!

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.504
Huh? Oh! No!

00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:40.107
It was because you gave
me a hint, that's all.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.042
I didn't do anything.

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:43.510
Well, to be honest with you,

00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:46.446
what I did basically on a whim
just happened to work out.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.481
Oh, c'mon!

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:48.515
It worked out

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:50.117
because you have a good
head on your shoulders.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.785
Just like your dad.

00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:53.654
Wait, just like my dad?

00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:55.055
Yeah!

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.758
You see, a lighter was kind
of like Asuma's trademark.

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.327
Oh.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.329
Even if you don't
remember much of him,

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:06.033
Asuma continues to live
on inside each one of us.

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:08.502
Really? You think so?

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.506
Your dad's Fire Style

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:13.740
and your mom's genjutsu.

00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:16.243
On the spur of the moment,

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.712
you merged them and
used them together.

00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:20.180
That just goes to show

00:21:20.214 --> 00:21:23.250
that not only Kurenai,
but Asuma as well,

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:26.019
are both deeply
rooted inside of you.

00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:29.756
I was all caught up
in what was going on,

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.292
so I just took a chance, and,

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:33.994
some things you just never know

00:21:34.027 --> 00:21:35.762
until you take a chance on them!

00:21:35.796 --> 00:21:36.997
I guess Guy's hot-blooded logic

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.066
can come in handy sometimes.

00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.002
(Guy snoring)

00:21:42.035 --> 00:21:44.238
All right, I'm going to
go take another soak.

00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:47.007
I haven't tried the salt
boiler hot springs yet.

00:21:49.176 --> 00:21:50.544
Thank you so much!

00:21:51.645 --> 00:21:54.481
(peaceful music)

00:21:57.518 --> 00:21:58.519
My dad, huh?

00:21:59.686 --> 00:22:03.757
Now I want to know about
him more than ever before!

00:22:10.831 --> 00:22:13.500
(Ending Theme Music)

00:22:25.812 --> 00:22:29.149
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:42.923
(upbeat music)

00:23:42.956 --> 00:23:44.725
Miss Tenten, I can't
thank you enough

00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:46.260
for bringing me all my things!

00:23:46.293 --> 00:23:48.195
I'm just relieved
everything's going so smoothly

00:23:48.228 --> 00:23:49.596
with you and the sensei.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.266
I'm not entirely sure if
I'm fitting in with them,

00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:53.634
but I'm managing somehow.

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:54.701
(Guy gasps)

00:23:54.735 --> 00:23:55.702
[Guy] It's terrible!

00:23:55.736 --> 00:23:57.237
(Guy screams)

00:23:57.271 --> 00:23:59.439
[Mirai] Mr. Guy! What happened?

00:23:59.473 --> 00:24:02.376
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:05.646
"The Steam Ninja Scrolls:
The Haunted Inn!"

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:07.614
[Guy] There was a ghost!

00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:09.750
(Guy screams)

00:24:09.783 --> 00:24:11.118
(Guy cries)

00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:14.488
(singing in Japanese)
