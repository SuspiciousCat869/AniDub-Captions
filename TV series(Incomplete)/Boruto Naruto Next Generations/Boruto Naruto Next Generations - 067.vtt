00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.317
(CHOJI) <i>Human Boulder!</i>

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.556
No way!

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:23.657
And Cho-Cho...

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.061
that one isn't the only jutsu
that's been passed down through
the Akimichi Clan!

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.630
That's so cool!

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:31.765
Now watch me very carefully...

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:35.302
This is a super-secret secret!

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:41.041
Releasing your chakra all at
once and surpassing the limits
of your physical power...

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.311
Butterfly Mode!

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:48.315
[grunt]

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.459
Did you see that, Cho-Cho?

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.428
This jutsu will also be-

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.064
[chewing]

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:07.100
Oh! Tomaru! You are super extra
cool!

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.305
[swooning]

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.579
Our two families are the most
bitter of enemies...

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:22.749
And that means... for us to fall
in love would be...

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:25.085
I will never betray you, dear.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:28.555
For... as long as you wear this
ring, our love...

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.992
...will shine brightly forever!

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.130

<i>I wonder if we raised her to</i>
<i>be too trendy...</i>

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:47.541
This is generations-old secret
<i>training, and she's hooked on</i>
<i>chips and a soap opera.</i>

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.110
Oh, Dad...?

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:50.978
Hm?

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:54.248
I need you to sign this form.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.115
Uh, sign it?

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.752
Yup! Sounds like this upcoming
mission is super complicated...

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.921
so they need to do a background
check.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.892
Hm? Blehhh! You got your
paperwork all greasy! Seriously,
Cho-Cho?!

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:07.995
Oh, wow Tomaru! You're so cool!

[nervous groan]

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:24.765
I see you've become quite adept
at physical transformations, as
expected.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:27.467
You are my son, after all.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:30.304
Now, then... you wanted me to
sign a form?

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:31.538
Mm.

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:38.779
The Ninja World has become quite
formal, hasn't it?

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:43.851
There's a section on the form
for guardian information. Are
you my father or my mother?

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:45.752
What should I write there?

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.255
That's a rather silly question.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.960
Although... I don't really care
either way. It's just...

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:57.764
At times, I've been a man, and
others, a woman...

00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:00.567
And even... something not of
this world.

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:05.272
Surface appearances are
meaningless.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:10.077
The will to uncover all truth,
that is the core of my being.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.980
[chuckle] But that won't fit on
your form...

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:15.115
Core...?

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.318
(OROCHIMARU) <i>You will understand</i>

(TOMARU) <i>I can't see into your</i>

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:23.724
[sigh]

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:26.326
But still, I can confirm the
truth.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.428
With my eyes...

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:30.130
...and my lips...

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.632
[gasps]

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:32.566
No, I can't do this!

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.134
Ah! My poor heart!

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.237
(TOMARU) <i>Like I said...</i>

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.373
<i>...as long as you wear this</i>
<i>ring...</i>

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.309
...the love that we share
will...

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.046
...shine brightly for ever and
ever...

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:49.416
Why do they keep saying the same
thing over and over?

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.384
Hey! Leave!

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:51.151
Ughh!

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:53.887
Please, try to focus on the
lesson, Cho-Cho.

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:57.925
Fine! You just bring Tomaru
here. And then I'll be happy to
train.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.293
Who's Tomaru?

00:05:59.326 --> 00:05:59.993
[gasp]

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:03.263
I hope this Tomaru crush-thing
is just some passing craze.

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:06.266
What's that supposed to mean?!
Speak for yourself, Mom.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.703
Was it a "passing craze" that
made you pick someone like Dad?

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:10.270
The hell...?!

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.272
Ohhh, bullseye!

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:15.676
That's enough outta you,
daughter! Or do you wanna fight
me?!

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.413
C'mon now, calm down, okay? I
love the both of you guys!

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.548
[growling] Huh?!

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:27.955
[sigh] I don't get it. How can
Dad be okay with being so dense?

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:30.224
Seriously! [chewing]

00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:35.329
I see. [chuckle] A dad who's
super sense? I know all too well
just what that's like...

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:37.564
[sigh]

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.234
Here.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:40.968
Hm?

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:44.204
Well for now, just eat these.
Consommé flavor.

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:44.972
Uh...

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:48.842
I've found that a few calories
make almost everything better.

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:49.877
Oh, uh, thanks...

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.545
Did you prefer lightly salted?

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.013
Oh! No!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.985
I'm not gonna let my life be
bound by calories! That's the
motto I live by!

00:06:58.485 --> 00:06:59.152
But, still...

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.056
I'm not gonna sit by and ignore
that troubled expression of
yours.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.928
It doesn't matter to me one
little bit if I'm bound by
friendship. Hm!

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:11.598
I mean, what can I say? I have a
big heart!

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:13.100
Thank you, Cho-Cho!

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:16.136
You're right. You really do have
a big heart, too.

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:19.106
"Too...?"

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:23.877
Ahhh! You have a big heart,
that's all!

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:28.916
So that just slipped out, huh?
You just insulted one of your
best friends! Didn't you?!

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.884
[nervous breath] I love you
Cho-Cho! [chuckle]

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:36.056
Yeah, well... a heart as big as
mine requires a big vessel to
carry it around in...

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.959
Exactly! You know what I mean!
You get it!

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:41.128
Yeah, it's true. I'm pretty much
perfect.

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.764
Although... there's one thing
that I'm missing...

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:44.731
What's that?

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:46.033
I need a man!

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:49.536
A really handsome guy to call my
own!

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:51.471
Uh...

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:53.407
[chattering]

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.209
[inhale and sigh]

00:07:55.242 --> 00:08:00.214
But you know... I think what I'm
gonna have to do is cut the size
of this vessel down...

00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:01.849
just a little bit at least...

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.951
You mean, like a diet?

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.086
And what's that? Is it edible?

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:09.256
Hello! Don't you remember the
motto I just told you?!

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:10.524
Uhhh...

00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:13.393
I'm not gonna let my life be
bound by calories! You got it?!

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:17.264
Okay, but, then how else are you
gonna make your "vessel"
smaller, then?

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:18.465
Ughhh!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.566
Just watch!

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:24.137
[grunt]

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.110
Cho-Cho...?

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.625
Hm!

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:47.461
W-What is this?

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:51.899
It's a super-secret secret of
the Akimichi Clan! But also, you
can call it...

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:54.101
Super Cho-Cho Butterfly Mode!

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:57.070
Wow!

00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:59.406
Amazing! That's just incredible!

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:05.746
The only thing is that unlike my
dad, when I use this, I can't
really amp up to maximum power.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.581
What? But that's totally not
good!

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:10.951
Nope, it isn't a problem!

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:14.721
The real issue is that now guys
will just stare at me even more
intensely than they normally do!

00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:15.055
Mmmm...

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.123
C'mon, let's go!

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:27.568
We're going to be bodyguards for
an A-list actor?

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:32.072
Yeah, it's a joint mission
that'll be utilizing both our
team and Team 10.

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.374
But to tell the truth, if we
have to guard someone...

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:37.711
then I'd prefer it a whole lot
more if it were an actress,
instead!

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.913
It shouldn't matter who we're
protecting, right?

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:44.985
Uhhh... Of course, it matters!
It's a huge issue that
determines how motivated you
are!

00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:46.620
You're late!

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:50.591
You're supposed to be at the
meeting place on time for a
mission!

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:51.992
[chuckle] Yeah, my bad!

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:58.265
<i>Hey, Sarada... Is that girl</i>
<i>the one that we're supposed</i>
<i>to...?</i>

00:09:58.298 --> 00:09:58.999
[chuckle]

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:01.969
Ehhhh!

00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:06.874
Uhhhh....! I-it's so nice to
meet you! Uh, my name is Bor-
wait, what?

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:08.475
Don't you recognize Cho-Cho?

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:12.880
Don't be ridiculous! Someone
that beautiful can't be Cho-Cho!
Don't insult her like that!

00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:16.583
Excuse me?! You're the only one
being insulting here, Boruto!

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.051
Seriously...?!

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.253
Okay, this is awkward...

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:22.589
You hear that? You see what I
mean about men?!

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:26.560
But what happened to you, then?
Are you feeling sick or
something like that?

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:30.764
Oh, please! I'm not sick in the
slightest bit. I've never been
healthier.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:33.066
What you're looking at is the
real me!

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.270
Cho-Cho, you're so uninhibited.

00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:39.940
Yeah, so what?! Look, don't go
declaring your love for me!

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:45.546
Just forget it! A rosy future
with someone plain like you is
nowhere near on my horizon.

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:49.283
Hmph! Try again some other time!

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:51.885
[chuckle] It seems that the
symptoms are getting worse...

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:55.989
All I was really trying to say
is that you're a free spirit...

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:02.829
[chattering]

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:04.831
[sigh] What is this weird
sensation...?

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:09.403
I just keep on having this
feeling like I'm gonna have some
kind of incredible encounter...

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:11.572
with a really handsome guy
today. [chuckle]

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:14.775
Steak over hamburger any day, am
I right, Sarada?

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:17.110
[chuckle] Yeah, I guess so...

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.147
Oh! Excuse me?

00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:22.382
Huh? Ah!

00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:26.119
Steak...! [smitten giggles]

00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:29.056
Can you tell me where to find
the Hokage's office?

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:32.693
Oh, uh... Hold on, are you two
the ones that we...

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:35.295
Oh, I'm so sorry!

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:38.599
My name's Tomaru. This is
Ashina, who plays my love
interest.

00:11:38.632 --> 00:11:39.233
A pleasure.

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:44.071
We came down here to talk to the
Hokage about a mission. But
we're lost.

00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:46.907
So you're here for the mission
we've been assigned today?

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.042
Well, that's quite a surprise,
huh, Cho-Cho?

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:51.612
<i>Cho-Cho...?</i>

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.283
The office is just up ahead...

00:11:56.316 --> 00:12:01.054
These guys seem so kind. That's
a big relief! Right, Ashina?

00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:02.155
I guess so.

00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:04.992
(NARUTO) <i>Yes?</i>

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:07.561
After you.

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.429
Oh, thanks.

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:11.164
Uh... [sigh]

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.403
Ah! Cho-Cho?! What happened? Are
you feeling sick or something-?!

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:19.072
I'm feeling perfectly fine,
thank you very much.

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:22.543
Wait, hold on. Let me guess. Did
you use that jutsu again?

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:26.213
Any way you look at it, your
appearance is just a sham...

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:27.981
Okay, it seems everyone's here.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.553
Let's get started then. Now, I'm
sure you've all guessed... but
your mission is to-

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:33.320
Lord Hokage...?

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.556
Hm?

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:39.159
I'm wondering if it's better if
I just explain to them what's
going on myself.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.974
You see... Ashina and I...

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.978
...have both had our lives
threatened.

00:12:58.512 --> 00:12:59.112
[gasps] What?!

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.981
[gasp]

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:12.159
So do you have any idea who's
behind these threats?

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:16.163
We have a suspicion that it's an
overzealous fan who hates the
fact that the characters...

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:18.699
played by these two actors are
lovers on the show.

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:21.535
I guess sometimes it's not so
easy being popular.

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:24.838
This isn't the first time I've
received threats like these.

00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:26.507
I think our producer is
overreacting.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.510
It's a serious threat! We can't
just overlook it, can we?!

00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:30.177
[sniffing]

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.678
Hm?

00:13:31.712 --> 00:13:34.181
Oh, wow! Actresses even smell
different than normal people...!

00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:37.518
Though we both know someone who
smells like potato chips.

00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:41.388
Hey, Sarada, give it to me
straight: do I smell like
consommé?

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:42.422
No. not at all.

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:47.661
Okay. Team 7 is assigned to Ms.
Ashina.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:48.862
Yes!

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:51.231
(NARUTO) <i>Team 10 will guard Mr.</i>
<i>Tomaru.</i>

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:54.034
Alright teams! Your bodyguard
mission starts now!

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:56.036
Yes, sir!

00:13:57.404 --> 00:14:00.140
[chattering]

00:14:00.174 --> 00:14:01.475
(FEMALE STAFF) <i>Okay, next!</i>

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:07.681
[chattering]

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:09.049
(FEMALE STAFF) <i>Okay, next!</i>

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.487
When you see behind the scenes,
everything on set is really
shabby...

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.455
Wow, blunt much...?

00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:17.491
(DIRECTOR) <i>Alright... your</i>
<i>mark's right there.</i>

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:20.661
And don't get in between the
hero and the camera.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:21.828
Ok. I'll be careful!

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.063
Great, thanks for that!

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:28.302
Tomaru, the scene we're shooting
today is a real tear-jerker! So
give it your all, as usual!

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:29.570
Right! You're the director!

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:31.471
[sigh]

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.842
Oh, no; my pen's run out of
ink... Huh?

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.810
Here, use this.

00:14:36.844 --> 00:14:39.947
Oh, great. Thank you. It was,
uh, Cho-Cho, wasn't it?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.081
Maybe...

00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:43.550
(FEMALE STAFF) <i>The shot's all</i>
<i>set up now!</i>

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:49.790
[sigh] So hot in here... Huh?

00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:51.191
Take this.

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:52.826
You're very thoughtful.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.396
(FEMALE STAFF) <i>Alright, that's</i>
<i>lunch! Back in half an hour!</i>

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.231
[sigh of relief]

00:14:58.432 --> 00:15:00.667
Oh, good. I wonder what they'll
have for lunch today? Huh?

00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:02.069
Here. Eat this.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.670
You're good!

00:15:03.704 --> 00:15:05.973
Oh, and is there anything to
drink?

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.074
Ah! Wait right here.

00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:13.046
Hmmm...

00:15:14.348 --> 00:15:16.850
Wow, that Cho-Cho girl really is
rather mysterious, isn't she?

00:15:16.884 --> 00:15:18.819
Hmmm, I want to know more...

00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:23.357
You're not wrong about that.
She's totally a mystery to us.
Isn't that right, Inojin?

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.325
Oh yeah, she's full of
surprises...

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:26.793
[chuckle]

00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:30.330
She seems like such a reserved,
shy girl... [chuckle]

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.369
I really didn't care for that
smile of his...

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:36.136
Me, either...

00:15:37.804 --> 00:15:40.774
[exasperated sigh] It seems
Boruto's team got the better end
of this whole deal...

00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:43.544
I wish I could be that actress's
<i>bodyguard instead...</i>

00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:45.712
Water!

00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:47.047
Ah! Right!

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.484
[gulping]

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:52.186
More fanning! Come on!

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:55.422
[angered breath] It's all so you
can be Hokage...

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.057
Remember that!

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.993
I need you to move your hands,
not your mouth!

00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:01.161
[trembling]

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:02.262
[uncomfortable chuckle]

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:04.064
Continue.

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:08.335
To the beautiful Miss Ashina,
This is my first fan letter...

00:16:08.368 --> 00:16:09.803
Next one.

00:16:09.837 --> 00:16:12.339
Miss Ashina, you're like a
goddess to me...

00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:13.073
Next one.

00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:16.176
You deserve to be sent straight
to hell.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:16.643
[gasps]

00:16:16.677 --> 00:16:17.244
Next one.

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:20.347
Eh! But wasn't that another
threatening letter just now?!

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.483
Ugh, I told you, I get them
practically every day.

00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:27.487
I can't get all worked up
whenever I get one of them.
Next!

00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:30.190
My beloved Ms. Ashina... When I
finally see you-

00:16:30.224 --> 00:16:33.327
Hey, you with the glasses! Get
me some cough drops.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.662
[grunting]

00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:39.333
[chattering]

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.667
[sigh] Huh?

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.303
Here you go. I didn't know what
you like to drink...

00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:45.572
so I just bought one of every
flavor they had.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.141
You're very kind, you know
that?

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:50.277
Not really. It's just how I
normally am.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:55.182
A girl who's as beautiful and
as stylish as you- and devoted
to her work... Frankly...

00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:56.717
that's every man's ideal dream!

00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:58.852
Hm?

00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:00.087
Sparkle!

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:02.256
Later!

00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:12.699
[heavy breathing]

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:17.337
Stupid, stupid, stupid! I'm
being so stupid! What in the
world is going on with me...

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:17.704
here?!

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:22.643
Why can't I just be myself in
front of Tomaru?! C'mon, drop
the fake attitude, Cho-Cho!

00:17:22.676 --> 00:17:24.077
[groan]

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:26.513
Uh, Cho-Cho...?

00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:27.814
Ahhh!

00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:31.718
W-What's up? And make it quick,
okay? I'm really busy...

00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:36.690
What is going on, Cho-Cho?
You're not the kind of person
who'd be subservient to anyone!

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:41.995
What do you mean? I treat
everyone the exact same way.
This is just how I normally am.

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:44.565
Come on! You're totally not
being yourself!

00:17:44.598 --> 00:17:46.366
Oh, wait, that's right...

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.069
Here. The consomme-flavored
chips you gave me.

00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:53.640
No, thanks. I don't want any of
those right now.

00:17:53.674 --> 00:17:54.241
But, you-!

00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:58.078
Sometimes even I don't feel like
eating anything! [heavy
breathing]

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.080
Cho-Cho...

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.254
[sigh]

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:09.823
(TOMARU) <i>Oh Cho-Cho!</i>

00:18:09.857 --> 00:18:10.257
Huh...?

00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:13.227
Thank goodness. I forgot to ask
you something earlier.

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:19.867
Here. This is an important prop.
Can I ask you to take care of
it?

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.339
With the death threat, I think
it's too risky to leave it in
the dressing room, don't you?

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:25.973
Th-This is the...

00:18:26.974 --> 00:18:29.243
I appreciate it! Thanks so much,
my bodyguard!

00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:34.248
[gasp and gulp]

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:41.255
Aweee!

00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:44.858
As long as you wear this ring...

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:46.727
...the love that we share
will...

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:51.498
...shine brightly for ever and
ever...

00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:57.804
That's it! I've made up my mind!
I am gonna marry Tomaru!

00:18:57.838 --> 00:19:00.040
Ninja training's over! Now
begins...

00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:03.010
...marriage training!

00:19:03.043 --> 00:19:07.814
Oh, Tomaru! We're gonna haveta
pick a date for our ceremony!
Oh!

00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:11.652
[worried screaming]

00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:12.986
Hey, are you okay?!

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.656
Yeah, I'm just fine, but...
[gasp]

00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:19.059
[straining]

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:31.238
[grunt] Who are you?!

00:19:32.906 --> 00:19:34.374
Where were you, Cho-Cho?!

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:35.342
Sorry!

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:36.210
Where's Ashina?!

00:19:36.243 --> 00:19:38.245
Mitsuki's with her. What's the
status?

00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:42.316
There's something in his hand!

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:43.150
[grunt]

00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:46.486
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:19:48.288 --> 00:19:48.722
A clone?!

00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:56.230
[grunt] Smokescreen!

00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:58.332
Mm. Oh!

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:58.999
Quick! This way!

00:19:59.032 --> 00:19:59.566
[coughing]

00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:03.470
Alright!

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.039
He's moving!

00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:08.308
Stop him! We'll catch and
question him!

00:20:10.077 --> 00:20:11.712
Ninja Art! Super Beast Scroll!

00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:22.256
Finish him, Cho-Cho!

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:23.257
Right!

00:20:23.891 --> 00:20:24.725
Rebound!

00:20:25.592 --> 00:20:27.694
And now Partial Expansion-

00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:28.495
(TOMARU) [coughing]

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:29.062
Huh?!

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:34.034
<i>Actually...</i>

00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:38.071
Hey!

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.542
[pained grunts]

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:43.844
Damn it! Get him!

00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:46.046
Cho-Cho, get serious!

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:49.249
Yeah, sure, that's easy for you
to say... [grunt]

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:59.159
I'm sorry. He got away. It's all
my fault.

00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:01.862
(PRODUCER) <i>What are you going to</i>
<i>do about it?!</i>

00:21:01.895 --> 00:21:06.834
Because you guys dropped the
ball on this one, our talent got
injured! You see that?!

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:11.171
We have to find a replacement
immediately or we won't make our
broadcast schedule!

00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:11.305
[groan]

00:21:12.005 --> 00:21:13.073
(TOMARU) <i>I have an idea...</i>

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:19.146
What do you say about giving
them a chance to redeem
themselves?

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:21.181
What do you mean by that?

00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:24.651
We need a replacement... Why not
let Cho-Cho take over the part?

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:25.552
[gasp] Me?! Really?!

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.321
Hmmm...

00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:31.325
That thing you did earlier
with the butterfly wings was
beautiful.

00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:32.960
[nervous groan]

00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:35.562
I'm sure you'd be absolutely
perfect for the role.

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:39.566
And besides, there's a really
cool scene that you'd get to
perform with me...

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:55.449
[trembling and nervous
breathing] [grunt]

00:21:55.482 --> 00:22:01.722
A-A-A... A-a-a... A kissing
scene...?!

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:07.494
This is it! This is it, this is
it!

00:23:43.891 --> 00:23:48.562
(CHO-CHO) <i>You see, when you're a</i>
<i>true lady like I am, scenes</i>
<i>are written especially for...</i>

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:51.064
you, camera angles are
arranged especially for you...

00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:55.035
But more than anything else...
<i>when you have a leading lady</i>
<i>like me...</i>

00:23:55.068 --> 00:23:57.204
<i>they write kissing scenes</i>
<i>especially for you-</i>

00:23:57.237 --> 00:23:59.373
(SARADA) <i>Cho-Cho! The scene's</i>
<i>about to start!</i>

00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:02.809
(CHO-CHO) [nervous groans and
breathing]

00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:08.215
(SARADA) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: "Super
<i>Cho-Cho Kiss Mode!"</i>

00:24:08.248 --> 00:24:13.053
(CHO-CHO) <i>I want to confirm</i>
everything... with your eyes...
<i>and your lips!</i>
