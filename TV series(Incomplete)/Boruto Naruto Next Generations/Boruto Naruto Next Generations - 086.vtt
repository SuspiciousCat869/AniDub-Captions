Where exactly are you taking
me, Old Man?

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.083
You'll find out soon.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.285
Earlier, you told me...

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:21.455
you want to create a world where
everyone can live happily.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.123
So, what was that all about, ya
know?

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.626
The place where we're
going...

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:30.097

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:33.634
We're here.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.070
Uhh...we're where?

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.407
I told you the story
back in the Leaf, didn't I?

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.211
About how my grandchild
died?

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:47.080
[BORUTO] <i>Oh yeah. His name was</i>

You're saying that all of this

while I was under a genjutsu?!

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.599
And also, Lady Kurotsuchi is...

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:46.633
(FRUSTRATED)

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.137
Since that's the case, we must
notify the other villages!

we're assuming control of the

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.056
This is all for the sake of
the Master.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.742
It's rather disappointing...

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.978
Is this really all that the
Stone's capable of...

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.913
under Kurotsuchi?

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.916
I'm leaving you in command of
the Akuta.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.019
Understood. By the
way, Lord Ku...

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.754
...is it true that the
Leaf Shinobi...

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.356
in our custody has escaped?

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.292
Right now, finding the location
of the master is our priority.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.995
The other's just one rat.

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.330

It's nothing. I understand.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.144
This is where your
grandson died?

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.445
Yes.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:11.618
This entire thing started when
I lost my grandchild Kozuchi.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.390
The Fourth Great Ninja War...

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:20.160
<i>left massive scars upon the</i>
<i>world...</i>

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:24.097
<i>And our village... was</i>
<i>no exception.</i>

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.000
<i>We toiled away day and</i>
<i>night restoring it...</i>

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.468
<i>and in a few years,...</i>

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:33.073
<i>...we somehow managed</i>
<i>to build a new town.</i>

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.107
<i>(SIGH) But...</i>

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.177
During this last Great
War...

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:40.814
the Stone suffered a
truly devastating loss of life.

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:44.151
The young generation lacks the
skills to make up for it.

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:46.553
So how are we going to
compensate for that?

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:49.623
Listen... the age of Great
Wars is over now.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:53.126
Just give it time...
and nurture their talent.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.996
You know, Grandfather, now that
you've retired...

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.665
You manage to make everything
sound so easy!

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.666
(CHUCKLE)

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.001
You're leaving?

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.103
I promised that I'd meet up with
Kozuchi.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:09.009
(CHUCKLE) He has really embraced
being a grandpa.

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:16.583
Welcome home, Grandpa!

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:20.287
Oh, hello! I'm sorry that I'm so
late, Kozuchi!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.292
[OHNOKI] <i>Well, you seem awfully</i>
<i>happy!</i>

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.394
(CHUCKLE) That's
right, I am!

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.731
The Genin Exams are
about to begin and I can't wait!

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:33.967
Oh, that's right! You're finally
at that age now, aren't you?

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.036
Kozuchi, from here on out...

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.641
it's all going to be up to young
shinobi like you.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.778
I've lived a very long life, and
I have no regrets now.

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.914
Whattaya mean?! You gotta live
longer!

00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:49.483
...and see me become a
jonin- No...

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:52.152
You gotta see me become the
Tsuchikage, you got it?

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.788
Oh! Tsuchikage, huh?

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.491
Then I guess I'd better teach
you the precious words...

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.659
that I live by...

00:05:58.692 --> 00:05:59.626
(EAGER)

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:04.164
The shinobi who manages to
become the Tsuchikage...

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:05.999
must never run away.

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:08.635
He must confront every
difficulty.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.472
Having a will strong enough to
do so is essential.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:15.943
To never run away... And have a
strong will...

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:18.412
Do you believe you have that, my
boy?

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:19.780
I sure do!

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:21.114
Just you watch!

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:24.151
I'll become a Tsuchikage that'll
surpass even you!

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:25.886
My, my! You have so much
confidence!

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.956
(CHUCKLE)

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.991
I have high hopes for you,
Kozuchi.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.926
(AFFIRMATIVE) Hm.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.162
<i>[OHNOKI] "I have no regrets</i>

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:41.268
<i>However...</i>

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.140
How strange. Kozuchi's much
later than usual today.

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:50.143
I wonder where he could
be loitering about...

It's still possible!

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.022

Kozuchi...

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:06.286
Tell me! Tell me the reason
why Kozuchi had to die!

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.889
Kozuchi just happened to learn
that robbers...

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:09.990
were about to attack...

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:12.993
and he went to confront them
alone...

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.429
...to hold them until
reinforcements came.

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:17.264
By himself.

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:20.133
You mean... Was it because I
told him...

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:23.103
...that he should never run
away?

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:25.005
No...

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.978
What have I done?!

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:35.649
I foolishly thought that the
world was at peace now...

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.486
and I placed such high
expectations upon him...

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.222
This is the direct result of
that!

00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:47.361
What have I done?! It's as
if I killed Kozuchi myself!

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:55.335

[KUROTSUCHI] <i>It's</i>

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:20.561
[OHNOKI] I was like the walking

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.101
<i>And then, one day...</i>

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:38.145
This notebook was discovered
among his belongings.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:40.280
It's Kozuchi's?

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:45.452
I'm giving it to you.

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:55.095

<i>that the peace we have in</i>

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.067

<i>who risked their lives to</i>
<i>achieve it.</i>

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:05.572
...I want to become a shinobi

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:15.415
...And this time, I'll be the
one who protects the peace...

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:19.152
...by becoming a great
Tsuchikage, just like Grandpa.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.092
[OHNOKI] <i>Yes... It's the least I</i>
<i>can do...</i>

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:30.430
<i>I must be the one to</i>
<i>fulfill Kozuchi's will!</i>

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:34.735
There must never be another
tragic death like yours, my boy.

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:36.537
I'll build a lasting peace...

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.407
so that young lives will never
be sacrificed again.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.111
That will be my tribute
to you,... Kozuchi!

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:49.883
[OHNOKI] But what could I do to
<i>achieve that goal?</i>

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:52.319
I gave it a lot of thought...

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:56.256
And at last... I came up with a
<i>solution.</i>

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.992
<i>If those who were to fight</i>
<i>weren't human...</i>

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:02.329
but instead were soldiers who
<i>had no will...</i>

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:05.933
and did exactly as ordered...

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.135
<i>I unearthed jutsu that</i>
<i>had been lost...</i>

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.370
<i>and tried to create soldiers</i>
<i>with no will of...</i>

00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:13.707
...their own who would do the
<i>fighting for humans...</i>

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.544
But they were defective and
proved to be uncontrollable...

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:20.047
<i>There was no way Kurotsuchi</i>
<i>and the others...</i>

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.115
<i>would approve of such</i>
<i>soldiers...</i>

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:28.055
<i>I tried everything I could</i>
<i>possibly think of...</i>

00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:30.157
<i>in search of a breakthrough.</i>

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.660
Then the solution came
from a most unexpected source...

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:38.432
So? What did you want to talk
about in private?

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:42.135
It's about this plan that you're
trying to advance, Lord Ohnoki.

00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:44.304
Perhaps I might be of
some assistance to you.

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:45.539
How so?

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:47.708
This is a sample of something
that was discovered...

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:50.677
the other day at a certain ruin.

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:52.479
This is--!

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.982
[DOCTOR] <i>Wouldn't you agree</i>
<i>that, with this...</i>

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:57.017
great progress can be made in
<i>the research...</i>

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.953
to create non-human soldiers?

00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:02.422
Why would you bring this
directly to me?

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:05.359
Because I am completely in
support of your grand plan...

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.093
Lord Third.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:08.562
Rather than show this to Lady
Kurotsuchi...

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.063
I thought that first...

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:13.166
But still... to rely on
something like this...

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:16.270
Would people truly approve of
it?

00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:26.146
What should I do about this?

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:29.283
<i>Kozuchi...</i>

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:36.623
I must carry on Kozuchi's will
<i>and fulfill his wish!</i>

00:12:36.657 --> 00:12:42.496
To do so... even if the means
might be detestable... I will--!

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:47.167
<i>There was an old underground</i>
<i>facility...</i>

00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:50.003
<i>that hadn't been used</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:54.708
I secretly made it my base...
<i>and revived my plan.</i>

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:57.144
<i>We used the sample that</i>
<i>had been brought to me...</i>

00:12:57.177 --> 00:13:00.013
<i>and the plan to create</i>
<i>artificial life...</i>

00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:03.517
which we called "Fabrications,"
<i>began in earnest.</i>

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.655
<i>First came Ku, who was</i>
<i>essentially a clone of me.</i>

00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:12.159
He was the one who would command
<i>the other soldiers...</i>

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:14.161
<i>Then came four more</i>
<i>Fabrications...</i>

00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:17.998
<i>who would serve as his arms</i>
<i>and legs...</i>

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:21.001
<i>And finally,... to be</i>
<i>led by those five...</i>

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:23.637
<i>the Akuta troops were born.</i>

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:27.975
<i>Once we perfect these</i>
<i>beings...</i>

00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:31.144
<i>the peace in the Stone</i>
<i>will be protected.</i>

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:33.046
<i>And Kurotsuchi will have no</i>
<i>choice...</i>

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.149
<i>but to acknowledge that I</i>
<i>was right.</i>

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:39.019
If we let non-humans do all the
fighting...

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:42.155
then there will never
again be another tragedy

00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:44.858
where young lives are lost.

00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:47.160
We've almost achieved it,
Kozuchi.

00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:52.599
So that's the story...

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:56.103
I simply must bring this plan to
completion.

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:59.439
Because doing so is fulfilling
Kozuchi's will.

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:01.108
Old Man...

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:04.044
I shared this story
with you...

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:07.114
because I believed
that you would understand.

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:12.186
I'm not even considering using
the Akuta...

00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:15.923
...to conquer any territory
that's owned by another land.

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.624
In fact, it's just the opposite.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.426
In the end...

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:22.729
this power is for preserving the
peace in the Stone...

00:14:22.763 --> 00:14:24.998
and the whole shinobi world.

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:28.001
The reason that all of you were
captured

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.137
...was just to prevent you from
<i>interfering</i>

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.306
<i>with the plan's completion.</i>

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.441
<i>Once it's done, you'll</i>
<i>be released.</i>

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.979
So you didn't want to fight us
in the first place?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.649
Not as long as you didn't get in
my way.

00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:47.120
So, then? Do you still have a
reason to oppose me and my plan?

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:49.189
Well, it's just that...

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.491
What is it?

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:57.164
Well... you said there was a
sample that marked a turning

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.999
point for your research, right?

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:00.000
(CURIOUS)

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.635
[BORUTO] <i>So... what was it?</i>

00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:06.640
[OHNOKI] <i>Something that you're</i>
<i>very familiar with.</i>

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:10.143
Yes...

00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:13.180
...it's a White Zetsu!

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:20.487
A White Zetsu?!

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:27.194
You're seriously using a
dangerous monster like that?

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:28.629
What're you even thinking?!

00:15:28.662 --> 00:15:30.664
I'm aware of the danger.

00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:33.100
But still! That creature...

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:36.170
was created by the Otsutsuki,
right?

00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:40.040
I admit, there are still things
that remain a mystery.

00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:43.177
And that's why Mitsuki is so
critical for us.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.312
Mitsuki? What do you mean?

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:47.881
Despite our research...

00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:51.018
the life of a Fabrication is
still unstable.

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.654
To put it simply, they don't
live very long.

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:56.990
What? How long do they live for?

00:15:57.024 --> 00:15:59.326
A year or perhaps just a few
months...

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:02.296
Sometimes even the next day...

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:05.699
they can just suddenly stop
functioning all together.

00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:09.269
Mitsuki can provide the means to
resolve all that.

00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:13.340
A perfect synthetic human...
Once we study his body...

00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:16.043
...we can fix the defects in the
Fabrications.

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:19.446
With that data, we can then
make perfect ones.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:23.317
And at that time, we'll gladly
release Mitsuki.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.120
[OHNOKI] <i>What he decides to do</i>
<i>after that is all up to him.</i>

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:29.323
You're saying you don't
intend to hurt him, then?

00:16:29.857 --> 00:16:31.291
Of course not!

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:35.696
I'd never want to do that. All I
want is peace, that's it!

00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:36.663
Peace, huh...?

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:41.034
Well... I've been honest with
you and told you everything.

00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:43.637
So do you still mistrust me?

00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:45.272
Well I-!

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:50.143
I won't ask you to cooperate.
However...

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:53.947
...there's no reason for
conflict to exist between us.

00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:56.950
Protecting the peace of the
shinobi world.

00:16:56.984 --> 00:16:59.553
And preventing the loss of
lives...

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:00.721
As a shinobi...

00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:04.691
I'm sure that you must feel the
same way I do, Boruto...

00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:05.659
Am I wrong?

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:07.327
Old Man...

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.138
<i>This is a coup d'état!</i>

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:22.176
Don't they care at all about how
<i>this is going to be received?</i>

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.545
I've got to get word back to my
<i>dad!</i>

00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:30.117
Seems all the key points of
the village have been secured.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.319
Anyone who tries to interfere
been jailed.

00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:34.955
Two birds with one stone...

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:37.424
And we also got the "things"
that we need.

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:38.358
(MILD SHOVING)

00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:43.163
We chose five... just like you
ordered.

00:17:44.164 --> 00:17:46.433
So you're saying, if we use
their hearts...

00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:49.102
then we'll be able to extend our
lives?

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:51.338
That's right. But we can't lay
a finger on them...

00:17:51.371 --> 00:17:53.340
without the Master's permission.

00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:57.311
What?! That's crazy, Lord Ku!
After we've come this far?!

00:17:57.644 --> 00:17:59.112
I said no!

00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:02.182
It's contrary to the Master's
plan to take human lives!

00:18:02.216 --> 00:18:05.953
Yes, but this isn't the time to
be so cautious!

00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:08.355
The Master has the final say in
all this.

00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:11.525
Just make sure everything's
ready.

00:18:11.558 --> 00:18:12.359
(ANNOYED)

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:15.162
Alright, as you wish, sir.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.031
(CURIOUS)

00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:20.334
So, what are we supposed to do
now?!

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:22.836
Split up and continue to search
for the Master.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.873
However, don't go overboard.

00:18:25.906 --> 00:18:29.009
Are you actually worried about
us, Lord Ku?

00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:31.745
We are tools that the Master
needs to finish this.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.947
We can't take risks.

00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:35.782
But what if we don't finish it
in time?

00:18:35.816 --> 00:18:38.185
We have a way to live right now!

00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:41.088
And yet you want us to just wait
for death to arrive?!

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.656
When the time comes...

00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:46.326
...a little sacrifice can't
be helped.

00:18:46.994 --> 00:18:48.462
Oh, my!

00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:50.697
My wish is the same as the
Master's.

00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:55.135
And I am certain that this is
what he would want!

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:01.008
I get what you were talking
about before...

00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:03.010
...that you've genuinely been
thinking about...

00:19:03.043 --> 00:19:04.678
how to maintain peace.

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:08.715
That's right! So that young
lives need not be sacrificed...

00:19:08.749 --> 00:19:11.752
the Fabrications are essential.

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:13.453
But, Old Man...

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:14.621
(CURIOUS) Hm?

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:17.024
I'll admit I don't know too
much about them.

00:19:17.057 --> 00:19:19.693
I had run-ins with two of
them...

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:20.661
...but still...

00:19:22.196 --> 00:19:25.065
They could talk and think just
<i>like us humans. And...</i>

00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:28.068
it seemed to me they had their
<i>own personalities, too.</i>

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:31.972
So having guys like that fight
for us...

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.842
I mean... what's the
difference between us and them

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:37.044
going off to fight?

00:19:37.077 --> 00:19:39.513
They may look like humans, but
like their name...

00:19:39.546 --> 00:19:43.016
they're really nothing more
than Fabrications, that's all!

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.786
What seem to be a will and
personality...

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:48.021
are just programmed functions.

00:19:48.055 --> 00:19:49.656
Do you really believe that's
true?

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:51.191
What's that?

00:19:52.326 --> 00:19:54.862
Your belief in a "will" is
much stronger than most.

00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:58.765
Just like what you taught us
back at the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.700
(TAKEN BACK)

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:04.137
And yet here you are saying
the Fabrications have no will...

00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:06.406
Do you really mean that?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.743
C'mon, be honest! Do you
really believe that?

00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:10.677
(shocked)

00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:13.380
This is ridiculous.

00:20:13.413 --> 00:20:17.451
What a strange thing to say when
you know nothing about them.

00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:18.952
Yeah, maybe...

00:20:18.986 --> 00:20:22.289
But... I do know something about
Mitsuki.

00:20:22.322 --> 00:20:25.659
He and those guys acted
like they were true friends.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:35.169
Mitsuki does have a will.

00:20:35.802 --> 00:20:37.271
Which means...

00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:40.474
you have no proof that those
guys don't have one, do you?

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:41.308
(UNCERTAIN)

00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:44.011
And if they do have a will...

00:20:44.044 --> 00:20:47.014
How are they any different from
humans?

00:20:47.047 --> 00:20:50.150
Is sacrificing them different
than a person?

00:20:50.517 --> 00:20:51.518
(DISTRESSED)

00:20:52.986 --> 00:20:55.022
Look, don't get so emotional.

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.724
While they're alike in
appearance...

00:20:57.758 --> 00:21:00.394
Fabrications are not human.

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:04.164
And it's possible that the same
applies to Mitsuki, as well.

00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:07.467
What's that?! Are you saying
Mitsuki doesn't have a will?!

00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:09.636
On what grounds can you say he
does?

00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:13.841
Come on! Of course Mitsuki has
a will!

00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:15.309
If you wanna know the truth...

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:19.146
I don't think you even know what
you're talking about, Old Man!

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.114
There's just no way

00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:24.151
I'd ever cooperate with a plan
like yours.

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:28.288
I've explained to you what I
wish to do.

00:21:28.322 --> 00:21:31.091
If I still haven't managed to
convince you,...

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:35.028
if you still oppose my heartfelt
vow...

00:21:35.062 --> 00:21:37.364
...then it can't be helped.

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:40.501
I suppose we'll just have
to go back to being enemies.

00:21:41.001 --> 00:21:43.470
(ANGRY)

00:21:44.838 --> 00:21:47.007
It appears that someone has come
for us.

00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:48.675
