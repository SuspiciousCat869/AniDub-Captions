WEBVTT

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.378
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.211
(suspenseful music)

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.722
Dammit!

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:02.723
Hmm?

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:05.058
(winces)

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.762
(grunts)

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.702
Let go!

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:17.504
You've seen what he can do.

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.641
You are simply no match
for the Otsutsuki.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:21.975
Taking your eyes off me?

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.310
So confident.

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.292
Father!

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:40.093
Shinki, you...

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:41.962
I said to protect Shukaku.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.830
Yes, but...

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:46.033
(gasps)

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:52.139
(dramatic music)

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.617
(gasping)

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.162
(roaring)

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.206
Imagine that, appearing
all on his own.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:38.051
(chuckling)

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:54.201
(grunting)

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:11.485
Magnificent.

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:14.188
Huh?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.230
Your chakra shall
become mine now.

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.288
(grunting)

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:56.163
Grand Sand Mausoleum Seal!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.502
Well, now you've
gone and done it,

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:04.471
but I guess I can
sit and bide my time.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.345
(panting)

00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.181
(yells)

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:15.215
Father!

00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:24.525
Gaara!

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:25.559
[Both] Lord Fifth!

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:33.867
You guys, what's going on?

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:35.936
[Kankuro] Boruto,
why are you here?

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.337
Please, I got to know.

00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:39.606
What was that, what
happened to Sasuke?

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:45.746
He seems to have been
sent to another dimension.

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:50.551
But knowing him, he'll be able
to make it back on his own.

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:51.852
(winces)

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:53.954
[Shinki] Father, don't
overexert yourself.

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:57.057
We received word from
Sasuke that the Otsutsuki

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.026
was targeting Shukaku.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.262
We assembled here in
order to protect Shukaku

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:04.531
but we didn't expect
the Otsutsuki

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:06.099
to show up quite so soon.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.570
Did you bring him
down with that?

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.206
Not yet.

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:16.443
The Grand Sand Mausoleum Seal
won't hold him completely.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.613
He'll revive in time.

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:24.284
So before he does, we must
get Shukaku to a safe place.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.321
Shinki, the item.

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:32.993
What is that?

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:35.095
Just be quiet a
minute and watch.

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.866
I got to say, you
look pretty beat up.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.734
It's nothing serious.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.571
Will you do as I ask?

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.541
I'm gonna pass, thanks.

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:52.079
[Gaara] The Otsutsuki
can sense your chakra.

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:53.847
To prevent that,
we have no choice

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.517
but to use the tea kettle.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.320
Forget it, I refuse
to go into that thing.

00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:01.555
I promise you

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.628
on my honor I will protect
you from the Otsutsuki.

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.697
You're gonna perform
the sealing jutsu

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:11.965
in your condition?

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:13.300
You'll die.

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:17.337
An easy sacrifice to
make to protect you.

00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:22.209
(suspenseful music)

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:32.085
If you die I have to admit
that I wouldn't cry for you,

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:35.722
but I don't want you coming
back as a ghost to haunt me

00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:38.091
so this time I'll
go in on my own.

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:54.141
Thank you, friend.

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.582
(Gaara groaning)

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:06.420
Kankuro, will you take on
a troublesome job for me?

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:07.821
Sure, what?

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:10.991
Go take Shukaku to
the Hidden Leaf.

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:12.526
The Hidden Leaf?

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:13.527
So...

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.262
Yes, to Naruto.

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.831
At this point, it's
the only place.

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:19.499
I'll call for reinforcements.

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.069
I'm afraid we don't
have time for that.

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:25.205
The Grand Sand Mausoleum
won't hold long.

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:28.208
You bring Shukaku.

00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:31.044
With your speed,
it'll take three days.

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:34.348
This is really turning
into a mess, huh?

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.453
I have one more
troublesome request.

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:41.588
Hmm?

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:49.730
The three of us
are gonna take him?

00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:51.398
If we consider teamwork,

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:54.401
it's best if only people
from the sand take him.

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:58.505
We're going to need Boruto's
knowledge of the Leafs terrain.

00:08:58.539 --> 00:08:59.540
Yes, but...

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:04.178
Can I entrust this
to you, Shinki?

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:11.718
Yodo and Araya will escort
Gaara back to our village

00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:13.320
and that's an order.

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.354
[Both] Right!

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.623
Any objections, Shinki?

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.228
Right, I'm on it.

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:22.996
[Kankuro] Boruto,
can we rely on you

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.566
to guide us once we're
in the Land of Fire?

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:26.567
Sure.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.901
But can you really do this?

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:29.236
What was that?

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.806
Shinki, you're the only
ones I can trust with this.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.208
But...

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:37.911
Boruto has something that
you don't possess just yet.

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:39.079
(gasps)

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:41.381
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.184
I'm sure you'll come
to learn what it is.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.056
Okay, I understand.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.959
Whoa, this thing's pretty heavy.

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:53.360
Hey, don't touch that.

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:55.996
Give me a break, it's
not like you own it.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:58.165
[Shukaku] Hey, be
gentler, would ya?

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:02.836
-(Shukaku grunting)
-Huh?

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.837
Boo.

00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:04.838
(Boruto gasping)

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.573
Oh, shut up.

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:07.674
Here we go.

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.744
Pon poko pon.

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:14.948
I hate being in
this weird thing.

00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:17.784
It's for your own protection.

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:19.520
And what do we do
in an emergency?

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:22.122
There's no way I
can fight like this.

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.825
You will be fine with
Kankuro and the others.

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:26.193
Hmm?

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:27.995
Please, Master Shukaku.

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:29.796
Come, I'll carry you.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.998
Oh, okay.

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:32.599
Here we go, pardon me.

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:36.436
You're just way too uptight.

00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:38.672
(growls)

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:39.973
Hmph.

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:41.208
[Kankuro] It can't be helped.

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:42.976
Boruto, you'll
have to carry him.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.212
Sure, but stay still, okay?

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:48.048
Hey, just who do you think
you're talking to here?

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.117
Yodo, Araya.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.952
I'm leaving father
in your hands.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.353
Just leave it to us.

00:10:53.387 --> 00:10:56.089
Don't worry, we'll protect
him with our lives.

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.060
Let's go.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.632
[Shinki] Just don't fall
behind, Boruto Uzumaki.

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.935
[Boruto] Quit using my
full name all the time.

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.437
[Kankuro] Can you two at
least try to get along?

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.605
[Boruto] He started it!

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.911
(wincing)

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:19.680
Are you all right?

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:34.995
(birds screeching)

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:41.168
I told you that you
need to keep up.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.071
We don't have time to slow
down and match your pace.

00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:46.807
Dammit, I'm not used
to running on sand

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.809
and I'm carrying
the tanuki, okay?

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.511
What'd you call me?

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:55.849
Hey, are you sure we
should be going this way?

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.084
Of course.

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:59.386
But the Hidden Leaf
Village is that way.

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:03.123
Look, just shut your mouth
and carry Master Shukaku.

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.661
(growls)

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.702
(panting)

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.571
You tired?

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.974
It's nothing I can't handle.

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:24.011
I couldn't find anything.

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:25.145
[Kankuro] I see.

00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:27.014
What is this place, anyway?

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.416
It's a wind power station.

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:31.552
It was built but didn't
end up working out,

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:34.888
so, as you can see,
it was abandoned.

00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.823
I thought we'd find some
communication equipment

00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:40.394
if we came here, but
I guess I was wrong.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.729
[Boruto] I wish you would
have just explained it

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:43.897
to me from the start.

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:45.699
Didn't I tell you?

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:46.967
(growling)

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.336
[Shinki] Uncle,
please take a look.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:50.370
Hmm?

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:52.673
A map?

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:55.742
It looks to me like
there's no close facility

00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:57.611
where we could contact the Leaf.

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:01.648
Too bad, I wanted to get in
touch with them beforehand.

00:13:01.682 --> 00:13:05.552
But I guess our only choice
is to head straight there.

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:06.486
[Shinki] In that case,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.722
I can think of three
routes we can take.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.368
(grunting)

00:13:22.503 --> 00:13:24.805
Come on, I'm thirsty.

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:25.806
Boruto.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:26.940
Yeah, what is it?

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.375
I gotta take a leak.

00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:31.545
Huh?

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:34.715
Wait, are you telling me
tailed beasts have to pee?

00:13:34.748 --> 00:13:35.716
Of course.

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:37.084
What, you don't believe me?

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:38.719
No, of course I believe you.

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:40.287
It's just...

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.656
Too late, I can't
hold it, I gotta go.

00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.627
All right, all right.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.062
(straining)

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.766
You going or what?

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:53.867
(laughs nervously)

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.636
Right, I'll just be a sec.

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.274
Where are you going?

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:02.876
Just do it there and
cover it with some sand.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.811
Yeah, right. Give me
a break, would you?

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:06.246
I'm not a cat!

00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:12.152
No peeking!

00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:15.622
Why in the world
would I want to?

00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:16.823
(sighs)

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:18.725
Is he really even
a tailed beast?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.696
Great, then the route's settled.

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:23.730
Go get Boruto.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.670
It's so hot.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:30.671
Let's go.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:31.972
Hmm?

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:34.675
We gotta wait, Shukaku is...

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:35.843
What's wrong?

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:38.512
Nothing, he just said
he needed to pee, so...

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.747
Tailed beasts don't
need to do that!

00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:41.982
What?

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:45.853
Ah, finally I get a
little alone time.

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:48.255
Now I can stretch out and relax.

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.890
[Shinki] Master
Shukaku, there you are.

00:14:49.923 --> 00:14:51.091
Huh?

00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:52.960
You've got some
nerve tricking me.

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:55.629
Ah, you got me and so fast too.

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:58.031
We can't have you
wandering off on your own.

00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:00.367
Are you telling me that
I'm not even allowed

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.468
to take a break?

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:03.270
For right now, yes.

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.404
What a pain.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:06.206
Come on, let's go.

00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:08.876
Huh?

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:11.245
(gasping)

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:15.249
What do you think you're doing?

00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:18.018
It was a mistake to have
left this in your hands.

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.621
I'll hold onto Master Shukaku.

00:15:20.654 --> 00:15:22.222
That wasn't the agreement.

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:23.757
Face it, you messed up.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.025
Now don't be so immature.

00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:27.561
I feel bad I let
him out of my sight,

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.029
but it's mean to ignore him.

00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:32.533
That's what I mean by immature,
we're on a mission here.

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:35.068
Getting emotional will
only cause more mistakes.

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:37.204
So I'm supposed to
act like a machine?

00:15:37.237 --> 00:15:38.972
Well no thanks, I won't do it.

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.708
I'm just saying that you
have to think rationally.

00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:46.346
All right you two,
that's enough.

00:15:48.182 --> 00:15:50.984
Shinki, go prepare to depart.

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:57.157
Think about what
you did wrong here.

00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:59.626
Yeah, I know, believe me.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.298
But I just don't like
the way he talks to me.

00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:07.534
So you'll only listen if
you're spoken to nicely?

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:10.971
Now that's definitely
immature, don't you think?

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:13.974
(winces)

00:16:14.007 --> 00:16:16.643
Look, I understand
your frustration.

00:16:16.677 --> 00:16:20.514
I know Shinki is very
blunt, try and forgive him.

00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:25.085
(sighs)

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:27.454
He's just such a drag.

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:30.257
Hmm.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.427
So, need to rest some more?

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.995
No, I don't need to.

00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:37.397
Besides I don't
want to lose to him.

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:39.533
That's the spirit.

00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:53.714
(suspenseful music)

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:20.374
(panting)

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.076
Hold up.

00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:29.383
I think we should
camp here tonight.

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:32.119
I'm so tired.

00:17:52.573 --> 00:17:54.508
No sign of the enemy nearby.

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:02.616
I'll just go ahead and
take watch, get some sleep.

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:05.118
No, I can stand guard.

00:18:05.152 --> 00:18:08.222
Please Uncle, I think
you should rest for now.

00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:10.624
Aren't you being a
little overzealous?

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:12.759
I understand you want
to fulfill the mission

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:14.761
that Gaara gave you, but...

00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:17.064
(grunts)

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:22.736
You can see the stars
so clearly tonight.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.271
[Shinki] Yes, that
makes it easier

00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:26.440
to tell the direction
more accurately.

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:30.344
[Kankuro] That's
kind of what I mean.

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:31.945
[Shinki] Huh?

00:18:31.979 --> 00:18:34.748
It's just all you
see in the starry sky

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.950
is how to find your bearings,

00:18:36.984 --> 00:18:40.187
but then I guess that's
perfectly rational.

00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:44.658
There are those who
gaze at the stars

00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:48.228
and can envision an
emotionally moving story.

00:18:48.262 --> 00:18:49.263
Huh.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.200
(Boruto growling)

00:18:56.904 --> 00:18:58.272
I don't get it.

00:18:58.305 --> 00:19:01.608
What can I possibly
learn from Boruto?

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:05.612
Well Gaara is a man
of few words, so...

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.416
You can't take Boruto's
fighting skills lightly.

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:13.253
Although when it comes to
teamwork as a three-man team,

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:15.889
the success rate of the
mission would be higher

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:19.526
if we had Yodo
and Araya instead.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.696
[Kankuro] Maybe, if you're
thinking about it rationally.

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:24.831
Is there another way?

00:19:24.865 --> 00:19:28.001
I bet that soon
enough you'll learn

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:30.237
what Gaara was
thinking when he chose

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.506
to entrust this
mission to you guys.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.328
Mr. Kankuro.

00:19:57.598 --> 00:19:58.765
Where's Shinki?

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:01.502
I sent him out to
refill our water.

00:20:01.535 --> 00:20:04.071
Oh, I didn't know
he drank water.

00:20:04.104 --> 00:20:05.739
Of course he does.

00:20:05.772 --> 00:20:07.541
He is a person, isn't he?

00:20:07.574 --> 00:20:10.744
Even if he is, he's
pretty unsociable.

00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:12.713
Well, like father, like son.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.483
Same goes for you too, Boruto.

00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:20.487
No way, my dad and I
are complete opposites.

00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:21.588
Oh, yeah?

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:23.657
Well, Gaara doesn't seem
to think that's the case.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:26.393
[Shinki] Uncle!

00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:29.796
What's the matter?

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.766
There's something heading
this way right toward us.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:33.901
Is it pursuers?

00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:35.435
Likely.

00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:37.437
(gasps)

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:41.875
(suspenseful music)

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:43.944
I'll beat 'em at their own game.

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:46.547
Just hold on, leave
this one to me.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.315
The two of you go on ahead.

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:49.283
What, why?

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:51.718
It'll be easier if we
fight them together.

00:20:51.752 --> 00:20:53.654
You don't get it, do you?

00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:57.958
Those guys are puppets and
I am a puppet specialist.

00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.494
So there's no way
I'll lose, right?

00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:02.963
And besides, the strategy
for right now should be

00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:05.332
to put the mission
first and foremost.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:09.970
Yes, that's absolutely right.

00:21:10.003 --> 00:21:12.139
We'll head straight
for the Leaf Village.

00:21:12.172 --> 00:21:13.240
Why?

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.109
You don't have to fight
alone, Mr. Kankuro.

00:21:21.381 --> 00:21:24.718
This isn't the time for you
guys to be hanging out here.

00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:26.086
The mission we were given is

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.722
to keep Master Shukaku
out of harm's way.

00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:29.890
Yeah, but...

00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:31.592
Go, Boruto.

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:32.626
Besides I'm getting tired

00:21:32.659 --> 00:21:35.596
of refereeing fights
between you two brats.

00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:40.167
All right, fine.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.503
But you better catch up
to us later, Mr. Kankuro.

00:21:43.837 --> 00:21:45.105
Of course I will.

00:21:51.245 --> 00:21:52.579
Well, that's not good.

00:21:54.648 --> 00:21:56.450
As expected, they're strong.

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:01.355
However, after talking
big to those two,

00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:06.360
I really can't
afford to lose now.

00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:16.036
(Closing Theme Music)

00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:43.223
(upbeat music)

00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:46.159
[Boruto] Is Mr. Kankuro really
gonna be okay by himself?

00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:47.394
[Shinki] He should be.

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:49.296
My uncle's puppet
jutsu gets stronger

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:52.232
and better against more enemies.

00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:55.402
If we were there, we
would only get in the way.

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:57.538
[Boruto] I hope he
takes them down soon

00:23:57.571 --> 00:23:59.406
and catches up to us.

00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:02.743
Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:03.944
The Puppet Battle.

00:24:03.977 --> 00:24:06.280
After all, a puppet
user can't let puppets

00:24:06.313 --> 00:24:08.081
make a fool of him, right?
