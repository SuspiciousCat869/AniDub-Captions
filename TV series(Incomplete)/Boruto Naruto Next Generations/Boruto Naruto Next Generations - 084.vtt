But anyway...

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.354

doing with those weird guys?

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.290
What the hell is going
on around here?

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:14.494
I already told you. I'm doing
this all for peace.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:15.863
I still don't get it.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:21.068
Because of those things, a lot
of Leaf shinobi were taken down.

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.271
Yes, and that is something that
I deeply regret.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:28.442
But still, this is all for
peace in the Ninja World.

I hope you realize that it's to
protect you, as well!

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.881
But why do we need to be
protected?!

Why can't we handle
it ourselves?!

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.085
Because you're simply too weak,
that's why.

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.686
What?! Come on!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.389
Do you even know what I'm
capable of, Old Man?

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.857
I know quite well.

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.860
Nonetheless, the fact is that
young people these days...

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:48.529
are far too weak and unreliable.

What did you say?! Hey, I
defeated the Otsutsuki!

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:55.969
Don't be arrogant! I have my
own reasons for doing this.

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:57.838
Although, right now...

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:00.174
...you probably wouldn't
understand them.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.810
Oh, yeah? Is that right? I've
had enough of this crap!

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:05.212
You're on your own from here on
out!

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.348
I'm just gonna go back to
my friends now.

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:09.449
But you can't.

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:10.484
Huh?!

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.988
I never imagined that we would
end up right here...

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:17.124
Alright, what are you talking
about now, Old Man?!

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:19.960
This area's the Sanzu Plain.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:23.697
It's completely surrounded by a
powerful barrier.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.368
Once you're inside, it's very
difficult to get back out again.

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:29.236
You're lying!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.704
You're only saying that to keep
me...

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.940
from trying to leave you here!

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.942
I'm not lying.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.177
Oh, yeah? Well, I still don't
believe you!

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:40.681
I'll just turn around and go
out the way I came in!

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.482
You're free to go ahead and try!

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.327

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:56.096
What the hell is going on?!

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.066
No matter how far I walk, I end
up in the same place.

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.035
The Sanzu Plain's long been used
as a Training Ground...

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.171
for shinobi from the Hidden
Stone Village.

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.874
The only way to get out of it
is...

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:09.009
to find your own individual
"Heart Stone"...

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.345
that lies somewhere in here.

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:12.312
Uh, the what?

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.248
I don't get it!

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:16.850
So you're telling me I gotta
find this "Heart Stone" thing?

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:19.653
How about... Um... this one.

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:23.957
Yeah, this'll work! This'll be
my Heart Stone!

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.994
I'm sorry, but it's not that
simple.

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:28.862
All right, is there an
easy-to-follow strategy...

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:30.364
or something?

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:31.632
(CHUCKLE) Nope.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.535
The Heart Stone's glow can
only be seen...

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:37.171
by those people who are
self-reliant...

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:40.674
and are truly able to confront
who they are.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:43.977
A person who's unwilling to
train will never find it.

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.146
Are you serious?

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.049
(FRUSTRATED) Alright!

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.385
Then I'll just have to use my
Shadow Clones...

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:53.687
to find a way out of here, ya
know!

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.655
[BORUTO] <i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:57.658

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:02.029
Just so you know, you can't
use jutsu inside this barrier.

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:03.197
No jutsu?!

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.532
How big a deal is this "Heart
Stone" thing

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:07.701
that someone has to
go through all this?!

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.270
I suppose that depends on how
you look at it.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:13.507
After all, the Heart Stone is
just a pebble.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.276
A pebble? It doesn't have any
powers?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.813
[OHNOKI] <i>It's not the rock</i>
<i>itself that has value.</i>

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.849
It's about the way that you find
it.

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:25.385
The significance of it is in
the process.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.120
(SHOCKED)

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:30.624
C'mon! This whole idea is
so old-fashioned!

00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:33.760
The young people in my village
say the same thing.

00:06:33.794 --> 00:06:37.998
They mock tradition and the old
ways of doing things.

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:41.034
So nowadays, nobody at all comes
to this place...

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:44.004
to make the search for their
Heart Stone anymore...

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:44.972
Huh? Wait a second...

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.142
When you say nobody... are you
really saying that...?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.044
That's right.

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:54.014
I mean the two of us are doomed
to rot in here...

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:55.682
without ever getting back out.

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.050
Quit messing around!

00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.686
There's no way we can give up
and accept that!

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.022
It's just our reality now.

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:04.091
<i>Instead of finding a</i>
<i>way out...</i>

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:08.028
<i>we have to think about</i>
<i>how we can survive here.</i>

00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:17.104
Have you located the Master
yet?

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:21.341
Regrettably, no. I had the
Akuta comb the entire area,...

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.212
but we still haven't been able
to find him.

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:28.982
[KU] Then just assign some more
Akuta to the search immediately!

00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:31.018
[KOKUYOU] But if we expand the
search too much...

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.853
...then the villagers will
become aware...

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:35.022
of the Akutas' presence.

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:37.024
[KU] That's what we have Kirara
for.

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:40.294
We just need to have her
keep things quiet.

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:43.764
Lord Ku... there's a human
expression that says...

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:45.866
you can't keep people from
talking.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:48.335
It means that despite your best
efforts...

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.338
you can't truly keep
rumors from spreading.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.106
What would you have us do,
then?!

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.509
The solution is simple, really.

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:58.512
We just have to eliminate every
witness.

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:01.615
No, that's contrary to the
Master's wishes.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.685
He wants us to keep harm to the
humans at a minimum.

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.286
(ANNOYED)

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.523
Then we will lead the search by
the Akuta ourselves.

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:12.392
I request permission to head
out, sir.

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:13.160

And keep all this a secret!

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.146

[MITSUKI] <i>What's all this?</i>

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:44.157

that so human?

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:46.460
Is it?

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:49.530
What? But you've lived among
humans for so long.

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:52.032
How do you know so little about
them?

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:53.867
No one that I knew...

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:56.537
ever really did anything quite
like this.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.506
Huh? Really? How weird...

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.010
That isn't what the intel I
gathered suggested...

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.947
Hey, Mitsuki. What are you
doing?

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.450
Not much. Kirara was just
showing me her things.

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:13.754
Your room's messy as usual, I
see.

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:16.590
Why don't you just throw all
this useless junk away?

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:19.026
Hey! Keep your dirty hands off
my things!

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:23.297
Can't you see how
wonderful they all are?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.632
Who cares. It's all trash.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:26.700
I'll kill you!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.869
Yeah, well, you can do that
later.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.871
Right now, Lord Ku wants
you to control...

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.774
the flow of information in the
village.

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:38.445

I heard that some Hidden Leaf
Shinobi...

came here looking for you.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.323
But Lord Ku chased them way.

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:51.458
Ah.

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:55.462
Anyway... when will I get to
meet this Lord Ku?

00:09:58.665 --> 00:09:59.967

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:50.551
(SIGH) I must've lost
weight from that...

00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:52.319
Was someone chasing you?

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:55.155
There's tons of Akuta. They're
everywhere.

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:58.025
And Boruto and Shikadai?
Aren't they with you?

00:10:58.525 --> 00:10:59.526
Wait, hold on...

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.895
You mean they're not here yet?!

00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:02.896
Akkun...

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.431
[INOJIN] Maybe they're lost...

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:07.067
Should we go out and look for
<i>them?</i>

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.036
It's too risky to move right
now.

00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:11.705
We should wait and see if
they show up first.

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:15.008
And besides, I don't think
I could walk another step!

00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:18.045
Akkun...

00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:19.179
(SHOCKED)

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:21.815
Chubs!

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.717
<i>(STOMACH GROWLS)</i>

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.685
I can't...

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.423
I'm so hungry right now, I
can't even move.

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:31.058
(INHALE) Damn it.

00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:34.061
(INHALE) At this rate, I'm done
for.

00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:39.700
So uncool... This just proves
I'm all talk...

00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:45.339
[BORUTO] <i>So thirsty... I need</i>
<i>water...</i>

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:48.041
(SPLASHED)

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.177
(SHOCKED) Ah!

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:51.979
[BORUTO] <i>Old Man?!</i>

00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:54.081
I guess I was right...

00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:56.450
It seems that you aren't going
to be able to survive...

00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:57.718
out here very well.

00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:58.719
(GUILTY)

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:01.054
Come with me.

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:06.593
Here's some water. Drink.

00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:09.696
(STARTLED) Are you sure?

00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:12.900
Just go on, drink.

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:15.035
(DRINKING)

00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:19.506
Wow, I feel alive again! You're
a real lifesaver!

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:22.042
(STOMACH GROWLS)

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.143
Want some food?

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:24.978
But aren't you hungry?

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:26.246
Take it.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.014
(RELIEVED)

00:12:28.682 --> 00:12:29.683
A bug?!

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:33.220
It's a valuable source of
protein. It's quite good.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.690
What?! Come on! Isn't
there, like, anything else?

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:38.392
You could always starve instead.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.727
(STOMACH GROWLS)

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:41.695
Well?

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.064
(RELUCTANT)

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:49.536
Okay fine! I'm not gonna die out
here!

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.038
(BITING)

00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:52.339
Well?

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.342
(CHEWING)

00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:57.044
(SWALLOWING)

00:12:58.378 --> 00:12:59.313
It's good!

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:00.347
I told you.

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.017
Why did you offer me food and
water, though?

00:13:05.018 --> 00:13:07.721
(CHUCKLE) Well, I figured that I
owed you...

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.556
for saving my life back there.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.892
So my conscience simply wouldn't
allow me...

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.394
to just let you perish.

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:15.495
Wow, Old Man...

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:18.198
Well, then? So, was I right or
what?

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:19.833
(TAKEN BACK)

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:21.802
(CHUCKLE) Oh, never mind.

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:24.204
For now, just lend me a hand.

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:26.573
I can only find so much food
myself...

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:28.041
so if you want to survive...

00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:31.512
<i>...listen to me. Let's</i>
<i>call a truce.</i>

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:06.580
(EATING)

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:09.183
Well! That's quite a big change
from this morning!

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.119
I gotta say...

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:15.088
it really is amazing just how
much food is out here.

00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:18.258
Living off the land is a basic
shinobi skill.

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:21.061
Didn't they teach you that at
the Academy in the Leaf?

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.262
Yeah, kinda.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.599
I read about it in a textbook,
but we didn't actually do it...

00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:27.067
If you keep a sharp eye
out...

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.203
then you can find what you need.

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:30.571
When you were looking
earlier...

00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:34.041
You saw bamboo leaves
and cicada shells, didn't you?

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:36.143
Ah, I get it!

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:37.878
Materials for utensils!

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:41.215
And we can find insects that we
can eat, too.

00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:43.050
You didn't realize that
before...

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:45.385
and that's a problem. Goodness,
me.

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:48.222
Young people these days are all
about book learning...

00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:50.591
but have no real-life
resourcefulness!

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:52.326
Sorry about that...

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:56.163
So, you finally admit it? That
you have shortcomings?

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.565
Uh- this and that are two
different things!

00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.567
Let's just eat, okay?

00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:01.668
(CHOMPING) Ah, hot!

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.172
You don't have to rush! Let it
cool down before you eat!

00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:15.415
Unlike the old days when I was
young...

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:18.252
you have everything you
could possibly need.

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:21.555
But still, has that abundance
actually made you stronger...

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:25.225
in any meaningful way?

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:27.761
Back when my peers and I were
young...

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:30.731
we were caught in a time of war.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:35.702
There was constant fighting. We
were desperate just to survive.

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:39.339
<i>That crucible forged</i>
<i>us... and made us stronger.</i>

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.875
Are you saying things were
better...

00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:43.544
...back when you were at
war?!

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:45.646
That's not what I meant.

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:49.516
Although, having experience in
battle does make a difference.

00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:52.886
Especially in times like these.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.888
if you don't exercise
self-control...

00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:56.924
and don't train enough...

00:15:56.957 --> 00:16:00.027
...then you can't fight enemies
<i>like Kaguya.</i>

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.729
<i>You've actually fought</i>
<i>against the Otsutsuki,...</i>

00:16:02.763 --> 00:16:06.066
<i>...so you have an idea</i>
<i>of what I'm talking about.</i>

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:08.268
<i>I just...</i>

00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:14.308
don't ever want to see innocent
<i>people die again...</i>

00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:17.177
And that's why I made Ku and the
others.

00:16:20.714 --> 00:16:23.016
Master... My dearest father...

00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:26.053
We're merely awaiting your
orders!

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.223
Actually... now that you
mention it...

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:32.926
I heard him call you
"father." Is that 'cause...?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.064
That's right. He was grown
from my cells.

00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:39.066
He's a synthetic human.

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:40.367
He's a Fabrication.

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.969
(SHOCKED)

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.905
Come, now! Don't act so
surprised.

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:46.874
After all, there's another one
that's similar...

00:16:46.907 --> 00:16:48.876
to him among you, as well.

00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:50.043
Oh...

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:58.018
The technology behind all of
this is still in its infancy.

00:16:58.051 --> 00:17:01.522
And to perfect it, I need to
have help from Mitsuki.

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:04.691
That's why I invited him to come
here.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.563
If my plan succeeds,...

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:15.068
Ku and those like him will be
able to fight in your place.

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:18.038
And they will dutifully
protect all of you from harm.

00:17:18.672 --> 00:17:19.673
Yeah, but...

00:17:20.674 --> 00:17:22.543
No "buts."

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:25.212
I can't bear the thought of
promising youths...

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.714
such as yourself becoming
casualties.

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:28.682
(SYMPATHETIC)

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.320
The plan is now about to enter
its final stages.

00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:35.088
I've left it in good hands.

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:38.892
I'm sure that Ku and the others
will see it through.

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:42.362
I've finally reached my goal.
<i>Finally!</i>

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:51.905
So, you're Ku? Well, we meet
at last. I'm-

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:54.308
There's no need for any
introductions.

00:17:54.341 --> 00:17:59.046
With your help, we're about to
gather vital data on your heart.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.714
We're very grateful to.you.

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:03.884
But I thought that a Curse Mark
had been placed on my heart.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:04.918
Isn't that right?

00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:07.054
Yes, but it's an older Curse
Mark.

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.922
It'll take some time...

00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:11.258
but we'll be able to complete
the analysis.

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.527
It's because you're here that we
can now complete our plan.

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:17.698
I have another reason for coming
to the Stone...

00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:21.969
...to learn the secret behind
my "will."

00:18:22.002 --> 00:18:24.037
[KU] The secret behind your
will?

00:18:24.071 --> 00:18:25.172
[MITSUKI] That's right.

00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:27.875
The two of us were both created
by humans.

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:29.009
Were our souls, too?

00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:31.411
Was the individual will in me...

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:34.548
something just given to me by
humans?

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:37.217
[KU] If you want to know the
answer to that question...

00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:40.254
I'd say that you should ask the
human who created you.

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:43.257
However, it seems clear to me
that you haven't done so.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.561
Why do you think that might be?

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:48.996
I don't know.

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:50.764
They say that humans go through
a...

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.567
rebellious stage as they mature.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.637
If that's true, then your
behavior isn't all that unusual.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.307
My will means I'm... maturing?

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.577
Perhaps. Or maybe you were
merely programmed...

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.078
that way to begin with.

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:07.347
But what difference does it
really make, anyway?

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:08.682
(SHOCKED)

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:13.854
I don't... really care either
way.

00:19:13.887 --> 00:19:17.024
Our master is pursuing a very
noble purpose.

00:19:17.057 --> 00:19:19.893
He needed an empty vessel to
fill with that purpose.

00:19:19.927 --> 00:19:22.396
That vessel is me.

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:24.898
The body the Master gave
me could've merely been...

00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:26.166
an empty one.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.403
That's why I call myself Ku,
which means "empty."

00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:30.170
(TAKEN BACK)

00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:34.007
I've heard that at one time
vessels were called "tsuki."

00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:37.010
Mitsuki... it appears that you
and I are the same.

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.680
An empty vessel, I see...

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:43.517
And does that leave you
dissatisfied?

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:49.990
Listen... there's no need for
you to lament being "empty."

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:53.560
Emptiness that's expanded to
its utmost limits...

00:19:53.594 --> 00:19:56.396
looks down upon everything that
it encompasses.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.066
[KU] <i>It becomes as limitless as</i>
<i>the sky.</i>

00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:06.039
[KOKUYOU] Reading human books
again, huh?

00:20:06.073 --> 00:20:08.308
[KAKOU] Yeah. They're fun.

00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:11.211
This one says that humans can
overcome adversity...

00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:13.881
depending on their attitude
toward it.

00:20:13.914 --> 00:20:17.084
I wonder if that applies to us
as well...

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:19.887
Ridiculous. That stuff won't
make a difference...

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.389
in how strong you are.

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:25.425
We fabrications have nothing
we would call a soul...

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:26.894
in the first place.

00:20:26.927 --> 00:20:28.829
Hey, where's Mitsuki?

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:30.731
[KAKOU] He's with Lord Ku.

00:20:30.764 --> 00:20:33.934
(DISAPPOINTED) I wanted to show
him how beautiful I look...

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:36.236
with this new umbrella I just
got.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.873
Quit doing stuff like that. Just
take over for the Tsuchikage

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.041
like you're supposed to.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.876
Huh?! Don't talk to me like
that...

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.579
when you're the one who's
slacking!

00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:48.382
What?! Who's slacking?!

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.050
Look, I'm not the one off having
fun...

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.219
pretending to be human like
you are.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.321
I'm studying the human soul!

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:56.590
What can you possibly understand
about humans...

00:20:56.623 --> 00:20:58.258
just by reading a book?

00:20:58.292 --> 00:20:59.026
Silence!

00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:00.761
(ANNOYED)

00:21:00.794 --> 00:21:04.398
Humans aren't worth it. Stop
wasting time on that nonsense.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.200
How dare you?! / What
was that?!

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:10.170
Okay, okay. That's enough.

00:21:10.204 --> 00:21:13.240
I get that you're interested in
understanding humans...

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:17.344
...but out of all of us, the one
who knows them best... is me.

00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:21.048
(SCOFF)

00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:25.385
Kakou... When you're done, can I
borrow that book?

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:28.055
I'm curious about books
concerning humans.

00:21:28.088 --> 00:21:30.991
Well, you can take it right now,
if you like.

00:21:31.024 --> 00:21:32.192
Oh! Are you sure?

00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:34.061
Here you go.

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:35.195
(SHOCKED)

00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:39.700
(WORRIED) Kakou?

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:45.205
(WORRIED) It just started all of
a sudden.

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:47.174
Kirara, Kakou needs help!

00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:49.843
Kirara?!

00:21:49.877 --> 00:21:55.015
Oh, no... This isn't beautiful
at all...

[BORUTO] <i>Damn it, I can't just</i>
<i>be here relaxing like this!</i>

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:49.096
<i>We stumbled into a seriously</i>
<i>dangerous place, here!</i>

00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:51.932
[OHNOKI] <i>Like I said, to get out</i>
<i>of the Sanzu Plain...</i>

00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:53.400
<i>you must find your "Heart</i>
<i>Stone."</i>

00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:55.536
[BORUTO] Does that thing even
<i>really exist?</i>

00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:57.538
<i>It's hard to believe such a</i>
<i>special stone...</i>

00:23:57.571 --> 00:23:59.072
<i>is just lying around here!</i>

00:23:59.106 --> 00:24:01.542
Next time on "Boruto: Naruto
Next Generations..."

00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:03.243
"The Heart Stone"

00:24:03.277 --> 00:24:06.380
[OHNOKI] If you realize or learn
<i>something while you're here,</i>

00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:09.349
<i>...then you'll be able to</i>
<i>obtain the "Heart Stone."</i>
