WEBVTT

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.013
He's late! What on earth is he
doing anyway?!

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:17.250
[chuckles] You really are
quite hard on Boruto all the
time.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.453
Well I have certain goals that
I'm trying to reach.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.757
So I have to be reliable and
carry out my missions.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.527
I, for one, cannot afford to
be late!

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.928
Ahh!

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.463
By the way, what about
yourself?

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:31.765
Mm? Who me?

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:35.769
Yeah, are there certain
missions you prefer to do over
others?

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.305
I never asked you that before
so now I'm curious.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:45.011
Oh, I don't know. I suppose
the ones that Boruto likes to
do.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.780
[sighs]

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.750
I'm not trying to be critical of
you or anything...

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.286
but are there any decisions that
you've made of your own free
will?

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.258
Actually, this is completely
my own decision.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:00:59.726
Huh?

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:08.134
<i>(Mitsuki) Yes. This is</i>
<i>somethingI decided</i>
<i>for myself.</i>

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.248
Uh.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.360
Looks like he's awake now.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.864
[exhales]

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.633
[grunts]

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:27.073
(Orochimaru) Don't worry,
you'll be okay since you drank
the medicine I gave you earlier.

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:33.246
Now, take one more dose of
this. It'll make you feel
better.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.449
<i>(Orochimaru) Go on.</i>

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.893
[coughing]

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.331
[panting]

00:03:55.335 --> 00:04:00.206
Please bring him to my room
later, after he's had a chance
to wake up and recover.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.643
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:04.277
Yeah got it.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.853
<i>(Suigetsu) Hey. Hey!</i>

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:14.287
Huh?

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:15.989
Are you okay?

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:25.331
Who am I?

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.304
(Orochimaru) We're on the sixth
<i>attempt now.</i>

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:37.844
It would be nice if the next
one goes as desired.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.016
Why was I lying in bed?

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.787
It figures you don't remember
the bad stuff that happened.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.821
Huh?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.458
(Suigetsu) You failed your
top‐secret mission as part of
Lord Orochimaru's two‐man team.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:57.163
Well, you were injured and Lord
Orochimaru had to carry you back
to this hideout.

00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:59.299
You remember that?

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:01.635
Oh. [gasps]

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.040
Huh? Hmph.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:13.013
[grunting]

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.249
Pretty good!

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.417
[gasps]

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.157
<i>(Mitsuki) [grunting]</i>

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.993
I...I'm sorry. I just...

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:31.865
Looks like your body clearly
remembers. You are a true
ninja through and through.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.400
[gasps]

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.336
Huh?

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.610
You were captured by a man in
the city, and some of your
memories were erased.

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:47.347
<i>(Suigetsu) I'm really sorry! I</i>
<i>just had to check to be sure.</i>

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.750
If your shinobi abilities were
removed too...

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:53.186
then Lord Orochimaru would have
been very disappointed.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.722
Orochimaru?

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:04.998
Yes. I am Orochimaru. You
don't remember but I'm your
parent.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.701
You're my, parent?

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:12.005
That's right. Which is the
reason that you're very
special to me.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.075
And why it's important we
retrieve your memory.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.444
We're going to retrieve my
memory? How does that work?

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:26.953
Behold this man. He's a
shinobi who has the ability to
steal others' memories.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:31.491
And after he steals them, he
stockpiles those memories as
his own.

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:35.295
<i>(Orochimaru) He can also</i>
manipulate people by implanting
<i>different memories.</i>

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:40.634
<i>Or of course, reinserting the</i>
very ones he stole in the first
<i>place.</i>

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:47.107
Mitsuki, your memory has been
taken by this very man I speak
of.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.210
In order to restore you, we
have to go capture him.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.146
Then we'll be able to
transplant all of your old
memories.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.550
We address this skilled
shinobi by the name of Log.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.753
His specific ability is called
Experience Stealing.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:00.621
Hm.

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:05.425
The two of us shall return to
where we last encountered this
man.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.560
Hold on a minute.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.529
<i>(Mitsuki) So.</i>

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.333
When we were on our previous
mission, what were you and I
doing confronting this guy?

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.368
Can you explain that?

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:17.003
Of course.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.441
We were confronting him because
we were trying to steal every
bit of intel he'd collected.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:24.044
By taking him in alive.

00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:28.949
Except that, he was the one
who ended up swiping our
precious intel instead.

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:31.384
You said your name is
Orochimaru, right?

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.554
If you were with me on that
mission, then...

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:37.924
How do you know your memories
haven't been stolen or altered
too?!

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:42.963
<i>(Mitsuki) And another</i>
<i>thing, are you my mother</i>
<i>or my father?</i>

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:46.900
[laughs] Trust me, that doesn't
really matter.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:47.568
[gasps]

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.773
<i>(Orochimaru) You used to know,</i>
<i>that I am one of the Legendary</i>
<i>Sannin.</i>

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:56.076
<i>And that I'm no ordinary</i>
<i>shinobi.</i>

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.483
<i>(Mitsuki) Then, why would you</i>
take someone as weak as I am on
<i>that kind of mission?</i>

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:08.488
I'm afraid you are
underestimating yourself. I
already told you.

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:14.294
<i>(Orochimaru) You're special.</i>
<i>You have always been my</i>
<i>precious child.</i>

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:20.233
I am actually quite fond of
you. You just don't happen to
remember.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:24.738
<i>(Orochimaru) This is also for</i>
<i>our sake, as parent and child.</i>

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:28.274
But. [gasps]

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:34.114
<i>(Orochimaru) Since you are</i>
just a child, you should listen
<i>obediently to me.</i>

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:38.118
[crying]

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:45.158
Who am I? That's all I'm
after. That's all I wanna know.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:49.730
Yes, it will all get settled
soon enough, as long as you come
with me.

00:08:56.603 --> 00:09:00.507
Just beyond this point, we
will find Log's barrier.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:01.675
What should we do?

00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:04.410
You will be the one to go over
there and take it down.

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:05.679
Huh?

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.916
You heard me right. That's the
reason I brought you along the
last time.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.686
It's because you're the only
one who can breach it.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.188
But, I don't have that kind of
power.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:20.794
Yes, you do, you've just
forgotten. In fact the power
you possess is very special.

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:22.996
I will show you how to use it.

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:35.008
Huh?

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:46.386
See? That's the power you
possess. Now, let's get going.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.622
[exhales] Mhm.

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:56.830
Looks like someone had a pair
of eyes on us after all.

00:09:56.863 --> 00:10:01.868
You really didn't have to come
to me. I was planning to make
my way to you eventually.

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:04.971
So I could get the key that
opens that thing!

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.173
Paralysis Jutsu!

00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:10.410
[grunting]

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:16.316
I insist you return that
thing right now, along with
restoring this child's memories.

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:20.887
Oh, I see my Paralysis Jutsu
doesn't work on you anymore.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:25.526
<i>They're fast!</i>

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:36.970
[grunting]

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.674
[grunts]

00:10:43.544 --> 00:10:44.878
[attacking yell]

00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:50.016
[grunting]

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.688
[grunts] Uh?

00:10:56.189 --> 00:11:01.194
That's some nice armor. My
fangs can't penetrate it. Did
you modify it?

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:04.230
You don't scare me, your
poison can't even reach me.

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:05.498
[gasps]

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.367
Ninja Art: Armor Eater!

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:18.044
I let you get away easily
before, but not this time.

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:21.047
Mitsu...ki...! [grunts]

00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:24.585
You possess... [grunts]

00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:28.221
<i>(Orochimaru) ...Sage Power so</i>
<i>use it.</i>

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:36.496
Oh yes, he's the one I really
need to watch.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.732
He gave me a lot of trouble
last time.

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:42.035
I can't move! [grunts]

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:45.739
Hmph. How come you didn't
release the Paralysis Jutsu?

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:49.142
It appears that you've forgotten
your own powers.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:54.280
Without that power, you're
just an ordinary kid!

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:55.481
[gasps]

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:03.924
[gasps]

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:15.035
[grunting]

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:19.005
<i>(Orochimaru) You were too</i>
<i>preoccupied with the large</i>
<i>snake.</i>

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:21.274
But even the venom of a small
snake...

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:25.111
that I can slip through the gap
in your armor is sufficient
enough.

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.780
[gasps]

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.484
The Curse Mark's poison will
render him mute and immobile
for a while.

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:36.489
Mitsuki, would you please do me
a favor and keep an eye on him
for a little bit?

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:38.859
I'm sure you can move now.

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:43.396
Uh. Where are you going?

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:48.935
There's something I'm looking
for here. It won't take me
long to find it.

00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:53.039
But no matter what you do,
don't go anywhere near him.

00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:57.243
[exhales]

00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:08.121
[gasps]

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:10.757
[gulps]

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:17.297
[grunting] Such... strong
poison...

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:23.436
Don't worry, I can't get you.
I can barely speak.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:29.175
<i>(Log) Seems the antidote I</i>
<i>prepared is only partially</i>
<i>effective.</i>

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:37.183
Ugh, it's painful like this.
Come here. Please take off my
mask.

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:39.953
Are you trying to deceive me?

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:46.259
No. If you take this mask off,
you'll know that it's just the
opposite.

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:48.995
I'll say this much.

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:51.497
The one who's deceiving you
is...

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:54.100
<i>(Log) Orochimaru.</i>

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:55.268
[gasps]

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:02.475
I imagine Orochimaru hasn't told
you anything. How could you know
what's really going on?

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.478
(Log) That's exactly how it was
<i>with me too.</i>

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:12.185
I wonder, do you know who you
really are? Do you have any
idea at all?

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:15.989
Yes. Yes I do. I'm
Orochimaru's child.

00:14:16.757 --> 00:14:18.458
And besides...

00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:22.095
I erased some of your extraneous
memories last time.

00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:26.166
But now, he's using that against
you, isn't he?

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:27.300
Huh?

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:32.372
Now, come here, and take my
mask off.

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:35.141
[light breathing]

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:46.653
[gasps]

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.322
[gasping]

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.124
I am also...

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:56.429
Mitsuki. It's just that I was
made before you were.

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:58.198
I don't understand what you are
talking about.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:01.735
Orochimaru created us both.
We're artificial beings.

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:05.338
<i>(Older Mitsuki) We are mere</i>
<i>vessels to fulfill his</i>
<i>ambitions.</i>

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:08.208
<i>"Tsuki" is an old name for a</i>
<i>vessel.</i>

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:12.513
<i>And "Mi" is the sixth of the</i>
<i>twelve zodiac creatures.</i>

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:16.349
<i>The snake is where our name</i>
<i>Mitsuki comes from.</i>

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.420
We're artificial beings?

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:23.156
The seed that served as our
source material...

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:25.892
is the thing he's searching
for right now.

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:29.796
He had it cultured to create
both of us.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.467
(Older Mitsuki) That's also the
reason you're able to break the
<i>barrier that was placed here.</i>

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:41.107
I stole that seed from
Orochimaru to destroy it. At
least that was my plan.

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:47.213
But, in order to open the case
that it's in...

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:50.517
I needed a key that was in
Orochimaru's possession.

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.587
But why would you destroy it?

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.190
Because life that's produced
artificially isn't human.

00:15:57.223 --> 00:16:01.194
It's an ideological construct
born from a selfish ego.

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:07.568
He's twisted the laws of nature
by pretending to be god! We're
vessels of his greed!

00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.803
A projection of his narcissism!

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:12.205
Orochimaru created me as his
son.

00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:18.178
I was exceptional but then
when I escaped from his side,
he longed for a replacement.

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:20.681
<i>(Older Mitsuki)</i>
<i>Make no mistake.</i>

00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:25.451
<i>Orochimaru will keep making</i>
<i>more beings like us to suit</i>
<i>his whims.</i>

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:30.290
Neither you nor I were ever
meant to exist in this world.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:34.127
However, I'll return things to
the way they should be.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.829
But before I do...

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:41.001
I'm going to get rid of you.
Orochimaru!

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:47.407
No matter how you came into this
world, please know you two are
no different from any other.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:53.179
<i>(Orochimaru) You are both my</i>
<i>absolute and perfect children,</i>
<i>whom I cannot help but love.</i>

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:56.016
You bear within you, more power
<i>than I.</i>

00:16:56.049 --> 00:17:00.887
<i>Do you know how much</i>
<i>I've eagerly awaited your</i>
<i>existence?</i>

00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:06.026
Is it wrong for a shinobi like
me to desire bringing children
into the world?

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:11.297
People are forgiving when they
find out your motives are
simply born of love.

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:15.401
So you see, you both are here
because of love.

00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:17.203
[gasps]

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:21.107
So what?! That justifies your
egotistical behavior?!

00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:23.677
Do you really think that you
can control everything?!

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.213
I don't consider my actions
"pretending to be god."

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:33.554
Actually, I'm only expanding
what god has so graciously
granted to us. That is all!

00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:34.521
<i>(Older Mitsuki) Mitsuki!</i>

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:35.255
Huh?

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:38.324
Since you're still a child, it
may be difficult for you to
understand.

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.794
Eventually you'll realize he's
wrong!

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:42.996
But you need to stop
Orochimaru!

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:47.934
I speak as the adult version
of you. One day, the time will
be right for you to stop him!

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:52.438
Mitsuki, don't believe him, he
thinks he can deceive you
because you are a child.

00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:56.710
I'm the one who has the seed,
and I also possess the key.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.845
Mitsuki, come over here to me.

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:03.550
I'll create a much better
sibling for you than he could
ever be, okay?!

00:18:03.584 --> 00:18:04.551
No! Mitsuki!

00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:05.652
[grunting]

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:07.521
Mitsuki, Now!

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:09.623
Mitsuki!

00:18:09.656 --> 00:18:10.456
Now!

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.472
Since I'm only a child...

00:18:26.507 --> 00:18:30.310
I don't... really care about
that either way...

00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:33.547
At least the things you adults
are talking about anyway.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.484
As for me, I'll make my own
decisions.

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:51.497
[gasps]

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:10.784
He's finally achieved Sage
Transformation.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:11.852
Yeah.

00:19:15.556 --> 00:19:16.990
[panting]

00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:20.460
<i>(Orochimaru) So, what did you</i>
<i>put into the scroll this time?</i>

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.427
Huh?

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:27.467
(Older Mitsuki) Well I suppose,
<i>let's just call it a photo of</i>
<i>the sun.</i>

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.436
<i>(Orochimaru) The sun, really?</i>

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.540
Finally! He did it on the
sixth try.

00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:36.710
<i>(Older Mitsuki) He didn't</i>
<i>choose to side with either one</i>
<i>of us.</i>

00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:40.714
<i>He opted for a third choice,</i>
<i>one that was all his own.</i>

00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:44.417
But still, you never know how
it'll turn out.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.287
I'd like to avoid a seventh
undertaking.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.892
(Orochimaru) I definitely don't
<i>want to use that drug again to</i>
<i>remove his memory.</i>

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.497
As an artificial being, he'll
carve his own path.

00:19:57.531 --> 00:20:00.333
He'll succeed in illuminating
the dark.

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:05.471
I had always been afraid that
neither one of you would ever
be able to.

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:08.174
I was worried you wouldn't
become the light.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:12.112
That you'd choose the dark,
since both of you are my
children.

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.681
C'mon. Isn't this what you
wanted?

00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:17.551
Your elaborate charade ended
up working.

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:18.952
Hmph.

00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:23.389
Except, it's highly unlikely
he'll become the light all on
his own.

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:26.292
<i>(Old Mitsuki) He can only</i>
<i>do it by finding a sun</i>

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:29.062
<i>who will stick by his side</i>
<i>and shine upon him.</i>

00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:35.335
<i>Only then will he become the</i>
<i>moonlight and illuminate the</i>
<i>dark.</i>

00:20:35.368 --> 00:20:41.141
Not simply as a vessel in the
dark, but as a moon in the
darkness of the nighttime sky.

00:20:41.174 --> 00:20:45.078
A cracked vessel can't hold
anything.

00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:50.517
<i>(Older Mitsuki) But a waning</i>
<i>moon in the night will</i>
<i>eventually wax full.</i>

00:20:50.551 --> 00:20:54.855
<i>Yes, my real name is...</i>

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:02.696
<i>Mitsuki, the Snake Moon.</i>

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:07.934
<i>(Boruto) Hey, guys!</i>

00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:09.870
I'll be right there!

00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:15.075
You're late!

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.743
I'm really sorry!

00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:21.782
I ran into a lost kid on my
way here. So I ended up
helping him look for his mom.

00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:23.584
That's a big fat lie.

00:21:23.617 --> 00:21:26.352
What?! You just suddenly
decided I was lying?!

00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:29.222
Yeah because you do it all the
time, am I wrong?

00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:31.825
[grunts] Hey, Mitsuki!

00:21:31.858 --> 00:21:34.595
You believe I'm telling the
truth, don't you?!

00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:38.098
Honestly, I don't care either
way.

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.365
Huh?

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.636
I've already decided to trust
both of you. So it's okay.

00:21:43.704 --> 00:21:45.672
Hm.

00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:49.776
Let's go. Or we'll be late.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.712
Okay.

00:22:00.353 --> 00:22:03.757
<i>I can see the sun, finally.</i>

00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:46.527
(Mitsuki) Team 7 will be going
on our first mission soon, huh?

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.696
(Boruto) I'm sure we'll be able
to handle whatever mission gets
<i>thrown our way!</i>

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.432
<i>(Sarada) Isn't every mission</i>
<i>ranked before it's assigned?</i>

00:23:52.465 --> 00:23:54.535
<i>I wonder if our team will get</i>
<i>the lowest rank.</i>

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:56.870
<i>(Boruto) How about we start</i>
<i>off with the highest ranked</i>
<i>mission...</i>

00:23:56.903 --> 00:24:00.574
<i>and show everybody just how</i>
<i>awesome Team 7 is!</i>

00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:06.613
<i>Next time on Boruto Naruto</i>
<i>Next Generations: Team 7: The</i>
<i>First Mission!</i>

00:24:06.647 --> 00:24:09.883
<i>It'll be a piece of cake, I</i>
<i>can handle it myself!</i>
