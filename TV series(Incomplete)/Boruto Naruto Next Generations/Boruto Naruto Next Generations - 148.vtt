WEBVTT

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:13.280
I can see your
destiny quite well.

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.315
Heed this warning.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.819
Beware, for those blue
eyes shall eventually

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.154
take everything from you!

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:29.029
(shocked waking)

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.170
After so long...

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.671
Why'd I dream that?

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.576
(opening theme music)

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:12.299
(opening theme music)

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:34.821
[Konohamaru] Listen up.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.123
I'll explain the plan.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.764
And it appears that
no one other than you,

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:45.966
and me of course
with my Rinnegan,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.735
seems to have noticed
what occurred back there.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.007
Look, I'm not trying to
scare you or anything.

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.610
But what happened to you
back then wasn't normal.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.145
So be on your guard.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.415
If you sense something
strange, then tell me.

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:02.449
You got it?

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:05.953
[Konohamaru] Hey, answer me!

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:06.954
Are you listening, Boruto?

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:08.488
Oh! I'm sorry!

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.624
The ones who raided the
bank are ordinary robbers,

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.193
but they could have others
in their group. Right?

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.629
What's wrong with you?

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.864
You're acting so weird.

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:17.865
Are you okay?

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:20.133
Uh, sorry!
It's nothing!

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.269
I'm totally fine, you know?

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.271
It'll be whatever it's gonna be.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.973
I just gotta
complete my missions

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.308
and become an amazing shinobi!

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:31.345
(upbeat music)

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.816
That went well!

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.418
Robbing a bank is a
cakewalk these days!

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:39.353
Of course!

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.754
With this peaceful
time we're living in,

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:44.024
robbers like us have it easy,
and that's a good thing!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.627
Now if we can just
escape, we'll win!

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.628
(shocked gasps)

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:48.662
Huh?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.735
What in the heck is that guy?

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:56.436
Just keep on running!

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:58.205
(startled gasps)

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.439
No way!

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:00.474
Cha!

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:07.981
(exhales)

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:11.552
Sarada, you aren't dealing
with shinobi, here,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:12.819
so don't overdo things.

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.821
Oh, c'mon, it's too
hard to hold back!

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:16.023
Ugh, damn it!

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:18.425
Wouldn't it be better
if you just surrendered?

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.261
Don't underestimate
us, little girl!

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.199
Come here!

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:40.147
This blade is completely
coated in deadly poison.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.649
Just one little scratch,
and you'll be a goner!

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.990
Boruto?

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:51.825
That really wasn't
like you, Sarada!

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:54.428
Well, no, but that's because...

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.429
Damn it!

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.463
I'm outta here!

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.766
(shocked gasp)

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.505
All right!

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:06.273
Everything is going
to plan so far.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.941
Now we just have
to let him escape

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.110
and rejoin the
rest of their gang.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.179
[Boruto] You're
not getting away!

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.449
No, stop it!

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.450
Don't!

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.618
Right there!

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:21.188
Rasengan!

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.323
Agh!

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.528
Boruto, you idiot!

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:32.566
Were you even
listening to the plan?

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.868
We weren't supposed
to take him down!

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:36.737
Aw, listen, I'm
really sorry, okay?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.138
I can see that now!

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:41.341
Listen, if you can't even
focus on a C-rank mission,

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.111
then we're never gonna
get assigned a B-rank one!

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:47.714
And on top of that,
his gang got away!

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:48.749
-Hm?
-Hm?

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:52.586
I caught one from
the main group.

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:56.356
Well then, thanks to
Konohamaru Sensei,

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.459
it appears that we've avoided
failing our C-rank mission.

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:00.427
Seriously!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.362
And also, Sarada's
right, you know!

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:05.699
You have to learn to stay
more focused on your missions.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:06.967
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.502
Okay, I got it.

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:11.672
As far as we can tell,

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.208
the Mujina Gang hasn't
been active at all lately.

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.343
And none of the other lands
outside the Land of Fire

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.213
have reported any more
incidents, either.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:21.481
It's been months since
Boruto and his team

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:22.883
brought down Tsukiyo.

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.218
We think they're being careful

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.553
after the death of
their lieutenant.

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:27.588
Hm.

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.824
I'm sorry we let you down.

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:32.292
We've been investigating

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:34.628
and mobilized the whole
Leaf Police Force,

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:35.963
but there are no leads.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:37.130
I know.

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:38.832
The other nations don't
have anything, either.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.300
That's simply who
we're up against.

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:43.070
So you have nothing to
apologize for, ya' know.

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:45.005
Shojoji, the leader
of the Mujina Gang,

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:46.440
can copy the appearance, voice,

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:49.409
and memories of those he kills
with the Corpse Clone Jutsu.

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:52.012
So it's really no wonder
we can't find him.

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:53.213
For now just have
the Police Force

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:54.948
continue to be vigilant.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:56.984
And thank you for your report.

00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:58.685
Yes, sir, I understand.

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.487
Now if you'll please excuse me.

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:04.791
The Mujina Gang is trouble.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.661
There's no way that they
won't make a move eventually.

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:10.430
What could they be out
there planning to do?

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:11.465
C'mon!

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.432
I know that's important,

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.101
but right now you
have to stay focused

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:16.203
on tomorrow's meeting
with the Feudal Lord.

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:17.804
You can just leave
the Mujina Gang

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:19.006
to the rest of us until later.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.007
(chuckle)

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.209
Yeah, yeah, okay, I got it.

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:24.578
The Feudal Lord should be
arriving in the village shortly,

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:25.579
isn't that right?

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.382
(train whistles)

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.434
Lord Ikkyu Madoka.

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:50.537
I bid you a very warm welcome.

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:52.940
I'm honored to be your
escort and bodyguard

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.741
during your stay
here, once again.

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:58.612
Ah, I look forward to it,
and thank you very much.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:07:59.880
[Tento] Hey, Yamaoka!

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:01.081
Hm?

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:03.217
Make sure you don't
forget my luggage!

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.552
And don't you dare put
even a single scratch

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.321
on my X Cards collection!

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:08.121
Of course.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.057
I understand, Milord.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:12.793
No way!

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.661
You're Sai the
shinobi, aren't you?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:19.499
Oh, that's right, the two of
you haven't met before now.

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:20.701
This is my son.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.469
His name is Tento.

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:23.437
Lord Tento.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.339
You're on an X Card, so
I know all about you!

00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:27.207
Here, I'll show you right now!

00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:28.475
Yamaoka!

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:30.544
Yes, sir, right away.

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:31.545
[Tento] Hurry up!

00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:32.946
What are you even doing?

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.648
I'll have it out shortly.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.751
Here it is right now.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.787
Look, Papa!

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.757
He uses this cool ninjutsu
called the Super Beast Scroll

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.592
that allows his
drawings to move around

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:46.960
and even to fight for him!

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:49.329
See? Here it is!

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:50.497
[Sai] Oh!

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:53.433
I didn't know X Cards contained
that kind of information.

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:54.401
I'm so sorry, Tento.

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:55.435
Huh?

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:58.005
I'm afraid that I
have to hurry off

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.607
or I'm going to be
late for my meeting.

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:01.942
Yamaoka!

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:03.110
Of course, Milord.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:05.212
I'm leaving you in
charge of Tento.

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:07.948
Please make sure to take
care of him in my absence.

00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:10.250
Very well, Milord; understood.

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:12.819
[Ikkyu] All right, Lord Sai.

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:14.188
Please lead the way.

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:17.691
Pardon.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.092
You sure about this?

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:20.460
Am I sure about what?

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.131
No, it's nothing, sir.

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:26.533
Mm.

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:36.877
All right, Yamaoka.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.412
What is it, Milord?

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:41.849
Go and check how many boxes
of X Cards this shop has.

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.717
Yes, certainly, Milord.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.586
I'll return in just a moment.

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.827
I heard this was a nice city,

00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:55.429
so I couldn't wait to see it.

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:58.966
But it's so disorganized
and crowded, too!

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.734
What a disappointment.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.406
I'm sorry to keep
you waiting, Milord.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.609
I'm afraid that product
is very popular,

00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:11.979
so the shop only has 10
boxes remaining in stock.

00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:13.347
That isn't very much!

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.583
But I guess that's to be
expected in a Shinobi Village.

00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:18.852
All right.

00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:20.254
I'll just buy up every X Card

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:22.389
in the entire Leaf
Village, then.

00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:29.563
[Boruto] I'll take
one of these, Aunty!

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.064
All righty!

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:35.636
Here I go!

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.037
Come on, now!

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.541
Please, let me get a rare card!

00:10:40.574 --> 00:10:42.042
Pretty please!

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:47.814
[Shikadai] Awesome!

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.816
A Seventh Hokage card!

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.319
-Wow!
-Lord Hokage!

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:54.421
Whoa, it's a super
special rare card!

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:55.455
How lucky!

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.658
Damn it!

00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:58.825
Missed again!

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:01.528
(laughter)

00:11:01.562 --> 00:11:02.462
Come on, stop!

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:03.830
-Quit laughing!
-Everyone wants that

00:11:03.864 --> 00:11:05.199
super special rare card.

00:11:05.232 --> 00:11:06.934
But to you, it's
not the right one?

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.068
Aw man!

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.037
And I was so excited
when I was opening it!

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.772
Here, you can have it, Iwabe.

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:12.906
No use having a buncha these!

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.907
(elated laughter)

00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:15.309
All right!

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.544
I've been looking all over
the place for this one.

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:18.478
Damn it!

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:19.913
I didn't want to
spend anymore today,

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:21.081
but it can't be helped!

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:23.183
I mean, I can't let
it end like this!

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:28.222
Man, they really can be
unbelievably stupid sometimes.

00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:30.224
They don't even know what
cards they're gonna get,

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:31.792
but they keep
wasting their money.

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:32.693
I know, right?

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:34.928
What's so fun about that?

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:36.096
But does it really matter

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:37.931
as long as they're
still having fun?

00:11:37.965 --> 00:11:40.100
No, I guess it doesn't.

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.669
Aren't you gonna buy
some X Cards, Mitsuki?

00:11:42.703 --> 00:11:44.037
No, I won't.

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:45.939
I don't want to
waste all my money.

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:47.808
That is just so like you!

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:50.043
Yeah, you're so reliable!

00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:52.913
Okay, one more pack of X Cards!

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:54.414
Thanks, again!

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.819
Boy, you're really are
into X Cards, aren't you?

00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:00.487
How many packs have
you bought, anyway?

00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:03.323
Look, there's a super rare
card I'm trying to find.

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.459
I'll show you when
I finally get it.

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:08.962
Even if you don't tell us,

00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:10.230
I'm pretty sure we
have a good idea

00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:11.231
of which one you want.

00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:13.300
Huh? Are you kidding me?

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.304
(sigh)

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.907
That's it, I'm done with this.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.074
I'm hungry.

00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:23.277
I'm gonna get myself
a Thunder Burger.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.211
Okay!

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.946
I wanna go get a burger, too!

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:27.514
Hey, Sarada, let's go!

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:28.515
[Sarada] Okay!

00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:29.316
[Mitsuki] Me, too.

00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:30.884
[Cho-Cho] Come on, let's go!

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:32.219
Do you guys think that Boruto

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.487
is just gonna end up spending

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.689
all of his mission
earnings on X Cards?

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:36.690
Seems like it!

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:38.058
He's really dedicated!

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.259
(chuckling)

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:42.029
And because of that, I
get to profit off it!

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:45.799
Hey, Yamaoka!

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:47.067
What is it, Milord?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.802
Go and ask them how
many boxes of X Cards

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.204
they have in here.

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.139
Of course, as you wish.

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:56.476
Pardon me, but how
many boxes of X Cards

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.946
do you have for sale here
in your establishment?

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.714
Please, hold on for a second.

00:13:02.516 --> 00:13:05.485
Milord, it seems this shop
just received a shipment

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:08.422
and has 30 boxes
in stock right now.

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:11.225
All right, Yamaoka.

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:13.360
Buy up every X Card they've got!

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.629
-(shocked gasps)
-As you wish.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:18.799
We'd like to purchase all
30 boxes that you have,

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:20.701
and we'll pay with this card.

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.803
(excited shriek)

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.204
No way. Who is he?

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:25.405
He's buying them all?

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:26.440
Is he for real?

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.775
Is he some rich guy's
kid or something?

00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:31.445
(shocked gasp)

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:38.385
Wow, no way!

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:39.186
How awesome!

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:40.687
A rare Seventh Hokage card!

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:42.089
It's the last one I need!

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.224
If I get it, I'll complete
my X Card collection!

00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:46.093
Yeah, so what are
you getting at?

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:49.530
Listen, I simply have to
have that X Card for myself!

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:50.531
So come on!

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:51.532
Sell it to me!

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:52.699
Huh?

00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:55.636
How much do you want? I'll
pay you really well for it!

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.538
What are you even talking about?

00:13:57.571 --> 00:13:58.772
Oh, come on, now!

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:01.041
Genin pay is quite
low, isn't it?

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:03.911
Listen, kid.

00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:05.779
I wouldn't sell
you my Hokage card

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:07.581
no matter how much you offer me!

00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:09.349
What? Why not?

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:11.518
Because I want to
become a great ninja

00:14:11.552 --> 00:14:13.420
just like Lord Hokage is.

00:14:13.453 --> 00:14:14.688
Just forget it, kid.

00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:16.323
I'm never giving this card up,

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.192
no matter how much
money you offer me.

00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:19.960
Oh, give me a break, would you?

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:21.094
Don't act so tough!

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:23.330
Come on, don't you
want some more money?

00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:27.534
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:28.936
What's your deal anyway?

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:30.504
Iwabe.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.338
Listen.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.906
Why don't we just
forget about him

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.375
and go to Ankorodo
for some dumplings?

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:36.543
Huh?

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:38.412
Yeah, good idea!

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:39.446
Let's hurry.

00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:43.183
We'll see for just how long

00:14:43.217 --> 00:14:45.552
you can keep up this
little act of yours.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:47.588
[Male Shop Clerk] Welcome!

00:14:48.956 --> 00:14:50.224
Hey, it's that kid!

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:51.825
The one from earlier!

00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:53.827
Why are you here?

00:14:53.861 --> 00:14:55.662
You guys are too late!

00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:56.830
I'm really sorry,

00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:58.198
but I've already bought up

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:00.567
every single dumpling that
they had in this shop.

00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:01.935
Yamaoka.

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:03.704
Yes! Right away, Milord!

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.206
We'll use this card to pay.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.942
But that's the most
exclusive credit card

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:11.211
that only the wealthiest
of the wealthy can get!

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.413
I've never even seen one before!

00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:17.918
Just what do you think
you're trying to do, huh?

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:19.353
I don't know what you mean!

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:21.088
But if you agree
to let me have that

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:22.756
rare Seventh Hokage
card of yours,

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:25.359
then I'll give you a
lifetime supply of dumplings.

00:15:25.392 --> 00:15:28.095
I told you I'm
not gonna sell it!

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:29.830
Let's go, guys!

00:15:29.863 --> 00:15:31.532
[Shikadai] Uh hey!

00:15:31.565 --> 00:15:32.599
Wait up!

00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:36.436
You can't escape me.

00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:40.307
Oh, well, uh...

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.277
I'm very happy that you
visited us, but, uh...

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:47.080
Uh, one snack burger, please.

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:48.549
I'll have the same thing.

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:49.449
I'll have--

00:15:49.483 --> 00:15:51.818
Uh, no, you see, I'm
very sorry, but--

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:53.287
[All] Huh?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.288
[Tento] Hi!

00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.088
[All] Huh?

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:57.357
It's no use ordering anything.

00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:59.092
Because I've already purchased

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:01.662
every single burger
in this restaurant!

00:16:01.695 --> 00:16:04.231
Ugh, not you again!

00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:06.667
Don't you have any more
ingredients in the back?

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.669
Can you make some more burgers?

00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:10.337
I'm very sorry!

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.806
You just don't get it, do you?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.308
Huh? Get what?

00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:16.810
I actually just purchased
this entire place!

00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:18.812
This whole restaurant
is all mine now.

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.214
Forget burgers.

00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:22.516
I might just turn this into
a whole other kind of shop!

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:23.817
The entire place?

00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:25.185
You've gotta be kidding!

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:28.755
We won't be able to eat
burgers here anymore?

00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:32.559
Well if you wanna continue
being able to eat burgers...

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.463
You already know what
I'm gonna say, don't you?

00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:46.406
Still, I can't!

00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:49.343
Who would have
thought a lowly genin

00:16:49.376 --> 00:16:52.479
who isn't even on an X
Card would be so stubborn!

00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.948
Come on, now.
Just give up already!

00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:56.783
What did you just say to me?

00:16:56.817 --> 00:16:58.218
That's it, I'm done!

00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:00.287
I'm gonna shut you up for good!

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:04.091
Just forget about all this.

00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:05.959
[Shikadai] You
were already here?

00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:07.327
(stunned gasp)

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:10.297
Listen, he needs to get
some sense knocked into him!

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:11.098
Hey, c'mon!

00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:12.699
Just calm down, Iwabe!

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:15.035
Hmm.

00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:17.337
Of course.

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:19.773
Commoners always tend
to resort to violence.

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:21.575
How horribly barbaric!

00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:24.344
I gotta say, you're
acting so damn proud,

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:26.079
but only because you're rich.

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:28.315
Well, no, I'm not
especially proud of it.

00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:30.184
In life, victory is just decided

00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:32.219
by the hand that one
is dealt, that's all.

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:34.087
And the cards that
I have in my hand

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:37.057
are simply different from
what you lowly commoners have.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.825
Just like with X Cards!

00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:40.627
It's not just about
the cards you have.

00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.197
It's also how you play
them and battle with them.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.499
I mean, isn't that actually
the fun part about it?

00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:46.834
Although I guess I
don't really know

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.069
what your strongest
card might be.

00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:53.006
Well, the strongest card
that I have is this one!

00:17:55.943 --> 00:17:57.277
If that's the case,

00:17:57.311 --> 00:17:59.179
then no one's gonna give you
the time of day, you know?

00:17:59.213 --> 00:18:00.814
Big talk from someone

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:03.317
who hasn't even made
it onto an X Card!

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:06.386
And that's the reason why.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.387
Huh?

00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:08.388
What do you mean?

00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:10.357
I'm gonna become such
an incredible shinobi

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.626
that the guys who make the
X Cards are gonna come to me

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:14.828
and beg me to let them
put me onto a card!

00:18:14.862 --> 00:18:15.996
Huh?

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:17.231
And I'm gonna going to
be such an amazing card

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:18.699
that even your strongest card

00:18:18.732 --> 00:18:19.967
won't be able to beat defeat me!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.236
I'm totally gonna shock my dad.

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:23.270
Huh?

00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:28.775
Oh, and by the way, I have
five Seventh Hokage cards.

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:29.910
Huh?

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.612
But I'm not gonna
give you even one!

00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:34.982
You can go and buy up
all the X Cards you want.

00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:39.052
Hey, Boruto!

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:40.687
You're really gonna leave?

00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:42.189
Boruto?

00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:44.925
Well, I can't help it if
he bought the whole place.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.159
Let's just go.

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:48.829
Oh, man.

00:18:48.862 --> 00:18:50.931
It's just so boring in here!

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.199
Huh?

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:53.500
It seems this restaurant

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:55.202
is a special place
for you commoners,

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.771
so I'll just pretend
as if I didn't buy it.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.673
All right, come on, Yamaoka.

00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:00.941
Let's head out.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:02.509
Oh. Yes, Milord.

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:09.917
What was that all about, anyway?

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.552
I dunno.

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:13.554
The only thing we really
found out about him

00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:15.055
is that he's super rich.

00:19:15.088 --> 00:19:18.825
I don't wanna see him again,
no matter who he might be,

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:20.527
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:21.595
Well, let's hope!

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:31.705
Wow, so that was Boruto Uzumaki?

00:19:31.738 --> 00:19:35.676
I just met the son of Naruto
Uzumaki, the Seventh Hokage.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.183
I just got my hands on
some very good info!

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:48.488
(Boruto yawns)

00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:52.092
Aw man, getting called in
this early in the morning.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:55.162
This better be for a
B-rank mission or else!

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.332
Well, Big Bro Konohamaru?

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.334
What'd you want to see me about?

00:20:02.803 --> 00:20:04.171
No way! You?

00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:05.472
Hey, Boruto.

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:08.075
I understand you met
this person yesterday.

00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:10.344
Huh? Yeah, but...

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.312
I didn't really wanna
ever see him again,

00:20:12.346 --> 00:20:14.481
-to tell you the truth--
-This is the son of Ikkyu Madoka

00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:16.783
the Feudal Lord of
the Land of Fire,

00:20:16.817 --> 00:20:18.652
Lord Tento Madoka.

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:19.786
Huh?

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.154
The Feudal Lord?

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:25.158
Hey, so thank you for yesterday!

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.228
Now, then, Boruto Uzumaki,

00:20:28.262 --> 00:20:29.930
please feel free
to call me Tento!

00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:32.099
Uh, okay.

00:20:32.132 --> 00:20:33.967
Those clothes of
yours are so shabby

00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:35.569
that when I first
met you yesterday,

00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:38.405
I had no idea you were
the Seventh Hokage's son.

00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:40.541
(chuckle)

00:20:40.574 --> 00:20:41.808
Why you little!

00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:43.310
But still, as long
as you work hard,

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.812
I guess I won't have
anything to complain about.

00:20:45.846 --> 00:20:47.047
You're competent, right?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.816
Big Bro, what exactly
is going on here?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.052
This is a mission
for you, Boruto.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.587
For the next few days,

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.090
you're gonna be Young Lord
Tento's bodyguard and escort.

00:20:57.124 --> 00:20:58.825
What are you talking about?

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:00.227
Why do I have to do it?

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.363
Why can't Sarada or
Mitsuki handle this?

00:21:03.397 --> 00:21:05.499
I mean, I've already got
a really strong feeling

00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:07.434
I'm not gonna get
along with him!

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:11.338
Aw, come on, don't say that.

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:14.474
And besides, the Feudal
Lord, Ikkyu Madoka,

00:21:14.508 --> 00:21:17.277
has requested you
personally for this job.

00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:18.312
Hmm.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.482
Listen, Boruto, it's
a good opportunity.

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:24.685
So, come on, show
me how the commoners

00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:26.019
live in this village,

00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:28.455
I'm already starting to get
really excited about it!

00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:32.059
Look, I may have
stopped Iwabe yesterday,

00:21:32.092 --> 00:21:33.694
but his bodyguard?
No way!

00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:35.796
I wanna slug him, not guard him!

00:21:35.829 --> 00:21:37.831
Well, it'll be a
good lesson for you

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:40.701
to experience such
hardship, too, Boruto.

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:41.935
(laughter)

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:44.671
I'm looking forward
to it, Boruto!

00:21:44.705 --> 00:21:45.939
(sigh)

00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:47.307
Seriously?

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.211
Looks like the meeting
with the Feudal Lord

00:21:51.245 --> 00:21:53.213
is happening today as scheduled.

00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:56.950
We had some unexpected
interference, but whatever.

00:21:56.984 --> 00:21:58.485
Let's notify the Boss.

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:02.456
Finally, time for the Mujina
Gang to make our move!

00:22:13.133 --> 00:22:18.305
(closing theme music)

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.091
Hey, Boruto!

00:23:44.124 --> 00:23:45.492
Will you teach me ninjutsu?

00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:48.562
In exchange, I'll give you
that rare card you really want!

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:49.596
No, thanks!

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.231
I'm the type of guy
who gets what he wants

00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:52.699
by using his own strengths,

00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:54.201
no matter how hard it might be!

00:23:54.234 --> 00:23:55.402
[Tento] Aww, c'mon!

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:56.904
Teach me ninjutsu!

00:23:56.937 --> 00:23:58.038
[Boruto] Okay, fine!

00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:00.207
But training's
gonna be super hard!

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.645
Next time on Boruto Naruto
Next Generations: "Friends!"

00:24:04.678 --> 00:24:05.546
All right!

00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:07.047
It's time to be really
hard on this kid

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.416
and knock that attitude
right outta him!

00:24:11.251 --> 00:24:16.456
(closing theme music)
