00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.718
[groggy moans]

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.387
[grunt] Where am I?

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.723
What happened?

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.395
Boruto... If it's for you...

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:35.202
[pained grunts and gasps]

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.405
[pained grunts]

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:40.541
Boruto!

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:42.709
[gasps]

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.615
[gasp]

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.886
[pained grunt and groan]

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.054
(SARADA) <i>Mitsuki?</i>

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.455
[gasp]

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.424
Mitsuki!

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.860
Hey, just what do you think
you're doing?!

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.529
Sarada... Where's Boruto?!

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:08.635
[gasp] It's alright. Lord
Seventh protected Boruto and
everybody else, too.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.207
Oh, I see... Well, thank
goodness.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.276
Now come on, get back in bed!

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:23.050
But Lord Seventh was kidnapped
by those guys...

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:24.218
[gasp]

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:29.623
So right now... my dad's on his
way with the Five kage to rescue
him. And...

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.458
Boruto went with them.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.693
Boruto, too?

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:33.427
(SARADA) <i>Yeah.</i>

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.198
He just snapped out of his
depression like that and went
with them.

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:39.399
(MITSUKI) <i>That's so like him...</i>

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.205
We'll use this to get to them.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:55.382
Let's go!

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.318
Sarada, Shikadai, take care of
everyone!

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.397
He'll be fine, right? I mean, my
dad and the Five Kage are with
him...

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.567
He'll come home safe, won't he?

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.435
(MITSUKI) <i>He'll be okay.</i>

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:20.207
Because, after all, he's the sun
in my sky.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:22.543
[chuckle]

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.782
I knew you'd say that.
[laughing]

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.217
Yeah, you're right.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:36.256
Okay... you were in critical
condition, you know! You gotta
stay in bed and rest.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.494
You're right. I feel like all my
energy has been drained away.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:41.595
[chuckle] There you go!

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:42.663
Whoah!

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:44.097
[chuckle] This is kind of fun.

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:45.399
Yeah, yeah...

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.437
Okay, well, I've gotta get going
now. I'll call Shizune in for
you.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.371
Okay.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:59.213
Wow, Boruto... As expected,
you're amazing...

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:04.771
[pained yells and groans]

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:10.477
So tell me... how does it feel
to be nourishing this nursery
I've created?

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:11.745
It's quite nice, isn't it?

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:17.451
This Divine Tree was created
from someone just like you who
harbored a Tailed Beast...

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.485
within him.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.553
[pained grunts]

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:20.787
<i>Old Man Bee...!</i>

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.423
[pained yells and groans]

00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:28.295
And shortly, you'll become part
of the Divine Tree as well! Hm?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.897
[pained yells and groans]

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.833
Such ridiculously enormous
chakra.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:35.636
And we've only reached the
halfway point.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.441
[pained yell and moan]

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:42.609
[grunt]

00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:44.611
It's taking too long.

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.446
[heavy breathing]

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.781
Sorry about that.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:48.715
[grunt]

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.921
You see... [pained breath] It's
just that... we ninja...

00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:56.723
...don't like to make things
easy, ya know?

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:59.960
[angered growl]

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:04.431
Ninja are different than you.
Our abilities took time and hard
work to acquire...

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:08.535
So we're not gonna give them up
at least not as easy as that!

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:12.706
[chuckle] So what will you do?

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:18.779
You vulgar creatures train and
persevere endlessly- and
pointlessly- all for nothing!

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:23.517
Once you become Chakra Fruit...
<i>You're merely fodder.</i>

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.288
Before bringing you here I was
able to absorb a large number of
jutsu.

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:31.592
I wouldn't begin to speculate,
nor would I care to know...

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:35.195
how much time you spent
mastering the ones you possess.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.798
But... with just these pills...

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:41.702
...we can obtain power greater
than yours effortlessly.

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:44.037
Huh?!

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:48.008
[nervous groan]

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.279
With this Shinobi Gauntlet you
can use jutsu without using your
own chakra.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.715
And also you can use other
people's jutsu.

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:58.852
It's just like that Scientific
Ninja Tool...

00:06:58.886 --> 00:06:59.720
Huh?

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:03.790
I guess that... it's all my
fault, huh?

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.159
If you'd talked to me before
this...

00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:07.761
[grunt] I...

00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:11.064
Then I...

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:14.468
I wouldn't have ended up in this
damn mess!

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:18.172
I pushed him... That's why he
relied on that Tool...

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:21.175
I treated him just like a little
kid...

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:25.179
I didn't even acknowledge him at
all... And I didn't try...

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:29.383
...to see him for who he really
is. And that's the reason...

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:34.121
[pained yells and groans]

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:37.558
What are you mumbling about you
fool? Just be quiet now.

00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:40.627
This is still going to take a
lot of time.

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.397
[pained yells and groans]

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.201
Anyway, you said you'd awakened
this "awesome power". So what is
it?

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:49.536
It's the Byakugan.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.304
[gasp]

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:50.737
What?!

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.542
Ordinarily, the Byakugan
requires intense training before
one can manifest it.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.778
Oh. Is that really true?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:01.215
Well, then, I guess that... I
must really be a genius!

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:09.456
Like Shikamaru just told you,
you need a lot of training
before you can use the Byakugan.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:13.527
And to be honest, there's
something that I know better
than anyone else...

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.029
you haven't gone through that
kind of training.

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:17.731
What's that mean?

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.568
Are you trying to say that I'm
just lying about this?

00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:26.607
No, I'm not. There are cases
like Himawari who've awakened it
out of the blue.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.444
So we can't simply write off
what you're saying... But, then
again...

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:34.982
I see. So in other words, you
just don't trust me, is that it?

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:38.118
At the very least, there has to
be some proof.

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:39.486
But I can see it!

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.222
Take a good look.

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.392
Hold on, that's...

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:51.331
(NARUTO CLONE) <i>Yeah... The</i>
<i>person who attacked your</i>
<i>classmates.</i>

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:55.536
The chakra in his body has been
<i>almost completely depleted.</i>

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:59.973
Listen... the only reason that
you've been safe during these
incidents...

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:02.776
...is sheer luck and nothing
more than that!

00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:06.113
This is no longer a matter for
kids playing detective.

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:09.283
Yeah, I know that, alright?!

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:13.420
You don't. You don't understand
the true horrors of battle till
you've seen them for yourself.

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:17.124
First, graduate from the
Academy. And then we'll be able
to talk.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.426
What?! Come on, Dad! That isn't
fair!

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:22.629
Boruto and the others were just
getting workplace experience.

00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:24.298
As I assigned them to.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:26.567
Correct, Boruto?

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:32.773
Look, Shino, you know he's only
a kid. He's too young to really
understand.

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:34.474
You may well be right.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.881
But still... there are times
when a child is able to show us
he can do more than an adult...

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.383
...if he is treated like an
adult.

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:45.786
But why not?! You're the Hokage,
after all!

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:50.991
Yes, but as Hokage, I have to
think about the well-being of
the entire village.

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:54.294
As I already told you I will not
let her down.

00:09:55.662 --> 00:10:00.434
Don't worry. But just try to
stay out of trouble, okay?

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.770
It's for your own good. Don't
stick your nose into dangerous
situations.

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:08.509
What do you mean by that?! When
I do something I always see it
through!

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:12.279
Listen, Boruto, I didn't
apologize to you well enough.

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:14.515
[sigh] About your birthday the
other day...

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:17.184
(BORUTO) <i>Forget it.</i>

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:21.255
You were super busy with all the
Hokage business, right? I never
had very high hopes, anyway.

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:23.857
Boruto, I...

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:27.394
But listen up! You'd better be
home for Himawari's birthday!

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:35.435
I honestly don't care if my
stupid old man won't come home
for my birthday. But Himawari...

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:41.108
She's still young n' innocent.
And she wants you there.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:44.444
So promise me right now! You
better come home for hers!

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.615
Yeah. I promise.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:53.287
Look. This is for real! If you
break your word, then I'll never
forgive you!

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:57.558
[chuckle]

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.094
Uh...!

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:03.197
[groan]

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.532
[pained yells and groans]

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:09.770
<i>I really didn't try... to</i>
<i>understand him... at all...</i>

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:12.039
[pained yells and groans]

00:11:13.974 --> 00:11:18.545
[chuckle] <i>I guess that I can't</i>
complain... It's only natural if
<i>he calls me "stupid old man."</i>

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:21.715
[pained yells and groans]

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.420
Stop mumbling and resisting!
Just let us extract your chakra!

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:30.791
[pained gasp] Nope, sorry.
There's no way that's gonna
happen, dude.

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:31.458
[gasp]

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:33.961
Huh?!

00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:41.969
[chuckle] I plan... on wrapping
this up quickly... so that... I
can hurry back home... to him...

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:45.506
...well that is after I defeat
you! Huh?

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:46.206
[gasp]

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:48.709
Let's do it!

00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:51.745
Ahhh!

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:54.548
[grunt]

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:57.217
What?! They're here?

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:00.554
<i>The one in the black cape</i>
<i>must've used his Rinnegan!</i>

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:03.390
Dad, hold on!

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:11.331
[angry growl]

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:13.133
[angry growl]

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.702
Don't even think about trying to
escape.

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:18.739
You vulgar creatures.

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:20.374
Let's get him!

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:27.981
Talk to me, Dad, are you okay?

00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.617
[gasp] Boruto! W-what are you
doing here?!

00:12:30.651 --> 00:12:32.286
[gasp]

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:33.854
<i>Why are you wearing that?</i>

00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:36.723
Uh...! [chuckle]

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:38.458
Many things have happened,
Naruto...

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:39.159
Huh?

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.627
And, well...

00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:42.563
Now he's become a shinobi.

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:50.571
[chuckling] I feel like I'm
looking at my own Shadow Clone,
here!

00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:54.074
Do I look a little bit cooler
now, at least?

00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:55.676
I'll say!

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:56.710
Better than before!

00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:57.711
Uh...!

00:12:58.478 --> 00:12:59.546
Huh?

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:04.985
Wait, you just said "before",
so... you have been paying
attention?

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:06.553
[sigh]

00:13:11.325 --> 00:13:11.725
Boruto...

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:14.394
I'm sorry...

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:15.395
For everything.

00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:24.571
By trying to protect you...
and everyone in the village... I
ended up ignoring my family...

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:27.774
And I didn't even really try to
understand you.

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.611
Look, Dad...

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:35.182
Back when I was just a kid... I
wanted attention, too, so I kept
pulling pranks.

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:38.785
Honestly... I'm the last guy who
should be lecturing you.

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:41.488
Wait, you used to pull pranks?

00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:43.056
[gasp] Oh, yeah...

00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:47.294
I'd also paint words like
"stupid" and "idiot" on the
Great Stone Faces...

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.897
and Iruka Sensei yelled at me a
whole lot.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.398
What, seriously?!

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:04.378
Y'know, it's funny, dad... but,
honestly, I hardly know anything
at all about you...

00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:05.445
Boruto...

00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:08.048
No that isn't really what I
mean...

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:12.553
Actually... I've always wanted
to know...

00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:18.825
But... my pride held me back...
and I didn't even try to see
your side of things...

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:21.562
I just kept pushing back at
you...

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.732
But now... I wanna know!

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.236
I guess what I mean is...

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:30.704
It's fine the way it was.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:35.709
Yeah... It's okay to keep things
like they were...

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:39.713
But...

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:42.216
when you're around, instead of
lectures...

00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:45.786
I'd really like you to tell me
stories about your past.

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:46.553
[chuckle]

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:49.556
[chuckle]

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:51.558
Sure...

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:55.295
Although... I gotta give you a
warning...

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:56.230
Huh?

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.466
We're talking about a seriously
long story, you know!

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:01.802
[laughing]

00:15:01.835 --> 00:15:05.706
Well... if we're gonna protect
everybody, then we'd better get
going.

00:15:07.474 --> 00:15:08.542
[gasp]

00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:14.448
To protect everybody, huh?

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:15.315
Huh?

00:15:16.884 --> 00:15:20.988
Oh, uh... Nothing. You always
say you gotta protect everyone
in the village...

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:24.458
But I guess... you really do
mean that, don't you?

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.693
[chuckle] Yeah, of course, ya
know!

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:27.561
Huh?

00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:31.665
I gave my word. Once I do, I
never go back on it.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.787
And I never will. Because that's
my Ninja Way!

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.055
[gasp]

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:57.558
Alright!

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.227
Let's go do this!

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:01.728
Yeah!

00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:03.630
I'm with you! Let's do it!

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:13.140
(SHIKAMARU) <i>Anyway... just make</i>
<i>sure that no one is missing.</i>

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:17.344
Also, we've received intel that
there's one intruder that's gone
into hiding.

00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:20.647
We believe there's a good chance
he's still lurking close by.

00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:23.116
Everyone, remain on full alert.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.486
We don't really know what to
expect, so be on guard!

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.354
Yes, sir!

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:29.590
(SHIKADAI) <i>Dad...</i>

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:31.358
What is it?

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:35.762
Um, shouldn't we... Be sending
out reinforcements?

00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:37.965
Are you worried about Boruto?

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:40.767
Well, yeah, of course. I mean,
he's my friend.

00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:42.402
[chuckle]

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:47.407
Kinda like me, when it came to
Naruto. I remember that I
couldn't sit still, either.

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:48.475
[gasp]

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:50.978
Just stay calm, alright?

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:54.248
We don't even know if the
enemy's gonna launch a second
wave of attacks yet.

00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:58.652
You're always cool and rational.
I expect you to be able to
analyze the situation.

00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:00.087
[sigh]

00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:04.424
Look, all this is the Static
Rook Anaguma defense.

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:05.259
[gasp]

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:07.828
You get what I'm saying, don't
you?

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.731
Yeah, I do. We're the ones...

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:15.235
...who'll protect the Hidden
Leaf Village till Boruto and the
others return!

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:16.737
[chuckle]

00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:20.407
Excuse me. I'm gonna join the
others, dad!

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:23.076
[sigh]

00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:26.413
[chuckle] Well, look at him,
Mister Big Shot!

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:32.419
[grunt]

00:17:33.687 --> 00:17:34.621
[pained grunt]

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:36.256
[pained grunt]

00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:38.125
Hm?

00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:41.094
[annoyed grunt]

00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:47.835
[grunt] You're really nimble and
fast for someone your size.
[gasp]

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:53.607
You'll regret your insolence
soon enough... you
inconsequential weakling!

00:17:55.609 --> 00:17:56.443
[grunt]

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:57.411
[pained grunt]

00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:58.779
You're wide open!

00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:00.247
And so are you.

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:01.415
Huh?!

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.319
[pained grunts]

00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:07.621
You impudent--!

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:11.158
Huh?

00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:12.292
Chidori!

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:15.596
[pained grunts]

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.765
(CHOJURO) <i>Bloody Mist Sword</i>
<i>Art...</i>

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.534
Honenuki: Bone...

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:21.502
...Mutilation!

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:22.536
Tsuchikage!

00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:23.403
Leave it to me!

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.807
Lava Style: Ash Stone Sealing
Jutsu!

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.742
[inhale and blowing out]

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.077
[pained grunts]

00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:32.412
[straining]

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.482
Huh?

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:39.086
Leave this guy to us. We'll hold
him here! You go take care of
the other one!

00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:45.926
Making a move on the Hidden Leaf
Village when the Five Kage were
all assembled there...

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.428
You guys sure have bad luck...

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:49.129
[annoyed grunting]

00:18:50.898 --> 00:18:54.635
If I were to die right here,
that would mean Kagura would end
up becoming the next Mizukage...

00:18:54.668 --> 00:18:55.335
so...

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.037
...we're gonna stop you right
now!

00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:01.241
[grunt]

00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:10.751
Sorry we're late!

00:19:11.618 --> 00:19:12.653
(BORUTO) <i>Dad, wait!</i>

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:13.720
Huh?

00:19:13.754 --> 00:19:14.755
What's the matter, Boruto?

00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:17.424
You can't use ninjutsu against
him, remember?!

00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:26.133
Back in the arena he absorbed
<i>every single jutsu I threw</i>
<i>at him...</i>

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:31.004
And then he magnified the
intensity of those jutsu and
threw them right back at us!

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:38.111
Man, what a pain. [grunt]

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.449
It's simple.

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:47.454
You absorb jutsu, and then
release it, don't you?

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:51.491
But then that ammunition is gone
once you use it, isn't that
right?

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:52.426
[grunt]

00:19:53.627 --> 00:19:56.663
Just like those toys from the
Scientific Ninja Tool Team.

00:19:56.697 --> 00:19:58.465
Then that makes it easy.

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:02.636
We'll just use taijutsu. And
we'll take you down with brute
force.

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.505
Although that's kinda dull.

00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:06.440
[growl] Huh?

00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:11.712
[straining]

00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:13.814
[growl]

00:20:13.847 --> 00:20:18.085
We've already taken care of your
friend. Just surrender.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.093
So, is that your child, then...
my dear Fox?

00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:33.834
Ah, yes I see... It appears that
you're burdened with a rather
interesting fate...

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:34.735
[gasp]

00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:37.971
It's really such a pity, Fox...

00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:40.340
...that you possess so much raw
power...

00:20:40.374 --> 00:20:44.378
yet you don't have the means to
pass it down to the next
generation...

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:47.581
What does that mean?! What the
hell are you talking about?!

00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:48.982
Just keep your distance, Boruto.

00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:55.088
Now let me show you... the way
we handle things in my clan!

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.360
[straining]

00:21:00.394 --> 00:21:01.061
[grunt]

00:21:02.563 --> 00:21:03.830
No way! How did he-?!

00:21:03.864 --> 00:21:06.900
Do it now, Lord Momoshiki.

00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:10.204
The time has come to consume my
chakra.

00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:15.409
Just as in the past, when my
guardian entrusted me with their
power! Do not waver!

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:17.811
Don't worry; I won't!

00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:20.747
[pained yell]

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:29.323
[chewing]

00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:30.290
[gasp]

00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:31.658
No way!

00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:32.726
Your own brethren?!

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:33.760
Damn it!

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:35.729
<i>This is bad.</i>

00:21:35.762 --> 00:21:37.064
[chewing]

00:21:37.497 --> 00:21:38.665
[gasp]

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:40.767
[licking] Sorry, too late.

00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:41.568
[gasp]

00:22:02.256 --> 00:22:03.423
Fox...

00:22:04.858 --> 00:22:07.461
...it's going to be your turn
next!

00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:48.295
(MOMOSHIKI) <i>How about we just</i>
<i>end this right now...</i>

00:23:48.328 --> 00:23:51.598
all of you fools who would dare
<i>to defy a god!</i>

00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:54.168
(NARUTO) <i>Oh man. This is not</i>
<i>looking good...</i>

00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:58.205
(MOMOSHIKI) <i>Yes, that's right.</i>
You understand. And now you will
<i>all die!</i>

00:23:58.238 --> 00:24:03.577
(BORUTO) <i>I can't wimp out now! I</i>
gotta trust my teacher, Sasuke,
<i>the one who believed in me!</i>

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:09.249
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
Generations: "Father and Child."

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.585
<i>I gotta do this!</i>
