WEBVTT

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:10.477
(bright mysterious music)

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.082
[Mirai] That day,
while I was down

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.084
in the basement archives,

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.620
I came across a
confidential document.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.222
It was purely by chance.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.592
It read Mission Report

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:29.363
[Shikamaru] 1-1,365.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:34.501
By Shikamaru Nara Regarding
the death of Asuma Sarutobi.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.307
The shinobi named Hidan is
a unique, immortal being.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.244
(blood whooshing)

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.813
After acquiring the
blood of his target,

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.483
he creates a link
with that victim.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:53.620
Any damage he sustains is
transferred to his target.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:56.757
While under Hidan's Curse Jutsu,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.496
Asuma Sarutobi perished
in the line of duty.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:09.169
-(Mirai gasps)
-(somber music)

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.076
(mysterious music)

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.345
Is that you, Dad?

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:25.252
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.601
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:54.208
(Opening Theme Music)

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.452
(mysterious music)

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.924
But where's my mom?

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.360
I could've sworn that
I just heard her voice!

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:15.462
Hey, Miss Mirai?

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.231
Mm-hmm.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.101
So, did you hear it?

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:24.137
The voice of your loved
one calling out your name?

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.173
-(gentle music)
-(water whooshing)

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.841
That is sacred water.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:31.411
It's to purify yourselves, but
don't drink till I tell you.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.082
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.052
You'll all be seeing your
loved ones very soon.

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:44.024
So if I drink this
then I'll see my dad?

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.793
Yes, that's right, Mirai.

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:50.230
Now, when I give the signal,
all of you drink it together.

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:52.933
Tell me, Tatsumi, what
are you going to do

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.401
when you see your mom?

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:57.337
I'll say I'm sorry.

00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.508
And then I want to go to
her and hold her hand.

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:04.344
That wish, and the others,
will be granted soon.

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:06.914
[Mirai] You know,
when I see my dad,

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.483
I want him to teach
me how to play shogi.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:13.253
Mirai, don't make everyone
else have to wait.

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:17.491
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just
a little bit anxious.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:22.062
I wonder, what if my dad
doesn't even recognize me?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:25.332
After all, I've never
actually met him before.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.937
Listen, there's something
I haven't told you.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.338
(Mirai gasps)

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.708
I possess the ability
to go back and forth

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.644
between this world and the next.

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:39.313
I've actually met Asuma before

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.915
while I was in the other world.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.450
What? Is that true?

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.587
He's wanted to meet you
for quite a long time now.

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.223
Oh, that reminds me.

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:53.193
About my name, apparently, I
was named after Mirai Toki,

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:56.196
a shogi genius that
my dad admired.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.399
Although to be frank,
I'm no good at shogi.

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.501
Mirai Toki, huh?

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:04.137
Yes, Asuma's often
mentioned that name to me.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.242
(Mirai giggling)

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:09.276
Mirai?

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:14.047
Right, now I know you're lying.

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.617
There's no such
person as Mirai Toki,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.786
which means being named
after them was a lie.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.954
Mirai!

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.257
You're a liar too!

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.626
And you'll rot in hell
for what you've done!

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.928
What do you mean?

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:30.564
Are you trying to
defile the ceremony?

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:33.066
(girls gasping)

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.268
Just ignore her.

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.336
Quickly! Drink the sacred water!

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.805
Sorry, you're gonna
feel a little shock.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.641
(electricity crackling)

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:41.842
(girls gasping)

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.710
-Wait, why am I?
-What is going on?

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:45.579
My head hurts!

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.081
Just stay calm! It's all
from the hypnotic vapor.

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:49.082
-(girl gasping)
-(weapon clanging)

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:50.551
Don't move, Mirai!

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:52.786
(girls gasping)

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.088
So you already knew
about the vapor?

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:56.356
Don't underestimate a shinobi.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.325
[Ryuki] Do you know
how hard it was

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.960
to gather all these girls here?

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:01.862
How dare you interfere!

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:03.063
You're the one who's

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.666
behind the missing
persons cases, aren't you?

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.800
Why did you do it?

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:10.337
It's all so that I'll be
able to acquire immortality.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.174
Lord Jashin loves fresh
young blood as sacrifices.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:18.111
Lord Jashin? Then does
that mean you guys?

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:19.479
Miss Mirai. (whimpering)

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:22.916
You're going to take care
of a little work for me now.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.019
(Tatsumi gasping)

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:28.956
(blood slurping)

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.692
(Ryuki laughs)

00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:37.431
She's now cursed! Curse Jutsu,
body, possession, blood!

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:40.133
(dramatic music)

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:43.036
Your friend Mirai, kill her!

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.540
(body whooshing)

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.841
(Mirai gasping)

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:48.942
Tatsumi!

00:06:48.976 --> 00:06:51.512
(Tatsumi grunting)

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.548
There's now a connection
between Tatsumi's body

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.216
and this puppet of mine.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.586
Meaning that she's become a
puppet I can control at will!

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.923
Tatsumi, stop it!

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:05.092
Please, I don't wanna hurt you!

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.127
(dramatic music)

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.096
Can't bring yourself
to fight an opponent

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.364
that's not a shinobi?

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.766
You're weak, like
lukewarm water.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:16.737
A shinobi who's reluctant
to act is utterly worthless!

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:19.573
(Mirai grunting)

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.442
(knife clanging)

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:28.182
(gasps) Tatsumi!

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:30.951
(laughs) I told you, this puppet

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:34.087
and Tatsumi are connected
by cursed blood.

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.791
Now, Tatsumi, go
and kill that woman!

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.861
-(Tatsumi moaning)
-(Mirai gasping)

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:43.463
Stop this! Please, Tatsumi!

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:49.536
-(Mirai groaning)
-(suspenseful music)

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:54.408
(eerie music)

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:55.509
(Ryuki gasping)

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:57.010
Master Ryuki!

00:07:57.678 --> 00:07:58.812
What's going on?

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:01.915
Out of nowhere, a masked
guy with messy hair

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.050
Kakashi!

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:05.319
And a guy with strong features-

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.654
-(blow thudding)
-(body thudding)

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:09.022
And Mr. Guy, too.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.225
(laughs) That makes five for me.

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:13.694
And Kakashi, you've
only gotten two.

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.863
Wait, this is a contest?

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.331
Damn right, it is!

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:19.967
We're rivals because
we always compete.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.505
All right! Well, guess
I'd better get serious.

00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:26.907
(dramatic music)

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.210
-(weapon whooshing)
-(Ryuki groaning)

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:33.180
Aren't you a little too old
to be playing with dolls?

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:40.187
(Tatsumi gasping)

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.523
The jutsu's released!

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:43.957
(weapon clattering)

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.792
Say your prayers.

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:48.562
(Ryuki groaning)

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:50.664
(weapon clanking)

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.666
Give me that. (groaning)

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:53.667
(girl gasping)

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.770
(glass crashing)

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:59.540
(fluid hissing)

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:04.545
(Mirai gasping)

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:07.548
Mirai, over there!

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:11.552
I'll leave this to you!

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:19.726
(footsteps tapping)

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.163
[Ryuki] Do you know where
we are, Mirai Sarutobi?

00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:26.133
This is the sacred ritual room.

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:29.369
Here, in exchange for blood
from human sacrifices,

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:32.906
I'll be granted
immortality by Lord Jashin.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.145
-(weapons whooshing)
-(Mirai gasping)

00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:41.181
That was close! (chuckling)

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:42.182
Careful!

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.585
If I get even a drop
of blood from you,

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:46.854
you'll be cursed like Tatsumi.

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:48.856
So, who is Hidan to you, anyway?

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.924
Say his name with respect.

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.694
Master Hidan is a Jashin hero!

00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:56.063
And I am the man who's worthy

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.065
of inheriting all
his accomplishments.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.667
You really think this'll
go as you planned?

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:01.735
Of course!

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.404
Just the fact that you
showed up here is a sign.

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.774
(weapons whooshing)

00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:09.176
(Mirai grunting)

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.945
I'm going to kill you right
here and now, daughter of Asuma.

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:13.447
And live up to my name

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.550
as the true second
coming of Master Hidan.

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:17.951
Fate has guided me.

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:20.654
I'm grateful to
you, Lord Jashin.

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:22.956
After I acquire my immortality,

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.126
I'll return the Way
of Jashin to glory.

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.394
I curse having been born

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:30.397
into such a mundane
era as this one.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.367
If I had lived in the
same time as Master Hidan,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.170
I would've stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with him.

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:40.908
But this current age that
we're in, this era is garbage!

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.843
It's just something
tacked on to the end

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.444
of a truly glorious age.

00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:47.281
There's nothing of
value to it at all.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.251
There's just no way that
catching petty bad guys

00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:52.920
like that is going to allow us

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.289
to surpass the
previous generation.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:58.492
It's just, in an age
of peace like this,

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:02.062
I wonder what point continuing
to be a shinobi serves?

00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:05.098
He's just like me! (gasps)

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:07.434
-(weapons clanging)
-(Mirai groaning)

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:10.437
I've gotcha! (groaning)

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.974
-(sword clanging)
-(blood spurting)

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.743
(Mirai gasping)

00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:18.946
(lick slurping)

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:21.949
Now you've been cursed, as well!

00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:25.452
Curse Jutsu, body,
possession, blood.

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:28.055
(dramatic music)

00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:30.090
(knife clattering)

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:32.192
Hear me, Lord Jashin.

00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:35.195
I now offer up a
sacrifice to you.

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:37.064
Since she's Asuma's daughter,

00:11:37.097 --> 00:11:40.334
she's worth a hundred
more common people!

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.535
And don't forget the reward

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:44.137
that I've been promised
for doing this.

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:47.040
(spear clanging)

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:49.443
Now I, too, will
become a legend.

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:51.645
(flesh squelching)

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:52.913
(Mirai groaning)

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:54.982
(Mirai coughing)

00:11:55.015 --> 00:12:00.220
-(blood trickling)
-(mysterious music)

00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:07.027
(dramatic music)

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.363
I did it!

00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:11.665
I did it!

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:14.568
I've actually killed
Asuma Sarutobi's daughter!

00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:21.642
Ooh, now I'm feeling
a surge of power.

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:26.413
Is this the power of
immortality? It's splendid!

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:27.381
Next, I'll take care

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.150
of the other intruders
with this sickle.

00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:31.118
Huh?

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.621
(bright mystical music)

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.725
What's going on here?

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.327
[Mirai] Wow, you're definitely

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.529
the gullible type, aren't you?

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:45.332
(dramatic music)

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:49.469
(wheels rattling)

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:53.307
Hey, Kakashi, is he?

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.641
Sh!

00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:56.043
Genjutsu?

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.180
But I could've sworn
that I tasted blood.

00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.982
You sure it wasn't
the iron-rich water

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:03.550
from the hot springs?

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:08.088
-(water splashing)
-(dramatic music)

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.524
No way! It can't be!

00:13:10.557 --> 00:13:13.293
I'm the second coming
of Master Hidan.

00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:16.430
You know, it's time
to face reality.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.464
I get it!

00:13:17.497 --> 00:13:20.200
This scene unfolding now
is nothing but genjutsu.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.337
Just give it up.
You can't fool me.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.106
The body that I possess
has become immortal!

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.208
And now, I'll prove it to you.

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:31.512
Do you wanna die?

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:33.113
I am immortal!

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.415
Now die, Mirai Sarutobi!

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.286
(dramatic music)

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:44.691
(electricity sizzling)

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:48.295
(wind whooshing)

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:51.698
(Kakashi gasping)

00:13:51.732 --> 00:13:54.334
Wind Style, whirlwind fist.

00:13:54.368 --> 00:13:59.540
-(dramatic music)
-(wind whooshing)

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:06.480
(Ryuki groaning)

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:11.285
-(Ryuki grunting)
-(blood spurting)

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:17.057
Did you see that?

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.359
Yeah, very impressive.

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:30.437
(gasps) I have become immortal.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.274
I have truly become
immortal now! (laughing)

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:38.312
(Tatsumi groans)

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:41.348
[Tatsumi] Miss Mirai?

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.450
Oh, thank goodness, you're okay.

00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:45.419
Um, I-

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.722
A weird jutsu made
you see illusions.

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:50.190
That's all it was.

00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:55.262
So, it was all just a lie
intended to lure us here?

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.997
And I actually
believed that I was

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.199
finally gonna be able
to meet my dad.

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:01.401
That no-good lyin' bastard!

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.637
(Tatsumi giggles)

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.274
But still, I'm glad that
no one became a victim.

00:15:07.307 --> 00:15:09.042
And that's all because
you asked me

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:11.211
to come along with
you, so thanks!

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.314
What are you gonna do now?

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:16.917
I think I'll go back home

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.486
and try my best to
build a life there.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.656
But I have so many
memories of my mom.

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:23.657
It won't be easy.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.126
You know, having those
memories doesn't have

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:27.728
to be a bad thing.

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:29.429
I'm hopeless, aren't I?

00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:31.965
All I can really think
about now are the times

00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:33.667
I spent with my mom.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.570
You think there's anything
for me to look forward to?

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:39.373
[Mirai] Of course!

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:40.374
Huh?

00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:42.976
Not just for you,
but for everyone.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.646
Memories of your loved
ones are beautiful, sure.

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:47.214
But at the end of the day,

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:49.550
what's important
isn't the past, but-

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:51.451
Oh! The future?

00:15:52.553 --> 00:15:53.787
You got it.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.658
-(both giggling)
-(gentle music)

00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:00.227
[Kakashi] Well, I guess
that's case closed, huh?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.796
Yeah, thank goodness.

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:05.232
But still, if there
were a hot spring

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:07.668
that could heal
your leg, then I'd-

00:16:08.602 --> 00:16:11.939
Come on, are you still
worried about me?

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:14.675
You know it's been
over 10 years.

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:19.413
(inhaling) Kakashi,
it's all okay.

00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:24.117
I'm alive, I get to talk to you.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.587
And in the end, that's
really all that matters.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.524
I mean, (chuckles) who
cares about a leg or two

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:32.860
in the grand scheme
of things, right?

00:16:32.893 --> 00:16:34.995
And besides, it's
because of that

00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:37.931
I always get to have you
right here by my side.

00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:40.567
What more can I ask
for? Not a thing.

00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:43.837
(gentle music)

00:16:43.871 --> 00:16:46.373
The king we swore to
protect has been passed

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:49.176
into the hands of
the next generation.

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.945
And I think the
future's full of hope.

00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:53.647
You and I have
been through a lot

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.282
over the years, haven't we?

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.520
Y'know, Kakashi both as
Hokage and as a person,

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:02.189
you've given your
all to the Village.

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:05.626
And I'm glad I was by your
side through all of it.

00:17:06.894 --> 00:17:08.095
Thank you, Guy.

00:17:09.997 --> 00:17:13.800
-(birds chirping)
-(gentle music)

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:16.436
Miss Mirai, thank you.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.673
Don't get fooled by
any more weirdos, okay?

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:21.775
Speaking of getting fooled,

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.444
the jutsu that guy
Ryuki had been using

00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:25.913
was his own creation,

00:17:25.946 --> 00:17:28.615
one that he adapted from
a common type of jutsu.

00:17:28.649 --> 00:17:31.385
So you're saying it was
different than Hidan's jutsu?

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.587
Well, according to
a member of his sect

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.457
he imitated several ceremonies
based on Jashin documents

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:39.993
that he just happened
to stumble upon.

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:41.228
And who knows for sure

00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:43.997
if those documents were
actually genuine or not?

00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:48.068
Anyway, the entire story
sounds incredibly sketchy.

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:50.370
-(wheels rattling)
-(footsteps tapping)

00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:52.773
I have to say, all of
this seems like too much

00:17:52.806 --> 00:17:54.374
of a coincidence, though.

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:56.844
To find a serious
situation on a trip

00:17:56.877 --> 00:17:58.645
that I just happened to go on?

00:17:58.679 --> 00:18:00.414
[Kakashi] It's no coincidence.

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:01.448
Huh?

00:18:01.481 --> 00:18:03.383
You see, right from
the very beginning,

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:06.253
our entire goal was actually
to investigate the case

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.655
of the girls who'd gone missing.

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:09.656
What?

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.958
In other words

00:18:10.991 --> 00:18:13.193
we were working alongside
the Land of Steam

00:18:13.227 --> 00:18:15.596
and we asked Kiba,
Tenten and Choji

00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:16.864
to go undercover as tourists

00:18:16.897 --> 00:18:20.400
to help us gather intel about
what was really going on.

00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:21.768
What?

00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:23.770
[Kakashi] Although,
I have to say

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:26.773
someone was having entirely
too much fun collecting intel.

00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:27.975
You should've told me

00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:29.710
all of this right from
the very beginning!

00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:33.080
To be fair, our mission was
to conduct the investigation.

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.382
Your mission was to guard us.

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:37.951
Besides, if we actually
told you the truth

00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:39.720
then your eyes would've
been like a predator's,

00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:43.724
hunting for prey, trying
to find clues all the time.

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:45.292
I wouldn't have done that!

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:48.428
Yeah, I would've.

00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:52.399
(upbeat music)

00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:54.468
[Kakashi] Jashin doesn't
have many followers anymore.

00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:56.203
Who would've guessed
that one of them

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:57.804
would have been behind all this?

00:18:57.838 --> 00:18:59.173
Hey, hold on.

00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:01.241
I've noticed that you're
telling me every minute detail

00:19:01.275 --> 00:19:03.143
as we're heading back home.

00:19:03.177 --> 00:19:04.511
Are you trying to get me

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:06.713
to write the report
about this mission?

00:19:06.747 --> 00:19:08.048
Busted.

00:19:08.081 --> 00:19:10.484
I'm looking forward to
reading your youthful report.

00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:12.052
I knew it!

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:13.287
-Mirai!
-Huh?

00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:17.057
Boruto!

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.993
So, how'd it go? Your big
mission with Lord Sixth?

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:23.797
Hm, well, let me see here.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.600
(chuckle) You said that it
was a super important mission

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:28.902
even beyond S-rank, didn't you?

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:30.838
Don't tell me you were
really just guarding

00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:32.506
them on a relaxing vacation?

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:35.576
Well, all we did was crush
a new Way of Jashin sect

00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:38.378
and solve the case of a
bunch of missing girls.

00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:40.681
So nothing big.

00:19:40.714 --> 00:19:41.682
(eyes ringing)

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:42.716
Seriously?

00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:46.453
(birds chirping)

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:49.389
Hm, like I told you,

00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:51.258
the silver general
is not allowed

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:52.926
to move sideways like that!

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.329
Oh, uh, is that really true?

00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:59.933
Sensei, the king that
shinobi have to protect,

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:02.202
I think that I know the answer.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.837
Oh, yeah?

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.405
That's great to hear. So?

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:12.112
Frankly, until recently, I
could be way too overzealous.

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.414
I just wasn't flexible enough.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.150
All the same,

00:20:17.184 --> 00:20:18.519
I believe that
straightforwardness

00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:20.420
is one of your strengths.

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:24.525
(pieces clicking)

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:28.262
But still, after encountering
Ryuki, it dawned on me.

00:20:28.295 --> 00:20:30.597
I came to realize that
there just isn't any point

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.200
in dwelling on the
greatness of the past.

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:37.204
So I decided to
focus on the future

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.473
and felt a weight
lift off my shoulders.

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:43.377
(pieces clicking)

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.780
What we shinobi are supposed
to protect is the future,

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:49.183
all the children
living in the villages.

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:51.985
That doesn't change,
no matter what the era.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:54.321
Which means, that the king is

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:56.323
(pieces clicking)

00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:59.193
the future a shinobi protects.

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:00.227
Right?

00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:02.596
You're correct!

00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:03.664
All right!

00:21:03.697 --> 00:21:05.699
And that is the reason why-

00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:07.134
Huh?

00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:10.404
Asuma named you
Mirai, for future.

00:21:12.873 --> 00:21:14.074
Oh, I see.

00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:16.210
It's just as I thought.

00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:18.979
I had a feeling you
didn't pick up on that.

00:21:19.012 --> 00:21:20.581
Well, I kinda did!

00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:21.582
But it's like that saying,

00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:23.917
"It's hard to see what's
right under your nose!"

00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:25.953
You know what I'm talking about?

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:28.922
Also you just lost big time.

00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:31.859
Huh? (groans)

00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:34.394
(upbeat music)

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:37.030
(Mirai groans)

00:21:48.408 --> 00:21:51.211
(knife clicking)

00:21:52.346 --> 00:21:56.083
Kurenai Sarutobi's and
Asuma Sarutobi's daughter.

00:21:58.352 --> 00:22:00.320
My name is

00:22:00.354 --> 00:22:03.156
(knife clanking)

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:06.360
Mirai Sarutobi!

00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:13.467

00:22:15.802 --> 00:22:19.673
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.955 --> 00:23:43.657
(dramatic music)

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.626
So, what's your decision?

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:46.793
Hey, come on!

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:48.962
You think this is something
I can that decide easily?

00:23:48.996 --> 00:23:50.130
[Shikamaru] I've
been getting pestered

00:23:50.163 --> 00:23:51.532
by a lot of departments.

00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:54.301
If you don't decide soon,
you're gonna get yelled at!

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:56.036
[Naruto] Yeah, I
know all of that!

00:23:56.069 --> 00:23:58.205
But it's really difficult
to pick just one person!

00:23:58.238 --> 00:23:59.640
[Shikamaru] I'll
help you out, okay?

00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:02.976
[Naruto] Next time on "Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,"

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.412
"The Chunin
Selection Conference"

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.583
So, who do we promote to chunin?

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:15.589
