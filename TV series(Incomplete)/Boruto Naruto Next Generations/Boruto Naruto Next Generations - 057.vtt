WEBVTT

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:17.084
(birds chirping)

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.789
Damn it.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.091
Just watch closely.

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.565
(annoyed)

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.269
Yeah, but Shuriken Jutsu's
Sarada's specialty, not mine!

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:39.406
I mean, everyone knows that!
She's, you know, an Uchiha!

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.209
Well, then... going by your
reasoning...

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.044
(startled)

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.514
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:51.018
...this jutsu should be your
specialty. Is that right, or
not?

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.654
(stunned) I guess so...

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.591
That was my Dad's specialty,
right?

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:02.129
I won't hear more excuses. He
can make over a thousand Shadow
Clones.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.463
(insulted)

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.434
I'll blow them all away during
<i>Round Two!</i>

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:10.204
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.008
(sheepish)

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.878
You barely managed four!

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.446
Who do you think you are?!

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.747
Huh? Whattaya mean?

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.282
Aren't the four of us enough?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.751
Not exactly.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.421
Look, newbie! Don't be so stuck
up!

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.622
What?!

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.524
All clones are equal, you know!

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.592
No, they're not!

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.494
No matter what, I've always
given it my all!

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:38.232
Seriously! A thousand?! All
right, then, I'm just gonna make
ten thousand!

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:39.333
No way!

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:40.901
(shocked)

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.569
It's impossible to
make that many!

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.039
Yeah, with that attitude
(annoyed)

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.042
(sigh)

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:45.125
(curious)

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:48.362
You're late. We've been waiting.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.798
You were both just too early.

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:53.634
Anyway... what did you want?

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.304
To tell you I was attacked.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.038
(shocked)

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.475
(GAARA) It was on the way to the
Leaf.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:09.049
(chuckle)

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:13.287
There was a barrier in place...

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.157
Oh, yeah! You mean that thing
that was as thin as wet paper?

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:21.128
Are you the one... who attacked
the Eight Tails?

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:25.299
The Eight Tails? Oh! My
superiors were behind that.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:31.138
I understand that you once had
one inside you, too. Right?
Wasn't it called the One Tail?

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:32.639
(shocked)

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.043
(shocked)

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.446
Looks like I got you!

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.147
(frustrated)

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:48.288
(surprised) Well, that technique
was really quite primitive...

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:53.160
What is it called? "Willpower"
or something? Honestly, it isn't
particularly effective.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:54.795
Why you...!

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:56.864
Well, guess it doesn't matter.

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.665
(SAND NINJA) Lord Kazekage! What
happened?!

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.967
Huh?! Who are you?!

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.601
Oops.

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.072
Oh well! I got what I was
fishing for... I'll see myself
out.

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:13.046
(frustrated)

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.517
I'm guessing it was the
Otsutsuki Clan.

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:18.986
The same as Kaguya?

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:20.053
(affirmative)

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:26.226
The scroll that I retrieved from
Kaguya's palace is being
deciphered as we speak.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.331
Somehow, he knew that Shukaku
was no longer inside of me.

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:35.435
I see... Guess we'll have to
postpone the Chunin Exams.

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.207
Although... these Exams... are
of enormous significance.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.411
They're co-sponsored by the
Feudal Lords, who were bitter
foes in the past.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:48.315
Yes. The current climate of
uncertainty's what they're
exploiting.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:55.789
To postpone the Exams now...
would damage the reputation of
the Hokage and the Land of Fire.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:06:00.127
And if that happens, the
hardliners in my village will
also try to exert their own

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.996
power... I'd like to avoid
that...

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.666
Governing can be so annoying...!

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.305
Yet another reason... why we
have to hurry up and decipher
that scroll...

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:16.476
Oh, boy... What a headache... If
only we could be were all the
action is like Sasuke.

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.245
Perhaps you're right.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:20.814
Are you hurt?

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:23.283
You underestimate me I think.

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:26.620
It takes much more to hurt me.
This wound is nothing.

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:29.122
Of course. I understand.

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:57.117
(TENTEN) Round Two is all about
capturing the flag.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.287
Guard your flag while you
infiltrate enemy territory to
get theirs.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.592
In short, this battle is both
offensive and defensive.

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:09.062
Now... it's three on three, so
half the teams will be dropped.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.097
(taken aback)

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:18.038
All right, teams! Get to your
areas!

00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:21.041
(TENTEN) Begin!

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.477
(rushing off)

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:27.047
(shocked) Can't... move!

00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:29.516
(straining)

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.484
Well, that's one down...

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:32.619
(attacking roar)

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:34.054
(startled)

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.190
(shocked)

00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:37.624
Too bad!

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:38.492
Cho-Cho!

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.498
I got it!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.668
(blowing bubble)

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:49.236
(throwing)

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.305
(scream)

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:52.039
(worried)

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:57.311
Watch out, you guys! So many
jutsu we've never seen...!

00:07:57.344 --> 00:07:58.178
(nervous)

00:07:59.346 --> 00:07:59.746
(shocked)

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.482
Scooped it from right under your
noses!

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:02.950
(disappointed)

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.017
(shocked)

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:06.854
We also scooped the pool on
getting the fastest time!

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:09.022
I'm glad i'm here to deliver
the scoop!

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:17.531
(yawn)

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.135
(struggling)

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.271
Denki! Get it together!

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:26.473
(grunt)

00:08:28.809 --> 00:08:31.011
(shocked, hit)

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:37.084
What is... this jutsu?

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:39.786
(fighting)

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.324
(straining) We can't let it...

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.425
...end here!

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:49.663
(frustrated)

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:57.471
(kicking)

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:02.976
Listen... Please, just don't
disappoint me.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.479
(taken aback)

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:07.080
(punching)

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:08.482
(kicking)

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:09.683
(punching)

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:11.084
(punching)

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:12.686
(frustrated)

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:17.324
(fighting)

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:24.064
(heavy breathing) Not yet! I'm
just getting started! (inhale)

00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:26.099
No... We're done.

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:28.502
(shocked)

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:36.443
You'd already lost when you let
me provoke you and forgot the
rules.

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.680
(shocked) But that is...!

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:44.685
Seems most of the matches are
done already.

00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.054
There's just...

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.488
...one team left.

00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:52.259
I don't see the enemy, are we
okay?

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:55.295
(BORUTO) I'm guarding our flag.
Just relax and move in already!

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:58.031
Boruto...

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.467
We're counting on you to keep
that flag safe!

00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:03.136
(BORUTO) Come on. Who do you
think you're talking to, ya
know?!

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.939
If we're going to show Lord
Seventh how strong we are,

00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:09.042
we have to make it through
this second round.

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:10.477
(MITSUKI) We're counting on you,
Boruto

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:17.751
(chuckle) Yeah, I know. You
don't have to tell me!

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:19.319
(throwing)

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:20.053
(leaping)

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.655
(landing)

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.257
(BORUTO) Sorry, triplets!

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.092
Your surprise attack didn't
work.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.462
So, it's five against three...

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:31.331
You know who has the edge here,
right?

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:34.101
(confident chuckling)

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:39.072
(shocked)

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:44.144
Who has the edge now?

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:46.413
(nervous)

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:49.049
(TAKANAMI) Wait, I think
I can figure it out, since it's
nine against five.

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:50.617
(BORUTO) Whoa!

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:52.686
(shocked, worried)

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:53.687
(MITSUKI) Don't worry, go!

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:55.989
I'll rejoin you soon!

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.057
(punched)

00:10:58.192 --> 00:10:59.059
(swinging weapon)

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.695
(lamenting) Nine against five
isn't great...

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:03.263
(swinging weapon)

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:06.133
If I only had a thousand...!

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:07.734
(Fighting)

00:11:09.136 --> 00:11:11.104
I guess four's really all that
he can make after all...

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:12.306
(worried)

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:13.507
Now, reverse!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.474
(knocked back)

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:18.679
(worried, desperate)

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.050
No! Wait!

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:35.128
(nervous)

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:39.466
(frustrated)

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:43.070
No way! I can't lose here!

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:44.671
That's right!

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.309
I gotta pass the Chunin Exams to
keep walking down the path to
becoming the Hokage!

00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:50.711
Hmmm?

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.113
I won't let you!

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:59.219
Water Style Bullet: Orca!

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:02.155
(gasp for air)

00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:03.624
(stunned) What...?!

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:07.361
A Water Style this powerful with
no water nearby?! (shocked)

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.231
You're done!

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:16.970
(Shocking Yell)

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.207
He even knows...

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:23.510
...Lightning Style? (collapsing)

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.482
Yes! We're okay!

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:35.088
Boruto! You all right?!
(shocked)

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:42.729
(considering)

00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:47.067
(chuckle) Are you seriously
asking me that?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.236
(SARADA) What? You were in
trouble earlier!

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.637
Everything's just fine here.

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:53.507
(BORUTO) Sarada, get that flag!

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.342
Yeah, I'm on it already.

00:13:08.522 --> 00:13:09.389
We did it!

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:11.458
Yes!

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:14.661
(relieved sigh)

00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:16.063
I guess we managed somehow...

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.532
It was a piece of cake.

00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:19.900
You know, Boruto...

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.468
You really could become the
Hokage.

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:22.669
That's gonna be me!

00:13:22.703 --> 00:13:23.303
(surprised)

00:13:24.338 --> 00:13:24.738
(chuckle)

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:25.072
(chuckle)

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:32.212
You know, I didn't see him weave
the Water Style sign...

00:13:37.618 --> 00:13:38.318
(nervous)

00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:44.725
(TENTEN) Yeah , he's good.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.026
(relieved)

00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:51.064
Weaving signs too fast to see...
Well, I guess he's the Seventh
Hokage's son, after all!

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:55.135
'K, that makes four teams. We're
done!

00:13:57.538 --> 00:13:59.806
He got through again.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.309
It seems he used it this time
around.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:06.980
Oh! Great! So, he finally used
it... Did you get any footage?

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:08.081
Yes.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:09.516
(chuckle)

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:16.690
All right! This means Lord
Seventh will finally get to see

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:18.492
how strong we are
in Round Three!

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.093
Oh... Yeah!

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:21.695
Sounds great!

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.331
(surprised)

00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:26.333
(confused)

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:27.634
Hey...

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.137
(taken aback) What is it?

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:35.175
Hey...! C'mon...!

00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:40.314
Thought so.

00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:41.181
(confused)

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:42.316
Thought so...?

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.017
It's your eyes...

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:46.053
they're even bluer than the
Seventh's...

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:47.521
Huh?!

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.088
(embarrassed)

00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:50.691
Really?

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.893
They are! I'm sure of it!

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:54.528
You do pay close attention,
don't you?

00:14:54.862 --> 00:14:55.529
Yep!

00:14:57.197 --> 00:15:00.133
Ask him to show you next time.
Lord Seventh is nice. I'm sure
he wouldn't say no.

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.102
(guilty)

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.677
(sigh) Oh, come on...!

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:12.312
I can't stand the suspense!

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.147
(startled)

00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:16.083
Uh,... yes?

00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:18.519
(curious) (pleasantly surprised)

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:22.356
I'm impressed.

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:23.624
'Bout what?

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:28.128
About Boruto and his team, of
course. They've cleared Round
Two.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:30.097
They have?

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.599
(sigh) Well, see ya.

00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:33.700
(surprised, curious)

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:35.102
Is that all you came to tell me?

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.372
Well, yeah. It is important
news.

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:41.842
By the way, Shikadai's team made
it, too.

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:44.077
Round Three's one-on-one combat.

00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.513
We just might see a showdown
between our sons!

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:51.518
Yes!

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.522
(CHO -_CHO) Here, have one of
these...

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:56.156
Oh, thanks!

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:56.523
Sorry you didn't pass...

00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:57.391
(BORUTO) Denki!

00:15:57.424 --> 00:15:57.991
Huh?

00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.326
Are you okay, Denki?

00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:03.964
Huh? Yeah. Cuz' I've gotten
stronger since I entered the
Academy.

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:05.799
Oh, good. I'm glad.

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:08.035
Hey! Worry about the rest of us,
too!

00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:09.803
Oh... sorry!

00:16:09.837 --> 00:16:12.005
(chuckle) I'm just
messing with ya.

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:14.675
Looks like you guys won your
match.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:15.976
Sure did!

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:16.977
Yeah!

00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:20.981
Our match was an epic fail. We
got our butts kicked.

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:23.083
At least I did not get nervous!

00:16:23.717 --> 00:16:25.519
But... I was useless...

00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:29.857
Me, too... I only held everyone
back!

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.859
Hey, what's done is done. Don't
sweat it!

00:16:31.892 --> 00:16:35.529
I think that we just weren't
ready for actual combat....

00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:39.633
That's true... All those jutsu
we'd never seen before...

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.536
And unknown enemies. Maybe we
were lucky...

00:16:42.569 --> 00:16:46.807
You think so? They do say
fortune favors the bold and the
hungry.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.308
I don't think you have that
right...

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:51.478
Anyway... Don't let us down,
guys!

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:52.079
(METAL) That is right!

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.848
(agreeing) We'll be rooting for
you!

00:16:54.882 --> 00:16:56.149
(pleased chuckle)

00:16:56.183 --> 00:16:56.984
(determined agreeing)

00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:57.684
Yeah!

00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.953
But... don't get carried away...

00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:05.225
(chatting)

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:07.327
(BORUTO) I'm home.

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:09.963
Huh?

00:17:09.997 --> 00:17:12.266
Hey! Welcome back!

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:14.168
Congratulations, Big Brother!

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.337
(chuckle) I just passed Round
Two. It's no big deal, you know!

00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:18.972
So, how are you?

00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:20.140
Did you get hurt?

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:22.109
Nah, I'm totally fine!

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:28.515
But I'm feeling tired, so I'm
going to my room.

00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:31.518
I'm gonna rest until dinner's
ready.

00:17:31.552 --> 00:17:32.319
(confused)

00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:34.988
Boruto...?

00:17:42.963 --> 00:17:44.331
Sorry you came for nothing.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:49.369
I told them we needed the scroll
deciphered quickly, but it seems
they still need more time.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.172
Okay, I'll come back later.

00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:54.374
Sasuke...

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.111
I've heard... that you've been
training him.

00:18:01.515 --> 00:18:02.516
Did Boruto tell you?

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.986
No, Konohamaru did...

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:08.655
I see.

00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:13.727
He came to me and asked to be my
student.

00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:18.165
So I guess that means you're...
his Teacher.

00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:21.502
(chuckle)

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.303
Well, maybe you were right after
all...

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.273
The soul of a shinobi never
changes.

00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:28.208
(chuckle)

00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:31.044
...even if times have changed,
huh?

00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:36.650
It's true. That's what I
believe.

00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:40.087
And Sarada got through, too!

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:42.656
Yeah, what about it?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.561
You could at least try to look a
little happy, you know!

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:51.131
I knew right from the start that
she would, so what's there to
celebrate?

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:55.502
(chuckle)

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:14.521
This thing really is amazing...

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:16.990
As long as I have this...

00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:21.695
(curious)

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:23.664
(curious) Is it dinner time?

00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:32.639
What is it?

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:39.313
(shocked)

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.122
Dad, what-?! (shocked, worried)

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:52.392
Hey!

00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:55.095
(uncomfortable chuckle)

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:02.102
So, uh... so, yeah...

00:20:02.135 --> 00:20:06.507
I mean... how about... those
Chunin Exams, huh?

00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:08.175
I heard...

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:08.375
Uh...

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:10.511
you passed the Second Round.

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:11.712
Huh...?

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.647
Y-Yeah...

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.227
(disappointed)

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:28.729
Dad?

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.099
If it's nothing, then can you
just go?

00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:37.137
You..

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:40.407
You did just great.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.108
(shocked)

00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:46.713
Well, see you later.

00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:48.482
You came up just to say that?

00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:50.184
Well, yeah...

00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:53.453
It... It's important, you know?

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:55.189
Actually...

00:20:56.123 --> 00:20:59.026
It's... It's the most important
thing...

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.063
Oh! Also...

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:05.165
Yeah?

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:09.169
Do not lose to Shikadai!

00:21:10.938 --> 00:21:11.605
(taken aback)

00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:19.146
Like I'd lose!

00:21:20.047 --> 00:21:20.714
(taken aback)

00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:22.115
(inhale)

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:27.187
I'll be watching.

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:29.122
(stunned)

00:21:32.893 --> 00:21:33.527
See ya!

00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:45.005
He could've just emailed me to
say that...

00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:48.509
(chuckle)

00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:52.679
Stupid old man.

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:55.315
(weary sigh)

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.087
(shocked)

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:01.321
(comically frustrated)

00:22:02.556 --> 00:22:03.524
(chuckle)

00:23:42.956 --> 00:23:46.927
(BORUTO) All right! Well, from
this point on, everyone's an
enemy!

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.330
(SHIKADAI) I wanna fight you
guys, so don't lose too fast,
okay?!

00:23:50.364 --> 00:23:53.000
(SARADA) Shinki seems like he
has some serious strength!

00:23:53.033 --> 00:23:57.771
I have a feeling that we aren't
going to be defeating anyone
all that easily...

00:23:57.804 --> 00:24:00.908
(BORUTO) Come on, let's show
them the Leaf's true strength!

00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:05.145
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
Generations: "The Tournament
Begins!"

00:24:07.014 --> 00:24:08.348
We're gonna win this!
