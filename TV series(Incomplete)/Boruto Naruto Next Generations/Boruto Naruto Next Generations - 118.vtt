WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.008
(birds chirping)

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.477
Man, Auntie still
isn't here yet!

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:11.612
Yes, I know.

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:14.214
She asked us for this
favor, and now she's late!

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.650
I'm getting tired of waiting.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.219
There's no choice.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.955
I guess we'll just have to
go and find her ourselves.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.190
Okay!

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:28.695
(suspenseful music)

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.330
She's not here.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.900
(door thuds open)

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:37.204
Huh?

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.740
Big Bro, it's Kankitsu!

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:41.508
[Konohamaru] Yeah.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.014
What now?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.482
I'll follow Kankitsu.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.751
You stay here and
look for Asaki.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.819
-Okay, got it.
-(whooshing)

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:55.656
(birds chirping)

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.594
(suspenseful music)

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.968
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:25.118
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.070
Mm.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.142
(grunts)

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:58.245
It's a trap!

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.046
Damn it!

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.248
Just what are you doing here?

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.517
Only Daidai Village citizens

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.287
are permitted to be here
on this sacred ground.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:11.225
I'd already asked you to
leave this place earlier.

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:14.194
So, why are you still here?

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:16.263
I'm going to contact the Leaf

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:19.233
and file an official
complaint with them.

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:22.936
Escort him out of the village.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.338
[Subordinate] Yes, sir.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:28.709
All right, then.

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:29.743
And now--

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:33.113
(birds chirping)

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.849
I can't find Auntie anywhere!

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:38.719
I thought that she'd be
in the mansion, but--

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.421
Hey, what is--

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.456
Kankitsu!

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.259
What is he doing?

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.294
-(door bangs shut)
-Hm?

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.329
(gasps)

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:52.933
Ms. Asaki!

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.268
Huh?

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.170
I've been looking for you!

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:59.840
How come you didn't meet us at
the time that we'd agreed to?

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.074
Hm?

00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:04.211
So--

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:07.281
Listen, what's the deal?

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:10.083
(clears throat)

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:14.388
My child, you can't just
barge onto people's property.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.124
Now, I won't tell
anyone you came here,

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:19.193
so, hurry and leave, all right?

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.060
Huh?

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.563
What are you even talking about?

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:23.697
(Asaki gasps)

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.100
(suspenseful music)

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:30.204
[Asaki] That's the--

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:34.541
Lord Kankitsu is definitely
hiding something, after all!

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:36.476
I have to stop him!

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.947
But Ms. Asaki, you're the
one who came to talk to us!

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.181
Now, go on.

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:42.516
Hurry on along home.

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.718
There'll be trouble
if someone sees you.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:45.719
Wait--

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:46.920
What?

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:49.590
Hold on, you really
don't remember me?

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.293
(soft music)

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.632
Okay, what exactly
is going on here?

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.167
(grunts)

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.304
(wind whistling)

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.708
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.310
(soft music)

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.984
The wedding ritual's
just around the corner.

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:20.687
And so, it's about
time I destroyed this.

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:22.589
[Asaki] Please, stop!

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:23.824
[Kankitsu] You!

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:26.093
That's Lady Remon's
precious hair clip!

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:28.428
Please, you must return it!

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:29.429
Let go!

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:30.597
I said let go!

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:32.666
[Asaki] Ow!

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.669
(air whooshing)

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:38.305
(metallic thud)

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.474
Wait, this is--

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.210
It's Miss Remon's.

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:45.579
How dare you try to
break that hair clip!

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.849
Lord Kankitsu would
never do such a thing!

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:52.085
Now, tell me, who
are you, really?

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:53.654
(Kankitsu giggles)

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.589
[Asaki] What's so funny?

00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:01.361
I guess that it wasn't enough
to just erase your memory.

00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:05.699
What must be done now
is to totally erase you.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.135
(grunting)

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:11.972
Lord Kankitsu?

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:12.973
What are--

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.442
(whooshing)

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.579
Wait, you're that boy!

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:20.214
Are you all right?

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.549
-It's you!
-That's right!

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.584
Who are you?

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:24.518
Tell us!

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.854
[Kankitsu] So, the
insect was still here--

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:27.855
[Boruto] Huh?

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.089
[Kankitsu] Two more days.

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.725
I won't allow anyone
to get in the way.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.827
Not this close to the ritual.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:35.395
[Boruto] Just what
are you planning?

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:37.531
There's no need for
you to know that.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:41.702
Even if you found out, you're
just going to forget again!

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.204
(whooshing)

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.607
Ms. Asaki, go and hide!

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.310
(whooshing)

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:58.452
(rocks rumbling)

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.421
[Asaki] Watch out!

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:02.456
Ah!

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:05.359
No, stop!

00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:09.997
Quick, get away!

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.065
(grunting)

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.535
(whooshing)

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:20.073
Ms. Asaki!

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:23.410
(groaning)

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.712
(whooshing)

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.149
(gasping)

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:32.719
(groaning)

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.692
(screaming)

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:41.195
(whooshing)

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.202
(panting)

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.707
What did he wanna say, anyway?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.108
[Cho-Cho] What?

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.945
I mean, it's not like they
actually loved each other

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.580
or anything like that, right?

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:01.849
Man, that movie was so boring.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:02.850
What?

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:04.084
What are you talking about?

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:05.953
Of course they loved each other!

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.321
They were both in love,

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:08.856
but they just couldn't
stay together!

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:12.392
It was a totally
tragic story, ya jerk!

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:13.460
What? But how?

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.229
They didn't say
anything to each other

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:17.064
about being in love at all!

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.498
I just don't get it!

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:20.367
How can they be
boyfriend and girlfriend?

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.303
The only girlfriend I
have is my Ninja Way!

00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:25.372
My goal is to become the Hokage!

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:28.075
I can't let things like
romantic relationships

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:29.843
get in the way of my focus!

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:32.579
(panting)

00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:35.382
(grunting)

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:37.818
(whooshing)

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:40.621
(dramatic music)

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:47.961
Hey.

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:50.063
It's all okay now.

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:52.065
Please, forgive my rudeness.

00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:55.702
First of all, my
name's Remon Yoimura.

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:56.737
Oh, Boruto.

00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:58.539
Thank you.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:00.440
(sighs)

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:03.177
(dramatic music)

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.712
Hey, I'll never
forget your kindness!

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:08.182
(giggling)

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.818
(glass shattering)

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:14.821
(water burbling)

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.724
(grunting)

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:20.093
(panting)

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.997
(giggling)

00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.366
(panting)

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:30.704
Who are you?

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.107
-Why were you in the shrine?
-Huh?

00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:35.809
[Kankitsu] Capture him.

00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:37.578
[Subordinate] Lord Kankitsu!

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:39.179
Understood, sir!

00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:40.848
Don't try anything!

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.115
Wait, hold up!

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.151
Look, you guys are--

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:47.187
[Asaki] Quick, get away!

00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:51.024
(panting)

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:56.964
[Subordinate] He
should be around here!

00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:57.965
Find him!

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:59.199
[Man] Right!

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.504
-(sighs)
-Who are those guys?

00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:06.807
And also, where am I?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.242
Oh, man.

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:09.543
(groaning)

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:11.078
-I found him!
-Huh?

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.247
-Just stay right there!
-Damn it!

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.315
(banging)

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:16.350
Ah!

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:21.455
(water splashing)

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.090
-Shall we--
-No.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:26.093
We shouldn't waste time
on just one insect.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:29.530
We must prepare for
the wedding ritual.

00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:31.198
As long as that hair clip

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:33.000
remains out of
Remon's possession,

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.435
there's nothing to worry about.

00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:40.507
I understand the story
about the Soma Rock.

00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:44.845
But why would you intentionally
choose to act so recklessly?

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:47.681
This really isn't
like you at all!

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:52.653
Daidai Village has filed
an official complaint.

00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:55.956
They say you trespassed
onto their sacred grounds.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.392
Is that the truth?

00:10:58.425 --> 00:10:59.226
Yes.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:00.961
[Shikamaru] Why did you go there

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.230
when they didn't even
request our help?

00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:07.935
A monster that consumes
people's memories, huh?

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.470
That certainly is
a troubling story.

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:13.941
However, that village
has had a ritual in place

00:11:13.974 --> 00:11:16.443
for many centuries
specifically to handle that.

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.345
It's understandable
that they consider

00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:21.815
your intrusion into this
matter an abuse of authority.

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.383
I understand, sir.

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:28.088
Kankitsu Akitsuki has also
filed an individual complaint.

00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:33.594
Look, I know you aren't
the kind of person

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:35.229
who'd do something like this.

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:38.065
Is there something
you're not telling us?

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:40.234
No, sir.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:42.970
[Shikamaru] You do realize
that means you're acknowledging

00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:44.838
everything that
they are claiming.

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:48.175
I do, there's no
excuse for my actions.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.176
Hm.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:49.977
I see.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.245
Then, we have no choice.

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:54.281
We have to place you
under house arrest.

00:11:57.618 --> 00:11:59.219
[Konohamaru] I understand.

00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:07.594
(birds chirping)

00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:11.298
(groaning)

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:14.902
Ow!

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:15.936
Mm?

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:17.171
What?

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.908
But how--

00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:23.443
What am I even doing here?

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:28.515
I just can't remember.

00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:31.618
Oh, well, I guess
I'll just go home.

00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:41.028
Move up the wedding ritual?

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:44.364
That's right, I believe that
Soma's getting stronger.

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:48.468
Yes, I agree, I've been
feeling the same thing.

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:51.405
So that the villagers
can live without fear

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:52.606
as soon as possible,

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:53.640
we should marry earlier.

00:12:53.674 --> 00:12:56.877
After all, that's our
duty and our destiny.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.111
All right.

00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:00.614
Then, let's perform
the ritual tomorrow.

00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:06.453
Please, begin your preparations.

00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:11.425
Lord Kankitsu,

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.628
I haven't seen my
attendant in a long time.

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.964
How is she doing?

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.031
Sorry.

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:19.299
I don't know.

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:22.803
But if I see her, I'll
tell her you're worried.

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.571
Please do so.

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:27.107
(soft music)

00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:31.378
(bangs door shut)

00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:36.517
(sighs)

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.997
(groans)

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.732
[Boruto] I'm home!

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:54.001
Welcome back, Big Brother!

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.937
Hey, what happened
to you out there?

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.139
Your clothes are so muddy!

00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:00.340
-Oh, yeah.
-(giggles)

00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:03.343
I think I must've
fallen or something.

00:14:03.377 --> 00:14:04.611
Hey, hold on!

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:06.246
Don't come in here like that!

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.583
Take off your clothes
there and take a bath!

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:10.751
Okay.

00:14:10.784 --> 00:14:12.719
[Himawari] Big
Brother, what's that?

00:14:12.753 --> 00:14:13.754
[Boruto] Huh?

00:14:14.922 --> 00:14:16.356
What is this?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.758
It's so pretty!

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:19.960
Where did you get that?

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:22.129
Hm, I have no idea!

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:24.031
But how can you not know?

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:25.499
How is that possible?

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.533
Hm.

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.669
This is--

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:31.705
(suspenseful music)

00:15:02.503 --> 00:15:05.506
(bangs drawer shut)

00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:12.446
How'd I ever end up down
by the river yesterday?

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:15.415
(grunts)

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:16.450
Hey!

00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:18.218
Why'd you--

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:22.155
Boruto, just what
did you do this time?

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:23.957
What are you talking about?

00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:25.626
[Sarada] Come on,
don't play dumb!

00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:28.862
Konohamaru Sensei is under
house arrest right now!

00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:30.264
House arrest?

00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:32.866
You didn't know
about it, Boruto?

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.168
No.

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:36.270
You probably did
something reckless again,

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:38.205
and Konohamaru Sensei
had to cover for you!

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:39.840
That's what happened, isn't it?

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:41.241
I didn't do anything!

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:43.810
Go and ask Big Bro
yourself, if you want!

00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:46.113
Do you really think
it's easy to go and see

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:48.015
someone who's been put
under house arrest?

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:50.484
Yes, Ma'am, you have a point.

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:52.586
Apparently, he
abused his authority

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:53.854
in a village somewhere.

00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:56.456
But we don't know the details.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.325
A village somewhere?

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.228
Village--

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:02.262
Mm?

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.668
It's no good.

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:09.136
Not this one either!

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:11.738
I've looked through all
of these, and no luck!

00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:14.541
Maybe it's
impossible, after all.

00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:15.542
Damn it!

00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:16.844
(slams desk)

00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:19.179
(groans)

00:16:22.983 --> 00:16:24.318
Gramps.

00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:29.223
(giggles)

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:32.125
All right, on to the next one!

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:36.096
[Sarada] Huh, I was so
sure it was your fault!

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:38.465
I said I didn't do anything!

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.267
Still, what did he do?

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.538
I can't believe Big Bro would
be put under house arrest!

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.739
What's wrong?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.141
[Boruto] No way!

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:49.643
[Sarada] What is it?

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:53.313
Why didn't I notice before?

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:56.483
They put out a brand new burger?

00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:59.253
I've made up my mind,
I'm getting one!

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.822
[Mitsuki] Hm, you
haven't tried it yet?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:05.158
You're usually the first to
jump on every new release.

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:07.261
It's been out for
several days already.

00:17:07.294 --> 00:17:09.763
I totally thought you would
have tried it by this point.

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:10.764
Huh?

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:11.765
Yeah, you're right.

00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:14.334
Why haven't I eaten it already?

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:16.136
Mm?

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.805
[Boruto] The Super
Sour Lemon Burger!

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.307
It looks so good!

00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:23.410
You have to let
me know how it is.

00:17:23.443 --> 00:17:26.146
If it's good, I'll
try it next time.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.882
Hey, I'm not your
taste-tester, you know!

00:17:28.916 --> 00:17:31.084
Thank you for the food!

00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:35.322
Super sour!

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:39.226
(grunts)

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.127
Mm!

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.130
-(glass shattering)
-Super sour!

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:45.232
But it's so delicious!

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:47.234
Mm?

00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:51.004
What was that just now?

00:17:51.038 --> 00:17:52.272
What's the matter?

00:17:52.306 --> 00:17:54.474
Was the burger
gross or something?

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:56.143
No, it's super good,

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:58.478
but I have this weird feeling

00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:00.881
that I ate one with
somebody else before.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:01.882
What?

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.116
Like who?

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.553
How do I say this?

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:08.021
Huh?

00:18:08.055 --> 00:18:09.723
Oh, wait, I know!

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:12.259
Just hold on for
a minute, ya know!

00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:16.063
Duh, duh, duh, duh!

00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:20.634
Okay, she looks
exactly like this.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:21.969
You know her?

00:18:22.002 --> 00:18:24.104
Sorry, I can't say I do.

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:26.707
I don't know her, either.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.141
Aw, man!

00:18:28.175 --> 00:18:31.078
Look, Boruto, maybe
you're just tired.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.714
You should probably go
home and rest today.

00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:35.849
Yeah, maybe you're right.

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:39.086
I'll go home after
I finish this.

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.990
-(scoffs)
-Tired, huh?

00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:45.425
Was I sent out on
a mission recently

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:47.127
that made me tired?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.163
-(grunts)
-Oh, Cho-Cho!

00:18:50.197 --> 00:18:53.033
I'm so sorry, Boruto!

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:55.602
Oh, it's okay, what's up?

00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:56.770
Well, you know

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.873
that I'm such an incredibly
sensitive maiden, right?

00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:01.074
Huh?

00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:04.144
Every time that I go
see that tragic movie,

00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:06.880
it keeps overlapping
with my own life!

00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:09.850
Just thinking of
it makes me cry!

00:19:09.883 --> 00:19:11.151
Oh, man, that stinks!

00:19:11.185 --> 00:19:12.619
What movie did you watch?

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:15.822
"The Man Who Lives in
Ambition," of course!

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:17.991
Oh, is it any good?

00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:20.727
Come on, you saw it
with me, remember?

00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:21.862
[Boruto] Huh?

00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:22.863
I did?

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:24.097
Ha!

00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:26.834
So, you were sleeping
that time, after all!

00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:28.001
Hm?

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:30.370
(sighing)

00:19:31.905 --> 00:19:34.641
(air whooshing)

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.351
(glass shattering)

00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:46.887
[Cho-Cho] Do you remember now?

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.889
Huh? No, not quite.

00:19:48.922 --> 00:19:50.357
I mean, seriously!

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.227
I was feeling all moved
and you ruined it!

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.896
This is why I hate
little kids like you!

00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:58.332
(groaning)

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.269
What's going on?

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:05.372
I feel like I'm about
to remember something.

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:07.307
But what?

00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:10.644
(groans)

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:18.585
Hold on.

00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:27.127
[Remon] Oh, how cute!

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.229
Would you like me
to get you one?

00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:33.367
Miss Remon, the hair clip
you already had looked fancy.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.269
You really didn't have
to accept something

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:37.204
as cheap-looking
as that new one.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:38.405
No!

00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:39.540
I actually like it!

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:41.341
(glass shattering)

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:43.510
(giggling)

00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:45.579
Wait.

00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:46.813
Miss Remon!

00:20:46.847 --> 00:20:49.383
(soft music)

00:20:51.752 --> 00:20:53.954
That's right, of course!

00:20:53.987 --> 00:20:57.057
(inspiring music)

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:00.561
(glass shattering)

00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:03.397
(water burbling)

00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:07.234
(groaning)

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.436
I remember, all of it!

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:14.074
That's definitely--

00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:19.046
There it is!

00:21:21.782 --> 00:21:23.283
This is it!

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:26.753
I think this one
should be able to work!

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:28.622
[Boruto] Big Brother!

00:21:28.655 --> 00:21:30.591
[Konohamaru] Boruto!

00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:31.692
You're okay!

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:33.093
It was Kankitsu!

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:36.096
He's the one who's been
stealing people's memories!

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:43.737
Miss Remon and Daidai Village
are in danger right now!

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.074
(inspirational music)

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:50.244
Big Bro!

00:21:52.112 --> 00:21:53.680
You're right.

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:54.982
Of course.

00:21:57.651 --> 00:21:59.086
Let's go!

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:02.456
(inspirational music)

00:22:10.597 --> 00:22:13.367

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:33.387
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:44.324
(thrilling music)

00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:46.960
[Boruto] Big Bro!

00:23:46.994 --> 00:23:48.762
Today's the day of
the wedding ritual!

00:23:48.795 --> 00:23:50.898
[Konohamaru] I can't
believe Kankitsu

00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:52.499
was the one stealing memories!

00:23:52.533 --> 00:23:54.001
Miss Remon's in danger!

00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:55.369
Let's hurry!

00:23:55.402 --> 00:23:57.538
[Boruto] Roger, now that's
what I'm talking about!

00:23:57.571 --> 00:23:58.705
[Konohamaru] Miss Remon!

00:23:58.739 --> 00:24:02.075
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:04.211
"Konohamaru's Ninja Way"

00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:07.948
[Konohamaru] I'm going to save
Miss Remon no matter what!

00:24:07.981 --> 00:24:11.151
(energetic music)

00:24:11.185 --> 00:24:15.055
