WEBVTT

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:12.879
Ryogi.

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.414
What are you doing, Shikadai?!

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.917
Those two are about
to get away!

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.152
Yeah, I'm aware of that!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.122
[laughing]

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.657
Now that we're on this train,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.693
it's a direct line to
the other side of the border.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.394
(BORUTO)
I wouldn't be so sure!

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.266
Checkmate.

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:35.569
Shikadai!

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.677
Ryogi, would you just snap
out of it already?!

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.211
Damn.
Seriously?

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.947
You really don't
give up easily.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.281
Did you do this?

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.517
You put these stupid ideas
into his head!

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.553
That doesn't even
matter anymore.

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.888
Do you think you can save
desperate people

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:39.092
with nothing more than
your childishly naive ideals?

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.362
The reality of the situation
isn't that simple.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.731
And now, you know
how things work.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:45.932
So accept the truth,

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.802
be a good kid
and go back home!

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.572
You think that lame speech
is gonna change our minds?

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:52.773
Lame?

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.509
I've seen your true character
with my own eyes.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.778
You're made of nothing
but filthy lies!

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:01.181
‐ [smirking]
‐ [grunting]

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.651
Ryogi...

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:08.154
Why do you go so far
to protect this guy?

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.790
I'd go as far as I have to.

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.058
[lightly grunting]

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:14.360
Because this man
once saved my life!

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.331
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>come with me?</i>

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.666
<i>[breathy inhale]</i>

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:21.602
Huh?

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.904
<i>Whaddya say?</i>

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:24.938
<i>[sniffling]</i>

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:28.975
<i>Mm.</i>

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.546
I understand now.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.948
But that's still no reason
to become a thief!

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.051
Is this really the kind of
life you had hoped for?!

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.053
Life I hoped for?

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.321
What a question!

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.323
So typical of the people
in this village;

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:46.092
your lives have been so easy!

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:48.128
In this world,
you just have to accept

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.030
the role that you were
cast to play...

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.732
It's just another way
of living!

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:52.833
Know what?

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.868
I think you're straining
to fit into a mold

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.169
that's too tight.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.304
All those hours
we spent playing shogi...

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.073
you were lying
the whole time?!

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:00.941
That wasn't real.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.408
It was just an act,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.978
so I could get close to you
and gain your trust.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.047
Why's it so hard for you
to get that?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.482
[wincing in pain]

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:10.551
My head.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.719
What's wrong, Ryogi?!
Are you okay?

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:13.787
Shut up!

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.923
I don't want to
talk to you anymore!

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.425
Ryogi!
Use it now!

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:19.993
Yes.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.830
Ice Style: Crystal Wall!

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:26.567
[gasping]

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.333
What?!

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:31.638
Hmph.

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:39.680
Be careful.

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:41.882
This isn't an ordinary
Ice Style.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:48.655
[gasping]

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.659
What is this?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.499
Well done, Ryogi!

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:05.305
[struggling]

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:07.841
Hurts so much.

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:12.779
No, stop!
Please stop!

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:16.783
Calm down, Ryogi.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:19.953
Relax.
You look terrible right now.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.454
[exhaling]

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.429
[smirking]

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:31.431
Damn it.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.867
What do we do, Boruto?

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.034
Uh!

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:37.370
Hey, did you hear me,
Boruto?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.543
You're that guy!

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:43.143
Huh?!

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.978
[grunting]

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.614
How did you get in here?

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.818
What do you think
you're doing?!

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.687
[grunting]

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.388
What's gotten into you,
Boruto?!

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.558
[grunting]

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.325
Tell me where
you put Shikadai!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.426
[grunting]

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.596
Is he caught in a genjutsu?

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.630
[gasping]

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.738
I get it.
The mirror!

00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:12.773
[grunting]

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.809
[grunting]

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:16.577
[landing]

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:21.515
[grunting]

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:24.785
No way in hell
I'm gonna stand around

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:28.188
and get stuffed into a mold
that's too tight!

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.089
I'm sorry.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.892
I just got a little confused.

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:34.728
[lightly gasping]

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.899
Hmm.

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:41.902
Did you get that from
the black‐haired kid?

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:42.669
[gasping]

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.806
I see how it is

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.174
between you two.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:50.343
I don't like what
you're implying.

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:52.713
That guy doesn't mean
anything at all to me!

00:06:58.885 --> 00:06:59.620
Uh?

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.023
[gasping]

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:07.227
Then it won't be a problem
for you to prove it,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.795
by getting rid of that brat.

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.131
I'm gonna go up front
and check on things.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.701
I understand, sir.

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:18.872
Hold on.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.511
Let me take a look
at your wound.

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.813
We're gonna need to
patch you up quickly.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:29.750
All right.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:41.528
[grunting]

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:43.496
You need to
calm down, Boruto!

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.567
[fighting]

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:48.201
[grunting]

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.637
[grunting]

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:52.573
[grunting]

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.214
[grunting]

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:04.518
<i>A Shadow Clone?!</i>

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.563
Now that was
a really close call.

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:21.968
[straining]

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.704
Damn it, let me go!

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:25.839
Tell me who the hell you are!

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.873
Oh, man.

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.109
Just how weak
are you to genjutsu?

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:32.846
Release!

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.183
Shikadai?

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:42.355
Was I by any chance just
controlled by a genjutsu?

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.925
It certainly seems that way.

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:45.559
I see.

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:47.528
If you can touch

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.130
and pass chakra through
the affected person...

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:51.397
you can cancel a genjutsu.

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:52.866
When I was little,

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:56.269
Mirai constantly used me for
her own experiments.

00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:58.972
And she made real sure

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.808
I knew how to release
a genjutsu.

00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:03.076
Ooooooh!

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:06.980
What's the big idea?!
That really hurt!

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:08.148
Shut up.

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:09.816
Just needed to even the score.

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.022
Boss...

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:18.458
Once we get over
that mountain,

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:20.260
we'll be in safe range.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.394
Yeah.

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:22.629
You're right.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.268
[struggling]

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:30.303
Why?

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.905
[struggling]

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.813
You think maybe Ryogi

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:42.583
is also being controlled
by a genjutsu?

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:44.851
There's a high possibility
of that.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.690
We can't get involved even if
we stumble onto something.

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:50.824
We have to report it

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:53.026
to someone ranked
chunin or higher.

00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:57.497
That's standard practice
for us genin, right?

00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:58.464
Huh?

00:09:58.498 --> 00:09:59.733
Why say that now?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.768
You should know...

00:10:01.802 --> 00:10:03.704
It's okay if you decide
not to stick around

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:05.772
with this good‐for‐nothing
rule breaker.

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:08.742
[chuckling]

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.945
Shikadai, you always
go by the book

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.947
and avoid getting involved.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.517
Yet, here you are sticking
your nose into something

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.952
that's bound to become
a real drag.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:22.989
Come on! You know I can't
turn down something this fun!

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:23.924
Heh.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.959
You're crazy,
you know that?

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.161
Okay!

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.731
I'm gonna punch Ryogi, next.

00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:32.699
Might knock some sense
into him!

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.840
I'll owe you one after this.

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:41.708
Next time they come out
with a new burger,

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:42.943
it's on you.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.222
Don't get too carried away.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:57.423
Oh, man.

00:11:03.864 --> 00:11:05.732
It's just Ryogi in there.

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:07.768
You think the boss
escaped already?

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:09.202
I didn't sense
the Thunder Train

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:10.671
slowing down.

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:11.872
My guess is...

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:13.740
he's still gotta be on board.

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.113
I thought you wanted us
to stop Ryogi?

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:22.883
If we're right and
he's under a genjutsu,

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.118
then we've got to get
his boss first.

00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:27.754
‐ Huh!
‐ Huh!

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:34.060
I won't let you go.

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:37.397
Boruto, go on ahead!
And watch out for any mirrors!

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.765
I got this one!

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:40.166
Hold it!

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.804
[grunting]
[straining]

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.874
I'm the only opponent
you've got now!

00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:55.248
Do your job and take care of
those pests back there, Ryogi.

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.049
Huh?

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:00.420
Let go of that lever!

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:01.187
[snarling]

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:05.659
He's using you.

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:07.227
And once you've served
your purpose,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.195
he'll cast you aside.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.430
I'm sure you've
already figured

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.298
that much out yourself.

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:13.700
Even if you're right,

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.969
it's still my responsibility
to protect him.

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:17.638
You like living like that?

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:19.339
Aren't you tired of
this life, yet?

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:20.574
I know.

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:22.208
How about we go back
to that bench

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:23.343
and play some shogi!

00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:25.078
[wincing]

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:29.415
I'm just...

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:30.483
a pawn.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.558
The pawn always protects
the King.

00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:39.492
Wha‐‐?
What are you saying?

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:42.395
I owe him for saving me.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.601
The only way to repay him
is with my life!

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:49.903
[grunting]

00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:53.940
[grunting]

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:56.843
[lightly gasping]

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:11.157
Ryogi...

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.160
What are you doing here?!

00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:14.928
[gasping]

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.063
You were still alive.

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:21.401
How dare you?

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:25.271
How dare you kill
my mom and dad!

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.441
[struggling]

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.713
Now hold on there.

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:34.548
The two of us should
have a conversation

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:35.315
and talk this out.

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:36.750
That sounds good.

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:38.819
You can tell me everything
back at the village.

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:41.421
How about teaming up
with me instead?

00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:44.157
There'll be no end of buyers
for what I've got.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.826
If we're smart
about selling it,

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:48.028
we'll both be
ridiculously rich.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:51.264
You would disgust
any noble thief.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:55.368
Okay then, fine.
I suppose I lose.

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:58.271
So you just want
this stuff back, right?

00:14:01.742 --> 00:14:03.710
[straining]

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:04.945
Damn it!

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:08.014
[grunting]

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:11.552
Boruto!

00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:14.187
I'm sorry,
I messed up.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.955
[gasping]

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:19.626
Damn it!

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.729
You almost got me,
you little brats!

00:14:22.763 --> 00:14:24.230
Dad...

00:14:24.264 --> 00:14:25.465
Mom...

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:28.334
I'm so sorry I couldn't
protect you back then.

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:38.712
Ryogi!
You're being manipulated!

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.714
You're absolutely right!

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:42.415
Once I rewrote
his childhood memories,

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.084
he became my pawn!

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:47.420
And then he was willing to do
anything in the world for me!

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:50.023
[laughing]

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:50.857
[lightly grunting]

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.158
Stop it, Ryogi!

00:14:52.192 --> 00:14:53.694
If you use too much chakra,

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.495
you're going to tear
yourself apart!

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:58.832
Now what?

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:01.134
I can't even get
close enough to touch him.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:09.409
Ryogi. Do you remember what
happened when we first met?

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:12.378
You showed up, out of nowhere,
and interrupted me.

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.682
Yet you still put up walls
around yourself.

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:17.483
Never letting anyone
get close to you

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:19.520
is just a bad habit, Ryogi!

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:25.692
Heh. I'm the last person
who should talk about that.

00:15:25.726 --> 00:15:26.459
[wincing]

00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:28.929
Shut up.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.331
Just shut up!

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:32.666
[grunting]

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:34.868
[wincing]

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:35.636
Shikadai!

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:41.074
You should take
a look at yourself.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.544
You're turning into a monster.

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:46.412
Is that really the kinda
figure you want to be?

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.486
I'm a...

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.021
a pawn!

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:57.691
[struggling]

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.160
Boruto!

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:01.928
You're in a tough spot.

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:02.929
So what now?

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:04.397
I'll strike a deal with you

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.500
for a juice, the new burger,
and some fries, too!

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:08.635
[chuckling]

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:10.470
That sounds like
a real bargain!

00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:15.676
Ryogi!

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:17.711
I am...

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:18.679
You are not!

00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:22.148
...a sacrificial pawn!

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:28.922
You are not
a sacrificial pawn!

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:30.857
[gasping for air]

00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:31.625
Release!

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:58.752
[quietly crying]

00:16:58.785 --> 00:16:59.520
I...

00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:08.294
Heh.

00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:11.765
Saying I'll be a pawn
sounded so cool at the time.

00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:14.535
It was all to avenge
my parents.

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:15.702
What a joke, huh?

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:18.539
[quietly crying]

00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:21.107
I have nothing left now.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.249
I gripe a lot.

00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:31.284
I complain about everything
being a drag,

00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:32.886
even thought I've spent
my whole life

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:34.721
in this peaceful village.

00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:36.122
I've never had it bad.

00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:37.457
I can't imagine your past,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.126
or understand
how tough it was.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.563
I don't have a clue
about that.

00:17:42.596 --> 00:17:43.830
But it's gonna work out!

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:47.768
What does that mean?

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:50.804
Do you really know things
are gonna work out, Shikadai?

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:52.873
[chuckling]
Not really.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.140
It's just...

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:58.879
I think things'll work out.

00:17:58.912 --> 00:17:59.646
Mm.

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:02.816
Didn't I tell you?

00:18:02.849 --> 00:18:04.150
The thing about pawns...

00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:06.152
is you decide what they are...

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:08.421
and then anything is possible.

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:25.371
Damn it!

00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:30.010
He was right in our gasp
and he still got away.

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.411
It's all over, then?

00:18:34.548 --> 00:18:35.281
[gasping]

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.017
Huh?

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.251
What was that?

00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:43.256
And now, I can say goodbye

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.491
to a life of
small‐time robbery.

00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:48.394
I've got a one‐way ticket
to all the luxury I want.

00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:52.498
To the good life!
[laughing]

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:53.233
Huh?

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:54.500
[grunting]

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.074
Are you the‐‐?

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:02.576
Aw, come on!

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:10.617
Is it really over?

00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:43.449
Oooh!

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:46.219
Thank you, Young Lord,
for bringing it back!

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:48.021
Aw, come on,
you don't have to cry about it

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:49.990
just because
I got it back for you.

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:51.725
Oh, I'm not crying about that.

00:19:51.758 --> 00:19:53.827
I'm just overwhelmed
because society

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.396
finally acknowledged that
this scientific ninja tool

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:59.866
is so valuable,
it's worth trying to steal!

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.901
'Kay...

00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:03.269
What is it anyway?

00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:05.872
What's the scientific
ninja tool do?

00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:09.075
I'll tell you.

00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:10.410
This is a new power

00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:13.680
that has the potential
to change history.

00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:14.715
Hmm?

00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:17.618
Young Lord...

00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:19.686
This tool was developed
to be used by

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.388
exceptional young shinobi
like yourself.

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:24.925
Whaddya mean?

00:20:47.213 --> 00:20:47.681
What's up?

00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:51.818
You waiting for him
again today?

00:20:51.852 --> 00:20:52.986
Yeah, kinda.

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:01.161
When does Ryogi get out?

00:21:01.194 --> 00:21:04.230
How long will he be
stuck in there?

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:04.731
Who knows?

00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:09.770
Looks like we've seen
the end of the Byakuya Gang.

00:21:09.803 --> 00:21:10.971
That's true.

00:21:11.004 --> 00:21:14.140
Seems like Lord Seventh
took care of it himself.

00:21:14.174 --> 00:21:17.644
Yeah.
It sure seems like it.

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:18.612
It's not right.

00:21:18.645 --> 00:21:20.113
If he was planning
to swoop in,

00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:21.582
he should've let us know.

00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:24.484
Don't trash talk him.

00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:26.386
In the end,
Lord Seventh was the one

00:21:26.419 --> 00:21:28.221
who made everything right.

00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:31.124
They were too much to handle
for you and me.

00:21:31.157 --> 00:21:32.358
[groaning]

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.396
Missions can be
pretty hard, huh?

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:37.964
More than I expected.

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.334
No kidding.

00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:42.503
But little by little,

00:21:42.536 --> 00:21:44.971
we'll get better at them
over time.

00:21:45.005 --> 00:21:46.439
Even though it's a drag.

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:50.143
We'll figure it out one day...

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:51.745
the both of us will.

00:21:53.046 --> 00:21:54.380
And Ryogi will, too.

00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:58.685
Seems like you've already
changed a little yourself.

00:21:58.719 --> 00:21:59.720
[scoffing]

00:22:01.087 --> 00:22:03.657
So? When do I get
my free burger?

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.727
Oh yeah...
I forgot all about that.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.360
What?!

00:22:07.393 --> 00:22:08.829
What a drag.

00:23:44.357 --> 00:23:45.592
(DENKI) You have to be
recommended

00:23:45.626 --> 00:23:47.594
by the sensei
in charge of your team

00:23:47.628 --> 00:23:49.262
to be able to participate
in the Chunin Exams, right?

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:50.531
(IWABE)
But we weren't able to help

00:23:50.564 --> 00:23:52.666
with the Byakuya Gang
incident one bit!

00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:54.968
At this rate, we won't ever
get recommended!

00:23:55.001 --> 00:23:57.470
(METAL) If we do not
get to take the exam,

00:23:57.504 --> 00:24:00.507
we will end up being
called Team Repeater!

00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:05.111
(IWABE) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:05.145 --> 00:24:06.647
"The Genin Documentary"

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.848
There's no way in hell

00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:10.584
I'm gonna repeat
this year again, dammit!
