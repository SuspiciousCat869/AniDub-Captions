Ryogi!

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.812
See?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.814
You're still doing it
even now.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.649
You're a full‐fledged
shinobi...

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.218
but you aren't even
trying to capture me.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.720
You're all talk and no action.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.133
[gasp]

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.203
We've been trying to find you.
What are you doing?

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:40.106
Oh, well, um...
nothing much.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.643
We've been called to assemble!
Come on, hurry!

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.677
Assemble?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.978
Yeah, there's trouble brewing

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.280
at the Kaminarimon Company
right now!

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.850
[sigh]

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.452
[protesting and chattering]

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.221
The Kaminarimon Company
is done!

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.091
The Kaminarimon Company
is unjust!

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.528
Protect the workers rights!

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:07.734
[laughing]

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.070
Ryogi,
never in a million years

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.273
did I think your strategy
would work out so well.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:15.008
We could even
leave the protest

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.911
and the chaos would
continue to spread.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:20.013
Once the current
begins to flow,

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.182
there's no stopping it!

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.851
That's the nature of reality.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:25.586

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:39.666
Oh...nothing.
I heard what you said.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.366
Heh.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.635
All right,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:45.338

<i>you can't do anything</i>

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.288
Since yesterday,

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.957
these flyers
have been distributed

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.726
all over the village.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.795
"The Hidden Leaf Village
is about to be reborn...

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.497
"Those of like minds,

[aggravated sigh]

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.508
The hell do they think
they are?!

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:03.476
So all of the recent
disturbances...

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.479
must have been leading up to
this one big protest.

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.314
One thing's for sure...

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.717
We can no longer
afford to ignore it.

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.919
Innocent villagers
will be in danger,

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:15.321
especially
if this gets bigger.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.858
Of course,
we won't allow that to happen.

00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.360
We've already sent in
several police agents.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:23.163
Security will be very tight
at Kaminarimon.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.965
All our resources are on it.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.499
The problem is...

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:30.336
...the protestors are
ordinary citizens, not ninja.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.372
We can't do
anything too rough.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.574
We'll just have to
appease them

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.475
by being calm and
asking them nicely

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.278
to disperse as peacefully
as possible...

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.446
That will be our mission,
you got that?

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:42.583
[sigh]

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.552
Boruto, what's wrong?

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:46.853
Uh...

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:48.121
I don't know...

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.455
I'm not used to
this kind of mission

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.025
It makes me
a little nervous...

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.160
We won't be
fighting the enemy.

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:56.096
We'll be confronting
ordinary citizens.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.964
What if someone gets hurt?

00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:58.965
Kinda scary.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.066
[sigh]

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.301
Still though...

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.203
it's our job as ninjas.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.838
In fact, it's also our duty...

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.041
to figure out
how to do it well and safely.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:08.408
Mm.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.410
In just a minute,

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.913
I'll be giving each team
their section assignments.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:15.916
Please get to your positions
as quickly as possible.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.519
You will then wait there
for further instruction.

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:20.020
‐ Yes, sir!
‐ Yes, sir!

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:23.256
[chattering]

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.958
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.826
It's decided.

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:26.893
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.329
You've been assigned to
a critical spot.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.431
It's close to
the company headquarters.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.133
And it's an important
location.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.868
Okay,
we get that it's important,

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.303
but what are we
supposed to actually do?

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.271
Yeah, what do we do?

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:39.673
Don't worry.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.175
Just remember
you've got Shikadai with you.

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.344
He's level‐headed,
so you'll be fine.

Damn it!

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.298
The scope of this job
is so big

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.768
even all the jonin
had to get involved!

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:11.304
And all we can do is stand by
and watch from here!

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.439
Why do we have to be
suspended right now?

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.575
I know it is frustrating,

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:16.543
but it is our job
to endure it.

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:20.180
To a ninja,
an order is always absolute.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.883

down there on guard.

Please be careful
everyone!

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:41.201
Wow! So these are
all the protesters, huh?

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.402
They weren't kidding.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:43.970
If all these people
make a move,

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:45.606
it'll be complete chaos!

‐ Dad and the others

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.474
are guarding
the front of the building,

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.410
so it should be okay.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.412
<i>This configuration...</i>

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:53.714
<i>It's familiar...</i>

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.951
Hey, why is Shikadai
acting super weird?

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.553
How should I know?!

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:03.089
He's been like this ever since
we got called to assemble.

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:04.625
Well, anyway...

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:05.826
All these pieces lined up

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.861
look like that thing
he does...

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:08.929

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:11.164
it's that game
he's always playing...

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.566
What's the name of it again?

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.134
You mean Shogi?

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:14.935

you mention it...

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.418
Oh yeah.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.121
I don't think there's
anyone in position there.

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:36.489
But it should be okay.

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:38.458
It's quite a ways
from the headquarters.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.626
No, not that!

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.227
I mean this building!

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:41.528
(INOJIN)
Oh!

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:45.932
That's the building where
Boruto always visits a lot...

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.702
a research lab run by
that Katasuke guy.

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:49.836
[gasp]

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.073
That's because you never
go on the offensive.

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:54.575
It's a decoy.

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:57.644
Looks like...their real target
is the research lab!

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.449
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.119

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:07.754
Is there something wrong?

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.191

start gathering soon.

‐ Wow,

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.416
Shikadai's totally snapped!

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.084

‐ Huh?!
‐ Huh?!

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.061
What was that about?

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.730

I don't think protestors
or the Byakuya Gang

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.605
are gonna show up here.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:01.174
But we're still on a mission.
We have to stay alert.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.609
Damn!

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.711
I wish we were stationed
closer to the headquarters

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.346

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.280
Hm?

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.715
(BORUTO)
That's Shikadai!

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.852
What's he doing?

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:14.087
Hey, Boruto!

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.488
Sorry!
I gotta go!

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:16.790
What?

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.224
You're not allowed
to leave your post!

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:19.359
Hold on.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.427
Something strange
must've happened.

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.363
Boruto's instincts
are almost always right

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.098
at times like these.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:26.266
I don't know...

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.635
‐ [gasps]
‐ Hm?

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:33.473
[protesting and chatter]

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:35.041
There's no other choice.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.577
We're going to have to
confront them...by ourselves.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.078
[groan]

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.614
Well, it's not my fault
if we get yelled at later.

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:44.785
[protesting and chatter]

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:47.654
The Kaminarimon
Company is unjust!

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.322
[protesting and chatter]

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.591
Here they come!

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:53.493
Kiba,
these people aren't ninja.

00:09:53.527 --> 00:09:56.196
So please try not to use
any ninjutsu.

00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:57.731
Hah, that's fine by me!

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:01.001
[protesting and chatter]
Protect the worker's rights!

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:04.938
[pained grunt]

00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:08.008
[pained grunt]

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:08.742
[pained grunt]

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:17.584
[groan]

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:19.385
We finally found you.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:21.221
That's exactly
what we came to get.

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:24.424
The Byakuya Gang!
What're you doing here?

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.826
I thought you were
only interested in

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.561
the Kaminarimon Company!

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:28.394
[chuckle]

00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:29.963
Yes,

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.833
that's what all the villagers
would have you believe.

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:35.769
But our real objective
all along was...

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.204
...your ninjutsu data.

00:10:38.238 --> 00:10:39.973
[panicking]
Woah!

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.809
[panicking]

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:50.216
So the Byakuya Gang's
real target is

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.352
Mr. Katasuke's research lab?

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:53.854
I'm pretty sure.

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:55.221
I don't have proof though.

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:56.456
You don't?!

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.592
So you're just going off
a hunch you have?

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.160
You're really
not yourself today,

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:01.194
are you, Shikadai?

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.295
Hmmm...

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.797
It's okay.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.966
If that's what you believe,
then I'll support you.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:09.069
I'll support you too!
We're a team, after all!

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.070
[gasp]

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:10.637
You guys...

00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:11.838
[chuckle]

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:12.573
We've gotta hurry!

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:13.439
M‐hm!

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:14.875
We're almost to the lab!

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:24.217
[protesting and chattering]

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.385
(DENKI)
Saradra!

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:26.920
What are you doing here Denki?

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:28.955
I've been tracking
the protestors' movements

00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:30.791
and monitoring
their activities.

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:31.592
Something's not right.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.926
What is it?

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.395
Well...their actions
are out of character

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:36.496
for normal citizens.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.631
What are you saying?

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:41.334
[protesting and chattering]

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:45.606
The Kaminarimon Company
must be destroyed!

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.373
[gasp]
No way!

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.108
What is it?

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.814
[gasps]

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.016
Hey, snap out of it!

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.483
[grunt]

00:11:57.518 --> 00:11:59.385
[gasp]
Katasuke!

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:01.287
[grunt]

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.459
Huh?!

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:07.093
Hey!

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.295
Are you okay, old man?

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.267
Oh, Young Lord...

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.769
Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow!

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:18.438
This kind of defeat
is extremely embarrassing.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.305
Mm.

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:20.674
The Byakuya Gang?

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:21.742
That's right!

00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:23.343
Please try to catch them!

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:27.147
They knocked me out, and then,
they stole my magnum opus!

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.782
Your magnum opus?

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:31.952
Yes... Well, um...
Could you please just hurry?!

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:33.086
I placed a transmitter

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:35.155
on the leader of
the Byakuya Gang!

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:42.362
<i>[pained grunts]</i>

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.536
Young Lord, here...

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.604
Huh?

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:51.505
What's this?

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:52.806
As long as you have that,

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.641
you'll be able to track
where they are...

00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:56.577
even if you don't sense any
chakra.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.945
Wow, this is amazing!

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:02.148
Please get my magnum opus
back, Young Lord.

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:04.217
I will!
Just leave it to me!

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.554
[determined]

00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:09.890
[protesters chatter]

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:12.959
Are you sure
everything's okay?

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:15.428
The uproar seems to be
getting bigger out there.

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.697
Please, don't worry!

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.832
We will protect
the Kaminarimon Company!

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:19.966
We'll do whatever it takes!

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.201
‐ (DENKI) Excuse me!
‐ Huh?!

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.338
Mr. Kotaro!

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:26.106
Denki!

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:30.276
What are you doing here?

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.378
You're under suspension
right now.

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:33.814
Yes, I realize that, sir.

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.148
Hear me out.

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:37.450
There's something urgent
I need to report to you!

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.521
Oh?

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.223
Okay, I'm listening.

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:46.092
Right! This isn't
your ordinary protest.

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.594
What exactly are you saying?

00:13:47.628 --> 00:13:50.363
Many of the people who
are protesting in the front

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:51.698
have a seal on their neck.

00:13:51.732 --> 00:13:52.899
What did you say?!

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:54.467
They might be under
a genjutsu,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.571
and it's possible that
they're inciting the others.

00:13:57.604 --> 00:13:58.905
Damn Byakuya Gang!

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:03.043
I see.
We'll confirm it right away.

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:04.945
You did well to report this.

00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:07.914
Oh... Sure thing.
I'm glad I could help.

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:11.284
Right now,
it's about all I can do...

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.385
Denki...

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:13.153
[startled]

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.189
Thank you for the report.

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:18.659
I think you're doing
exceptionally well.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:19.425
Oh!

00:14:20.594 --> 00:14:21.294
Thank you!

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:25.566
Hey, Boss,

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:27.067
what is that thing anyway?

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.335
Doesn't look like
it's very valuable.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:32.806
Heh... This is a very precious
storage device.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:35.075
Why would you want
his storage device?

00:14:35.108 --> 00:14:37.343
Every ninjutsu
that exists in the world

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.846
has been recorded
in this storage device

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.182
it's incredibly valuable data.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.719
Be it Secret Ninjutsu or
Kekkei Genkai, it's all there.

00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:48.655
There are so many people who
want this, I can't keep count.

00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:49.923
Wow, that's great.

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:51.725
We can get a high price
for it then.

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:52.926
That's right.

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.528
Our haul up until now
is nothing

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.864
compared to what we'll get
for this priceless treasure.

00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.032
Hmm...

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:00.934
That data's going to benefit

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.570
the people of the world,
right?

00:15:03.604 --> 00:15:04.605
Hmm...

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.107
Of course!

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.710
It's selfish to keep something
all to yourself

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.444
that is good for
the entire world.

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:14.047
I'm all for sharing
when the time is right.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.217
Plus, this is for
true justice anyway.

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:21.154
Huh?!

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:25.491
Uhh?

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.928
We won't let you get away!

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:30.797
We caught up with you,
you rotten thieves!

00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:31.131
[shocked]

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:34.100
How did you know
you'd find us here?!

00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:37.237
It's useless to run away.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.440
Mr. Katasuke's science
showed us where you were.

00:15:40.473 --> 00:15:41.341
Science?!

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:42.142
Tch!

00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:44.110
Boss!
On your back!

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:46.647
Gah!

00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:51.451
I riled up the demonstrators
into a giant frenzy...

00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:53.754
so no one would detect
our chakra.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.522
But science gave us away?!

00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:01.728
Hand that thing over now!
That's Mr. Katasuke's...

00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:05.766
...precious...precious...uh...

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.268
I forgot...
What's it called?

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.572
[laugh] You ran after us
without knowing?

00:16:11.605 --> 00:16:13.774
Clearly, you bratty kids
are in a situation

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:14.775
that's over your heads.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.042
Oh shut up!

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:18.378
Whatever it's called,
give it back now!

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:20.413
[fighting]

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:24.551
Boss, get out of here now.
We'll take care of them!

00:16:24.585 --> 00:16:25.686
Good! Do it!

00:16:25.719 --> 00:16:26.920
You! Come with me!

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:28.188
‐ Right!
‐ Uh?!

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:29.590
‐ Wait!
‐ Shikadai!

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:33.259
Whaddya say?!
Should we get outta here too?

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:35.996
Yeah, but deal with him first!

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:38.899
[protesters cheering]

00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:40.433
I heard everything myself!

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.903
The Kaminarimon Company
always works us to the bone,

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:44.170
but then they want to keep

00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:46.072
100% of the profits
for themselves!

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.307
Who'd you hear that from?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.474
Huh?

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:51.678
Who was it that told
you that crazy story?

00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:54.180
I don't know.
It was...

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:56.482
Uh... Let's see...

00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:57.584
Who was it anyway?

00:16:58.585 --> 00:16:59.753
It's true.

00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:02.088
It's just like you said,
Mr. Kotaro.

00:17:02.122 --> 00:17:03.590
They're under a genjutsu.

00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:06.292
Release!

00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:11.031
What the‐‐? Uh...

00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:13.233
What on earth
am I doing here?

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:15.301
What are all these people
doing here?!

00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:21.207
Super Beast Scroll!

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:23.844
Ahh!

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.412
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:27.147
‐ Ahh!
‐ Ahh!

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:32.385
Looks like you're
the last one left, huh mister?

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.988
You kids really are
a bunch of spoiled brats!

00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:36.623
Fire Style: Fox Fire!

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:41.094
Die!

00:17:43.764 --> 00:17:44.464
Ohh?!

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:45.231
Whoa!

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:47.233
This came on kind of fast!

00:17:48.769 --> 00:17:49.970
Aaaah!

00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:50.737
Cho‐Cho!

00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:51.772
[laugh]

00:17:51.805 --> 00:17:52.906
Time's up, kids.

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:55.275
I'll turn both of you
into ash!

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:57.811
Uhuh!

00:17:57.844 --> 00:17:58.812
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.883
Stay alert until the very end.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.685
Uncle Shikamaru?!

00:18:04.718 --> 00:18:06.119
Ah...

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.422
So they're the Byakuya Gang?

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:12.025
You managed quite a feat.
Good job.

00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:12.926
Huh?!

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:14.460
Uh... Yeah, thanks....

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:17.664
Incidentally, genin aren't
officially authorized

00:18:17.698 --> 00:18:18.999
to take part in battle.

00:18:19.032 --> 00:18:21.001
But this was urgent,

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.769
so I'll let it slide
this time.

00:18:22.803 --> 00:18:23.136
[exhale]

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.073
But how'd you know
where we were?

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:28.474
Because I spoke with Mitsuki

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:30.811
and he told me that guys
were headed out this way.

00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:34.047
So I thought I would check in
and see what was going on.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.282
And try and calm
the rebellion.

00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:38.384
(SHIKAMARU) I'm sure it's
going to be a bit of a drag

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:40.687
but it's our duty to
listen to the people.

00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:44.124
Huh? What am I doing here?

00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:44.791
(NARUTO)
Listen!

00:18:44.825 --> 00:18:45.926
Hmm?

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.562
I need everyone's
attention please.

00:18:48.595 --> 00:18:50.463
(PROTESTER)
Is that Lord Hokage?

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:56.002
There's been rumors about
the Kaminarimon Company.

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.839
These men are
responsible for that.

00:18:58.872 --> 00:18:59.840
(PROTESTER)
Who are they?

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.276
Hey...

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.945
He's that guy who
stopped me back there

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.479
and chatted me up
for awhile.

00:19:06.513 --> 00:19:09.215
First of all, they made you
believe you were friends,

00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:10.551
and then they used genjutsu

00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:12.953
to make you believe
all of their lies.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.187
Genjutsu?

00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:16.489
That's right.

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:19.726
We wouldn't normally
fall for stories like that.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.994
However...

00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:22.495
I realize that
there are some of you

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:24.531
who weren't happy
in the first place.

00:19:25.766 --> 00:19:25.832
Ohh...?

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.870
This village is still undergoing
a lot of development.

00:19:29.903 --> 00:19:31.404
And during all this,

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:34.374
there are those who are facing
hard and demanding times.

00:19:34.407 --> 00:19:35.876
Perhaps there's some of you

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:38.612
who might be growing impatient
with the entire process.

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:40.981
You feel things are never
going to change.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.984
But...
I couldn't disagree more.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.285
Climbing the mountain
in front of us...

00:19:45.318 --> 00:19:46.653
step by step...

00:19:46.687 --> 00:19:49.222
if even just
a little at a time...

00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:51.925
that's what will make
the world a better place.

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.494
[protesters chatter]

00:19:54.528 --> 00:19:56.262
I want the Leaf Village...

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:59.966
to be a place where people
smile and enjoy their lives.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.467
And for that to happen,

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:04.738
we need every single person's
help in the village.

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:08.241
So please,
lend me all of your strength.

00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:10.376
We'll change our village
together!

00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:25.125
[applause and cheering]

00:20:25.158 --> 00:20:25.859
Hmmm.

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:33.233
All right.
Let's get down to business.

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.601
So Shikadai and Boruto

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:35.869
were the ones who
initially went after them?

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.370
Yeah.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.506
I think you should try
to follow them immediately!

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.375
I wish I could,
but here's the thing...

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.646
the chaos from the protests
hasn't calmed down yet.

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:48.749
With everyone's emotions
running at an all time high...

00:20:48.782 --> 00:20:51.752
there's no way for even Naruto
to find the enemy.

00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:53.186
Then...

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:56.122
I guess we'll just have to
let them handle it.

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:57.490
Interesting...

00:20:57.524 --> 00:21:00.260
I get why Boruto went...
but Shikadai as well?

00:21:00.293 --> 00:21:01.528
That's right,

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:04.164
and he looked
unusually determined.

00:21:04.197 --> 00:21:06.833
I wonder what brought that on.

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:08.201
I see.

00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:11.471
He looked unusually
determined, did he?

00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:14.708
Give it your all then...
my idiot son.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.544
‐ Uhh?!
‐ Uhh?!

00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:18.712
No way!

00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:19.445
The train!

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:24.918
Nice timing.
Exactly as planned.

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.288
‐ Ohh!
‐ Ohh!

00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:29.022
This way!

00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:36.630
Ryogi...

00:21:36.663 --> 00:21:38.264
What're you doing, Shikadai?!

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.867
Those two are
about to get away!

00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:42.836
Yeah, I'm aware of that!

00:21:44.838 --> 00:21:46.439
[laugh]

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:47.974
Now that we're on this
train,

00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:50.777
it's a direct line to
the other side of the border.

00:21:50.811 --> 00:21:53.179
No one will be able to
stop us now.

00:21:53.213 --> 00:21:54.915
(BORUTO)
I wouldn't be so sure!

00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:01.588
Checkmate.

00:22:02.723 --> 00:22:03.757
Shikadai!

00:23:45.692 --> 00:23:48.829
(SHIKADAI) Ryogi, why do you
go so far to protect this guy?

00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:50.564
(RYOGI) Because this man
saved my life!

00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:52.065
(SHIKADAI) Is this really
the kind of life

00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:52.566
you had hoped for?

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:55.401
(RYOGI) In this world,
you just have to accept

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:57.137
the role that you were
cast to play...

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:00.541
Its just another way
of living!

00:24:00.574 --> 00:24:04.444
(SHIKADAI) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.477 --> 00:24:05.846
"The Figure I Want to Be"

00:24:06.379 --> 00:24:07.648
Know what?

00:24:07.681 --> 00:24:09.449
I think you're straining
to fit into a mold

00:24:09.482 --> 00:24:10.684
that's too tight.
