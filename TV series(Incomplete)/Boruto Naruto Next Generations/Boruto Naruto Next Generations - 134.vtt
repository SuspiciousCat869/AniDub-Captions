WEBVTT

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.342
You're too slow.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.878
(Jiraiya groans)

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:12.212
Pervy Sage.

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.749
Oh, no, you don't.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.384
I can see it.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.256
(dramatic music)

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.726
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.161
Just give it up, already.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.999
(dramatic music continues)

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.842
(Jiraiya groans)

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.877
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:45.112
Pervy Sage.

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:52.352
(Urashiki patters)

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.358
(fishing rod whooshes)

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.861
(fishing rod smacks)

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.630
(Boruto thuds)

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.000
I'll stop you.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.969
No, don't, Naruto.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.071
You're the one he's
after, remember?

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:14.575
But if this keeps up...

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.477
(Sasuke breathes)

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.851
What's going on?

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.519
Wait, it's those guys.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.492
(Boruto grunts)

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.128
(Boruto thuds)

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:46.473
In one fell swoop, I'll tear
off that seal inside of you.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.008
(Naruto grunts)

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.245
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:57.885
(Sasuke patters)

00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:00.487
(kick sound)

00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:05.993
(Sasuke groans)

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:07.394
(Sasuke thuds)

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.531
You certainly know
how to waste my time.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:15.135
Boruto, take Naruto
and get out of here.

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.671
-(Naruto gasps)
-What? Sasuke, no way.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:22.743
The whole reason we came
here is to protect Naruto.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.411
Don't lose sight of that.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.980
Oh, well, I'm not
going to let you.

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:29.616
(wind blasts)

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.087
Go on.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.324
But...

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.625
Go, now.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:44.131
(Sasuke grunts)

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:47.501
(wind blasts)

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.738
(both gasp)

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:52.973
Let go.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.608
Come on, let go of us.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.311
You're not going anywhere.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.712
(Sasuke groans)

00:02:58.745 --> 00:02:59.980
Let go.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.749
(Sasuke groans)

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.487
(Urashiki screams)

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.859
(dramatic music)

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:13.760
(Urashiki screams)

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:16.630
(water splashes)

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:23.971
(opening theme music)

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.225
(opening theme music)

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:02.035
(dramatic music)

00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:08.208
It doesn't seem like
he's followed us.

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:11.078
Hey, hold still, I'm
not done wrapping you.

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:15.849
Lemme go.

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:18.719
Please, just let me out of this.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.053
Settle down.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:22.823
Come on.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.725
Please, just undo this thing.

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:27.494
And what happens then?

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:30.531
Then we go and save
him, what else?

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:34.434
Are you certain that you could
win if you went back there?

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:37.171
(Boruto sighs)

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:41.441
(dramatic music)

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.382
(Urashiki grunts)

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:51.485
Now you fools have
really gone and done it.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:56.356
(dramatic music continues)

00:05:57.658 --> 00:06:01.461
Well, I guess I'll go and look
for the owner of this sword.

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:10.170
(Sakura patters)

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:20.314
Just who are you, anyway?

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:26.453
(Sakura gasps)

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:31.725
(Sakura pants)

00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:35.062
So heavy.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.465
(Sakura groans)

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:47.074
You really ought to
think very carefully

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:49.109
about exactly why your friend,

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.478
did all that just
to let you get away.

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:56.350
You saw Urashiki's moves
as well, didn't you?

00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:58.952
Don't you fools get it yet?

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.455
My eyes are able to
see into the future.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:06.226
What he said, I don't
think it was a bluff.

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:10.864
Do you believe that he can
actually see the future?

00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:12.633
That's impossible,

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:15.202
regardless of who this
Urashiki guy might be.

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:16.770
I've never even heard of a jutsu

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:20.607
that would give someone the
ability to see into the future.

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:25.245
Still, until we figure
out what his trick is...

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:28.048
And that's why we
can't just leave him.

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:29.349
Boruto.

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:31.852
I'll never abandon my friends.

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:34.721
Uh-huh, you sure got that right.

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:38.091
I said you're not
going anywhere.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.626
Hey, let go of me.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.962
Until we're able to
figure out his jutsu,

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:44.097
we don't have a chance
of winning against him.

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.632
Don't you understand that?

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:50.337
(Boruto gasps)

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:55.809
The blood.

00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:58.111
Listen, just hold on
for a second, all right?

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.581
You've gotta give us
more details, you know.

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:03.684
I'm not sure about
this just yet,

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:05.586
but I wanna test something out.

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.588
It's okay, just come with me.

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:11.491
(dramatic music)

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:21.435
Hmm.

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:25.572
(dramatic music continues)

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:28.442
Ah-ha, a child?

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.080
(dramatic music continues)

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:35.682
What exactly is going on here?

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.584
And just who is that enemy?

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:42.222
(dramatic music continues)

00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:45.459
You've gotta wake up soon or
we're gonna be in big trouble.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.001
[Urashiki] Can you hear me?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.469
(Sakura gasps)

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:57.771
I don't know who you are
or where you're from,

00:08:57.804 --> 00:09:01.675
but you really ought to stop
doing such dangerous things.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.210
So what do you say?

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:06.747
Come on now, let's stop
wasting each other's time.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.850
Simply hand that man over
to me and if you do so,

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.853
then I'll be happy
to spare your life.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.121
He found us.

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:17.124
No, he couldn't
have, not that fast.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.359
There's no need to
put yourself at risk,

00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:21.128
futilely trying to protect a man

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:24.097
that you really don't know
anything about, is there?

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:27.501
What am I doing?

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.437
Why am I risking my life
for someone I barely know?

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.343
Despite appearances
to the contrary,

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.212
I'm quite tolerant, you know.

00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:41.081
I have no desire to
hurt an innocent child.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:46.119
I could find you quite
easily with my eyes

00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:49.590
but I don't want to waste
my strength unnecessarily.

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:54.061
(Boruto grunts)

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.337
You're quite stubborn
brats, aren't you?

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.043
(Naruto grunts)

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:13.347
(bomb blasts)

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:18.352
(daggers whoosh)

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.222
Got him.

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:29.997
Damn it.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.498
What is going on here?

00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:34.568
You have eyes in the back
of your head or something?

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:36.803
You're really quite relentless,

00:10:36.837 --> 00:10:39.273
putting me through
all this trouble.

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:40.340
Come on.

00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:43.076
How are you able to evade
our attacks so easily?

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:50.584
Can they do it?

00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:57.424
(sword slices)

00:10:57.457 --> 00:10:58.692
(kick sound)

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.562
(Boruto thuds)

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.497
Weren't you listening?

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.034
Didn't I already say that
my eyes can see the future?

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:11.672
(tree cracks)

00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:14.541
Fire Style Dragon Flame Bomb.

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:17.344
(Jiraiya grunts)

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:22.749
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:28.589
(upbeat music)

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:38.966
So you snuck back just
to brazenly attack me?

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.568
Your friendship
really is so touching.

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:45.472
Toad Oil Bomb.

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.577
(upbeat music)

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:13.967
(Jiraiya gasps)

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:15.068
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:17.704
An attack like that is useless.

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.541
Now, Earth Style Mud Wall.

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:23.343
(ground rumbles)

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:28.048
(upbeat music continues)

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:35.055
(wall crashes)

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:39.626
My, they certainly
are quick to run away.

00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:45.966
You see it?

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.568
Yeah, I did.

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:52.472
The blood on his clothes,

00:12:53.507 --> 00:12:56.043
dried more quickly
than what got on mine.

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:03.584
(dramatic music)

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:15.295
Now let's end all
this, shall we?

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:22.369
It all happened just like
you said that it would.

00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:23.804
Mm-hmm.

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:26.340
Although, you were
being pretty reckless,

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:29.209
taking that risk
just to confirm it.

00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:31.445
If our attack had
been too obvious,

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:34.414
Urashiki would've
gotten suspicious.

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:35.449
Blood, huh?

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.684
I get it.

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:39.953
Wait, are you serious right now?

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.089
Are you telling us that
you've just figured out,

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:43.724
how his jutsu works?

00:13:43.757 --> 00:13:46.660
I'm only saying I saw that
the blood on his clothes,

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:48.529
had dried faster than on yours.

00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:49.696
Which means...

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.032
Which means?

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.470
That's as far as
I got, you know.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.906
That's literally
what I just said.

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:01.942
Yeah, well, have you
figured it out yet?

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:04.444
No, I don't have a clue either.

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.313
[Jiraiya] Is it
possible that Urashiki,

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.048
could've released
heat from his body

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:09.950
to increase how fast it dried?

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:11.818
[Boruto] No, I don't think so.

00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:13.453
I didn't see any signs of that.

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:16.056
Okay, is there any
chance he used Wind Style

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:17.558
or something like that?

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:19.660
I doubt it.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.094
Hey, come on, guys.

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:24.198
Just explain it so that
I can understand it too.

00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:26.233
Looking at the factors
that caused the bloodstain

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:29.203
to dry faster, there are
three things to consider.

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:32.439
First, he produced heat that
decreased the drying time.

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:35.809
Second, that he was exposed
to a whole lot of wind.

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:38.912
Or thirdly, for
him and only him,

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:42.149
somehow a longer
amount of time passed.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.652
[Naruto] A longer
amount of time?

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:46.820
[Boruto] What do you mean?

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:48.956
The way he boasted
to all of us earlier,

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:50.924
about being able to
see into the future,

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.061
hasn't been sitting well
with me, one little bit.

00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:56.330
At first, I thought
he was just bluffing

00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:59.700
but it could be at
least half true.

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:00.734
Half true?

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:04.471
Instead of just
foreseeing the future,

00:15:04.505 --> 00:15:07.040
what if he actually
goes to the future

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:09.810
and then uses some method
to go back to the present,

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:11.411
once again?

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:12.913
Seriously?

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:14.414
No way.

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:19.419
I wonder if maybe he can
actually turn back time.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.055
You mean he has another ability,

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:25.025
aside from the
Transportation Technique?

00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:27.594
Hmm, well, without a doubt,

00:15:27.628 --> 00:15:29.930
that would explain all
the totally weird stuff

00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:31.932
that's been happening
up until now.

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:34.668
(dramatic music)

00:15:36.537 --> 00:15:39.139
(wind gushes)

00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:42.142
I found you.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.614
No more running away.

00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:50.717
Careful, if he can turn
back time, this'll be bad.

00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:56.190
(bomb blasts)

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.827
Ah, so you've
finally realized it?

00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:05.232
Yes, you're correct,
time is on my side.

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:07.534
I'll choke the breath
right out of your bodies,

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.670
before you even realize it.

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:14.675
(fishing rod whooshes)

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.077
(daggers clang)

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.313
What a fidgety
little brat you are.

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:22.316
However, I've already
read all your moves.

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:26.320
(tree cracks)

00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:28.488
Even if only seconds
pass for you,

00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:31.792
in the same amount of time,
I can relive that moment,

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.461
over and over, even
dozens of times.

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:39.666
And doing so allows me to
select the best possible move.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.101
(Boruto screams)

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:43.637
(Boruto thuds)

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.938
Initially, this ability,

00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:47.474
was supposed to be
a defensive jutsu,

00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:49.910
but of course, against
idiots like you,

00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:53.413
I can easily use it
offensively, as well.

00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:54.414
Why you.

00:16:54.448 --> 00:16:56.183
Yes, get angry.

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:59.052
That'll make my
job so much easier.

00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:02.556
I won't let you get away
this time, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.296
(Urashiki gasps)

00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:19.039
(Urashiki grunts)

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.544
(droplet plinks)

00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:30.350
Ninja Art Toad Mouth Trap.

00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:34.454
We're inside the belly of the
Great Toad of Mt. Myoboku.

00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:38.325
I see.

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:41.795
So then right now,
I'm in a stomach.

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:44.965
You humans do such
interesting things.

00:17:44.998 --> 00:17:46.600
Even if you can turn back time,

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:49.303
I've figured out that it's
only for a few seconds.

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:53.507
Because otherwise, we'd
have been dead long ago.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.908
So what's your point?

00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:56.810
In other words,
even you aren't able

00:17:56.844 --> 00:17:59.379
to go back to the moment
before you were put

00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:00.681
into this belly.

00:18:00.714 --> 00:18:02.216
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:05.786
Do you plan on dissolving
me in stomach acid?

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:07.821
How pitiful you think
you can stop me,

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:09.890
with something like this.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:13.327
Try to conserve your strength
as much as you can, you two.

00:18:14.728 --> 00:18:17.331
(blast sound)

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.702
(upbeat music)

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.683
(Urashiki whooshes)

00:18:49.096 --> 00:18:52.232
Like I said, I can
replay the same moment,

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:54.468
over and over dozens of times

00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:56.637
and then select the
best possible move,

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.539
all before you can even blink.

00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:03.177
I'll begin by eliminating
the nuisances,

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.412
and then proceed at my leisure.

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:10.284
(dramatic music)

00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:26.533
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:28.902
(Boruto grunts)

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:32.139
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.543
(dramatic music continues)

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:44.518
(Urashiki coughs)

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.954
(Jiraiya smirks)

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:50.524
This is quite strange.

00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:53.026
What's going on here?

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:55.362
We got you.

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:59.499
Like I said, we're
inside the belly now.

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:02.336
You see, the air in here is
filled with acidic poison.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.638
Since it's colorless
and odorless,

00:20:04.671 --> 00:20:06.473
it can be very hard to detect.

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:09.510
Even if you can endure
it for a little while,

00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:11.078
after about ten minutes,

00:20:11.111 --> 00:20:14.781
the poison begins to
paralyze your entire body.

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:15.816
(Urashiki chokes)

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:17.217
No way.

00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.486
[Jiraiya] You've been
reliving the earlier attacks,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.055
over and over
again, haven't you?

00:20:22.089 --> 00:20:23.757
That's what you said, right?

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.227
That means the poison's effect
on you is many times greater,

00:20:27.261 --> 00:20:29.329
than the effect it's had on us.

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:34.434
Despite being on a rung of
existence lower than a monkey,

00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:41.008
you fools are pretty
arrogant, aren't you?

00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:42.910
Let's do this.

00:20:42.943 --> 00:20:44.411
Right.

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:47.047
(upbeat music)

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:51.285
(Boruto grunts)

00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:56.557
(Naruto whooshes)

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.326
(Naruto grunts)

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:03.931
(Urashiki thuds)

00:21:03.964 --> 00:21:06.700
(upbeat music)

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:10.771
(Naruto chuckles)

00:21:10.804 --> 00:21:12.539
That's what you get.

00:21:16.844 --> 00:21:17.945
See that?

00:21:17.978 --> 00:21:18.946
Awesome.

00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:22.783
Wow, big bro, that was amazing.

00:21:22.816 --> 00:21:23.784
I'll say.

00:21:23.817 --> 00:21:25.419
Knocked me off my feet.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.287
(Boruto chuckles)

00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:28.322
We won.

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.457
Yeah.

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:43.770
That jutsu earlier was amazing.

00:21:43.804 --> 00:21:44.771
Yeah.

00:21:44.805 --> 00:21:46.173
So, what should we call it?

00:21:46.206 --> 00:21:48.408
Maybe Naruto Stream?

00:21:49.109 --> 00:21:50.444
I don't really know why,

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.913
but that sure has
a nice ring to it.

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:53.914
Right?

00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:55.148
I know.

00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:58.418
(upbeat music)

00:22:11.698 --> 00:22:15.169
(closing theme music)

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.314
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:45.826
[Boruto] It's over, Urashiki.

00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:47.461
It's over, you say?

00:23:47.494 --> 00:23:50.631
Don't underestimate
me, you little brat.

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:53.567
[Naruto] What, are you looking
to get beat up some more?

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.601
[Jiraiya] He's not bluffing.

00:23:54.635 --> 00:23:57.304
He still has something
hidden up his sleeve.

00:23:57.337 --> 00:24:00.908
Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations".

00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:03.510
The Last Battle: Urashiki.

00:24:03.544 --> 00:24:04.645
(Urashiki chuckles)

00:24:04.678 --> 00:24:05.646
You fools.

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:08.282
I'm gonna crush all of
you till you're dead.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:15.689
(closing theme music)
