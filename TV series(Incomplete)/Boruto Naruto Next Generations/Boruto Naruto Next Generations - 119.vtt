WEBVTT

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:09.376
(instrumental music)

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.509
In order to prevent Soma
from victimizing anyone else,

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.278
let's make sure that
the wedding ritual

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.213
goes off without a hitch.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.247
Yes.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:51.218
(chuckles)

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.256
Miss Remon!

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.363
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:20.113
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.333
(instrumental music)

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.122
And finally, we'll
proceed with the ritual

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:13.060
to cut the stone's horns and
seal Soma away once again.

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:16.630
(strange music)

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.736
(strange growling)

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:39.953
These are Lady Kuen's swords,

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:42.089
used against Soma
for generations.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:45.225
All right, now, please take
them and cut off its horns.

00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:49.363
(strange music)

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.738
(loud blast)

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.151
Lord Kankitsu!

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:13.954
What have you done? Now
we're never going to be able

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:16.590
to seal Soma away ever again.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.728
What are you doing?

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.039
(strange growling)

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:36.977
This can't be!

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.212
Miss Remon!

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.548
Mr. Konohamaru!

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:44.451
(strange roaring)

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:58.131
Damn it! Kankitsu,
why'd you do it?

00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:01.168
And with that, I have
fulfilled my duty.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.440
What is going on?

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:11.612
(strange roaring)

00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:13.747
Seriously?

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:22.589
Soma will be resurrected.

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:25.292
(strange music)

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.326
Oh, no...

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.561
No, this...

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:28.595
can't be!

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.334
(strange roaring)

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.338
[Konohamaru] Hey,
are you all right?

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:41.074
Mr. Konohamaru!

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:45.712
Damn it! Wind Style Gale Palm!

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:49.950
Guess ninjutsu
doesn't work either.

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:52.586
(angry growl)

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:01.862
Did Soma just eat
their memories?

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:03.497
Damn it! Boruto!

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.732
Get everybody out
of here. Quick.

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:06.867
I'll stop Soma!

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.835
Big Bro!

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.536
Hurry!

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.938
Right!

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.606
Come on, hurry, get outside.

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:17.277
You too, Miss Remon!
We've gotta go!

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:18.312
Bring it!

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:21.081
(angry roaring)

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:27.754
What just?

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:31.859
(angry roaring)

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.093
No, you don't.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.495
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.071
Here goes! Sealing
Jutsu, Triangle Seal!

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:50.043
(angry roaring)

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.312
That's amazing!

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:54.848
Did it work?

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:57.618
(angry roaring)

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.855
I really thought that
Gramps' Sealing Jutsu

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:02.890
was going to work,

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.491
but it seems like
it's only going

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:06.560
to limit Soma's
movements temporarily.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.995
No way!

00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:11.131
(angry roaring)

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.133
Miss Remon, are you injured?

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.935
No, I'm all right.

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:18.238
Mr. Konohamaru, what
am I going to do now?

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:20.941
Well, first of all, let's
just get out of here.

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:23.243
Then we can regroup and
come up with a strategy

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:25.445
to beat this Soma creature.

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.215
(angry roaring)

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.094
Where am I?

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:42.596
Lord Kankitsu!

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:45.199
What have I done?

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:49.970
But why? Why would I
even try to revive Soma?

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:51.338
From the looks of it,

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.574
I'd say that Soma
was controlling you.

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:57.744
So it completely makes sense

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:00.814
that you were acting like
a totally different person.

00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:03.083
But when did Soma
get ahold of you?

00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:07.821
I believe it was when

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:09.523
I went to the Yoimura household

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:11.758
to set the date for
the wedding ritual.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.762
(slow music)

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:20.801
I heard someone
calling out to me.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:24.471
Before I realized it, I was
in front of the Soma Rock.

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.078
I touched the stone and I...

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.548
This is terrible!

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.983
Just what have I done?

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.384
Forget wallowing in guilt!

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.753
Let's figure out how
to bring Soma down!

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:43.123
Because physical attacks
and ninjutsu aren't working!

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:45.993
There's something that
puzzles me about that...

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.661
In the cave earlier,

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:51.465
when Soma approached me, it
moved as if it were scared.

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:53.000
It seemed scared?

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.203
Yes, but... what could
it have been afraid of?

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:59.339
Once we know that, we'll
know how to beat it.

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:01.642
As far as I know,
all that it fears

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:05.212
is the hair clip that Lady
Kuen used against it long ago.

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:08.615
(slow music)

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:17.124
Why do you have
that, Mr. Konohamaru?

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.693
Kankitsu was gonna try
to break it earlier,

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.361
so I took it with me.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.865
Now that we have this,

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.334
we may be able to do
something about Soma.

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:33.707
We can still seal Soma
away, inside of my own body.

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:36.810
Please, just wait!

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:39.479
If you do that, Miss
Remon, then you'll be...

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:42.716
What's he mean by that?

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:46.587
Well, back when Lady
Kuen was attempting

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.222
to subjugate Soma...

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:52.693
(heavy breathing)

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:55.095
(growling)

00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:01.268
Her body became
possessed by Soma.

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:04.104
Using the power of the jutsu
woven into the hair clip,

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:07.574
she sealed Soma inside her body
so that it couldn't escape.

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:10.110
Once Soma's horns
have materialized,

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:13.947
we'll be able to cut them
off and bring it down.

00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:16.850
That hair clip is
really that powerful!

00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:18.819
Only a member of
the Yoimura Clan

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:20.387
is able to use the hair clip

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.489
to seal Soma inside
of their body.

00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:24.358
Although...

00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:28.362
Is there a risk to
this plan of yours?

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:31.965
Lady Kuen was able to
successfully seal Soma away

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.600
inside her body.

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:34.601
However...

00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:41.308
...as a result of that, it
consumed every memory she had.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:53.720
... as a result of that, it
consumed every memory she had.

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:57.858
After Soma's trapped inside,

00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:00.627
all that's left is to
cut off its horn...

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:04.097
But Soma put up a fight
inside Lady Kuen's body

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:05.766
and devoured her memories.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.101
With her memories lost,

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.771
she even began to
forget who she was.

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:15.576
Despite that, Lady Kuen
managed to cut off Soma's horn.

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:17.211
But only one of them.

00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:26.753
(frustrated roaring)

00:11:34.628 --> 00:11:36.263
Along with help from her clan,

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:39.099
she was able to seal
Soma inside the rock.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.504
(instrumental music)

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:48.809
But still, Lady Kuen never
regained her memories afterward.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.244
But the hair clip.

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.579
I thought you said that
it protects your memories.

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:53.747
Isn't that right?

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.384
Not even that can suppress
Soma once it's inside the body.

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:59.753
But this is the
only way to stop it.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.592
Big Bro, can't you come
up with anything else?

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.096
(angry roaring)

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:11.732
The Sealing Jutsu's
about to break!

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:13.767
I have an idea I'd like to try!

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.072
(angry roar)

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:30.851
All right! Come and get us!

00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:33.487
(angry growl)

00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:36.089
Summoning!

00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:41.862
I was just thinkin'

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.630
that it's been a while
since I was summoned...

00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:47.167
...but this is just
another annoying scenario.

00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:48.101
Argh.

00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:50.103
Oh, come on. Don't
say that, Enra!

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:52.739
Wait, I've never seen
that Summoning before!

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:57.978
Neither ninjutsu nor
physical attacks work on it.

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.948
It's a monster that
devours people's memories.

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:02.549
(attacking roar)

00:13:02.583 --> 00:13:04.218
Mmmhh... Sarutobi...

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:05.986
...y'know the fable
about the monkey

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:08.088
who tried to catch the moon?

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.258
Sometimes there are things
beyond one's abilities.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.863
Hey, you talk too much.
Enra, let's do that.

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:19.766
Yeah, yeah, you wanna
do that, huh? Transform

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:27.574
(angry roaring)

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:31.311
Boruto! Is everything ready?

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:32.346
Oh, yeah.

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:35.716
We're good to go!

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.052
(wary growl)

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.089
All right, now just stand back.

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:47.461
(eager roar)

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:53.433
Let's go, Enra! Now!

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:54.568
[Enra] Right!

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:56.103
(attacking growl)

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:57.571
Combined Sealing.

00:13:57.604 --> 00:13:59.306
Monkey-Sun Suppression

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:10.584
(angry roar)

00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:11.618
Awesome!

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.623
(struggling roars)

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.546
I knew it! You don't
have enough chakra!

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.315
C'mon, focus!

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:42.449
Yeah, I know.

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:45.953
Big Bro!

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:49.323
(angry straining roar)

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.192
That's as far as I can go.

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:53.227
Damn it!

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:02.469
Ugh.

00:15:07.474 --> 00:15:10.210
(attacking roar)

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.449
I'm all out of chakra...

00:15:21.622 --> 00:15:23.257
Mr. Konohamaru...

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.325
...thank you for everything.

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:29.363
(growling)

00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:40.040
No! You won't escape!

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:01.361
(Remon cries)

00:16:03.764 --> 00:16:05.065
Miss Remon!

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:09.603
I've managed... to seal him.

00:16:11.705 --> 00:16:13.073
Mr. Konohamaru!

00:16:14.842 --> 00:16:17.311
Please hurry, the horns!

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:19.746
(Remon yells)

00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:30.357
Hold on, what am
I even doing here?

00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:34.862
Oh, no. Miss Remon's memories...

00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:36.630
some are starting to eat them!

00:16:38.732 --> 00:16:39.733
Oh, uh..

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:43.070
Who are you?

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.378
When I first met you,

00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:53.847
I thought you were just an
ordinary young noblewoman.

00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:56.483
(Remon yells)

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:00.354
But in the end...

00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:02.656
you chose to harden
your resolve...

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.492
...and confronted Soma for
the sake of your people.

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:09.062
You're a strong and
beautiful woman.

00:17:09.997 --> 00:17:11.999
N-No! Just stay back!

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.468
(sad music)

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.752
You're amazing, Miss Remon!

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:38.625
And meeting you is...

00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:43.330
...something I'll...

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:45.299
...never forget!

00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:47.568
(soft music)

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:17.231
(angry roaring)

00:18:25.005 --> 00:18:28.475
Are those all the
memories it ate?

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.491
Big Bro...

00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:03.277
Miss Remon!

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.311
Lady Remon!

00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:09.750
Who are you two? Do I know you?

00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:13.754
Oh, my! How sad...

00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:16.557
And, uh...

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.624
who am I?

00:19:21.028 --> 00:19:25.732
You are Remon Yoimura. And
I am Kankitsu Akitsuki.

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:29.736
I am Remon Yoimura?

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.440
Yes, and you're the one
who saved Daidai Village.

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:45.385
So uh...

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:48.422
Are you sure you don't wanna
see Miss Remon before we go?

00:19:48.455 --> 00:19:49.556
I am.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.524
But why not?

00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:53.126
This could be your
last chance to tell her

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.195
how you feel about her.

00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:56.129
Hey...

00:19:56.163 --> 00:19:58.332
...I guess it just
wasn't my time yet.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.268
Some things you just understand

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.670
without even putting
them into words.

00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:05.072
You'll get it one day.

00:20:16.283 --> 00:20:18.385
[Remon] Lord Kankitsu...?

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:20.254
Would you like to
have some lunch?

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:23.724
You've always loved sour
foods, so you'll love these.

00:20:23.757 --> 00:20:26.326
(piano music)

00:20:33.367 --> 00:20:35.402
Super sour!

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:37.671
But so delicious!

00:20:37.704 --> 00:20:39.239
I'm glad that you like it.

00:20:39.273 --> 00:20:41.341
I haven't seen you
smile in so long.

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:45.212
I never even knew something
so delicious existed.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:47.214
This is such a nice surprise!

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:52.219
Oh, my...

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:54.454
Miss Remon?

00:20:56.123 --> 00:20:57.758
This is so strange.

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.360
I've never eaten this before...

00:21:01.161 --> 00:21:04.298
...but it tastes so nostalgic.

00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:07.201
(soft music)

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.041
Big Bro!

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.213
Listen, I've been
doing some thinking.

00:21:22.382 --> 00:21:25.252
I still don't get, what it
means to understand stuff

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.620
without putting it into words,

00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:29.823
But you know Big Bro, I kinda
think of you as my cool,

00:21:29.857 --> 00:21:32.426
trusty older brother, ya know!

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:33.627
Boruto!

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.563
Well, I guess your Ninja
Way will be your girlfriend

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.098
for a long time!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.733
What? Hey, Boruto!

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:43.604
(soft music)

00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:55.482
Super sour!

00:22:03.857 --> 00:22:06.226
Hey, it really is sour.

00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:13.767
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:32.352
(Singing in Japanese)

00:23:43.123 --> 00:23:46.260
When is Sasuke
gonna help me train?

00:23:46.293 --> 00:23:48.395
You mean that you still
haven't heard from him?

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:50.497
You did ask him to
train you, right?

00:23:50.531 --> 00:23:53.367
You really think my dad
is gonna keep his promise?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.069
Although, if he had the
time, I wish he'd come by.

00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:58.305
Is that? It's Sasuke's hawk!

00:23:58.338 --> 00:23:59.506
He replied!

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.809
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:04.978
"With Sasuke As the Goal"

00:24:05.012 --> 00:24:06.380
Please wait there, Sasuke!

00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:08.582
I'm gonna come and
see you right away!

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:14.221
