00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.343
[Hinata] A birthday party?

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.511
Well, yeah!

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.479
Father's birthday's gonna
be coming up soon, isn't it?

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.215
He hasn't been able to see his
sweet lil' grandkids lately,

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.950
so he's feeling lonely.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.685
Even though he'd never say it.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.554
(calm music)

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.756
(groaning)

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.426
(sighing)

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.229
[Hiashi] My sweet
Boruto and Himawari...

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.001
Your grandpa misses you so much!

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.270
-(chuckling)
-Oh yeah, that's right.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.672
Boruto didn't go camping
with us last time.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.806
Exactly!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.275
So I'm really counting on you

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.344
to recruit everyone
for this party, Hinata!

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.947
Oh! And I think he'll
be even happier

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.950
if his grandkids both
get him a surprise gift.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.186
-(chuckling)
-(calm music)

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.222
(Naruto humming)

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.390
[Naruto] A birthday
party sounds great!

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.525
I'll see what I can
do to get the day off.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.763
I just can't wait to go to
Grandpa's to visit again!

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.865
Grandpa Hiashi's birthday, huh?

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.533
Man, I totally
forgot about that.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:10.404
Boruto, you really gotta try
to remember these things.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:13.473
But I thought that you'd
forgotten about it as well.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:15.509
(gasping)

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.811
Although, goin' over
to Grandpa's place

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.813
is always so intense.

00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:21.348
Does he have to get so clingy

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.350
and huggy with us all the time?

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.251
Well, actually,

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.353
when Grandpa gets angry,
he's really scary!

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.354
Come on.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.756
I find that seriously
hard to believe.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.959
I've never seen
him get like that.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.760
Anyway, since we'll
be going over there,

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:35.963
I want you to get
Grandpa a present.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.731
That goes for the both of you.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:38.765
Okay!

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.735
I wonder what he'd like...

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.972
(chomping)

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.407
[Boruto Voiceover]
Present for Grandpa, huh?

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.443
I wonder what would
make him happy?

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:55.449
-(opening theme music)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:25.038
-(opening theme music)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.081
Oh?

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:35.449
A present for your
grandfather, huh?

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.351
I kinda feel like that
should be something

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.119
you come up with by yourself.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:42.089
I know, I tried to, but
absolutely nothing came to mind!

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:43.957
That's why I'm asking you guys!

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.192
Let's see.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.594
He's the head of the
Hyuga Clan's main family,

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:48.829
isn't that right?

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:50.597
Are the Hyuga strong?

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:52.232
Why don't you know that already?

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.835
You're a ninja of the Hidden
Leaf Village, aren't you?

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.203
I think it's safe to say

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.638
that they're amongst
the most famous

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.407
and influential of all of
the ninja in the village.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.208
Yeah.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.342
You know, they always say

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.711
the Hyuga are the
strongest in the Leaf.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:05.812
(humming)

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.214
And what makes
them the strongest?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.816
Well, it's gotta be their
Byakugan, of course!

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.351
It increases the
scope of their vision,

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:13.687
gives them the ability
to see through things,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.222
and lets them use Gentle Fist.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.090
It's an offensive
and defensive art

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.860
that only the Hyuga
are able to master.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:21.495
Look, forget about all that!

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.497
Isn't my grandpa known
for something he likes?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.532
Something that'll help
me choose a present?

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.501
Come on, Boruto,
if his own grandson

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.203
doesn't know that kind
of thing about him,

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:30.938
then how would we know?

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:32.840
[Boruto] Yeah, I
guess you're right.

00:04:32.873 --> 00:04:35.475
Wouldn't it be faster to
just ask your parents?

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.978
They're both having way
too much fun with this.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.146
They keep telling me

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:41.481
to go and figure it out
yourself for a change.

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.116
-(Sarada chuckling)
-[Sarada] That's what you get

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.285
for always being so oblivious
about these kinds of things.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.086
(groaning)

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.488
Fine. If that's the case...

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.824
Mitsuki, come along
with me for a bit.

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:52.559
-(gasping)
-(groaning)

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.698
(birds chirping)

00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.233
(footsteps tapping)

00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:04.204
-(chuckling)
-So far so good!

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:06.640
Hey, why didn't we simply
enter through the front door?

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.209
Because it's gonna be
a big pain in the neck

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:10.777
if we get found out here.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.346
Not just 'cause of
my doting grandpa,

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.548
but 'cause of Big
Sister Hanabi, too.

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:15.716
[Hanabi] Oh?

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.718
(groaning)

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.720
Who's a big pain
in the neck, now?

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:20.821
Huh?

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:22.823
[Boruto] Oh, Big Sister Hanabi!

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.391
Pardon us.

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:25.292
(chuckling)

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.960
[Hanabi] Trying to
sneak into the house

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.495
of a clan with the Byakugan?

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.098
There's no way you
could pull that off.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.267
[Boruto] I know,
I wasn't thinking.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.068
Although, I understand
your dilemma

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:37.070
about finding a present.

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:38.805
Honestly, even I
don't really know

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.974
what to get my father
for his birthday.

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.209
Seriously?

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:44.845
Even you don't know,
Big Sister Hanabi?

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:46.313
Oh man, I give up.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.347
'Scuse me.

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.515
You're Boruto's
aunt, aren't you?

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:51.318
So why does he call
you his big sister?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.719
Hey, Mitsuki!

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:54.755
Yes, I am his big sister.

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:57.791
-(humming)
-(nervous laughing)

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.193
Look, Father's at
home right now,

00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:00.727
so why don't I just go ahead

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:03.330
and ask him what
he wants from you?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.331
No, that's okay.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.133
I mean, if he finds out
that I'm here right now,

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:09.102
he'll just rush in and get
all mushy with me again.

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:10.504
Yeah, you're probably right.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.306
And that certainly would
be really embarrassing

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.274
in front of your
friend, wouldn't it?

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:15.108
(laughing)

00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:16.577
[Boruto] Man, when
is he gonna stop

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.545
smothering his grandkids?

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:19.580
[Gatai] Excuse me!

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.182
I said excuse me!

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.484
My name's Gatai.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:26.954
I'm from the Village
Hidden in the Cloud.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:29.089
I'm here to challenge
the celebrated head

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:30.524
of the Hyuga Main Family,

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.694
touted to be the strongest
in the Hidden Leaf.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.296
(grunting)

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.231
(thudding)

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:39.099
If you call yourself
the strongest,

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.035
then come out here and
accept my challenge.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.570
[Boruto] Old school
guys like that

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:45.572
still exist these days?

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:46.573
[Mitsuki] A has-been shinobi

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.809
who wants to prove his strength?

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.110
(sighing)

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.813
Sometimes we get guys like
him with the wrong idea.

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:54.181
But picking a
fight with Grandpa?

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.116
This guy doesn't know
what's gonna hit him!

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.718
Is your grandfather strong?

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.086
He's the head of the house!

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:00.320
That isn't just for show.

00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:02.823
That guy'll be a piece
of cake for my grandpa--

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:04.725
[Hiashi] Hey, Hanabi!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:05.993
Are you here?

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:07.427
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:09.530
Not good!

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:12.466
[Hiashi] Sorry, but can you
take care of this like usual?

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.467
Yup.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.701
Sure, father!

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:15.736
[Boruto] Huh?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.704
Wait, what?

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:19.940
The head of the family's away?

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:21.275
That's right.

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:23.076
Unfortunately, he's out of
the village at the moment.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.379
I'm really sorry that you
traveled so far for nothing,

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.948
but please, it's time for
you to take your leave.

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.983
Sorry, but I don't believe you.

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:31.952
Fighting you won't be the same.

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:33.954
Bring me Hiashi Hyuga.

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.089
I'm afraid I can't get
someone who's not here.

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:37.958
(chuckling)
Oh, I get it.

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:39.593
So he's afraid of fighting me!

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.595
Is that what's going on here?

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:44.731
If he's gonna run
away from a challenge,

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:46.867
then I count that as my victory.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.303
Strongest in the
Leaf, what a joke!

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:51.405
(laughing)

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.674
(laughing)

00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:54.808
(growling)

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:57.077
I should throw down salt
to purify this spot.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:58.912
I just don't get it.

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:00.814
Why would Grandpa pretend
to be out, anyway?

00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:02.950
He should've defeated that guy!

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.017
Who knows.

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:05.719
Whenever guys like
that come by here,

00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:07.087
we handle it this way.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.555
[Boruto] Every time?

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:09.723
Maybe that guy was right.

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.426
Maybe your grandfather's
really weak.

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:13.393
What, no way!

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:16.063
He's even stronger than
Big Sister Hanabi is!

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:20.133
Aw man, now I'm even more
confused about Grandpa.

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.702
[Mitsuki] Boruto, wait up.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.706
Well, maybe Boruto's
too young to understand.

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:29.076
(door shutting)

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:32.079
Okay, I sent those
guys away like usual.

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:33.514
[Hiashi] I'm sorry
for the trouble.

00:08:33.547 --> 00:08:35.382
[Hanabi] No, it's
an easy enough task.

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:38.585
I know you have your reasons
for doing things this way.

00:08:38.619 --> 00:08:40.020
(Hiashi sighing)

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:44.124
It's easy to use force
to settle issues.

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:46.960
But when I say the Hyuga's
the strongest in the Leaf,

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:49.796
that's not the kind
of strength I mean.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.367
I just wish I'd been able
to realize the truth sooner.

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:03.977
Uh, Father?

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.579
[Hiashi] It's nothing.

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:08.815
[Boruto] Damn it!

00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.117
He should've just
confronted that jerk

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.252
and put him in his
place, you know?

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:15.122
Well, maybe your
grandfather's just a kind man.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:17.691
He sure is soft on
me and Himawari.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:18.825
But everyone talks about

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:21.061
how he was super
strict in the past.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:23.830
Then perhaps something happened

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:25.832
that triggered a change in him.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.100
A change?

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:28.468
[Mitsuki] If you
figure that out,

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:32.406
maybe you'll get an idea of
what present you should get him.

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:33.540
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:35.843
And I think I know just the
person who can tell me--

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.110
[Gatai] Hey, move!

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:38.679
You're in my seat!

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:39.680
(grunting)

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:40.948
Hey, what's your problem?

00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.216
Just shut up!

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.951
Or are you a tough guy?

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.353
I'm the man who
defeated Hiashi Hyuga,

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.422
-the strongest in the Leaf!
-Sorry!

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:50.958
(Gatai laughing)

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.125
[Gatai's Follower]
The Hyuga Clan

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.628
turned out to be pretty
weak, didn't they?

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.232
I guess that Hiashi Hyuga was
just terrified of facing me,

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.834
so he pretended to
be away from home.

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.603
Man, how far Leaf
Shinobi have fallen

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:05.706
for a coward like that to
claim to be the strongest.

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:08.809
(laughing)

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:11.411
That bastard, I can't take this!

00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:12.446
(laughing)

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:13.714
Hey, you!

00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:15.215
Yeah, what do you want, kid?

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:18.819
I'm the grandson of Hiashi
Hyuga, the man you insulted.

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:20.787
The daughter, now the grandson?

00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:24.424
He sure is good at using
children to shield himself.

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.226
(laughing)

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.595
You guys oughta
just shut up now.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:29.830
All right, then!

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:31.632
I'll take you on
in Grandpa's place!

00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:36.837
(laughing)

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.540
It's too late to
back out now, kid.

00:10:39.573 --> 00:10:43.143
(scoffing) You just took the
words right out of my mouth.

00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:44.578
(knuckles cracking)

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.413
All right, fine then.

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:49.449
Lightning Style:
Pulverizing Lightning Rod!

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.718
(electricity zapping)

00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:53.720
(yelling)

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:54.922
(thudding)

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.524
(grunting)

00:10:57.558 --> 00:10:58.525
(growling)

00:10:58.559 --> 00:10:59.760
(chuckling)

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:04.665
Is running away all you can do?

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:07.568
You may talk big, but
you're really just a joke!

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.569
Oh yeah?

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:10.604
(grunting)

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:14.808
What's the matter?

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:16.176
If this is all you've got,

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.378
you're no match for
Big Sister Hanabi.

00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:19.580
(growling)

00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:22.182
Now you've made me mad, kid.

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:23.784
(electricity zapping)

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:25.986
(yelling)

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.054
(booming)

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:29.122
-(wood snapping)
-(thudding)

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:31.258
He's causing so much damage...

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.726
(growling)

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:34.995
(electricity zapping)

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:35.996
(growling)

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.931
He's lost it!

00:11:37.965 --> 00:11:39.867
I've got no choice.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.369
(air whooshing)

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:43.570
Rasengan!

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:45.439
(growling)

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:48.141
(air whooshing)

00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:56.483
Eight Trigrams: Palm Rotation.

00:11:57.351 --> 00:11:58.785
(gasping)

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:00.320
(groaning)

00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:01.121
Grandpa!

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:02.589
What are you doing down here?

00:12:02.623 --> 00:12:05.158
I heard that someone
using the Hyuga name

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:07.594
had gotten involved in a duel.

00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:08.762
That won't stand.

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:12.165
[Gatai] Hiashi Hyuga?

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:14.568
You dare turn down
my challenge earlier?

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:18.105
My lack of foresight led my
grandchild to act rashly.

00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:21.775
However, if you still insist
on having a duel with me,

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:24.311
I'm willing to accept
your challenge.

00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:25.379
What'll it be?

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.781
(booming)

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:29.116
Uh, no, that's okay.

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:31.385
I think I'm good.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.487
(grunting)

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.889
(whimpering)

00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:37.858
[Boruto] That was
amazing, Grandpa!

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:39.393
(sighing)

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.028
It wasn't amazing.

00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:43.931
Using power and fear
to settle things

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:46.066
is never the best answer.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.434
It breeds tragedy

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:50.871
and leaves behind enmity
that can never be resolved.

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:52.272
But why?

00:12:52.306 --> 00:12:54.675
Why do things that can be
interpreted as weakness?

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:58.612
I couldn't stand that they were
making fun of you, Grandpa!

00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:00.147
(sighing)

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.382
Look, just ignore them.

00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:05.953
Things like that won't make
the powerful Hyuga Clan waiver.

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:07.120
I don't have any idea

00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:09.890
what you're even
talking about, Grandpa.

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.124
Boruto...

00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:14.461
No, I have no high ground.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.697
It would be arrogant
to lecture you.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.299
Long ago, I lived a
completely different life

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:22.636
until the day I learned
how to change myself.

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:23.837
Huh?

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.440
If you learned it,
then who taught you?

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.041
That's all in the past.

00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:31.144
One day, I'm sure that
you'll understand as well.

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:33.247
Wait, what?

00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:39.186
Your grandfather
must be very strong.

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:42.923
He held back perfectly so he
wouldn't hurt either of you.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:44.124
Mitsuki!

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.392
If you were watching,

00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:47.528
you could have told me
when my Grandpa got here!

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:50.130
But now I'm even more
confused than ever.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.066
I mean, why doesn't my
Grandpa like using his power

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.835
if he's that strong?

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:55.903
(footsteps tapping)

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.471
Oh, Boruto?

00:13:58.539 --> 00:13:59.640
Miss Mirai!

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:01.975
I heard that some shinobi
were fighting around here.

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:03.544
Do you know what's going on?

00:14:03.577 --> 00:14:04.578
Don't tell me it was you!

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:07.514
Oh no, it was all just
a misunderstanding!

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:08.715
Seriously?

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:11.118
You weren't pulling some kind
of prank again, were you?

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.753
No way, I wasn't!

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:13.987
Right?

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.190
Whatever.

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:18.258
Anyway, I'm always
hearing from my mom

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.726
that Hinata's
constantly worrying

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.796
about all the trouble that you
keep getting yourself into.

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.464
Well that was uncalled for.

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:26.500
Are your mothers
close to each other?

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.401
Yeah, of course.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.436
Back in the day,
Mirai's mother, Kurenai,

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:32.172
was the captain of the
team my mom was on.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:33.173
Ah.

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.542
Then she must know all
about the Hyuga Clan.

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:36.910
Why don't you go ask her?

00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:39.379
Yeah! Hey, you're pretty
sharp, Mitsuki!

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:40.447
Huh?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.382
What are you two
guys talking about?

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.253
Oh, I see.

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.922
After hearing that, I
kind of have an idea.

00:14:48.956 --> 00:14:49.923
Really?

00:14:49.957 --> 00:14:51.391
But I'm not entirely sure

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:53.927
if it's okay for me
to be telling you.

00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:57.564
It involves internal
family affairs.

00:14:57.598 --> 00:15:00.901
Uh, we'll leave the two of
you alone for a little while.

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:04.104
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:10.777
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:10.811 --> 00:15:11.979
Thank you.

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:13.914
I really want to learn
everything that I can

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:15.449
about all this stuff.

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:18.585
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:19.786
You know the Hyuga Clan

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.856
is split into the main and
side branch families, right?

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.458
Long ago, both
families were bound

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.727
by a strict tradition
of subjugation

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.662
when an incident occurred.

00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:30.197
Oh yeah, right.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.165
I heard some about that before.

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:36.036
The way Mr. Hiashi
lives his life now

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.839
is rooted in when his twin
brother from the side-branch

00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:41.475
sacrificed himself
for the main family.

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:42.976
[Boruto] What?

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.845
It was all to take
the responsibility

00:15:44.878 --> 00:15:47.648
for a conflict with
another village.

00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:49.883
Hiashi or Hizashi.

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:52.085
One of the brothers had to die.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.754
What?

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.022
Don't tell me...

00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:57.891
Hizashi willingly
sacrificed himself

00:15:57.925 --> 00:16:00.661
in order to avoid a
war, and in doing so,

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:04.064
he took the place of Hiashi,
the head of the clan.

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:05.532
[Boruto] But that's...

00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:07.634
[Kurenai] It was all
for the Hyuga Clan,

00:16:07.668 --> 00:16:09.503
and ultimately, the Leaf.

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:12.272
As if compensating for his
younger brother's death,

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:14.441
Mr. Hiashi hardened his heart

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.376
and became an
authoritarian leader.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:21.048
[Boruto] So, that's why Grandpa
was so strict in the past.

00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:24.051
But Mr. Hiashi came
to regret that.

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:26.920
Ultimately, being a
stern disciplinarian

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:29.690
ended up making life
very painful for many.

00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.759
Including Hinata and Neji.

00:16:33.894 --> 00:16:36.396
No wonder Grandpa
said that earlier...

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.799
Using power and fear
to settle things

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.434
is never the best answer.

00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:43.504
But don't be worried.

00:16:43.537 --> 00:16:46.073
The Hyuga have changed
a lot since then.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.408
The devoted and
loving grandfather

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:51.645
that you've come to know
so well is the real Hiashi

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:55.015
that he struggled to keep
suppressed for so long.

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:58.185
(somber music)

00:16:58.218 --> 00:17:00.787
So that's the real reason...

00:17:00.821 --> 00:17:04.358
Try to cut him a little slack
from time to time, okay?

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:05.325
(chuckling)

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.195
Well, I promise
I'll try, you know?

00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:10.130
Have you finished
with your talk?

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:12.933
Does this mean that your
mission has been accomplished?

00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:15.035
Yeah, the mystery's cleared up!

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:16.637
Oh no, hold on!

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.372
The gift, the gift!

00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:20.741
I still haven't figured
that out at all!

00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:21.909
(chuckling)

00:17:21.942 --> 00:17:23.777
So I guess you're back
to square one, huh?

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.179
Oh man!

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:26.847
After learning about
all that stuff,

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.115
I'm even more confused

00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:30.284
about what I ought to
get him for his birthday!

00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:31.485
(laughing)

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:34.188
You really don't need to think
about it as hard as that.

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.322
Huh?

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:37.324
It's not like it's so
important to your grandfather

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:39.259
for you to know about
the past, right?

00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:41.261
[Boruto] That's true, but...

00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:43.330
I'm sure that he
considers the time

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:45.465
he gets to spend with
you in the present

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:47.601
to be the most
priceless gift of all.

00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:51.305
He's finally found happiness
filled with calm and peace.

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:54.274
The time he gets to spend
with us in the present?

00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:57.711
(gasping)

00:17:57.744 --> 00:17:59.479
[All] Happy birthday!

00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:01.715
(confetti poppers popping)

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.218
(chuckling)

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:08.722
Both of the kids got you
birthday presents, Father.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:09.990
(giggling)

00:18:10.023 --> 00:18:11.225
This is for you!

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.360
For me, really?

00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:15.429
Thank you.

00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:18.265
Mommy and I picked it out
especially for you, Grandpa.

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:20.734
(wrapping paper rustling)

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.736
[Hiashi] Oh, this is...

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.104
It's so you don't get sick

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:26.707
and stay warm and
healthy forever.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.841
Oh, how sweet!

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.476
Brings a tear to your eye!

00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:32.913
(chuckling)

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.015
I'll wear it and
cherish it always.

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:36.183
(laughing)

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.352
You have a present
for him too, right?

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:39.553
Sorta, yeah.

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:42.923
Hey Grandpa, can you come
out to the garden for a sec?

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.057
The garden?

00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:46.927
Whoa, is your present
really that big?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.328
No, of course not.

00:18:48.362 --> 00:18:51.098
It's a gift we're gonna
make together now, you know?

00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:53.901
[Himawari] Oh!

00:18:53.934 --> 00:18:55.402
A picture to celebrate!

00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:57.704
My, this is--

00:18:57.738 --> 00:19:00.174
Wow, this is a
really great idea.

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:03.577
We haven't taken a
family photo in forever!

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.778
But Boruto,

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.848
I thought that you always
hated taking pictures with me.

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:08.849
(Himawari giggling)

00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:10.017
That's 'cause you always tried

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.718
to squish your
face against mine.

00:19:11.752 --> 00:19:12.886
But I just figured

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.489
that something like
this is super important!

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:18.592
We're a family, you know,

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.928
so it's important for
us to leave a record

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:23.197
that we're happy and
doing well, right?

00:19:23.797 --> 00:19:24.798
(gasping)

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.133
Boruto...

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.368
Let's take a family picture
like this every year!

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:31.905
Until I become the Leaf's
strongest, most amazing Shinobi!

00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:35.108
(whimpering)

00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:36.777
I'm glad, Boruto!

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.779
This is a wonderful present!

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:39.913
No wait, please!

00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:40.914
Anything but that, okay?

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:42.115
[Hiashi] Boruto!

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:44.585
[Boruto] Dad, come
on, help me out here!

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:46.587
Grandpa's gonna smush my face!

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.623
(Himawari giggling)

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.759
Okay, lineup, it's picture time.

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:55.429
Say cheese!

00:19:56.563 --> 00:19:59.433
(camera clicking)

00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:06.240
[Hiashi] You didn't put that
idea in his head, did you?

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.277
[Naruto] No, I didn't
do anything at all.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.447
I'm pretty sure he came
up with it on his own.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.115
Oh, I see.

00:20:15.148 --> 00:20:17.451
In the past, I believed
that harsh discipline

00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:19.453
and a stern attitude
bred strength.

00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:21.889
I thought that it would
help protect the clan

00:20:21.922 --> 00:20:23.257
and the village.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.125
If things had remained the same,

00:20:25.158 --> 00:20:27.794
tragedies like Hizashi and
Neji would have continued,

00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:31.164
and ultimately would have
destroyed the Hyuga Clan.

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:34.768
But things are
completely different now,

00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:37.371
and all of it is
thanks to you, Naruto.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:38.906
You changed it.

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:40.374
Father, I...

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.576
[Hiashi] It's because
you confronted Neji

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:45.012
with truth and sincerity.

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:47.314
It's hard to admit
that, but at least

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:50.551
I was able to come to an
understanding with him.

00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:54.521
Just as you said you would
long ago, you changed me,

00:20:54.555 --> 00:20:58.792
you changed Neji, and you
change the whole Hyuga Clan.

00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:02.062
(somber music)

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.097
It was really you, Father.

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:06.600
You were the one
that changed it.

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.336
(sighing)

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:12.372
Thanks to you, I'm surrounded
by a new family now,

00:21:12.406 --> 00:21:16.043
and I get to experience
happy memories with them.

00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:18.846
I'm blessed beyond
my wildest dreams.

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:21.715
(uplifting music)

00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:25.018
[Sarada] So what did you end
up giving him for a present?

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:27.321
[Boruto] Come on, forget
about that already.

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:30.324
But your grandfather
was happy, wasn't he?

00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:32.726
The thing is, he
wasn't just happy,

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:34.027
he was overjoyed.

00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:35.529
(gasping)

00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:36.864
Oh, Boruto!

00:21:36.897 --> 00:21:38.599
What perfect timing!

00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:39.733
Why are you here?

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:42.503
I just came by so we could
spend some time together!

00:21:42.536 --> 00:21:43.670
So, how have you been?

00:21:43.704 --> 00:21:44.671
How have I been?

00:21:44.705 --> 00:21:45.839
You just saw me yesterday!

00:21:45.873 --> 00:21:47.207
Oh, so what?
This is fine!

00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:48.976
No, it's not fine,
Grandpa, stop it!

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:50.277
Hey, come on now!

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.514
That's what you'd call
being overly overjoyed.

00:21:53.547 --> 00:21:57.451
Yes, but I have to say
I'm a little bit jealous.

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.587
Hey, stop, put me down,
Grandpa, this is embarrassing!

00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:03.490
(camera clicking)

00:22:10.964 --> 00:22:13.634
(closing theme music)

00:22:23.143 --> 00:22:27.214
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:42.022 --> 00:23:43.123
(intense music)

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:46.527
Hey, how's Team 40 doing
these days, anyway?

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.695
[Enko Onikuma] Our mission
success rate's getting better!

00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:50.063
But I'm afraid that I haven't

00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:52.866
been able to control my
arm strength very well.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.268
[Sarada] You mean
the Secret Jutsu

00:23:54.301 --> 00:23:56.837
that's been passed down
in your clan, right Enko?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.305
If it's going out of control,

00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:00.774
maybe it means that your
summoning's power is growing?

00:24:00.807 --> 00:24:04.044
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.077 --> 00:24:06.146
The Terror Enko Onikuma.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.714
[Enko Onikuma] If this keeps up,

00:24:07.748 --> 00:24:09.516
Tsuru and Doushu'll leave me!

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:15.556
(closing theme music)
