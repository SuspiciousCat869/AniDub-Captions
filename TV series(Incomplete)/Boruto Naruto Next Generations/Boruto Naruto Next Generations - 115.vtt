(Opening Theme Music)

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:26.393
(singer singing in Japanese)

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:40.000
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.078
(birds chirping)

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.682
(marker squeaking)

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.690
-(door creaking)
-Hm?

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:04.691
(door thudding)

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:05.859
(footsteps thudding)

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:07.094
Lord Sixth!

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:08.996
[Kakashi] What?

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.531
Are you really
the only one here?

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:13.100
There's no one in the
other rooms either.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.836
Everyone's out investigating
the bomb threat.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.838
[Kakashi] Oh, you mean
that warning letter?

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.474
So it wasn't just a
prank of some kind?

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:23.110
We're not sure either, but
we can't just ignore it.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.811
Everyone's focused on that now,

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.214
so all other work
has come to a halt.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.254
[Kakashi] What's this?

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:36.089
A complaint about Team 25

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:38.425
from the post office
they were assigned to?

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:42.729
Huh, should I go
and look into this?

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:45.365
You sure that's okay?

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.368
I mean, you're the
retired Sixth Hokage!

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:49.770
[Kakashi] I'll
figure something out.

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:52.906
And besides, I have a little
time on my hands right now.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.542
It'll do me some good to
move around, you know?

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:59.346
(energetic electronic music)

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.482
(clothes rustling)

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.055
All right.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.724
Excuse me?

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:14.361
(rabbit puppet grunting)

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.836
[Houki] Hako, what
are you doing?

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.439
I told you to clean
up over here first!

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:26.573
Oh yeah.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:27.407
But, uh-

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:29.109
[Houki] It's a
problem if you don't

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.978
do things according to plan!

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.380
Hey, Houki, move your
hands, not your lips!

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:36.216
We've still got some packages
that need to be organized!

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.785
[Houki] (groaning)
But Hako won't listen!

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.556
Renga, it's dangerous to
have them stacked that high!

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.458
[Renga] Oh, it's fine!

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.326
Oh, oh, oh, whoa!

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.728
Oh, oh!

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.464
Oh, whoa, oh!

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.399
(boxes crashing)

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.400
(Houki yelping)

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.368
[Houki] You see?

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.569
I told you!

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.804
You gotta do things my way!

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:00.174
What is going on?

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.748
(machinery banging)

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.658
How many times does this
make it now, anyway?

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:18.825
The fifth.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.294
[Houki] Hako!

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:21.094
What's that?

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:23.063
[Houki] We're sorry, sir!

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.965
Hako, apologize!

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.200
I'm sorry, sir.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.534
[Houki] Renga, you too!

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:29.069
Yeah, really sorry, sir.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.305
[Clerk] Seriously,
if you mess up again,

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:33.640
I'm going to have to
ask for different genin

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:35.108
to be assigned here!

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:38.212
(clerk grumbling)

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.583
[Houki] Keep your mouth
shut next time, Hako!

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.352
But he asked how many
times it's been, didn't he?

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.188
[Houki] Aw, man,
that's not the issue!

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:49.523
[Renga] Yeah, well,
it's your fault

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:52.192
for giving us bad directions
in the first place!

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:54.228
[Houki] Huh? My fault?

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:58.398
Look, Houki, I don't
get your orders.

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.134
Yeah, the orders that you
give us are frankly just bad,

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:03.370
so we end up doing
things our own way.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.105
[Houki] What do
you mean by that?

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.674
The real problem is that
you two don't do things

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:09.476
the way that I tell you to!

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.945
[Renga] (groaning)
Fine, whatever!

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.947
Houki, you be careful too.

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.282
[Houki] Huh, me?

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.717
Aw, man!

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.318
What the hell?

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.821
[Sukea] Hey, you got a minute?

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:22.055
[Houki] Huh?

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.492
Hey, aren't you that
guy who was conducting

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:29.129
career interviews during the
Academy graduation exams?

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.431
You're that
journalist, Mr. Sukea!

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.368
I'm impressed that
you remembered.

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:37.538
[Houki] Oh, yeah, I actually
have a really good memory!

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.040
So what are you doing here?

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.343
Oh, uh, Lord Hokage just
asked me to take a quick look

00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:46.113
to see how Team 25's
doing on their mission.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:48.615
[Houki] (sighing) Oh, I see.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:52.586
Anyway, would you mind
talking to me a bit?

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:55.756
(gentle upbeat music)

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:58.592
Thank you for your time.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.227
Uh, you're?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.863
[Houki] Oh, Houki Taketori.

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:05.232
I saw all three of you
guys working back there.

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.802
Is that the way that things
usually go with those other two?

00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:10.170
[Houki] Uh, yeah.

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:14.208
Hm, well, anyway, you
know, what you're wearing

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.310
kinda reminds me
of somebody else.

00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:18.378
[Houki] (chuckling)
Is it that obvious?

00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:21.114
Ever since I was a kid
and I first saw him,

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:23.317
I've been a big
fan of Lord Sixth!

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:27.721
Was Lord Sixth really so
amazing to merit that?

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:28.922
[Houki] Oh!

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.591
A sharp intellect
and calm disposition,

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:31.792
feared by the other Villages,

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:34.962
the one who nurtured Lord
Seventh, who saved the world!

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:39.099
The genius ninja, Lord
Sixth, Kakashi Hatake!

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.969
Any way you look at it,
he's the perfect ninja!

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:43.804
I guess that I can't
really complain

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.706
about that much praise!

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.341
[Houki] Huh? Oh, no, sorry.

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:49.243
I wasn't talking
about you, Mr. Sukea,

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:50.811
I was talking about Lord Sixth!

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:53.814
Uh, oh, right, yes, of course!

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.082
[Houki] Someday, I wanna become

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:57.251
a perfect ninja just like him!

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:58.986
Although I guess that's kind of

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:00.487
an overambitious goal for me.

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:02.990
So that's why you're starting
with the way you look?

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:04.124
(Houki chuckling nervously)

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.860
Hm, well, if that's
what you want,

00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:08.228
then you've gotta
pull your comrades

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:09.730
together on this mission.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:12.332
[Houki] Huh?

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.401
What exactly is
the problem anyway?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:18.972
[Houki] Uh, well, you see,
we keep on messing up.

00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:21.642
So now all that we've been
getting assigned lately

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.810
are D-rank missions.

00:07:23.844 --> 00:07:26.079
[Sukea] Who's your
jonin in charge?

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:28.115
[Houki] Our jonin got
injured on another mission

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:30.184
and is recuperating for a while.

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.186
No one wants to fill in

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.521
since our team only
gets D-rank missions,

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:37.391
and the labor shortage
hasn't been helping.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:40.093
That's why I've taken
charge of the team.

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:44.097
I'm trying my best, but my
team just doesn't get it.

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:48.168
Hako's a kunoichi
who uses puppets,

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:51.038
she always just goes off
and does her own thing.

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:54.842
Renga only believes
in brute strength.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.845
They're both just so selfish!

00:07:57.878 --> 00:07:58.979
(footsteps thundering)

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:00.480
[Sukea] Hm?

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.983
[Boruto] Hey, quickly,
which packages are scheduled

00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:04.852
to be delivered
by two p. m. today?

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.221
Uh, wait, who are you guys?

00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:09.423
We're here investigating
the bomb threat!

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:10.457
Please help us!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.658
Which packages?

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:12.826
What was that?

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.495
Uh, the packages for that
delivery window are over there!

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:18.966
-(footsteps thundering)
-(energetic rock music)

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.968
(both grunting)

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:21.935
(Boruto gasping)

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:22.936
(dramatic whooshing)

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.404
Found it! That one!

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.577
(both gasping)

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.347
(timer beeping)

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:46.593
(timer warbling)

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:48.996
(both sighing)

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.597
[Houki] Boruto!

00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:53.700
(footsteps thundering)

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:56.103
Hey, you're Houki!

00:08:56.136 --> 00:09:01.308
-(people chattering worriedly)
-(tense music)

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.978
-I'm just not sure.
-I don't know.

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:09.116
(people whispering worriedly)

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:10.484
[Boruto] So are you guys here

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:12.920
investigating the
bomb threat too?

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:14.988
Unfortunately, we aren't.

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:16.123
What's going on?

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:18.225
Nobody told us
about this mission.

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:20.227
Are you saying that a
bomber's been sending

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.596
explosive devices
through the mail?

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:24.231
Yes, that's right.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:25.933
Hey, wait, Mr. Sukea?

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.334
[Sukea] Long time no see!

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.236
[Houki] Boruto, Sarada,
how did you know

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:31.238
that the bomb was
in that package?

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:32.439
Well-

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:34.641
During the investigation, we
managed to find his hideout.

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.978
The perp was using
specific delivery windows

00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:40.447
in order to mail
out his time bombs.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.381
Yes, I see.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:43.717
So that's how he was
planning to set off

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.452
his explosive
devices at the times

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:47.721
and locations of
his choosing, huh?

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.122
That bomb just now?

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:52.192
It had been programmed to
detonate at one p. m. today.

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:54.328
But how were you guys
even able to tell

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.096
which package was the bomb?

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.198
At the hideout, we
found wrapping paper

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:01.001
in addition to a note
about the delivery times.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.303
He left behind some
really obvious clues.

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:06.073
So does that mean you captured
the one behind all this?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.208
[Boruto] We almost had
him, but he got away.

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:10.077
Shikadai, Iwabe, and the others

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.579
are out pursuing him right now.

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:14.081
[Houki] Iwabe and the others?

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.717
[Sarada] Yeah, all the
genin have been mobilized.

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.219
[Houki] I see.

00:10:19.253 --> 00:10:22.456
Ah ha, so this is where you are!

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:25.692
It seems that we're
done for the day

00:10:25.726 --> 00:10:27.294
Is that why you've come?

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:28.328
Hm?

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:30.797
Uh, yes, but how
did you know that?

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.966
[Hako] You kept
looking at your watch.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.768
(yelping) Just from that?

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.437
You've also been fighting
with your wife, haven't you?

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.373
You'd better make up
with her pretty soon

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:42.109
so that you can get that
shirt of yours ironed, sir.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.545
But how? How did
you know all of that?

00:10:44.578 --> 00:10:47.114
Uh, anyway, as a precaution,

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:50.050
we've stopped accepting any
more packages for today.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:52.853
We were supposed
to start processing

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:56.723
the afternoon deliveries but
there's no work left to do now.

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.660
(gentle somber music)

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:02.963
[Renga] What about the packages
that we already sorted?

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.365
[Clerk] They'll be
delivered like normal.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.267
(sighing) I wish that
we could get back

00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:09.336
to business as usual already!

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:12.206
Don't worry, we'll capture
the perp as soon as we can!

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:13.974
So hang tight for a bit, 'kay?

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.577
Well, I'm counting on
you to do just that!

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.478
Anyway, I'm very grateful
that you've managed

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:21.248
to prevent the perp from
causing any harm so far.

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:25.219
As is to be expected, Leaf
Shinobi are exceptional!

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:29.690
(footsteps thundering)

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:39.066
(Houki sighing)

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:51.044
[Houki] You're okay just
going home like this?

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:52.946
We're the only ones
who were left out

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.182
of this whole investigation!

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.951
Don't you guys feel frustrated?

00:11:57.985 --> 00:12:00.087
I don't think there's
anything we can do.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.355
Well, what do you expect?

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.190
We don't know what
we're working toward!

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.492
How are we supposed to give
it everything we've got?

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:08.228
[Houki] (groaning) Give up on
yourselves and you're done!

00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:12.099
Optimism isn't the answer
to all of our problems!

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:14.401
Forget it, I can't
listen to this.

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:15.435
Bye!

00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:20.941
Maybe it'd be best if
we disbanded for now.

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:23.377
(Houki gasping)

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.411
(Houki grumbling)

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:26.513
[Houki] Damn it!

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.217
Well, that was heated.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.353
I gotta say, genin these
days are quite exceptional.

00:12:33.387 --> 00:12:35.289
Huh?

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.591
I mean, your former classmates
are currently out there

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:40.060
investigating the bomb
threat, aren't they?

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.728
I think that's amazing!

00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:45.065
[Houki] Maybe, but I don't
wanna just take a backseat

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.367
to Boruto and all of the others.

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:50.437
Well, at the same
time, I have to wonder

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.673
why your team wasn't
also assigned to

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:53.707
investigate this case.

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:57.544
Anyway, we're all
useful in our own way.

00:12:57.578 --> 00:13:00.280
You guys should just do your
best in missions that suit-

00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:02.082
[Houki] I wanna become
a perfect ninja,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.383
just like Lord Sixth!

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:04.618
[Sukea] Hm?

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:07.287
[Houki] But no matter how hard
I try to get them to listen,

00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:10.457
Hako and Renga won't do
things the way I want!

00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:13.894
Perhaps that's because
you aren't taking

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:16.063
their feelings
into consideration?

00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.064
[Houki] Huh?

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:18.365
But that's, uh...

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:20.801
I've been thinking
about those two.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:23.136
Hako's really
pretty interesting.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.439
For example, the way she
figured out that clerk

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.574
had a fight with his
wife, just like that!

00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:29.309
And the strength that
your other teammate,

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:32.813
Renga, possesses
is extraordinary.

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:34.281
Although, I guess that to you,

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.817
it's just the normal
way that things are.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.018
[Houki] Well, sure!

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:39.820
We're on the same
team, after all.

00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:42.322
Hako possesses
outstanding perception.

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:46.693
And Renga's not just strong,
he excels at defense too!

00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:49.162
[Sukea] Hm, I see.

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:51.064
And is that why those
two were working

00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:52.499
the way they were earlier?

00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:53.667
[Houki] Huh?

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.635
Oh!

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:58.172
(gentle thoughtful music)

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.915
Hako anticipated the
deliveryman's thoughts

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:10.551
and reorganized the
packages to reflect that.

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:13.954
Renga was trying to
make up for lost time

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:16.590
by hauling a ridiculous
number of boxes!

00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:20.093
Those two ignored my
orders for a reason,

00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:22.062
and I was supposed
to be helping them

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:24.097
so they wouldn't
have to do all that.

00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:26.333
That was my job!

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.303
All I thought about were
my own selfish orders,

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:32.139
I didn't consider
those two at all!

00:14:33.574 --> 00:14:35.008
What should I do now?

00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:38.812
You said before that
you admire Lord Sixth,

00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:40.814
but have you heard this story?

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:43.350
Lord Sixth made
many mistakes too,

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.386
and each time he reflected
on them and tried again.

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:50.224
By focusing only on
orders and rules,

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:53.727
he put his comrades in
danger and lost a friend.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.097
He regretted it very much
and wanted to apologize,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.067
but the friend he wanted
to say it to was gone.

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.769
If you want to apologize,

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:05.506
then no time like
the present, right?

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.443
[Houki] No time like the
present to apologize.

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:13.380
Oh, what am I even
talking about, anyway?

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.615
(Sukea chuckling)

00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:17.184
By the way, there are a
lot of different kinds

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:19.353
of department store
wrapping paper,

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:22.656
so I wonder how they knew
which package was the bomb.

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:24.424
[Houki] Huh?

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:26.326
Well, I'm pretty
sure the packages

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.694
that the department
store wrapped

00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:29.162
have the store's sticker on it,

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:30.497
but the wrapping on the package

00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.966
containing the bomb
didn't have one!

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.935
(Houki gasping)

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:36.937
What's wrong?

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.673
[Houki] Once I see
something, I never forget it!

00:15:40.841 --> 00:15:44.144
(dramatic whooshing)

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:49.216
There were some among
today's packages!

00:15:49.249 --> 00:15:52.819
Some of the wrapped packages
didn't have a sticker!

00:15:52.853 --> 00:15:54.054
Three of them!

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.456
Which means what?

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.493
[Houki] I've gotta get
Hako and Renga right away!

00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:01.895
-(timer beeping)
-(tense dramatic music)

00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:03.797
(timer warbling)

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.533
(all grunting)

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:10.337
There was still one left.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.340
After one bomb is found,
everyone lets down their guard,

00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:15.909
and security becomes more lax,

00:16:15.943 --> 00:16:19.446
and that's just what
the perpetrator wants!

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.582
[Houki] That's right, and
he chose a delivery window

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:24.184
set for later than the first
bomb that was discovered,

00:16:24.218 --> 00:16:26.486
which means the perp
mailed several bombs

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.621
from the very beginning!

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:30.791
Wait, that was the perp's
strategy all along?

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.460
[Houki] There should
be one more bomb!

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.629
There's a delivery
to the New Town area

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:38.298
scheduled for 1:30 p. m.

00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:40.434
Where are the packages
for that delivery?

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:42.736
That batch just went
out a little while ago!

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:44.171
After them, fast!

00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:46.473
Just a minute,
it'll be impossible!

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:47.407
Why?

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:50.043
There's no set
order for delivery.

00:16:50.077 --> 00:16:51.612
Depending on what
there is to take,

00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:55.215
it's the preference
of the postal worker!

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:58.819
So it makes no sense to go
chasing after them blindly.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.053
But we still oughta notify

00:17:00.087 --> 00:17:01.822
those shinobi from
earlier, right?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.224
Yes, but there's
just no time left,

00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:07.361
the delivery will be
completed within 15 minutes.

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:08.395
This is awful!

00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:11.031
[Houki] Please, let us help!

00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:12.299
[Sukea] Hm?

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:15.936
Houki, you-

00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:17.804
[Houki] If you can see
what we're working toward,

00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:19.406
you'll give it your all, right?

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.307
Huh?

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.642
[Houki] Hako, you're right.

00:17:21.675 --> 00:17:22.676
Disbanding for now-

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:23.677
(Hako gasping)

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.045
is a good idea.

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:27.915
You got this?

00:17:27.948 --> 00:17:29.783
(Houki grunting)

00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:31.218
All right, then.

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.020
I'll contact the
Hokage's Office,

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.821
but the rest is up to you.

00:17:34.855 --> 00:17:36.089
[Houki] Right!

00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:38.225
Are you sure that they
can actually handle this?

00:17:38.258 --> 00:17:40.727
Oh, yes, I'm completely
sure about that.

00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:44.231
After all, they're exceptional
Hidden Leaf Shinobi, too.

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:47.668
(pedestrians chattering)

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:49.903
(footsteps thundering)

00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:51.905
[Woman] Yes!

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:53.006
Sure, I'll take it.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.608
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you!

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:55.776
[Houki] There's no time,

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:57.678
so please do exactly
what I tell you!

00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:58.812
Hey, hold on!

00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:01.014
Are you putting yourself
in charge again?

00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:04.284
[Houki] Hako, I want
you to take the lead!

00:18:04.318 --> 00:18:05.185
Really? Me?

00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:06.887
[Houki] I know that
I'm not very good

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.455
at making the most
of your strengths,

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:11.625
but, Hako, with your
outstanding perceptive ability,

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:12.960
you'll figure out our strengths

00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:15.796
and how to put them
to their best use!

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:18.365
Look, I say that
we should disband

00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:20.467
so that we can start again anew!

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:23.036
All right then!

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.204
If you can see what
we're working toward,

00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:26.139
then I think I can do my best.

00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:28.041
First of all, do you know
who's the one assigned

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.177
to make the deliveries
on this route?

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.913
[Houki] Don't worry, I have
the schedule memorized!

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:36.316
(energetic rock music)

00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:42.756
-Huh?
-Hey there, delivery!

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:43.757
[Man] Oh, thank you!

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.992
Thank you very much.

00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:48.195
[Houki] There he is, over there!

00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:50.531
Thought so.

00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:52.366
I figured the first
stop the postal worker

00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:53.967
would make would be this one.

00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:55.068
Nice, Hako!

00:18:55.102 --> 00:18:56.904
I can't believe you
found him just from

00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:59.606
his personality and his
behavioral patterns!

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.774
[Houki] I'm amazed you analyzed

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.209
each postal worker
so thoroughly!

00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:05.312
There's just a few of them,
so if I observe them for a day,

00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:06.914
it's easy to piece it together.

00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:09.416
Just how strong is
your perception?

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:10.884
(Houki grunting)

00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:12.920
[Man] What's this about?

00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:13.921
[Houki] I'll explain later.

00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:15.289
Please give us the package!

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:16.523
-(dramatic whooshing)
-(timer beeping)

00:19:16.557 --> 00:19:17.624
We found it.

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:20.394
(timer beeping)

00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:22.062
[Houki] This is it.

00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:23.096
(timer beeping)

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.097
(timer warbling)

00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:25.098
(timer beeping in error)

00:19:25.132 --> 00:19:26.099
(all gasping)

00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:29.002
(timer beeping)

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:31.772
What now?

00:19:31.805 --> 00:19:33.373
Just leave this one to me!

00:19:33.407 --> 00:19:35.909
[Houki] Huh?

00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:38.912
(footsteps thudding)

00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:40.080
(Renga grunting)

00:19:40.113 --> 00:19:41.648
[Renga] Houki, the bomb!

00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:43.483
(timer beeping)

00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:45.786
-(Houki grunting)
-(air whooshing)

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:48.388
(dramatic whooshing)

00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:49.823
Quarantine Wall!

00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:50.924
(wall clanging)

00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:54.394
(timer beeping)

00:19:54.428 --> 00:19:55.696
(timer droning)

00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:58.732
(explosion booming)

00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:10.644
(both grunting)

00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:12.412
(all grunting)

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:13.514
(all chuckling)

00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:15.382
[Kakashi] Guess there was
nothing to worry about!

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:17.084
[All] Huh? Oh!

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:20.354
[Houki] (gasping) Lord Sixth?

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.022
Why're you here?

00:20:22.823 --> 00:20:25.526
(air whooshing)

00:20:26.793 --> 00:20:29.196
[Kakashi] Sukea contacted
me and I rushed over here,

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.833
but, uh, is everything
okay with you guys?

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:34.234
[Houki] Uh, yes, sir!

00:20:34.268 --> 00:20:37.404
We worked together and managed
to pull it off somehow!

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:40.641
Renga's defense is the
best in all the Leaf!

00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:42.209
Well, we just received word

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:45.145
that the one behind the
bombs has been captured.

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:47.314
But anyway, switching
the leader of your team

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:50.317
was a rather drastic course
of action, don't you think?

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:53.854
[Houki] After I heard Mr.
Sukea's story about Lord Sixth,

00:20:53.887 --> 00:20:57.257
I gave some serious thought
to each one of my teammates,

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:00.027
and that made me
realize something.

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:02.362
Hako, Renga?

00:21:02.396 --> 00:21:04.498
-I'm sorry.
-(Hako and Renga gasping)

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:06.466
For a while now,
I've blamed you two

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.204
when things didn't go right,
but it was really my fault.

00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:11.872
Listen, forget about all that!

00:21:11.905 --> 00:21:13.507
I was wrong, too.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.541
I'm sorry!

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:17.144
[Houki] Renga!

00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:19.279
I'm sorry, too.

00:21:19.313 --> 00:21:21.481
I left everything
up to you, Houki,

00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:24.084
just because that
made it easier for me.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.819
I'm really sorry!

00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:27.387
[Houki] Oh, Hako!

00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:32.092
Well, we may not get any
missions higher than D-rank,

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:33.827
but even if that's the case,

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:35.662
let's just keep
on doing our best!

00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:36.697
[Hako And Renga] Yeah!

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.566
(bright upbeat music)

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.702
On the recommendation
of the Sixth Hokage,

00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:45.539
Mr. Kakashi Hatake, Team
25 will be under my command

00:21:45.572 --> 00:21:46.707
from this day forward.

00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:49.343
Hako Kuroi with your
powers of perception,

00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:52.145
Renga Kokubou with your
defensive abilities,

00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:54.581
and Houki Taketori with
your photographic memory,

00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:57.317
you three are perfect
for intel missions.

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:01.288
I'm eager to work with you!

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:03.056
[Houki, Hako, And
Renga] Yes, sir!

00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:06.593
(all laughing)

00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:14.535
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:29.783 --> 00:22:33.587
(singer singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.822 --> 00:23:43.790
(gentle music)

00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:44.925
[Konohamaru]
Romance? (chuckling)

00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:46.827
If you have the time
for stuff like that,

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.195
you have time to go train!

00:23:48.228 --> 00:23:49.196
[Boruto] Aren't you interested

00:23:49.229 --> 00:23:50.797
in things like
that, Big Brother?

00:23:50.831 --> 00:23:52.132
(Konohamaru laughing)

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:54.234
[Konohamaru] The only girlfriend
I have is my Ninja Way!

00:23:54.268 --> 00:23:56.303
My goal is to become the Hokage,

00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:58.672
I can't let things like
romantic relationships

00:23:58.705 --> 00:24:00.340
get in the way of my focus!

00:24:00.374 --> 00:24:03.677
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations",

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.913
"Konohamaru and Remon"!

00:24:05.946 --> 00:24:08.682
Big Brother, that
is just so uncool!

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:15.389
