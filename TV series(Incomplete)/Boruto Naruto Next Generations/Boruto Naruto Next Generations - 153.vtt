WEBVTT

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.309
(intense music)

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.044
All right, listen
up we were the ones

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.479
who cornered the
bandits first, got it?

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.516
So you guys move to the
rear and back us up!

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.184
Ha! That's just too bad.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.585
Because we're gonna-

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.421
Iwabe! Come on, let's
move to the rear.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.823
What? No way!

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.191
Bandits! Right there!

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.661
(bandit grunts)

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.296
All right, guys! Let's go!

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.831
Right!

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.832
Huh?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.966
Hey, wait!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.568
[Namida] Tsubaki!

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:40.541
-(Tsubaki grunting)
-(bandits grunting)

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.677
(Big Bro grunting)

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.581
[Tsubaki] You're
not getting away!

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.221
(Big Bro screaming)

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.657
Oh, nothing happened.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.059
(Big Bro fearfully breathing)

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.961
The boss is the only
one that's left.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.563
We can handle the
rest ourself...

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:03.597
Ah!

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.934
[Iwabe] Leave the rest to me!

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:12.139
-Hey, you guys!
-Oh, come on, no!

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:21.181
(opening theme music)

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:50.003
(opening theme music)

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:59.680
-(dramatic music)
-Tsubaki!

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:00.814
Look, what's the deal?

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.583
What happened out
there on that mission?

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:03.951
What are you talking about?

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.953
Come on, you know
exactly what I mean!

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:07.788
I'm talking about
allowing Team 5

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:09.356
to take all the
credit, of course!

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.359
If you'd used your Snowstorm
Slash like that one time,

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.961
we could've caught those guys.

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.330
So why didn't you use
your full power, huh?

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.100
It hasn't been working
very well lately.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.935
Are you being serious?

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.037
Are you hiding
something from us?

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:26.406
I'm not hiding anything!

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.075
[Metal Lee] You're
on the same team,

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:29.943
so you really should
not be fighting.

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:31.178
[All] Huh?

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.947
Oh, it's just you guys.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:36.250
All right, what do you want now?

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:38.218
Oh, please don't be so angry.

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:40.521
We're just on the way back
from turning the bandit boss

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.723
over to the Leaf Police
Force, that's all.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.091
Our super capable team's

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:46.727
not like some other
super incapable team.

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:49.830
What the hell did
you just say to me?

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.231
You wanna go or what?

00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:52.633
[Wasabi] The way
you just barge in

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.268
-really bugs me!
-(sighs) In the Land of Iron,

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.670
it's considered shameful
for teams on the same side

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.938
to bicker with each other.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.806
You cannot become a
full-fledged samurai

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.974
if you do such things.

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:02.809
-(Iwabe sighs)
-(girls chuckling)

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:04.978
Oh, wow! I'm really
impressed, Tsubaki.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:06.380
[Iwabe] What's up
with that, Denki?

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.116
Why are you complimenting
someone on another team?

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.951
It's important to
acknowledge others,

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.053
even if they happen
to be rivals.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.090
(gasps) The rectangle lit up!

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.226
I'm sorry about that, Denki.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.862
Tsubaki isn't very used
to seeing machines yet.

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.630
What are you even talking about?

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:26.366
The Land of Iron has many
things just like this!

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.470
(chuckles) Tsubaki, actually
everyone, come take a look.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.209
What is all this?

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:38.212
Oh, well, I simply charted
out everyone's abilities

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.981
and my calculations indicate
that Tsubaki's skills

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.482
are far ahead of any genin's.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.218
-Is that the truth?
-What? Seriously?

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.986
Ah! Well, then it seems this

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.155
rectangle is a
trustworthy object!

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:49.423
Huh?

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.225
Over there, is that?

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:54.695
[Denki] Yep, that's you
and Namida's data, Wasabi.

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:55.829
Oh, man.

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:56.997
Looks like we're
gonna have to try

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.966
a little harder than
we have been, huh?

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.868
It's not just you two, either.

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:04.538
Even Team 5 can't hold
a candle to Ms. Tsubaki!

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.373
Wow, that is amazing.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.809
I cannot allow myself
to fall behind!

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:10.210
Yeah, I guess that
I'd really better

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:12.379
start training
harder from now on.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:15.816
(chuckles) Honestly, this
is just to be expected

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.050
of a samurai.

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.952
Hmm?

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:20.954
What's this chart?

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.991
[Denki] It's Team 15's
monthly performance score.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:26.126
[Iwabe] It looks like
since Tsubaki joined,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.195
their score's been going down!

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.267
No, that simply cannot be true!

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.369
You mustn't trust a mere
rectangle such as this one!

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:38.839
I thought you said that it
was a trustworthy object.

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.575
Sorry, but I'm sure
the data's correct.

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:43.677
Huh, in fact,

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.379
since Tsubaki joined their team,

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:49.349
they have not surpassed our
team's metrics, not even once!

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:52.085
Well, no wonder it doesn't
feel like we're losing to them!

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.087
No matter how good
an individual is,

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.857
it doesn't mean anything if
the team doesn't do well.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.092
(laughing)

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.961
Hey come on, Iwabe!

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:01.962
See you guys!

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.597
[Metal Lee] Please wait for me!

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.304
We will overthrow Team 5!

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:13.106
Going forward, Team 15's goal

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.210
will be to surpass Team 5's
score no matter what happens!

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.545
Is this seriously why
you called us out here

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:19.680
right before a mission?

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.248
(grunts) What are you saying?

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:24.351
Aren't you frustrated
losing to Team 5 every time?

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.854
Well, sure, of course I am, but-

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.489
If we wish to beat Team 5,

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:32.693
we each must work to improve
our individual abilities.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.228
(Wasabi scoffs)

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.831
Lord Mifune, whom I respect
very deeply, once said to me,

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:39.132
"Man is a sword.

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.134
The one who continues
to polish themselves

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:42.669
can become a hero."

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:44.071
Those were his words!

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:48.809
But what specifically do you
suggest that we do, then?

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.210
Well, let's see.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:52.079
Merely training
aimlessly isn't likely

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:54.815
to garner any better results,

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.851
so I suggest that we
take up a challenge.

00:06:57.885 --> 00:06:59.453
[Both] A challenge?

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:00.354
That's right.

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.356
We will have a
competition to determine

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.092
who within the team performs
the best on missions.

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.494
You mean we wouldn't just
be competing against Team 5,

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:09.997
but we'd be competing
against each other, as well?

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.365
That's correct.

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:13.367
If we compete with each
other, it will create tension

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.235
and push all of us
to grow stronger.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.604
Huh, you know, that
sounds interesting!

00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:20.240
And I say whoever distinguishes
themselves the most

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:23.677
should get treated to whatever
they want by the other two.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.845
Sounds marvelous.

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:27.347
It seems like fun.
I'm getting excited!

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.450
Well, now that's decided,
I won't lose, got it?

00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:39.826
This probably isn't good.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.228
At this rate, I'm going
to be a bit sluggish

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:42.596
before the day is even done.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.597
-Damn it!
-Oh well.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.866
I'm just so mad!

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:46.867
Huh?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.068
Wow, that's amazing!

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.337
But don't you ever get
bored eating only fries?

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.806
No, I don't at all.
May I help you?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.342
Wow, that is seriously
a lot of fries!

00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:00.948
If this keeps up, all of
my paycheck is gonna end up

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.116
being used to pay
for Tsubaki's fries!

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.118
I definitely won't lose again!

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:07.087
-(Sarada laughing)
-Just what are you guys

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.455
up to anyway?

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.826
(intense music)

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.461
[Wasabi] Gotcha!

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:19.633
[Namida] See ya!

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:26.974
All of you guys have been
unusually motivated lately,

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.109
and your scores have
really improved, too.

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:31.245
I'm going to win
the next contest!

00:08:31.278 --> 00:08:32.479
What? No way, I'm gonna win it!

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:34.815
Wrong! The next one's
gonna be mine, too!

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.184
A really great thing, isn't it?

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:49.229
So, um, everything's gonna
turn out okay, isn't it?

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:52.833
Yes! I swear that I'm going
to capture all of the bandits!

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:53.967
I shall not fail!

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.068
No, I'll do it!

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:57.571
I'll be the one to catch
them! I'll show you!

00:08:57.604 --> 00:09:01.108
Uh, no, that isn't what I meant.

00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:03.076
Let's just retreat for now!

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.678
[All] You're not getting away!

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.580
Hey! Don't leave me!

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:09.750
But I...

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:12.953
(chuckles) I can't believe
they actually fell for that!

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:16.557
They've just made our
work super easy for us!

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.758
Ah!

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:20.827
It seems that Leaf Shinobi
have really lost their touch.

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.329
[Hanabi] I know, right?

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:23.130
[Both] Huh?

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:24.565
Who the hell are you?

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:25.832
(Hanabi chuckles)

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:30.070
-(attacks thudding)
-(bandits screaming)

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:32.239
All right, that's
all taken care of,

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:35.209
but those kids are still
in need of a good scolding.

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:43.517
Every one of our efforts today
was completely fruitless,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.553
so we must redeem
ourselves tomorrow.

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.222
Hold on, isn't tomorrow-

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:49.489
The boar hunting mission

00:09:49.523 --> 00:09:52.125
that we'll be handling
together with Team 5!

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.094
I vow not to fail tomorrow!

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.295
[Hanabi] About that.

00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:56.597
[All] Huh?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.965
[Wasabi] Hanabi Sensei!

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:59.566
I'm afraid that
I can't allow you

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.268
to go on tomorrow's mission.

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:02.202
[All] Huh?

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:04.104
[Hanabi] Due to
your failure today,

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:07.341
only Team 5 will be
allowed to go tomorrow.

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.076
-But that's not-
-Please just hold on!

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.245
There's no doubt
that we failed today,

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:13.647
but for tomorrow's challenge,
we're definitely going to-

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.282
That's all the more reason.

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:16.517
[All] Huh?

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.353
I'm not trying to say
that competing is wrong,

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.622
but because of the contest
that you've been holding,

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:23.490
there could have been
tragic consequences

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:25.726
to the mistake that
you made today.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.494
(all sighing)

00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:29.997
Because this is still
a relatively new team,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.398
there's something
much more important

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.834
than merely improving
your performance scores,

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.335
so please think about that.

00:10:36.537 --> 00:10:39.072
Also, try to cool
your heads a little.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:50.951
[Tsubaki] Dearest Mother,
some time has passed

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.187
since I came to the
Hidden Leaf Village,

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.088
and since then, I
have grown accustomed

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:57.157
to life amongst the shinobi.

00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:58.926
I have been on several
difficult missions

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.294
with my assigned team,

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.095
but of course, they
have proceeded smoothly

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:04.665
since I, being a samurai,
am present on them.

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.036
[Denki] Ms. Tsubaki!

00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.407
Oh, it's all of you.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.809
We will do our best to
make up for your absence

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:17.344
during the boar
hunt mission today!

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.880
At this rate, I guess we'll
be surpassing you guys

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:22.049
in this month's
mission score, too.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.585
Hey, come on, Iwabe!

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:31.491
[Iwabe] Hey, Denki! We're
gonna leave without you!

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:32.526
[Denki] Huh? Wait!

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:37.664
When it comes to individual
ability, I'm winning, though.

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.334
(gentle music)

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.105
Is that all you're
having today, too?

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.008
What's up?

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.143
Yes, Boruto? May I help you?

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:52.246
Well, I noticed you've
only been eating fries,

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.814
so I got a little worried.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.049
Fries are more than
adequate for me.

00:11:57.651 --> 00:12:00.287
(Boruto sighs)

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.490
And what is the meaning of this?

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:06.393
The true value of Thunder
Burger is in the meal deal.

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:08.929
Whether you believe that
or not, just try it out.

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:10.297
No, I refuse.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.067
(grunts) (chuckles) Come
on, don't be like that.

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:15.435
Look, eating it all together

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:18.805
makes you appreciate how
good each individual part is.

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:20.307
Try it!

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.810
(sighs) Okay, but just one bite.

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:25.212
Sure, that's fine!

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.581
All right, go ahead
and eat up, then!

00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:34.588
Now try it along
with some fries.

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:41.962
[Tsubaki] (gasps)
This is amazing!

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:44.331
[Boruto] (chuckles) Well?

00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:47.334
[Tsubaki] On its own, it...

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.069
Once you start to
taste the saltiness

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.938
of the burger and the
fries mixing together,

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:54.107
it's time for this!

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:58.378
(energetic rock music)

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.215
This combination!

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:03.317
The taste of each
individual item

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.419
brings out the full
flavor of the others!

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:09.423
Right? Isn't it delicious when
you eat all of them together?

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:12.626
Indeed! This is what they mean
when they talk of flavors

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:14.261
being in perfect harmony!

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:16.630
[Sarada] Boruto!

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:19.166
Aren't we meeting to
review yesterday's mission?

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:21.935
Oh yeah, right! I'm
sorry, I forgot!

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.871
Oh, but these are-

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.806
Don't worry about
it. It's my treat!

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.140
It'll make me happy
if Thunder Burger

00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:29.109
just ends up
getting another fan!

00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:33.046
Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.649
What were you doing anyway?

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.953
Hey, hold on, didn't you
order anything to eat?

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.655
Oh, uh, I just forgot!

00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:45.392
(wood thudding)

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.630
(Wasabi heavily breathing)

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:51.331
[Wasabi] Hey, Tsubaki!

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:54.601
So this is where the two of you
have been this entire time.

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:56.270
Well, we really do need to train

00:13:56.303 --> 00:13:58.138
and get as strong as possible.

00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:05.913
I just don't understand it.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.080
We're trying so hard,

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:09.616
but then, why aren't
we able to beat Team 5?

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.185
What's up, Tsubaki?

00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:13.187
Are you feeling
sick or something?

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.956
Of course not! But
listen, I just-

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:16.990
[Namida] Hey, you guys?

00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:18.058
[Both] Huh?

00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:19.760
I think that I just
heard something

00:14:19.793 --> 00:14:21.728
coming from inside the forest.

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:26.233
(villager groaning)

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:28.402
Yeah, you're right. I can
actually hear something, too.

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.204
It's kinda like
a groaning sound.

00:14:30.237 --> 00:14:32.539
You think that
maybe it's a bear?

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:34.675
[Tsubaki] (gasps) Over here!

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.543
[Wasabi] What is it?

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:37.544
(Wasabi and Namida gasping)

00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:39.947
(villager groaning)

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.481
That's not good!

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:44.551
Namida, go and notify
the Police Force!

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:45.819
[Namida] Got it!

00:14:45.853 --> 00:14:47.888
Tsubaki, will you come
along and help me?

00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:49.122
Of course.

00:14:52.192 --> 00:14:55.362
(sighs) Thank you guys
so much for saving me!

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.564
No problem. What
happened anyway?

00:14:57.598 --> 00:15:00.901
Well, I was guiding the
Leaf shinobi to our village

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.269
for the boar hunting mission,

00:15:02.302 --> 00:15:04.004
but then, practically
out of nowhere,

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:06.073
we were attacked
by some bandits.

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:08.408
And after that...

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:10.611
They just tied you up and
just left you out here,

00:15:10.644 --> 00:15:11.645
is that right?

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:18.986
Hold on, then that means the
one who's with Team 5 is...

00:15:22.823 --> 00:15:24.525
Thank you very much for coming!

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.995
So, Wasabi.

00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:31.465
(ominous music)

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.911
Is something the matter?

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:45.078
[Villager] No.

00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:47.147
We've just reached our
destination, that's all.

00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:49.983
What? But isn't the
village farther ahead?

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:53.220
(Iwabe lightly grunts)

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:56.523
We're not actually going
to go to the village.

00:15:56.557 --> 00:15:58.292
Hmm?
Ah!

00:15:58.325 --> 00:15:59.092
Iwabe?

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.894
They have gotten us cornered.

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:02.462
Yeah, we're
completely surrounded.

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.765
What are you talking
about, you guys?

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:08.669
(bandits chuckling)

00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:09.703
What's going on?

00:16:12.573 --> 00:16:14.641
(group gasps)

00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:16.476
The gall of you pathetic genin,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.012
daring to capture
my big brother.

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:20.614
Big brother?

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.216
Wait, could it be that...

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:24.718
Does he mean the bandit
we caught before?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.255
Thanks for taking care of him.

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:31.158
And now, instead
of hunting boar,

00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:33.460
we're just gonna play
with you a little!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.832
(shurikens clanking)

00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:40.267
[Iwabe] What? You guys!

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:42.903
[Younger Bro] The hell?

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:44.338
Wasabi!

00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:45.606
Denki.

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:47.007
We've sent for backup,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.877
so until Hanabi Sensei
arrives, let's hold them.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.411
Right!

00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:54.081
(angrily grunts) All
of you, go get them!

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:57.184
(bandits yelling)

00:16:58.051 --> 00:16:59.286
Let's do this, you guys!

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.822
Iwabe, Mud Wall on the right!

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.223
Okay!

00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:05.692
And Metal, you attack.
Engage the enemy head on!

00:17:05.726 --> 00:17:06.827
Understood!

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.529
[Iwabe] Earth Style: Mud Wall!

00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:13.066
(Metal Lee grunting)

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.768
(bandit chuckling)

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:16.136
[Bandit] Ow!

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.071
Denki, please be more
aware of your surroundings!

00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:19.640
Yeah, well, I simply figured

00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:22.476
that you'd be there to cover me!

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.945
[Tsubaki] Each member covers
for the others' weaknesses

00:17:24.978 --> 00:17:27.481
while bringing out
their strengths as well.

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.383
This is just like the-

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:33.320
(all grunting)

00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:35.088
Hey, Boss!

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:37.357
Huh? Damn it!

00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:39.393
Let's just retreat! Follow me!

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:43.564
[Iwabe] Why that.

00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:45.365
Iwabe! Just hold on!

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:46.533
Huh?

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.035
Ms. Tsubaki!

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.436
We'll take care of things here,

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:51.805
so, Team 15, please go and
take care of the others!

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.207
We leave it to you!

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.813
[Wasabi] Hold it right there!

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:01.715
Huh? (snickers)

00:18:03.984 --> 00:18:05.185
Up above!

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:14.695
You guys. You two okay?

00:18:14.728 --> 00:18:16.029
This is nothing.

00:18:16.997 --> 00:18:19.433
Seriously? There's
even more of them?

00:18:19.466 --> 00:18:21.635
(bandits chuckling)

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:24.605
I'm still little more
than just a blunt blade.

00:18:24.638 --> 00:18:26.073
What are you talking about?

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:28.041
All three of us

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.777
must somehow become a
hamburger meal deal!

00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:32.045
[Both] Huh?

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:33.881
So instead of
merely having fries,

00:18:33.914 --> 00:18:36.016
we must become more like
a hamburger meal deal,

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:38.752
each one of us bringing
out the best in the others.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.888
So, uh, what's that mean?

00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:43.090
What's essential for
Team 15 to succeed

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:44.491
is strong teamwork.

00:18:44.525 --> 00:18:47.327
We have to bring out the best
in each other's abilities.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.098
You're totally right. Good call.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.233
Studying and using what
you've learned are important,

00:18:53.267 --> 00:18:55.435
but what comes
first is teamwork!

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:58.539
[Wasabi] Okay, well, now that
we understand each other,

00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:01.141
what are we gonna do
about this situation?

00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:02.543
[Tsubaki] Just leave it to me.

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:04.678
[Namida] But you said
your Snowstorm Slash

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:06.146
wasn't working too well.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.349
The Snowstorm Slash is
a lethal single strike.

00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:11.418
If I misjudge the
amount of power,

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:13.053
it can become a
double-edged sword

00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:15.422
that puts my own
life at risk as well.

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:17.758
That's why

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:19.426
I'll put my trust in you two.

00:19:19.459 --> 00:19:21.828
Wasabi, please
create a smokescreen

00:19:21.862 --> 00:19:23.797
so I may infiltrate them.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.098
[Wasabi] Got it.

00:19:25.132 --> 00:19:27.034
I don't know what you're
gabbing about over there,

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:29.002
but just go get them, you guys!

00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:30.804
(bandits yelling)

00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:33.340
Team 15, begin the assault!

00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:34.641
-Okay!
-Right!

00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:36.243
Now! Cat Surprise!

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.181
What?

00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:46.687
Heh, just one little brat?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.355
Take her down, you guys!

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:51.158
Very well. I'll proceed
at my full strength.

00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:55.562
Secret Sword Snowstorm Slash!

00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:03.203
(bandits groaning)

00:20:03.237 --> 00:20:06.640
(energetic rock music)

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.482
(Younger Bro panicking)

00:20:15.516 --> 00:20:20.287
(groaning) Namida, the
rest is in your hands.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.555
Tsubaki!

00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:22.556
Huh?

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:23.557
Ah!

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.325
[Wasabi] He's getting
away! Go, Namida!

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:29.263
On it! Tsubaki's efforts
will not be in vain!

00:20:31.732 --> 00:20:33.734
(yells)

00:20:34.968 --> 00:20:38.305
(Younger Bro screams)

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:45.045
Ha! Gotcha!

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:52.019
(group sighs)

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:53.787
You guys, you...

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.890
[Wasabi] You okay,
Tsubaki? Hang in there.

00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:59.092
How did this happen?

00:20:59.126 --> 00:21:01.028
I told you before.

00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:04.898
The Snowstorm Slash is a
double-edged sword, so I...

00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:06.099
Oh, no!

00:21:06.133 --> 00:21:09.036
Right now, I'm still
only a blunt blade,

00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:13.006
so I shall have to
train a lot harder.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.676
-Tsubaki!
-Tsubaki.

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:18.278
It's quite wonderful
to have friends

00:21:18.312 --> 00:21:21.148
that you can put your trust in.

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:26.186
From now on, we should
do many more fun things.

00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:29.890
-(both gasping)
-Tsubaki!

00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:32.559
Hey, come on, Tsubaki,
hang in there!

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:34.261
Open your eyes! Please!

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:38.565
Tsubaki!

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:44.037
(Tsubaki snoring)

00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:45.272
[Both] Huh?

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:50.944
Hold on a sec. Is she-

00:21:50.978 --> 00:21:52.379
[Wasabi] Asleep?

00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:53.547
(guys laughing)

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.949
It appears that she simply
exhausted all of her chakra

00:21:55.983 --> 00:21:57.251
and then fell asleep.

00:21:59.987 --> 00:22:02.222
Then, is this what she meant by

00:22:02.256 --> 00:22:06.193
it being a double-edged
sword? (sighs)

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:14.234
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.922 --> 00:23:43.290
(uptempo rock music)

00:23:43.323 --> 00:23:45.959
[Hanabi] Himawari, what do
you want to be in the future?

00:23:45.993 --> 00:23:48.695
[Himawari] Huh? I haven't
decided on anything.

00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:49.863
[Hanabi] I see.

00:23:49.897 --> 00:23:51.198
I kinda thought you
were already dead set

00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:53.267
on becoming a shinobi.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.868
[Boruto] Himawari can
decide what she wants to be

00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:56.203
for herself, can't she?

00:23:56.236 --> 00:23:57.471
[Hanabi] You're right.

00:23:57.504 --> 00:23:59.740
Oh, hey, wait! They're
holding one of these soon.

00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:01.141
Do you wanna go?

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:04.044
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations",

00:24:04.077 --> 00:24:06.213
"Himawari's Ninja
Trial Session."

00:24:06.246 --> 00:24:08.782
[Himawari] A one-day
Academy trial session?

00:24:08.815 --> 00:24:10.317
Sounds fun! I'll go!

00:24:11.985 --> 00:24:16.723
(closing theme music)
