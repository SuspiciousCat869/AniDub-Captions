00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.947
Hmm. Ah! The footprints!

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.816
Why'd they stop
all of a sudden?!

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.017
Is this a trap?

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.985
Just intended
to lure us in?!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.353
[growling]

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.824
Damn it! Where are they gonna
come at us from?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.460
[growling]

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.730
[gasping] Up there!

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.233

[growling]

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.323
White Zetsu!
Why is he here?!

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.560
What the hell is
that monster?!

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:00.961
White Zetsu?!

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.863
You mean the things
Dad and everyone fought

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.397
during the Fourth
Great Ninja War?!

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.033
Yeah. I thought
they were all destroyed,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.602
but I guess some survived.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.572
Still... I've never seen
one take on this form...

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:14.340
Huh?! Wait, what are
you talking about?

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.979
[snarling]

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.480

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.125
Lightning Style?

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.861
[snarling]

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.899
And Fire Style
this time?!

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.801
[roaring]

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:23.269
Wind Style, too?!

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:24.538
But how can...?!

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.873
How many styles
of jutsu can he use?

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.643
[snarling]

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.511

Whoa, no way!

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.376
Big Bro Konohamaru's
overpowered?

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.645
Let's help him!

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:19.192
Did it work?

[struggling]

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.737

Come on, are you kidding?!

Huh? Wait a second.

[snarling]

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.480
If I'm remembering
right...

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.549
What are you
doing now, Boruto?!

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:45.552
[snarling]

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:48.121
<i>It may come in quite</i>

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.756

Uh!

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.743
Big Brother!

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:12.312
[grunting]

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:17.618
[growling]

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:22.088
It ran off?

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.489
Not quite.

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:25.726
Let us off the hook
is really more like it,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.727
I'd say.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.561
[grunting]

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.029
[gasping] Big Brother!

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.631
We've gotta treat
your wound!

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:35.368
What the hell was that
crazy monster, anyway?

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.139
He's called White Zetsu.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.874
He's basically
a living weapon

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:45.111
created by Kaguya Otsutsuki,
the last enemy we battled

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:47.180
during the Fourth Great
Ninja War.

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:49.182
But didn't Lord Seventh
and the others

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.584
destroy them all?

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:52.285
So what's something
like that doing

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:54.120
down here after
all this time?

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.225
I think the answer to
that lies deeper inside here.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:00.226
What do you mean?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.595
Hey, when did you...?

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.574
What is...all this?

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:14.575
Whoa.

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.277
Can it be...?

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.947
A relic of the Otsutsuki
Clan down here?

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:22.448
Long ago,

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:26.286
Kaguya used the roots
of a tree just like this...

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.389
to cultivate
countless White Zetsu.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.957
But that
White Zetsu form...

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:34.127
I've never seen anything
like it in the intel.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.962
Its intellect seemed low...

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:38.431
But still, its strength
was off the charts.

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:44.838
Maybe it underwent
a change while left alone?

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.172
Wait a minute!

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.574
Does that mean
there are even more

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:49.776
like that one further down
underneath us?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.346
What?! No way,
that is seriously bad!

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.982
Actually, I don't think
there are more.

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:56.550
Why not, Mitsuki?

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.921
It's been nearly ten years
since it lost its master.

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:02.623
That bud is dried up.

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:05.491
I don't believe it's
even active right now.

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:07.460
If they don't have
a supply of chakra,

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:09.530
they cannot incubate.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.064
Yeah, let's hope not...

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.701
Mitsuki, you sure seem to
know a whole lot about this...

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.638
Well, I learned all about it
from my parent.

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.440
Okay!
Let's head down already!

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.241
Boruto?

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.475
I mean, come on!

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.010
Now that we know about
that thing,

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.512
we can't ignore it.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.313
You say that like going down
there's gonna be easy!

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:28.782
Just listen!

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:31.217
If this is the factory where
those monsters are made,

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.920
then we have
to destroy all of it.

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.989
That may be true, but...

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:38.859
Big Brother Konohamaru!
Let's get that thing.

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:40.060
All four of us.

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:43.396
Boruto, that would seem
to be a good strategy...

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.397
But, no.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.099
What?! But how come?

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.269
Look, this ruin definitely
appears to be inactive.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.105
But if that's the case,
then why is White Zetsu here?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.440
Huh? Well, that's...

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.009
What it means
is that

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:58.311
we should assume that
there are others here, too.

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:01.214
And frankly, those things are
too much for you to handle.

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:02.549
Hey, hold on a minute!

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:03.684
What are you trying
to say here?

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:05.251
That we're a burden
to you?!

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:06.953
To put it bluntly, yes!

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.354
Uhh...

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.256
You're in over
your heads here.

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:11.658
Mm.

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:15.195
What, so we're all just
gonna retreat then?

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.530
Not quite.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:18.264
Because I'm gonna go
in there by myself.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:19.700
[gasping]

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.468
You're right that we can't just
leave this place.

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.204
And if anyone's gonna
deal with it,

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.573
it has to be a jonin
like me.

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:29.242
I need the three of you
to go back to the Village

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.844
and report on
the situation here

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.146
in case I don't make it back.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.648
Konohamaru Sensei!

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.017
No! We can't,
Big Brother Konohamaru!

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.484
It's okay!

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:41.688
Together, we can find a way
to beat that thing!

00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:47.093
You didn't live through
the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.462
You don't know how terrifying
the things

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.698
connected to
Kaguya Otsutsuki are.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.669
Kaguya is a god‐like being...

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.872
One that first brought about
ninja like us.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.007
Her power is beyond measure.

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:04.611
She's that powerful?

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:07.013
There's no doubt that
you three have grown strong,

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.015
but this is on
a whole other level.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.285
Greater strength will
be required from here on out.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:13.987
Don't let this get you down.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.123
Take your time and
build up your strength.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:20.326
The one thing that
we must absolutely avoid,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.395
is for all of us
to fall here.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.631
So you three need
to go back.

00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.232
And that is an order.

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.167
[grunting]

00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:39.880
<i>Please wait,</i>
<i>Konohamaru Sensei!</i>

00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:45.886
Sarada...

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.325
Don't get me wrong.

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:54.595
It's not that I agree
with Boruto.

00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:56.530
But at the same time,
I also believe that

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:59.365
all four of us should go
down there together.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.466
What, you do?!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.168
And why is that?

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:03.537
Since we don't even know

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.238
where the enemy might
be hiding right now,

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:08.074
splitting up would actually
be more dangerous for us.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.744
It's possible that thing
could come after us instead.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.212
In fact, I think that

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:14.414
there's an even greater chance
of that happening.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.182
Even a slow‐witted creature
like that

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:19.119
knows enough to go after
opponents that are weaker.

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:20.420
And if that's the case,

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.989
the best strategy is for
the three of us to come along

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.691
and provide you
with back‐up.

00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:27.327
Don't you agree that
I'm right about that, Sensei?

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.632
You might be, but...

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:32.866
Big Brother!

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.701
If the risk of attack
is the same,

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.670
I agree that splitting up
our battle power

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:38.271
isn't the best move.

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:42.743
Well, damn it.
I guess there's no choice.

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:44.611
‐ Mm!
‐ Mmhm!

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:46.847
We'll prove that
we're useful, Big Brother!

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.282
I mean, Konohamaru Sensei!

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:49.983
You better!

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:50.684
[laughing]

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:52.218
But whatever happens,

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:55.388
you absolutely must not
overestimate your strength.

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.990
Okay, your orders
have changed.

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.593
We'll all proceed further
inside together.

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:01.728
We'll take down White Zetsu,

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:04.297
get through this alive,
and all go home together!

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.532
Right!

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:07.433
Okay, pay attention.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:08.869
I need you to listen
carefully to

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:10.937
the strategy I'm about
to explain.

00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:11.505
Strategy?

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.006
That's right.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.976
The strategy that's
guaranteed to bring him down.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:28.488
[groaning in pain]

00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:29.422
[noticing]

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:35.295
Did we get him?!

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.233
No. Here it comes...

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:42.603
Just stick to the plan,
okay, you guys?

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:44.270
Sarada, use your Sharingan!

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:45.138
Right!

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:59.753
It'll use Lightning Style,
Wind Style, then Fire Style!

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:03.557
Leave Lightning Style
to me.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.925
Snake Lightning!

00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:12.899
It's my turn! All right!
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:19.105
Fire Style: Fire Dragon Bomb!

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.774
[blowing]

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.778
[snarling]

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.716
[growling]

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.654
[roaring]

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:35.556
He knows jutsu attacks
won't work,

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:37.357
so he's moving to
hand‐to‐hand combat...

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.726
[snarling]

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.828
It's exactly as I predicted!

00:12:43.564 --> 00:12:49.235
[growling]

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:51.705
Now, Boruto!

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:53.139
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:59.212
[fighting]

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.447
[snarling]

00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:03.850
Hey ugly, over here!

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:06.086
No matter how powerful
this monster is,

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.789
if we keep chipping away
at him, then we'll win.

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:11.725
Konohamaru Sensei's plan
is brilliant, of course!

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:12.626
At this rate...

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:13.894
That's right...

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:15.896
Keep on picking away
at him, Boruto!

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.531
Just like that!

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:18.999
While you're keeping
him busy,

00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:20.366
I'll get him with this!

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.437
[grunting]

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.639
[snarling]

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:26.773
[yelling]

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:30.143
[snarling]

00:13:31.712 --> 00:13:33.146
<i>Listen close.</i>
<i>First, you're going to</i>

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:36.416
<i>lure him in with</i>
<i>your Shadow Clones, Boruto.</i>

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:40.621
<i>But don't do anything</i>
<i>reckless, you understand me?</i>

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.523
<i>(thinking) But...</i>

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:44.090
[growling]

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.358
Mm.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.127
[growling]

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.163
[gasping]

00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:55.301
<i>(thinking) It's weakened.</i>
<i>If I do it now...</i>

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.104
<i>Well, eventually everyone</i>
<i>will come to understand</i>

00:13:58.138 --> 00:14:00.941
<i>and they'll see</i>
<i>your true power, Young Lord.</i>

00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:04.144
<i>And when that time</i>
<i>finally comes...</i>

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.679
<i>(thinking) If I prove that</i>

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:06.613
<i>I can I bring him</i>
<i>down myself...</i>

00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:07.914
[growling]

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:10.250
[gasping] Wait,
what is Boruto doing?!

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:11.084
No!

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.190
This is my big chance!
I'll settle it right now!

00:14:23.564 --> 00:14:24.698
[confused snarling]

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:25.866
[gasping]

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:27.568
[yelping]

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:30.771
[struggling]

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:37.143
[growling]

00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:38.178
Boruto!

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.554
It's no good.
It won't work!

00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:49.322
Try to get free, Boruto!

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.526
My...chakra is...

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:57.698
[roaring]

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.032
[grunting]

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.133
If this keeps up...

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.935
You can't have Boruto!

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:11.712
[snarling]

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.814
All right... It's time!

00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:16.216
[growling]

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:29.329
I saved the very best
for last! Rasengan!

00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:33.634
[snarling]

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.301
[yelling]

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.470
Feel the power that
was passed on to me

00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:38.739
by the Professor,

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.140
Lord Third Hokage,

00:15:40.173 --> 00:15:42.342
and Big Brother Naruto!

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.150
A‐ Amazing!

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:52.519
He did it!

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.256
[exhaling]

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:03.764
<i>You absolutely must not</i>
<i>overestimate your strength.</i>

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.465
Come on, let's go.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:09.603
<i>Greater strength will be</i>
<i>required from here on out.</i>

00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:13.406
Yeah, I know, all right?

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.286
What are those?!

00:16:28.689 --> 00:16:29.756
Those are...

00:16:30.691 --> 00:16:32.192
I knew it...

00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:34.260
It's inside cocoons just
like these that

00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.196
the White Zetsu
are produced.

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:38.965
Don't tell me
every cocoon contains...

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.934
one of those monsters?!

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.537
No, that doesn't seem
to be the case.

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:51.411
Yes, they're decomposed.

00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:02.222
It seems we've come as far in
as we can go.

00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:04.791
What if there are more
White Zetsu lurking in there

00:17:04.825 --> 00:17:06.092
behind this barrier?

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.194
If so, we'll just have
to fight them

00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:09.429
as hard as we can,

00:17:09.462 --> 00:17:11.698
using the same strategy
as before.

00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:13.399
Don't let your guard down...

00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:21.041
[gasping]

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:33.386
Wait, those are...

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.355
Make sure you don't
touch those flames!

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.357
Why, what's the deal
with them?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.391
Who knows?

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:43.096
What are those
flat‐looking black flames?

00:17:44.965 --> 00:17:47.133
Almost everything in here
is burning...!

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.603
This is...Amaterasu!

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:50.704
[gasping]

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.606
And what exactly is that?

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:54.074
It's Sasuke's doing...

00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:56.109
Flames that only one man
can control,

00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:59.646
that can completely
burn anything, Amaterasu!

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.781
I knew it.

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:06.520
It looks like there were
several dozen of them in here.

00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:09.222
If Sasuke hadn't gotten
here first,

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.692
then all of us
would've been goners...

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:14.294
Are you saying he destroyed
them all by himself?

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:17.430
Yeah... The White Zetsu
creature that we encountered

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.700
must've somehow managed
to escape the attack

00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:21.067
and survive.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.770
So Sarada's dad was
down here?! But why?!

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:25.972
What was he doing
in here?

00:18:26.006 --> 00:18:26.472
[sighing]

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.577
I guess I have no choice
since you've seen this much.

00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:32.513
Sasuke's been out on
a top‐secret mission

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:33.747
all by himself,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.950
tracking down any remnants
of Kaguya Otsutsuki.

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:38.451
Top‐secret mission?

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:40.286
He said it's a very
important duty

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.955
that only he can fulfill.

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:43.223
But hold on a minute.

00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:44.858
Where is your dad now, then?

00:18:44.891 --> 00:18:45.992
Well, you see...

00:18:46.026 --> 00:18:47.460
With the power of
his Rinnegan,

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:49.930
he can travel through
time and space.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.699
He's probably far away
by now.

00:18:52.733 --> 00:18:53.700
[sighing]

00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:55.536
Whoa... So awesome!

00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:57.971
[chuckling] You bet
he's awesome.

00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:00.607
Sasuke is Lord Seventh's
lifelong rival

00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:01.608
and the only person that

00:19:01.642 --> 00:19:03.710
he truly considers
to be his equal.

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:06.446
Uh...he's Dad's rival?

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:09.616
That's right.
My parent said so too.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.885
And that he doesn't
receive any accolades,

00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:14.054
but that
he's the supreme ninja

00:19:14.087 --> 00:19:17.490
who watches over the Leaf
from the shadows.

00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:19.693
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>The supreme Ninja.</i>

00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:33.940
So thanks to Sasuke,

00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:35.576
you guys ended up
safe n' sound,

00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:36.743
huh, Konohamaru?

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:38.044
Yeah.

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:39.746
But one thing, Lord Seventh...

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.981
I know you're just a clone,

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.482
but why come all
the way out here?

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:44.250
Well... I just can't ignore

00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:46.820
anything that has to
do with Kaguya.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:48.321
But at the same time...

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:51.091
I can't believe you found
a ruin here, too...

00:19:51.124 --> 00:19:53.694
You mean...
there are others?

00:19:53.727 --> 00:19:54.661
Yeah...

00:19:54.695 --> 00:19:56.462
Judging by that
one's appearance,

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.031
if Kaguya was
getting something

00:19:58.064 --> 00:19:59.332
like these guys ready,

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.535
she must've been
expecting a serious battle

00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:03.436
with some formidable enemies.

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:03.870
[gasping]

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:07.073
An enemy that can only
be confronted

00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:09.810
by an army of monsters
like these?

00:20:09.843 --> 00:20:12.112
I wonder what kind of
foe that could be...

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:13.246
I don't know.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.548
But it looks like

00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:16.717
we're gonna have our hands
full once again.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:25.325
So we're just gonna be
left in the dark, after all.

00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:26.727
It can't be helped.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.630
That's just part of what
it's like to be a genin.

00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:31.231
Well, I don't like it
one bit!

00:20:31.264 --> 00:20:32.432
I mean, don't they know
that we‐‐

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:34.568
We fought too,
is that it?

00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:37.137
But still, even when
it really counted,

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.105
we simply didn't have
enough power.

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:40.707
Neither one of us did...

00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.908
[sighing]

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.411
Konohamaru Sensei said
that we're not supposed

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:48.448
to say a word about this.
Not to anyone at all.

00:20:48.481 --> 00:20:50.717
That means Lord Seventh
and the Leaf higher‐ups

00:20:50.751 --> 00:20:52.953
are gonna handle the rest
of this from here on out.

00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:58.191
<i>Sasuke is Lord Seventh's</i>
<i>lifelong rival</i>

00:20:58.224 --> 00:20:59.593
<i>and the only person that</i>

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.695
<i>he truly considers to</i>
<i>be his equal.</i>

00:21:03.329 --> 00:21:05.766
<i>(thinking) Power that</i>
<i>all the grown‐ups...</i>

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:08.802
<i>everyone, even Dad...</i>

00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:10.436
will have to acknowledge.

00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:17.844
<i>I still don't have enough...</i>

00:23:18.098 --> 00:23:19.900
Seems I've finally arrived.

00:23:24.505 --> 00:23:28.208
What should we do,
Lord Momoshiki?

00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:31.377
I thought it would be
a fool's errand.

00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:33.046
[chuckling]

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.581
Well, then...

00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:37.651
Why don't we go and
greet our visitor?

00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:46.960
In the Chunin Exams,

00:23:46.993 --> 00:23:49.462
we can show Lord Seventh
what we've got!

00:23:49.495 --> 00:23:50.831
So what do ya say?

00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:52.332
Okay, already...

00:23:52.365 --> 00:23:54.367
I'll just ace the exam,
wow everyone,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.702
and make them all see

00:23:55.736 --> 00:23:58.471
that Boruto Uzumaki
has finally arrived!

00:23:58.505 --> 00:23:59.906
But before all of that,

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.142
there's something important
that I have to do.

00:24:02.175 --> 00:24:03.476
What's that?

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.613
Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:06.647 --> 00:24:08.448
"Himawari's Birthday"

00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.884
I gotta check on
an important promise.
