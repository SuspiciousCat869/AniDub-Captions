WEBVTT

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:39.834
There, now you look just a
little more handsome.

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.300
At least show me the steps!

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:52.767
Idiot. Figuring it out yourself
is the most valuable part of
training.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.900
And that's a bigger drag.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:57.000
Huh?

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.934
[groans] What the
hell is he doing?

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.734
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.834
[roars]

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.967
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:11.967
[barks]

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:14.734
What's that? Graffiti or
something?

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.667
Your aesthetics are old
fashioned, Dad!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.834
[grunting]

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:22.167
Set your heart on fire!

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:23.900
Yes, Poppa!

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.134
Okay, any minute now.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.867
Yep, it's on!

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.067
Hmm.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.667
Boruto! Don't get carried away
with your antics, ya know?

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.867
Hah! But that's what I do!

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:46.600
A Shadow Clone?!

00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:48.067
I'm up here!

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:49.767
Stop! Boruto!

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
It's gonna take a whole lot more
than that to catch me!

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:04.167
Idiots just don't give up.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.967
Uh.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.100
Shh!

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.767
[grunts] Sarada!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.634
Uh, Lord Seventh!

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.067
Have you happened to see Boruto
recently?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.634
He went that way.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.100
Thank you!

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.967
If anyone should thank you,
Sarada, it's me.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.067
[sighs]

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.600
Damn it. Getting so upset over a
little graffiti on the Great
Stone Faces.

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:42.900
He is such a stupid old man.

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:46.434
You just wanted him
to come after you.

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:50.467
You think this is the only way
you can ever get him to pay you
more attention.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.300
You're completely wrong! I was
only playing a game of tag with
him, that's all!

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:57.867
Trying to break the record, from
the last time we played!

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.500
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu...

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:08.967
Boruto. Don't make too much
trouble for Lord Seventh.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.700
The Hokage is a very busy man,
as are all of his advisors, like
me.

00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:15.100
Damn it.

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:18.667
Lord Hokage sure has it rough
having to deal with a
troublemaker like you.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.767
That was just a Shadow Clone!
The real stupid old man went
back to work ages ago.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.600
If Lord Seventh bothered to use
his Sage Mode, he would find you
in a flash!

00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:32.467
Of course I know that! And
that's why I was just gonna keep
running away...

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.800
until Dad finally got serious
about catching me himself!

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:38.834
So neither father nor son know
when to quit.

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:42.534
It's amazing how alike you and
Naruto really are.

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:46.367
Don't you ever lump me together
with my Dad! [grunting]

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.800
Shikadai, go and get Lord
Seventh's shadow clone.

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:51.700
Huh? Why do I have to go?

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:53.967
What? Are you gonna
take over here?

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:59.267
[sighs] Fine, but this
is such a drag.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.967
It seems like the both of us are
alike too.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.734
It's a drag for me as
well, so hurry it up!

00:05:55.534 --> 00:05:57.967
All right! Let us
run with spirit!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.734
Yes!

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:01.100
Next up, cliff‐climbing!

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:02.067
Yes, Poppa!

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:08.500
<i>(Cho‐Cho) If you're not gonna</i>
<i>eat it, I'm gonna.</i>

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:11.900
Okay. You can
keep ignoring me.

00:06:12.734 --> 00:06:15.400
Everyone's getting
along so well.

00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:19.734
But then I guess our
graduation exam is still a ways
off, so...

00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:21.634
Oh, that's what you're talking
about?

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:25.834
If the test would make me lose
weight, I might be excited about
it.

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:28.434
But I really hadn't given it
much thought.

00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:31.700
And what's the big deal about
becoming a ninja?

00:06:31.734 --> 00:06:34.400
Is that really what everybody
wants to be?

00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:39.500
I mean just think of the actual
word. "Ninja" sounds pretty
lame.

00:06:39.534 --> 00:06:41.867
What's all this about?

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:44.634
Did something happen to you?

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.900
Not really.

00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:50.767
Anyway what are you going to do
after this? I have the whole day
to myself, so lets hang out!

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.734
Well, actually...

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.100
I think I kinda promised my Dad
that I would train with him for
a while later today.

00:06:59.134 --> 00:07:01.334
Yeah, I get it.

00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:04.367
Of course, I'm totally not even
interested in training with him.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.900
I have zero desire to
go whatsoever, but, you know...

00:07:09.534 --> 00:07:10.800
You should go with him.

00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:12.800
Huh?!

00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:14.767
After all, you don't
want to fail the exam.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.000
You think you're better than me
now?

00:07:17.034 --> 00:07:20.300
And you know that attitude
really gets on my nerves.

00:07:20.334 --> 00:07:23.667
Of course you think because you
come from the one and only
Uchiha Clan...

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.700
that you don't have to worry
about training for the exam like
the rest of us.

00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:29.767
That's got nothing to do with
it.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:32.867
Then what the heck
is this all about!

00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:38.967
It's special...training with
your Dad.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.534
Cho‐Cho!

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:43.534
I'm right over here!

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:46.600
Damn, he's so embarrassing.

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:49.600
But what's so embarrassing about
a grown‐up walking around
enjoying a bag of chips?

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:50.734
He's such a poser.

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:54.834
<i>(Cho‐Cho) See those lightly</i>
<i>salted chips? That's for show.</i>

00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:57.734
He eats the consomme
flavored ones at home.

00:07:57.767 --> 00:08:01.000
Truth is, the two of us really
don't see eye to eye.

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:02.867
[chuckles] Oh, that's it.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:08.134
Cho‐Cho! I'm over here! Come
on! Turn around, I'm over here!

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.900
Huh?

00:08:09.934 --> 00:08:11.867
Guess she didn't hear me.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.400
We're not alike in any way.
You'd never know he's my dad.

00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:17.834
Isn't it obvious that we're
totally different?

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.834
I'd have to think about that.

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:24.100
Well what's it like
in your family?

00:08:24.134 --> 00:08:25.767
My...my family?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.800
Are you and your dad
really similar?

00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:34.667
I really don't know. I can't
even clearly remember him.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.867
I haven't seen him in such a
long time.

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:46.434
Where are you, and what are you
doing?

00:08:47.634 --> 00:08:49.867
[rubbing eye]

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:51.667
<i>(Sakura) I'm home!</i>

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.167
I am so tired!

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.800
Welcome home.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.667
Is something wrong?

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.567
My eyes got blurry
all of a sudden.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.100
It happens every once
in a while now.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.800
Let me see!

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.434
Uh.

00:09:09.034 --> 00:09:11.734
Uh, they just got a little
blurry for a second.

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:16.500
There, it's better now. Maybe I
just need a new prescription for
my glasses.

00:09:16.534 --> 00:09:20.000
I'll go make an appointment
right away for an eye exam.

00:09:20.034 --> 00:09:24.267
It's really not a big deal. You
should worry more about
yourself!

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.734
You're the one who works too
hard all the time.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.067
I was wondering...

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.600
Yeah?

00:09:39.634 --> 00:09:42.934
So does Dad...have to wear
glasses like I do?

00:09:42.967 --> 00:09:46.434
Why would you ask
such a question?

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:50.767
Well you don't need glasses, so
I was just wondering if maybe my
eyesight came from Dad.

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:55.800
Does your eyesight
come from him? Maybe.

00:09:55.834 --> 00:09:57.500
That's your answer?

00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:00.434
You don't seem to know much
about your own husband.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:04.467
What's going on? You've been
acting weird lately.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.967
When is Dad's super important
mission supposed to end?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.734
Well, I think it'll end
someday in the future.

00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:14.367
Of course you wouldn't know.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.800
You don't even know if he ever
had to wear prescription
glasses.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.834
[chuckles] That's kind of harsh,
Sarada.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.867
<i>(Sarada) What's wrong with</i>
<i>wanting to know a little about</i>
<i>my Dad?</i>

00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:45.467
[sighs] "The noble Uchiha Clan.
It's bloodline ranks among the
most venerable."

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.167
"Many highly skilled ninja hail
from this family."

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.400
<i>(Sarada) "The ability to wield</i>
<i>the Sharingan is considered</i>
<i>their greatest trait."</i>

00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:56.467
"Even among the clan, the
Sharingan awakens in the eyes of
very few members...

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.167
enabling them to see through
taijutsu, genjutsu, and
ninjutsu."

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.967
<i>"The rare Mangekyo Sharingan</i>
<i>manifests itself in a pattern</i>
<i>different from the others."</i>

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.600
The Sharingan, huh?

00:11:11.634 --> 00:11:14.767
I wonder if it ever manifested
in Dad...

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:22.300
"And furthermore, the Sharingan
awakens as a result of deep
emotional trauma."

00:11:22.334 --> 00:11:26.534
"Acute emotions cause the brain
to release a unique form of
chakra...

00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:33.100
that affects the optic nerve,
and transforms the eye into the
Sharingan."

00:11:33.134 --> 00:11:38.234
(Sarada) "Due to grave
misfortune, the Uchiha Clan
nearly lost its entire lineage."

00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:44.400
<i>"At the present time, the only</i>
known family members still alive
<i>to carry on the bloodline...</i>

00:11:44.434 --> 00:11:50.000

<i>child, a daughter."</i>

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.100
[rubbing eye]

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.034
Excuse me, may I see the volume
of data pertaining to Sasuke
Uchiha?

00:12:04.067 --> 00:12:06.867
Sure! Hold on just one minute!

00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:11.234
Huh.

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:14.900
It seems access to materials
specifically about Sasuke Uchiha
has been restricted.

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:18.667
<i>(Sarada) Restricted? Does that</i>
<i>mean I can't see them?</i>

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.767
Why not?

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.234
Who knows? I didn't make the
rules so I couldn't say.

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:28.767
You could fill out a request,
but I really doubt the answer
will change.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.000
No, it's all right.

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:45.000
Mom?

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:49.567
Huh?

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.634
Can I ask you something?

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:52.734
Of course you can!

00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:55.667
Why hasn't Dad decided to
come back home yet?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.667
You know where he's been all
this time and what he's been
doing, don't you?

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.000
So we're back on that again?

00:13:02.834 --> 00:13:05.767
[sighs] I wonder what he's up
to.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.934
What's the matter?

00:13:08.967 --> 00:13:11.567
Please don't avoid my question.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.100
Every time I ask, you just tell
me you don't know. How can you
call yourself his wife?

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:20.800
Sarada, Right now I...

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.367
I need to know. Are you actually
married to my father?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.700
[gasps] Why are you so full of
questions all of a sudden?

00:13:34.734 --> 00:13:38.034
It's not sudden! I've been
wondering for ages!

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:41.000
Did you think you could
just lie to me forever?

00:13:41.034 --> 00:13:45.967
You've been acting kind of weird
all day!

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.367
What's weird is the relationship
you have with my Dad!

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.734
And it's not just kind of weird,
it's definitely weird!

00:13:53.134 --> 00:13:54.967
Sarada!

00:13:58.834 --> 00:13:59.734
[trying not to cry]

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:02.400
[gasps] [sighs]

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.267
(Sakura) I am so sorry I raised
<i>my voice.</i>

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.834
Your father is on a mission. But
it will end one day.

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:12.600
And then he'll come home!

00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:15.734
You still believe that will
happen?

00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:18.600
But you've been apart for such a
long time now!

00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:23.400
Maybe he doesn't even remember
he has a family back home
anymore!

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.867
[crying]

00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:35.467
Your Dad and I, our feelings
connect us to each other. So
don't worry!

00:14:36.567 --> 00:14:40.100
You always sound so confident,
but how can you be sure?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.767
Huh?

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.867
Huh?

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:57.867
No way! The loan's not paid off!
[grunts]

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:07.367
There, there. Well, she always
has been prone to fainting.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.667
We've been very busy lately. I
guess the fatigue finally caught
up with her.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.734
I bet you she'll be fine in two
or three days.

00:15:14.767 --> 00:15:17.767
Shizune, I told
her terrible things.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.167
The loan...

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.534
[chuckles]

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:25.900
I'm going to admit her into the
hospital. Do you want to come
with us?

00:15:25.934 --> 00:15:27.734
I'll meet you there later.

00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:31.400
I want to pull some important
things out of here before I
leave.

00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:36.467
I found it! [chuckles]

00:15:43.134 --> 00:15:44.800
[gasps]

00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:52.600
[gasping]

00:15:52.634 --> 00:15:55.034
[gasping]

00:15:56.634 --> 00:16:00.834
Who is this? Why's she with my
Dad?

00:16:00.867 --> 00:16:03.500
<i>(Sarada) A woman wearing</i>
<i>glasses...</i>

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:23.667
<i>(Shizune) Now I see.</i>

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.634
You were looking for
pictures of your Dad!

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:27.900
[gasps] That's not
what I was doing!

00:16:27.934 --> 00:16:31.800
That photograph was taken a
really long time ago.

00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:36.400
Do you know what my father
looks like nowadays?

00:16:36.434 --> 00:16:42.600
Oh right. You haven't seen him
since you were a baby. It's been
years now.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:47.834
Yeah. There's something I'd like
to ask you, Miss Shizune.

00:16:47.867 --> 00:16:50.600
<i>(Sarada) Please don't tell my</i>
<i>Mom.</i>

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.467
Well of course Sakura
is your real mother!

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.534
Fine! Then could you please tell
me a few details about my
birth!?

00:16:57.567 --> 00:17:01.434
I would like to know who
delivered me and who was
present when I was born.

00:17:02.534 --> 00:17:04.434
Uh, that was...

00:17:04.467 --> 00:17:07.834
Your response is just the same
as everybody else's.

00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:09.767
[sympathetic sigh]

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.467
I checked every hospital.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.467
And now I know that there are no
records of my birth anywhere in
the Hidden Leaf.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.267
That doesn't mean anything.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.934
Anyway, why are you so
interested in this all of a
sudden?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.234
<i>(Sarada) Because of her. She's</i>
<i>wearing the same glasses...</i>

00:17:28.267 --> 00:17:30.767
...that I wear.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.434
<i>(Choji) [eating sounds]</i>

00:17:37.467 --> 00:17:40.500
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Dad! I told you to</i>
<i>stop that already!</i>

00:17:40.534 --> 00:17:44.767
Could you not super‐size things
when you're out with your
daughter?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.134
[chewing]

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:48.800
[chuckles]

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.834
More importantly, why would
anyone eat such things so early
in the morning?

00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:56.967
Well, no matter how careful you
are, when you die, you die.
That's just life.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.267
Not that I'd ever
eat that stuff.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.000
[mouth full] Cho‐Cho, you're
still a child!

00:18:01.034 --> 00:18:03.467
You need to eat more so you can
grow big and strong!

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.700
I think I'm already bigger than
most of my classmates are, Dad.

00:18:07.734 --> 00:18:09.434
And look Mom...

00:18:11.067 --> 00:18:13.834
You need to seriously dial back
that condescending, know‐it‐all
attitude of yours.

00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:15.767
[grunts]

00:18:17.267 --> 00:18:20.734
You've made me so mad I'm
hungry again! Now I'll just have
to have seconds!

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.967
[grunting] Oh!

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.667
Sarada!

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.767
Oh, hello there!

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.800
[slurping]

00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:33.800
A troubled mind can spoil any
appetite, or so they say. And
it's true!

00:18:34.567 --> 00:18:37.334
Oh, so you're feeling troubled?

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:42.734
Hey Sarada, if I tell you
something can you keep it just
between us?

00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:44.734
Uh‐huh, what is it?

00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:50.434
I have a feeling that the two
people over there aren't
actually my real parents.

00:18:50.967 --> 00:18:51.834
Uh.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.500
I mean look at them. I don't
look anything like either of
them.

00:18:57.634 --> 00:19:00.267
Uh... You think so?

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.167
Once when I was little, I got
sick and started running a
really high fever...

00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:09.500
[panting]

00:19:09.534 --> 00:19:13.667
Oh! I can't believe you got
this! I bet it took some time.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.000
Well let's hurry up
and give it to her!

00:19:16.034 --> 00:19:20.967
Cho‐Cho, here's your medicine.
You're gonna be all right now.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.967
[panting]

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.800
Get better soon, all right?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.400
[sighs] Thanks a lot. Thanks.

00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:38.800
I can still remember just how
his hand felt since he touched
my head.

00:19:38.834 --> 00:19:44.834
I've believed ever since that
that handsome, manly man, had to
be my real father.

00:19:45.567 --> 00:19:47.367
Sure.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.967
That's what's called the "tragic
heroine syndrome."

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.167
What?

00:19:53.534 --> 00:19:56.634
A condition that
subconsciously occurs in
girls, of a certain age...

00:19:56.667 --> 00:19:58.400
when attempting to define who
they are.

00:19:58.434 --> 00:20:02.367
Who do you think you are,
Mitsuki? What's with that
condescending tone?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.500
You couldn't begin to understand
the mind of a delicate maiden,
right Sarada?

00:20:07.534 --> 00:20:12.700
I can tell without even having
to look at your crest, that
you're from the Akimichi Clan.

00:20:12.734 --> 00:20:14.867
So don't worry!

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.700
Get lost you insensitive jerk!

00:20:17.734 --> 00:20:21.567
Damn it! I'm actually worrying
even while I sit here.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.934
I get it.

00:20:23.967 --> 00:20:27.934
Realizing you don't know the
truth about your own mom and
dad.

00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:31.834
No kidding, right? Of course you
get it, you're my best friend!

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.434
[sighs]

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:36.934
So anyway, I kind of have a
favor to ask of my best friend.

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:38.734
Are you willing to hear me out?

00:20:38.767 --> 00:20:39.867
What do you need?

00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:43.267
Well you see, I'm thinking of
going on a journey.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.000
I'm going to find out who my
real mom and dad are.

00:20:46.034 --> 00:20:48.667
And naturally you'll be coming
along, right?

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.734
[gasps]

00:20:49.767 --> 00:20:51.900
What's the matter?

00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:55.600
That's it! That's the answer!

00:20:55.634 --> 00:20:57.467
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Sarada?</i>

00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:02.034
Why didn't I ever think of this
<i>before?</i>

00:21:02.067 --> 00:21:06.534
<i>I just have to find my dad and</i>
<i>ask him about it directly!</i>

00:21:06.567 --> 00:21:08.334
If you want to know
about Sasuke...

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:11.467
maybe you should talk to
Lord Seventh about him.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.134
We'll leave just as soon
as we get packed! Okay?
Did you get that?

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.767
<i>I'm going to wring it out of</i>
<i>him! Every last detail!</i>

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:42.867
[panting]

00:21:53.467 --> 00:21:54.734
Hmm?

00:21:58.034 --> 00:21:59.900
[sighs]

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Who was that kid?</i>

00:23:48.534 --> 00:23:51.367
<i>Am I like a fair maiden who</i>
<i>everyone's fighting over?</i>

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.500
<i>(Naruto) Nah, it's probably</i>
<i>Sarada that they're after.</i>

00:23:54.534 --> 00:23:58.367
<i>(Sarada) Do you know who they</i>
<i>are? He said he was from the</i>
<i>Uchiha Clan.</i>

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.467
(Naruto) Listen, you don't have
<i>to worry about a thing, okay?</i>

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.734
I think both of you should come
<i>with me. That'll be the safest</i>
<i>option.</i>

00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:10.734
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: The Boy with the</i>
<i>Sharingan.</i>

00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:14.000
<i>Besides I want to take you to</i>
<i>see Sasuke.</i>
