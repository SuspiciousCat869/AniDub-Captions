It's not fair. We were ordered
to return...

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.127
to the Hidden Leaf
Village immediately...

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.264
But Dad gets to stay behind a
little while longer...

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.767
Well, it does make sense.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.070
The Five Kage have to attend
Lord Ohnoki's funeral, right?

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.740
And simply put, we're outsiders.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.408
Right, the Old Man's funeral...

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:25.045
Too bad we couldn't attend, huh?

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:28.248
Well, yeah... (SIGH)
Aw, man.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:32.085
And Mitsuki's locked up in whole
a different railcar too!

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.629
We didn't have a chance to talk
to him before we left...

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:23.070
(SAD SIGH)

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:29.109
Damn, you know what? I
realized when we get back...

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.578
we're gonna have to face Moegi
Sensei's wrath...

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:32.713
(SHOCKED)

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.414
Come on, don't remind me!

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:38.752
I deliberately made myself
forget about that!

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.254
Yeah, it's gonna suck.

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:43.590
But, I guess that we gotta go
home at some point!

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:45.092
You sure got that right.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:48.262
Ino-Shika-Cho always lives and
dies together.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:51.565
Oh, please! Give me a break,
would ya?

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:55.602
I'm totally craving all the
awesome sweets from back home!

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:56.570
Even while you're eating?!

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.772
(lLAUGHTER)

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.574
(CHUCKLING) But seriously,
guys.. .

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.577
sweets go into a different part
of the stomach, okay?!

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.612
[SHIKADAI] Here, Cho-Cho, you
<i>can have my lunch.</i>

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:08.081
<i>[CHO-CHO] Score!! (CHUCKLE)</i>
<i>Thanks for the food!</i>

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.295
This is a really strange
feeling.

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:24.598
I always kinda figured that the
old man couldn't be killed.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.767
If only I'd been able to do
something more...

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.069
then this might not've happened.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.705
No, you're wrong, Lady Fourth!
That's not true!

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:35.409
Because of what he went through,
Lord Ohnoki was able...

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.579
to rediscover his true will at
the end.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:39.580
(EMOTIONAL)

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.615
I see...

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.651
That's right. And he also left
an important lesson behind

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.253
for all of us, as well!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.923
It's important that we protect
the Shinobi World...

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.091
with our own hands.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.126
And in order to do so...

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.596
we're going to have to nurture
the youth of our villages.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.632
That task lies with those of us
<i>still alive now.</i>

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:02.269
<i>That is our duty.</i>

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.270
Although...

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.240
I'm sure that we lost a lot of
trust because of this situation.

00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:08.775
So it'll take some time to
regain that.

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.544
The villages must become one
again.

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:11.912
To tell you the truth...

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.448
I don't think you have to worry
about that.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.382

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.424
(SHOCKED) Look at all
the people who came...!

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.428
Goes to show just how immense

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:31.098
a legacy the old lord left
behind for us.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:34.268
Lord Third!

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.538
I may not look like much, but...
I vow to become...

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.040
...a strong shinobi who'll
protect the Stone!

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:41.575
(EMOTIONAL)

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:43.043
I'll carry out your will...

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.578
(EMOTIONAL) Lord Third!

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.587
We have...

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:57.124
...the strongest and hardest
will in the whole world.

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.594
And we'll continue to carry on
that will...

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:02.596
...won't we?

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.139

Boruto! (EMOTIONAL) D'you know
how worried we were?!

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:37.264
I'm really sorry, mom, but...
at least... I'm okay.

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:40.300
(EMOTIONAL) You had us all so
concerned...

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:53.413
Uh, hey, um, I'm home!

[SARADA] <i>Mom...</i>

00:06:56.984 --> 00:07:00.287
Um, listen, I'm sorry
that I made you worry!

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:02.289
Idiot!

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:05.292
(EMOTIONAL) I was so worried!

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:14.134
(CHUCKLE-SOB) I'm home!

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.740
[SA] <i>Mitsuki's been placed in</i>
<i>solitary.</i>

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:23.977
In reality, he's a hero who
prevented a terrible calamity...

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:26.947
but we've got to keep up
appearances, I guess...

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.449
Also... what about Boruto and
Sarada?

00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:31.285
Yeah well, they, uh...

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:33.954
[NARUTO] They didn't turn
their backs on their friend...

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.290
and risked their lives to save
<i>him.</i>

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:39.459
So to be honest, what I want
to do is praise them.

00:07:39.493 --> 00:07:40.460
Naruto!

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.464
You're back from the Stone
already!

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:46.433
But, of course...

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.303
you do realize we can't actually
do what you said, right?

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:51.138
(SIGH) Yeah.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.616
We've been stripped of our rank
of genin?

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.117
Whatever your reasons were...

00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:07.120
you're guilty of leaving the
Leaf without permission.

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.122
So this is to be expected.

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:11.158
Yeah...

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.793

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.595

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:16.630
(CURIOUS)

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.633
Mitsuki is being debriefed.
When will he be done?

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.069
Yeah, well, uh...

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:24.938
There's still a lot of critical
intel to be had...

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.940
and he's the only one that knows
it.

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:27.941
Oh, I see.

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:30.110
(FRUSTRATED)

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:32.613
Hold on. You gotta leave your
headbands here.

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.147
(SHOCKED)

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.161
Please excuse me.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.438
[SAI] <i>So, you're saying that you</i>
<i>went with them...</i>

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:01.575
...in order to investigate what
they were planning to do?

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:04.278
Yes. If I'd captured them
right away...

00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:07.447
we couldn't have found out who
the mastermind was.

00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:09.950
So instead you chose to walk
into the heart of...

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.319
enemy territory? Yes?

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:13.120
I'm sorry.

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:17.124
I ended up getting so many
people mixed up in all of this.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.393
Well, the fact is...

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:23.163
that your actions did prevent a
worst-case scenario.

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:26.133
Although... why didn't you at
least say something to me?

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.436
I'm so sorry. I just...

00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:33.307
Before he left the Hidden Leaf
Village...

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.443
he had ample opportunity to ask
others to help him out.

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:39.279
But he didn't. He came on his
own to meet us.

00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:41.448
[KU] <i>He was happy to find others</i>
<i>like himself...</i>

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.984
<i>He couldn't ignore his</i>
<i>curiosity...</i>

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.653
about getting a chance to meet
<i>real comrades.</i>

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:47.621
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:53.460
For the sake of truth. And the
Village...

00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:57.164
But maybe those weren't the only
reasons...

00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:00.300
(TOWN CHATTER)

00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:03.270
(SIGH) I wonder what's gonna
happen to Team 7 now...

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.938
This isn't like you!

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:07.774
The three of us will just start
over, right?

00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:09.309
Don't you get it, Boruto?!

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:12.446
It's possible we might not see
Mitsuki again!

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.982
(GASP) What are you
talking about?

00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:16.783
You think he's gonna get kicked
out of the Village?

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.418
It's not just the Leaf.

00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:20.988
It's possible he'll have to face
consequences...

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:22.623
for causing chaos
in the Stone, too.

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.124
I won't let that happen!

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:26.493
If it does, then I'll... ask Dad
to-!

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:28.295
There's more.

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:30.264
He might decide to leave the
village on his own...

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.466
(SHOCKED) He wouldn't
do something like that!

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.068
But how can you be so sure?

00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:37.271
There are many sides to a
person, right?

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.439
And what we see isn't
everything.

00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:41.441
We just learned that all too
well -

00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:42.576
Sarada!

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:46.146
Mitsuki's gonna be fine.
(SIGH) I'm going home.

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:53.620
UZUMAKI

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.627
It's possible we might not see
Mitsuki again!

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:02.462
(LANDING)

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:06.967
No, she's wrong. This is the
place where he belongs.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:14.474
I gotta talk to him...

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:17.444
(SAD SIGH) Mitsuki...

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:24.451
Where am I? (CURIOUS)

00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:26.286
<i>Hey, brat!</i>

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:31.925
Garaga!

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:35.329
I wanted to come say my
goodbyes...

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.296
"Goodbyes?"

00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:41.301
Yeah.... I mean, our Summoning
Contract is done now, right?

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:43.103
That was the whole agreement

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:46.139
we made in the first place,
wasn't it?

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:49.409
Oh, right... Mitsuki's back in
the village...

00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:52.813
But I still haven't been able
to have a good talk with him...

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:55.782
Huh?! You're not scared, are
you?

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:57.284
Quit making excuses

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:59.953
and just go settle it once and
for all, brat!

00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:03.257
(ANNOYED) Yeah,
Gimme a break! I know!

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.992
I don't care what he was
thinking!

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:07.294
Mitsuki is Mitsuki!
He always will be!

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:12.165
If you already know that, you
don't need me anymore, do you?

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:14.201
Thank you, Garaga!

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.271
We weren't together long, but
still, I owe you.

00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:20.440
(CHUCKLE) Well,...
good riddance, brat!

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:22.442
Hey, Garaga!

00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:25.145
About that old partner of
yours...

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.448
Guess there are people foolish
enough...

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:30.817
to trust a friend till the
end...

00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:33.120
It could be that he, too...

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:40.460
(ANNOYED) I've said too
much! Anyway, see ya, Boruto!

00:12:40.494 --> 00:12:43.830
Take care of yourself, ya
got that?!

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:46.166
I will. You do the same,
Garaga!

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.141
Okay then...

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:58.278
...I won't be able to see Garaga
anymore. And also...

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.281
<i>Boruto!</i>

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:05.252
Boruto! C'mon, wake up,
already!

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.254
(SITTING UP) Sarada, what-?

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.622
What are you doing here?!

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:10.457
Never mind that!

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.460
It seems Mitsuki's debriefing is
finally over!

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:14.461
Really?

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.298
No, Mitsuki's not here. He left
already.

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.000
Where is he now?

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:21.702
Sorry, I don't know.

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:26.139
Wait, actually, he said he had
something important to do...

00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:28.275
He isn't planning on leaving the
village, is he?

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:32.246
No, he wouldn't! Either way,
let's just go and find him.

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.114
All right, let's split up and
look.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:47.461
I've never actually made one of
these before...

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:50.764
...so I'm not sure if it's okay.

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:53.467
I don't even know if it's
something you guys would want.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.635
Maybe...

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:57.271
This is just for my own comfort.

00:13:57.304 --> 00:14:00.440
Well... it doesn't really
matter either way, right?

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.444
I'm doing it because it's
something I want to do.

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:08.982
Sekiei, I'm returning to the
place I belong.

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:12.452
And you'll get to be with your
friends forever.

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:28.268
Mitsuki...

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:32.773
(HEAVY BREATHING)

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:34.074
Boruto.

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.976
Mitsuki! Are you--?!

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:40.981
Boruto, it seems to me that I
owe you an apology.

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:45.085
Back then... Ku was correct.

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:48.155
I didn't go along with them just
to spy on them...

00:14:48.188 --> 00:14:51.992
and to figure out exactly what
they were planning on doing.

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:54.461
I wanted to know how I could
find my will.

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:58.966
And to see if my will was
something similar to yours.

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.467
I simply had to find out...

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.303
Mitsuki...

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:08.408
In the end, I did it for myself.
I was acting selfishly.

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:12.145
I kept everything a secret and I
ended up hurting you.

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:16.450
So I can't blame you if
you're...

00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:17.951
...angry.

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:20.454
Maybe I have no right to stay by
your side now...

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:24.291
Hey, do you remember the Old
Man's last words?

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.093
Huh?

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:28.662
He said there are lots of sides
to one's will.

00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:30.130
You remember that?

00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:33.433
Well, I think... what he
really meant by that is...

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:35.135
...it's natural to question
yourself...

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:37.771
or to not even know
exactly what your will is!

00:15:37.804 --> 00:15:38.906
(STUNNED)

00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:40.774
You wanted to save the Leaf
Village...

00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:43.277
and to learn more
about yourself.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.979
Both of those things are a
part of your will.

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:49.149
So both are my will?

00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:51.451
And there's something else, too!

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:54.121
You know, I thought I
knew all about you, Mitsuki.

00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:57.157
I was being just as smug as you
were!

00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:58.158
I see!

00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:02.262
Then it's okay for us to be
the way that we were?

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.298
No, not the way we were...

00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:05.632
(SHOCKED)

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:07.134
'Cause we're more connected now

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:10.938
with a stronger will than
before!

00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:12.606
Thanks for that, Boruto.

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:15.108
(CHUCKLE) Don't be so sappy!

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:18.111
I look forward to our future,
Mitsuki.

00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:20.113
Yes!

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.484
<i>The same goes for me, too,</i>
<i>right?</i>

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:26.320
Sarada!

00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:28.322
What the hell?! Were you
standing there watching us?!

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:29.957
(GIGGLE)

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.460
Well, the three of us do make up
Team 7, don't we?

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.928
Thank you, both of you!

00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:36.330
Although...

00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:39.166
don't forget we did get stripped
of our status as genin...

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.602
Hey, c'mon! Now's not the time
to bring that up!

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:44.905
(CHUCKLE)

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:53.113

00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:59.453
Countless experiences are
essential for a child...

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:02.823
if they're to fully grow into
an adult.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.958
Like meeting different kinds of
people...

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:06.960
and parting from them...

00:17:06.994 --> 00:17:10.130
At times one must become lost
and wander.

00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:11.798
You see...

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:14.635
what's important is that this
was a time of rebellion...

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:17.271
No, more like puberty.

00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:20.741
When you put it that way,
it seems like kind of a letdown.

00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:22.009
But anyway...

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:26.079
about that scientist, the one
advising Ohnoki...

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:28.115
Seems his body was never found.

00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:33.921
The technology behind
Fabrications...

00:17:33.954 --> 00:17:39.259
If not from me, then I wonder
where it could have come from?

00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:42.095
<i>I guess the evidence was</i>
<i>destroyed.</i>

00:17:42.129 --> 00:17:44.131
Seems so. Who do you think did
it?

00:17:44.965 --> 00:17:46.466
Who knows?

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.438
In any case, we should be very
careful moving forward.

00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:54.107
(TOWN CHATTER)

00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:57.110
It's been a really long
time since the three of us..

00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:59.112
got to just walk around together
like this.

00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:02.149
It feels the same as it used to,
though, doesn't it?!

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.785
[NEWSCASTER] The disturbance in
<i>the Hidden Stone Village...</i>

00:18:04.818 --> 00:18:07.454
...was due to a rebellion by
dissidents of the current

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:08.455
administration.

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:11.291
It was fully subdued by
Kurotsuchi...

00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:13.794
the Fourth and current
Tsuchikage.

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.996

the Third Tsuchikage, Ohnoki the

We are deeply indebted to all of
you.

00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:12.079
So I came here to apologize
and say, "thank you."

Uh, look, please raise your
head, ya know!

00:20:14.448 --> 00:20:19.286
No. By all rights, I owe you a
lot more than just a simple bow.

Mitsuki and the other genin...

00:20:23.156 --> 00:20:25.325
who knows what would've happened
to the Stone.

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:28.428

myself, if that's okay.

Well, uh... actually now's not
so good...

00:20:31.832 --> 00:20:33.166

if you would.

00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:39.439
