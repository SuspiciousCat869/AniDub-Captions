WEBVTT

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.275
(footsteps tapping)

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.743
Attention!

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.745
Starting today,
I'll be standing in

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:12.946
as the lord of the castle,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.082
and looking after
all you inmates!

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.283
-[Boruto] Standing in?
-(inmates murmuring)

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.619
What happened to Mr. Mujo?

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.354
[Benga] He's fallen ill.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.023
You're going to be leaving soon.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.825
Really, I am?

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.960
Your transfer to
Hozuki Castle Number 2

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.028
has been authorized.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.363
(Kokuri gasps)

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:33.033
By next week, you'll be
reunited with your old friends.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.668
[Kokuri] No, you can't do this!

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.470
Please, stop there! (wails)

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.740
This means we'll have to
do it before the transfer.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.941
Do what?

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.077
Take Kokuri and break
him out of this prison.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.312
Break him out?

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.983
(seagulls squawking)

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.031
(Mitsuki whistles)

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.367
(seagulls screeching)

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.478
They're coming.

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:21.548
All right. (grunts)

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.716
You, inmates!

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.084
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.421
(chuckles) Nothin'
at all, you know.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.324
(seagull squawks)

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:39.399
-(seagulls squawking)
-(wings fluttering)

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.474
(opening theme music)

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:52.513
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.598
(opening theme music)

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:29.610
(seagulls screeching)

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.715
Hey, how come we
have to be the ones

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.550
to clean all this mess up?

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:37.751
If you have any complaints,

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:41.388
tell them to the idiot who
left the window open in here!

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.257
Report to me once
you're finished.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.993
I'm not gonna let you out
of here until you're done.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.228
(door clatters)

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:49.596
That went quite well.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.631
Yeah.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:55.435
Time's running out so
we need to talk quickly.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.471
Kokuri, you'll be transferred

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.207
to Hozuki Castle
Number 2 in three days.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.609
So, we gotta break out
of here before then.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:06.079
Last time, where'd we leave off?

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:10.217
(moans) Thank you for
everything you're doing for me.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.086
But I can't simply leave
everything up to you guys.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.189
So I'll take care
of the clean-up!

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.926
Let's go over each
of the points again.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.827
There are three
things we have to do

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.396
to make sure we can break out.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.731
The first is to find
a safe escape route.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.767
So, Mitsuki, how's that going?

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.204
These guys checked
it out for us.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:33.574
(rock music)

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.182
(water gushing)

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.384
I think we found a route

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.620
where we can avoid
detection by the guards.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.956
All right. Then the second
is getting a boat

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:51.158
that can take us off
the island, Boruto?

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.260
For that, I think
the information

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.462
we got from Doragu
will come in handy.

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.200
(rock music)

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:02.236
Okay, listen, there
are two types of ships

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:05.038
that come and go, to
and from this island.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.907
One is the same transport ship

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.209
that originally
brought you here.

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:12.813
And the other one is the supply
ship that brings in food.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:15.215
Why do you wanna know, anyway?

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.184
Planning on stowing away?

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:20.220
Yeah, like I'd do
something that dangerous.

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:23.090
And the ship's next landing
is gonna be tomorrow morning.

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:25.325
[Sarada] So, in other
words, you only have

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:27.961
from tonight until
morning to break out.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:29.863
Then the third part
is how to release

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:32.966
the Celestial Prison
Jutsu placed on Kokuri.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.068
That's the part that's
got me the most worried.

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:36.803
You need a lot of fresh water

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.972
to undo the Celestial
Prison Jutsu.

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.174
(Kokuri chuckles nervously)

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:42.442
I'm so sorry for
all the trouble.

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:45.712
Getting the water ready was
your job, wasn't it, Sarada?

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.047
So, how's it coming along?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.382
Hey, that's why I asked you

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.184
to tamper with the
drinking water tank.

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:52.486
Did you seriously
forget about that?

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.122
Relax, we've already
got all of that covered.

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:56.690
Don't we, Mitsuki?

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.724
Mm-hmm.

00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:00.961
(toothbrush scratching)

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:03.363
(faucet squeaking)

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:07.935
-(snake hissing)
-(guard yelling)

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.236
(hatch clatters)

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:10.704
-(guard yells)
-(snakes hissing)

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.240
How did all them
get inside there?

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:15.509
But how does tampering
with the drinking water

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:19.613
help us release the
Celestial Prison Jutsu?

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.782
The area around the
aboveground water tank

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:23.217
is very heavily guarded.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.353
So, it'd be impossible to
get Kokuri close to it.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.722
We have to aim for
the underground tank.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.924
There's a water
tank underground?

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.492
When the potable
water is running low,

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.595
that tank is filled
up with sea water,

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:36.697
which is then desalinated.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.599
It's usually empty, but now...

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:42.369
Hurry up and get that
underground tank filled.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.172
Or else I'm gonna flush
you down the toilet.

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:46.240
Sir.

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:48.675
But isn't the security
going to be just as tight

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.277
around the spare tank, too?

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.312
Look next to it.

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:54.948
This is the old water tank.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:56.517
Their system was
changed five years ago,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.854
and it's no longer in use, so
security should be minimal.

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:02.990
The valve that'll divert
water to the old tank

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:04.758
is located in the courtyard.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.594
When they open the other valve

00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:08.795
and fill the tank with seawater,

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.732
I'll turn this valve to
fill the old tank, as well.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.867
You can be easily spotted there.

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:15.035
You sure about this?

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:18.038
It should be okay if I
wait to move until dark.

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:21.208
Well, then, all that's
left is to clean in here.

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:24.578
(sparkling chimes)

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:28.582
(sighs) It's not exactly
pristine, but it's done!

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.717
Wow, Kokuri, nice job.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.820
(door creaks)

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:37.057
(snakes slithering)

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.363
It looks like it's clear.

00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:45.365
Now's the time to go, Sarada.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.634
I'll let you guys know

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:49.937
when I've turned the
valve to divert the water.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.338
Wait, but how?

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:55.209
We're not allowed to go to
the library until the evening.

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:58.045
I guess we can't use
that book to communicate.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.214
What about that building?

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.050
Even from the
inside of our cell,

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:04.618
we're still able
to see that window.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.520
All right, when the
light from that window

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:09.456
goes on and off twice, it
means everything is ready.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.691
How about that?

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:11.758
Two times, huh?

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:14.228
We're counting on you, Sarada.

00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.663
Kokuri's life depends
on this working.

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:17.631
On it.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.967
Getting the fresh water
into place is my job.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.469
I'll make sure that it's
done, no matter what.

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:24.338
Boruto.

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.773
Yeah, I'll be there with you.

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:28.442
No, it isn't that, look!

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:29.476
Huh?

00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:35.315
Did he see us?

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:36.350
Kedama.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.255
I'm only here to get
the bird droppings.

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:43.624
I'm not interested
in you guys at all.

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:50.697
What now? He's the guy who
snitched on his friends

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:52.199
in the past, after all.

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.702
Just leave him to me.

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:57.037
What are you gonna do?

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.972
Try to talk to him.

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:01.975
And if that doesn't
work, I'll restrain him.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.344
You two, please just
proceed as planned.

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:06.246
(footsteps pattering)

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.815
I have to put this back
in its original place

00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.751
before anyone
notices it's missing.

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:13.187
(Sarada swooshes)

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:16.223
Ah, Boruto?

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.791
Let's just go and report in

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:19.359
that we've finished
all of our work.

00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:21.595
We can't afford to
raise suspicion.

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:23.597
Is everything gonna work out?

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.200
Listen, there's no
use in panicking now.

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:31.839
Hm?

00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:36.844
-(snakes hissing)
-(Kedama grunts)

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:39.613
Jutsu, but how? The seal!

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:42.983
We were sent here undercover
on a secret mission.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:44.985
If we don't get
Kokuri out of here,

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:46.720
then he's going to be killed.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.989
So, we can't have
you telling anyone

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:50.924
-about what you just saw.
-(snake hisses)

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.527
But I just told you, I
don't care if you guys

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.496
are working with that girl
who wears the glasses.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.966
I'm afraid that I
just can't trust you.

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:02.102
The rumor is that you
pass information to Benga.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:05.305
(sighs) Rumor, huh?

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:09.977
Amazing, your heart rate

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.346
hasn't increased even
in the slightest.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:17.451
You were admired by the
inmates in the past, right?

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:21.622
Actually, that's just
a rumor, as well.

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:24.958
Is it also just a rumor that
you ratted out your friend?

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:26.593
(Kedama moans)

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:28.195
Your pulse just went up.

00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:35.169
At one time, I infiltrated
an enemy organization.

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:38.639
I found it was rather hard
to live with a secret.

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:40.107
So, when I see someone suffering

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.443
from the burden of keeping a
secret, I know how they feel.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:45.579
You're hiding something

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.582
and it's something
very important to you.

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:50.450
(Kedama sighs)

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:52.953
Why are you so curious?

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.188
Maybe I'm simply intrigued

00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:56.423
by someone who grows
flowers like you.

00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:01.195
So, did your friend
actually die because of you?

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.232
It's almost like I
killed him myself.

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:13.273
It was right after I came
out of solitary confinement,

00:11:13.307 --> 00:11:14.541
yet again.

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:16.543
You're still alive, huh?

00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:18.679
We missed having you around.

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:19.980
[Inmate] How soon is it gonna be

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.216
before you punch a
guard again, huh?

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:23.984
You were gone for a long time!

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:27.487
I was starting to get tired
of waiting. (chuckles)

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:32.292
So, tell me, how's the
plan coming along, anyway?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.829
My friend Kiku and
I were planning

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:38.365
to break out of this place.

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.101
I tore down the wall that
connects to the flood gate.

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:43.704
Now we just have to
wait for it to rain.

00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:46.940
Our target was the flood gate

00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:48.976
which only opened when
rainwater built up

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:51.044
and was about to overflow.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.216
Are you sure it's
going to rain tonight?

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.318
My dad's a fisherman
and reading the clouds

00:11:58.352 --> 00:12:01.255
was something he drilled into
me until I was sick of it.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:03.090
I can tell it's
absolutely gonna rain

00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:04.958
like cats and dogs tonight.

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:07.327
Have some trust in
your friend Kiku!

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.063
Anyway, just make sure

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:12.733
that you come to the meeting
place at midnight, okay?

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:14.001
And don't be late.

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:17.237
But the sun had set

00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:20.174
and there still wasn't a
single sign of rain coming.

00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:24.811
If it didn't rain, we'd
have to postpone the plan.

00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:27.181
I wasn't sure if I
should go or not.

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:33.387
And then when it finally
did start raining,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.290
it was already way past the
time for our rendezvous.

00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:40.627
(footsteps pattering)

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:46.333
Sorry I'm late!

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:50.037
Why, Kedama?

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.973
You promised that
you wouldn't be late.

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:56.977
The both of us swore
that we would (groans)

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.345
[Kedama] Kiku!

00:12:58.378 --> 00:12:59.580
-(Kiku moans)
-(Kiku thuds)

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.682
That sure was close.

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:02.983
If you'd come on time,

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:05.919
then there really might've
been a prison break.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.555
I really do have to
thank you, Kedama.

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:12.860
Aren't I the one
you really want?

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:14.928
That's right, you are.

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.531
This place used to
be quite peaceful

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:20.234
but these days, even all
the little weaklings in here

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:22.736
are copying you by defying me.

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:27.241
Go on, just do it, I'm prepared.

00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:29.209
If I were to take you down here,

00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:31.812
the prisoners would
consider you a hero

00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:34.114
so I'm going to do
just the opposite.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.850
I'm going to praise you for
reporting a prison break

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.919
and being a model prisoner.

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:41.688
(Kedama grunts)

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.825
Just as Benga wanted,

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:47.394
the inmates turned
their backs on me.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:49.496
Anyway, that's about
what you can expect

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.732
from the level of
trust among prisoners.

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:56.970
(snakes slithering)

00:13:57.004 --> 00:13:58.605
Why didn't you just deny it?

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:04.344
If I'd been there on time
like I promised I would,

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:06.313
my friend would still be alive.

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:08.949
No matter what I say,

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:11.418
it doesn't change the
fact that I killed him.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:16.089
It seems like you plan
to escape with Kokuri.

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:17.624
Well, just be careful.

00:14:17.658 --> 00:14:21.195
Trust is a fragile thing
that's easily broken.

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:22.496
Boruto's trustworthy.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.264
Once he puts his
faith in someone,

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:26.099
he never wavers from that.

00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:28.569
I wonder, though.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:32.105
I won't tell anyone, so relax.

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:35.742
I decided that I'd never get
involved with anyone again.

00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:38.512
Not since that day.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.215
Although, you don't
like it, do you?

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:44.218
Otherwise you
wouldn't grow flowers.

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:49.189
I only do that to kill the time.

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:53.460
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:06.740
Doragu, come here, now.

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:10.511
If you need something, contact
me through my secretary.

00:15:10.544 --> 00:15:12.045
(inmates laughing)

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:14.348
Would you rather be
dragged out of here?

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:18.185
Come on, man, I mean, can't
you even take a little joke?

00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:22.623
Having to act tough
and defiant like that

00:15:22.656 --> 00:15:26.493
when your underlings are around
that must be hard for you.

00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:29.897
Ah, you know how it is,
gotta keep up the facade.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.098
Anyway, Doragu,

00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:33.600
there's been a rash of
strange occurrences.

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:37.171
So, do you know
anything about them?

00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:38.172
What does that mean?

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:39.540
(boots thump)
Don't act dumb!

00:15:39.573 --> 00:15:42.609
I'm asking you if there's
anything suspicious going on

00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:43.644
with the prisoners.

00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:44.811
(Doragu chuckles nervously)

00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:46.213
You do know who you owe

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.215
for your current status
in this prison, right?

00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:50.450
[Doragu] You, Mr. Benga.

00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:53.187
Do you want it all to
come out into the open?

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.088
No, please no, don't do that.

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:57.291
Then cooperate with me.

00:15:58.192 --> 00:16:01.828
Hmm, well, you know,
now that you mention it,

00:16:01.862 --> 00:16:03.497
that kid, Boruto
was asking around

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.532
about the food
supply ship earlier.

00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:08.068
Hmm, interesting.

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:09.469
Anything else?

00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:12.472
There's also that apprentice
journalist, named Sarada.

00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:14.808
Seems she asked Tsukiyo
lots of questions

00:16:14.842 --> 00:16:16.810
about his relationship with ya.

00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:18.045
What did you say?

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:21.381
(paper rustling)

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:22.649
(drawer clicks)

00:16:22.683 --> 00:16:24.117
That should be good.

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:26.186
Now all I have to do

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.488
is destroy the notes in
my room, open the valve,

00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:31.925
and send Boruto and Mitsuki
the confirmation signal

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:33.427
and then we'll be done.

00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:35.362
(footsteps pattering)

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:38.432
[Benga] Seriously? No one
saw the girl with glasses?

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:40.701
Split up and find her

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:43.170
and when you do,
bring her to me.

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.205
(Sarada swoops)

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:47.341
It's bad, I didn't get
to destroy my notes

00:16:47.374 --> 00:16:49.309
but I can't risk getting caught.

00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:56.550
[Mitsuki] The signal?

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.285
Haven't seen anything yet.

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:00.721
Nevermind that, how'd
it go with Kedama?

00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:03.056
Yes, about that.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.425
I think we'll be okay.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.064
Hey, Kedama, have you seen

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:13.066
that young girl with
the glasses around?

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.902
The apprentice journalist?

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:16.904
[Kedama] Why?

00:17:16.937 --> 00:17:19.072
That isn't something
you need to know.

00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:21.375
Now, have you seen
her or haven't you?

00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:23.410
I have not.

00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:26.013
Let me know if you do.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:28.649
That's your specialty, isn't it?

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:29.816
(Kedama groans)

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.052
You always look so gloomy.

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:34.388
Make sure that you
put the tools away!

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:37.324
(explosion booms)

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:39.193
[Guard] Huh? What was that?

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:40.661
(footsteps pattering)

00:17:40.694 --> 00:17:41.695
Over there!

00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:44.331
(footsteps pattering)

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.166
-Come on, open!
-(lever creaking)

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.935
-(Sarada groaning)
-(lever clanks)

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:50.704
(water gushing)

00:17:57.044 --> 00:17:58.579
[First Guard] I
wonder what that was?

00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:02.149
[Second Guard] Whatever it
was, let's let Benga know.

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.718
[Sarada] Gotta give Boruto
and the others the signal.

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:11.058
-(suspenseful music)
-(footsteps crunching)

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:18.565
(Benga chuckles)

00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:21.134
I hope Tsukiyo hasn't
told her about this.

00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:26.039
Just how much does that girl
with glasses know, I wonder?

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.076
The sound of good luck, my foot!

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:31.512
If people find
out, I'll be fired.

00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:32.713
Of all the luck!

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.049
(footsteps pattering)

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:37.918
That sound...

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:41.288
(footsteps pattering)

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:45.158
Well, well, what are
you doing down here?

00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:48.462
I was on my way back to
my room to pack my things.

00:18:48.996 --> 00:18:50.697
You mean you're leaving?

00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:52.065
As suddenly as that?

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.868
I did quite a bit
of research, so...

00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:56.637
Oh, what kind of research?

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.005
What did you hear?

00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.574
Don't try to threaten me.

00:19:00.607 --> 00:19:03.777
I figured out a lot of
what's going on here.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.212
A lot, you say?

00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:08.749
When Lord Mujo collapsed, I
understand you two were alone.

00:19:08.782 --> 00:19:12.186
And of course, the order to
transfer Kokuri so suddenly.

00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:14.655
The timing's just too
convenient, isn't it?

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.192
If you understand
me, then let me pass.

00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:22.563
So, you know and that's
why you came here.

00:19:23.797 --> 00:19:26.300
That means I can't
let you go, then.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.036
I have no idea
what you're saying.

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:30.871
(Benga grunts)

00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:33.907
-Fire style flame bombs!
-(fire roars)

00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:35.676
No more holding back!

00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:36.810
(fire swooshing)

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:38.078
(explosion booms)

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:39.680
-(rocks crashing)
-(Sarada grunts)

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:42.349
(Sarada screaming)

00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:44.685
-(rocks clattering)
-(Benga groans)

00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:47.521
(Benga chuckles)

00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:53.427
(Benga guffaws)

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.062
Who'd have thought
the negative legacy

00:19:55.095 --> 00:19:57.464
of this castle would
become an asset?

00:19:57.497 --> 00:20:01.168
Not even a shinobi could
ever escape a pit like this!

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.569
Just stay down there

00:20:02.603 --> 00:20:05.706
and write your little
articles til you die!

00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:12.479
[Kedama] I decided that
I'd never get involved

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:16.950
with anyone again,
not since that day.

00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:19.586
[Mitsuki] Although, you
don't like it do you?

00:20:20.487 --> 00:20:22.956
Otherwise, you
wouldn't grow flowers.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.459
(hoe cracks)

00:20:29.463 --> 00:20:30.464
(Benga coughing)

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:32.599
[Guard] Mr. Benga,
what happened, sir?

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:36.537
It's nothing, but it looks
like there's a small gas leak

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.907
in the basement so don't
let anyone go in, for now.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.176
But what about the
search for Sarada?

00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:44.411
That's finished, it's over now.

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:45.445
[Guard] But sir-

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:48.182
Didn't you just hear me
say it's all over now?

00:20:48.215 --> 00:20:51.285
Anyway, isn't it about
time to hold roll call?

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:58.292
This isn't any concern of mine.

00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:03.664
Sarada's late with the signal.

00:21:03.697 --> 00:21:04.698
Yeah.

00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:17.211
The supply ship's
going to arrive

00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:18.979
tomorrow morning, isn't it?

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.381
But there's been no signal.

00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:25.152
Maybe something has
happened to Sarada.

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.560
If Miss Sarada fails
then that will mean

00:21:33.594 --> 00:21:36.096
it's impossible to break
out of here, right?

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.432
But that wouldn't
happen, would it?

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:44.037
I can't deal, my stomach's
starting to hurt.

00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:46.673
Well, Boruto, should
we cancel the plan?

00:21:49.576 --> 00:21:53.146
Sarada told us she'd get
it done, no matter what.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.983
And I'm gonna choose to
take her at her word.

00:21:58.852 --> 00:22:01.188
Of course, I thought
you'd say that.

00:22:04.858 --> 00:22:07.528
We still do this,
like we planned.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.672
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:44.091
(upbeat music)

00:23:44.124 --> 00:23:45.292
[Boruto] Just a little longer

00:23:45.325 --> 00:23:47.060
til we meet up with
Sarada, Kokuri.

00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:49.196
[Kokuri] We haven't
got word from her.

00:23:49.229 --> 00:23:50.664
Do you think she's okay?

00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:51.832
[Boruto] I'm sure she's fine.

00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:53.367
We'll meet up at
the tank as planned.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.602
Mitsuki, what about the guards?

00:23:55.636 --> 00:23:57.571
[Mitsuki] I've set my
snakes to keep watch.

00:23:57.604 --> 00:24:00.040
They'll alert me if the
guards start to make a move.

00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:03.310
[Boruto] Next time, on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations,"

00:24:03.343 --> 00:24:05.479
executing the prison break.

00:24:05.512 --> 00:24:08.715
We can't turn back now,
we've just gotta forge ahead.

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:16.690
