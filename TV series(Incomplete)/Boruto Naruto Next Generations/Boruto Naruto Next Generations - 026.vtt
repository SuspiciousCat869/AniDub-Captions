WEBVTT

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:14.855
(SHIKADAI) <i>Great job today.</i>

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:16.657
...field trip leader...

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.594
Hey, Iwabe... no more running
off by yourself anymore. 'Kay?

00:00:20.627 --> 00:00:21.061
Hmph!

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:24.197
I mean, damn; getting tangled up
with that weird guy...

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.368
If we hadn't been around, there
would've been a throw down for
sure.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.670
Sorry 'bout that.

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:34.908
Some people in this town tend
to get a little too upset when
outsiders come to the island.

00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:39.412
Ah that's alright; no worries!
I'm sure there are guys like
that everywhere.

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:43.850
Besides, then this really strong
local guy came along and stopped
him.

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:44.951
A strong local guy?

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:46.520
(CHO‐CHO) <i>Please, who cares</i>
<i>about that?!</i>

00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:50.056
What really matters is, where
are we going to next?

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.061
Oh... Actually, I'm taking all
of you to meet someone very
special.

00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:57.931
Someone like... a handsome man?

00:00:57.964 --> 00:01:00.567
(SARADA) <i>Oh, Cho‐Cho, give it a</i>
<i>rest.</i>

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:05.071
My, My...

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:06.740
[gasp]

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.411
Well look at all of these cute
visitors you brought.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:18.084
The former Mizukage... Lady Mei.

00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:21.487
She was part of the Great Ninja
War effort, and later,

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:25.792
helped lay the foundation for
the village's growth and
expansion.

00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:29.429
Awww, stop that's all in the
past. [chuckle]

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.430
Huh?

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:35.569
This era... will be defined by
young people like you.

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:38.238
We adults have already had our
day in the sun.

00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:39.606
Right Kagura?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.106
Uh...

00:01:42.142 --> 00:01:44.310
No, I... actually...

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:45.111
[sigh]

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.781
Hm?

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:50.016
(MEI) <i>Ah! We've arrived.</i>

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.784
Huh?

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:53.954
(KAGURA) <i>Excuse us.</i>

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:04.798
Whoa...!

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.970
Everyone's here.

00:02:10.637 --> 00:02:12.138
Thank you very much.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.445
It's nice to meet you. I am
Chojuro, and I am the current
Mizukage.

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.551
<i>Thank you for traveling so far</i>
<i>from the Hidden Leaf to the</i>
<i>Hidden Mist Village.</i>

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:27.153
I'm honored to have you all
here,

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:14.561
...So, my colleagues and I
agreed that we would be the
hosts for this special...

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:18.464
...field trip with the
belief that it would promote
development between our

00:04:18.498 --> 00:04:21.535
villages, and foster
mutual goodwill.

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:22.335
<i>Yes, peace...</i>

00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:23.604
[yawn]

00:04:23.637 --> 00:04:25.539
C'mon; pay attention!

00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:27.908
I know, but gimme a break.

00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:31.444
Basically, all he's saying is
let's get along, right?

00:04:31.477 --> 00:04:34.480
But he's rambling on forever...
[yawn]

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:35.281
Boruto!

00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:39.285
Ugh, we might as well be sitting
inside a classroom, right?

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.186
[clearing throat]

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.854
[startled grunts]

00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:45.025
I‐ um, what I meant‐ uh,
sorry...

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:48.829
Quite alright. It can be rather
tiresome.

00:04:48.862 --> 00:04:50.964
In fact‐ I think so too.

00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:52.198
Huh?

00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:54.635
Huh? [gasps]

00:04:54.668 --> 00:04:59.105
He's right. All I've really been
trying to say is, let's all get
along.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.411
It's really a very simple idea.
But adults always need to turn
everything into a long speech!

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:11.785
The past can be hard to explain.
The truth is our villages were
once mortal enemies.

00:05:11.818 --> 00:05:14.521
<i>Back then, we caused so much</i>
<i>bloodshed</i>

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:19.092
<i>that we were actually called</i>
<i>"the</i> Blood <i>Mist Village".</i>

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:22.162
However, your destiny will be
different.

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:24.164
[gasps]

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.069
You have faith; that tragic
histories like ours can be
easily overcome...

00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:33.006
...and that a bright new future
can be forged from the ashes.

00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:34.240
[happy sigh]

00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:34.841
[grunt]

00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:40.146
All the Hidden Mist asks... is
for your friendship.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.085
Now please... go outside and
look around, and have as much
fun as you can!

00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:46.186
Thank you!

00:05:48.288 --> 00:05:48.822
[chattering]

00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:50.724
Oh man, I got so tongue‐tied!

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:52.959
Come on! The trip leader
shouldn't be dawdling!

00:05:52.993 --> 00:05:54.761
[grunt] Yeah I know that!

00:05:55.596 --> 00:05:56.697
[scoff]

00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:04.671
(CHOJURO) <i>Wait... one moment,</i>
<i>Kagura.</i>

00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:05.772
Yes, what is it?

00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:11.177
Perhaps... you would consider
giving it a try once again?

00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:15.448
What i was saying earlier in my
speech... That was really aimed
<i>towards you.</i>

00:06:15.481 --> 00:06:20.186
<i>You're my ideal person to lead</i>
<i>the charge to build a future</i>
<i>with the Hidden Leaf.</i>

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.124
For in due time, I want to pass
it on to you.

00:06:28.128 --> 00:06:31.097
I'm afraid I'm not suited for
leading the village.

00:06:33.634 --> 00:06:36.770
I must return to the students.
Excuse me...

00:06:42.743 --> 00:06:44.244
[sigh]

00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:53.620
[chattering]

00:06:53.654 --> 00:06:56.990
Please, everyone wait here a
moment while I check us in.

00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:59.760
Then I'll show you our village's
notable sites.

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:06.432
(CHO‐CHO) <i>He seems like a man</i>
<i>with great prospects for the</i>
<i>future.</i>

00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:08.635
Wait, you mean Kagura?

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.037
Who else would I be talking
about?

00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:15.041
He's kind, considerate... best
of all, he's competent!

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:17.043
(MITSUKI) <i>Kagura Karatachi...</i>

00:07:17.077 --> 00:07:21.247
He only became a Hidden Mist
Chunin two years ago.

00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:23.950
And, he's a top aide to the
Sixth Mizukage.

00:07:23.984 --> 00:07:26.386
You know a lot about him!

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.789
Hidden Sound rumors. That's all.

00:07:28.822 --> 00:07:31.525
And? Anything else?

00:07:31.558 --> 00:07:34.995
He's in line to be the head of
the new Seven Ninja Swordsmen of
the Mist.

00:07:35.028 --> 00:07:39.966
Also, for the current Mizukage's
sword, Hiramekarei's successor.

00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:41.134
[gasps]

00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:44.304
Wait, the Seven Ninja Swordsmen?
Uh, of the Mist?

00:07:44.838 --> 00:07:46.139
Huh? Who are they?

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.210
Wow, you really have no interest
in history at all, do you?

00:07:50.243 --> 00:07:51.277
What a drag...

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:53.379
Listen up.

00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:57.483
There are Seven Hidden Mist
Shinobi Swords passed down since
the First Mizukage.

00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.521
The shinobi who are able to
wield these mystical swords...

00:08:00.554 --> 00:08:04.891
<i>are known as the Seven</i>
<i>Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.</i>

00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:06.560
From everything I've heard...

00:08:06.593 --> 00:08:10.531
Together, those ninja are
capable of bringing down an
entire nation.

00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:15.401
So in terms of the Leaf, we're
talking about people from
Advisor Kakashi's class?

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:17.571
(SHIKADAI) <i>In other words...</i>
<i>they're monsters...</i>

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:18.404
[chewing]

00:08:18.438 --> 00:08:19.940
[gasp] That guy, huh?

00:08:19.973 --> 00:08:23.977
Ahhh! Then he's got a
picture‐perfect future!

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.881
Finally, a man worthy of
courting me has come along.

00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:28.882
[sigh]

00:08:29.883 --> 00:08:33.419
Judging by titles, Boruto's just
like him, then.

00:08:33.453 --> 00:08:38.559
Yeah, but a title's really just
a fancy name. [chewing]

00:08:38.592 --> 00:08:44.030
Potato chips are simply fried
potatoes. But all of them have a
different taste!

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:45.832
Hmmm...

00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:46.399
(KAGURA) <i>Thanks for waiting!</i>

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.200
Huh?!

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:51.404
First thing's first. Come on,
I'll show you the Hidden Mist
Academy.

00:09:06.186 --> 00:09:07.888
Whoa!

00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:10.323
(REFEREE) One point!

00:09:10.356 --> 00:09:12.926
I knew it! Their sword style's
incredible!

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:13.894
Uh‐huh...

00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:17.463
On top of that, they're on an
unstable liquid surface.

00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:19.265
Man, that's so crazy!

00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:20.000
I know!

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:23.904
Thank you very much!

00:09:24.805 --> 00:09:26.039
Well, what'd you think of that?

00:09:26.072 --> 00:09:28.474
Wow! That was totally amazing!

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:33.079
We do taijutsu too, but our
kenjutsu is nowhere near that
good.

00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:35.849
How would you like to take part
in an official match?

00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:37.584
Heck yeah, I would!

00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:39.052
Oh, Kagura...

00:09:39.085 --> 00:09:40.621
Yes.

00:09:40.654 --> 00:09:42.022
(CHOJURO) <i>Be his opponent.</i>

00:09:42.523 --> 00:09:43.456
Oh... But, I...

00:09:44.124 --> 00:09:47.160
You are both shinobi.

00:09:47.193 --> 00:09:50.897
If you're to be friends, it
wouldn't be a bad idea to learn
one another's strengths.

00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:53.233
Yeah, I'm in! What do you say?

00:09:57.037 --> 00:09:59.506
Well, in that case, I suppose...

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.475
[giggles and ah's]

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:05.178
Do you prefer the match be on
solid ground?

00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:09.015
Either way. Since we're in the
Mist, I'll go with the flow.

00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:10.617
I'll manage somehow.

00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:14.020
'Kay! I'm ready!

00:10:14.054 --> 00:10:15.922
Doin' good, Boruto!

00:10:15.956 --> 00:10:18.191
He's a natural when it comes to
things like this.

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:22.763
Go, Boruto!

00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:23.597
[crowd cheering]

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.632
Now, ready... begin!

00:10:36.476 --> 00:10:40.914
<i>I‐ I can't find a single</i>
<i>opening. Damn it.</i>

00:10:40.947 --> 00:10:43.917
What's he waiting for? Why
doesn't he attack?

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.219
Because he can't yet.

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:50.423
To be Mizukage, the shinobi
must best all the others.

00:10:50.456 --> 00:10:53.827
The Seven Ninja Swordsmen are
the ones who rank closest.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.561
Oh, I see...

00:10:55.562 --> 00:10:57.864
So being chosen as a Seven Ninja
Swordsman means

00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:00.801
you're already pretty close to
being the strongest shinobi...

00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:01.602
Is that right?

00:11:01.635 --> 00:11:02.102
[crowd cheering]

00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:04.004
(CHO‐CHO) <i>Boruto, go for it!</i>

00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:05.672
(DENKI) <i>Get him, Boruto!</i>

00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:08.008
[gasp]

00:11:12.746 --> 00:11:14.515
[panting]

00:11:18.418 --> 00:11:20.721
<i>At this point, it's sink or</i>
<i>swim.</i>

00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:22.789
[attack yell]

00:11:26.693 --> 00:11:27.728
[grunt]

00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:32.265
Ah!

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.538
[crowd gasps]

00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:38.672
[scoff]

00:11:40.006 --> 00:11:41.875
Wait, Iwabe...

00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:43.610
Whoa... No way.

00:11:43.644 --> 00:11:46.713
Aw, man... You totally got me.

00:11:47.714 --> 00:11:48.582
You're really strong, Kagura!

00:11:49.616 --> 00:11:52.218
[dazed panting]

00:11:53.787 --> 00:11:55.622
Uh...? What's the matter?

00:11:56.089 --> 00:12:00.193
[groggy breaths]

00:12:00.226 --> 00:12:06.399
Oh... it's nothing, I'm alright.
But, thank you.

00:12:06.432 --> 00:12:09.002
Though, if ninjutsu was allowed,
who knows?

00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:11.605
[chuckle] Your face hardly shows
the effort!

00:12:11.638 --> 00:12:15.509
No, that's not true! The current
favored me, that's all.

00:12:15.542 --> 00:12:17.243
[chattering]

00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:19.412
No wonder he's a Seven Ninja
Swordsmen candidate.

00:12:21.014 --> 00:12:23.283
(INOJIN) <i>Nobody else is here,</i>
<i>right?</i>

00:12:23.316 --> 00:12:27.253
So, then, is the next Mizukage
going to be you, Kagura?

00:12:29.122 --> 00:12:30.691
Hey, what's the mater, Kagura?

00:12:30.724 --> 00:12:33.594
[nervous chuckle] I promise you,
nothing's wrong.

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:36.797
There's no way I deserve to have
that honor.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.767
Right now, the only thing that
matters is my duty.

00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:43.670
[sighs and giggles]

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:47.073
Okay everyone, we're taking an
afternoon break on the beach,

00:12:47.107 --> 00:12:50.577
and then we'll head to
the memorial park.

00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:51.444
Huh?

00:12:56.116 --> 00:13:05.391
[chattering]

00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:08.028
(BORUTO) <i>Hey, Pops, I'd like one</i>
<i>of these.</i>

00:13:08.061 --> 00:13:09.395
(SHOPKEEPER) <i>Here you go!</i>

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.998
Just one is fine.

00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:14.234
Share the other one with your
friends.

00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:16.503
Not from around here,
huh?

00:13:18.038 --> 00:13:20.507
Well, thank you!

00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:23.443
What the‐‐ Where did everybody
else go?

00:13:23.944 --> 00:13:25.145
Oh, well...

00:13:25.812 --> 00:13:29.149
[chewing] So good! Huh?

00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:38.158
Here, want one?

00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:38.959
Uhh...

00:13:38.992 --> 00:13:40.226
Uh, what is that?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.228
It's squid. It's good, try it.

00:13:42.262 --> 00:13:44.531
Oh, that's not exactly what I
meant...

00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:47.534
The guy gave me an extra one.

00:13:47.568 --> 00:13:52.138
I like it here. The scenery, the
people... Is this place great,
or what?

00:13:52.172 --> 00:13:57.611
It is so impolite to talk with
your mouth full. Didn't your mom
ever teach you any manners?

00:13:57.644 --> 00:13:58.845
You want it or not?

00:13:58.879 --> 00:13:59.980
I just said...

00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:01.948
(Stomach Growl)

00:14:03.584 --> 00:14:04.618
Give it here.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.362
[chewing]

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:18.064
Oh! it's so good!

00:14:18.098 --> 00:14:19.399
Yeah, right?

00:14:19.432 --> 00:14:20.701
(KAGURA) <i>Ah, I'm so pleased.</i>

00:14:21.134 --> 00:14:21.568
Huh?

00:14:23.369 --> 00:14:26.673
To be honest, I was worried our
local specialties would be too
simple to suit your tastes.

00:14:26.707 --> 00:14:29.375
Our village is surrounded by
nothing but mountains and
forests,

00:14:29.409 --> 00:14:31.778
so getting to eat this is
awesome!

00:14:32.478 --> 00:14:32.879
Mhm.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.583
I see. I'd like to visit one
day.

00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:39.553
Nothing to see there except
boring countryside.

00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:40.721
[chuckle]

00:14:45.692 --> 00:14:49.295
'Til a few years back, this
place had nothing to do or see,
either.

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:50.897
Really? You serious?

00:14:52.432 --> 00:14:56.302
Yeah. A poor fishing village
with so little, the breeze could
blow it away.

00:14:56.336 --> 00:15:00.707
And not just here... The whole
village was poor.

00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:05.612
But then, Lord Chojuro took
over, and changed it all.

00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:09.616
He made life better, and more
prosperous for everybody.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.620
You must love the village the
way it is currently, Kagura.

00:15:13.654 --> 00:15:14.588
Yeah.

00:15:15.455 --> 00:15:16.923
And that's why...

00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:23.496
We must ensure that we never
regress back to the era when we
bore the shame...

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.699
of that infamous name.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:48.388
<i>Long ago, when people used to</i>
<i>refer to us as the</i> Blood
<i>Mist...</i>

00:15:48.421 --> 00:15:52.526
<i>We were forced to kill each</i>
<i>other to pass our graduation</i>
<i>exam.</i>

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:57.964
<i>It was during the era of the</i>
<i>Fourth Mizukage.</i>

00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:01.334
<i>It's said that no day passed</i>
<i>without bloodshed.</i>

00:16:02.368 --> 00:16:05.305
<i>Our past was gruesome beyond</i>
<i>measure.</i>

00:16:05.572 --> 00:16:06.807
[sigh]

00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:12.045
But today, we are now known as
just the Hidden mist. No more
slaughter‐

00:16:12.078 --> 00:16:13.179
(IWABE) <i>Oh, come on...</i>

00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:16.082
It wasn't really that long ago.

00:16:16.116 --> 00:16:18.084
Iwabe...?

00:16:18.118 --> 00:16:19.920
My grandpa, for example...

00:16:19.953 --> 00:16:24.825
Fought with Yagura Karatachi,
the Fourth Mizukage, and he was
murdered...

00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:25.025
[gasp]

00:16:26.326 --> 00:16:27.327
[gasps]

00:16:28.428 --> 00:16:31.364
That's the shinobi world...
Things like that happen.

00:16:31.397 --> 00:16:36.837
But my dad always used to say
he'd never forgive the Hidden
Mist for killing my grandfather.

00:16:37.571 --> 00:16:38.839
[sigh]

00:16:40.406 --> 00:16:43.009
It's not only about the past.
It's about people who are alive
today, as well.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:46.479
Even we managed to get caught up
in it earlier.

00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:49.315
I'm sorry.

00:16:49.349 --> 00:16:52.118
What are you apologizing for.

00:16:52.152 --> 00:16:56.156
[sneer] That is exactly what's
so irritating about you.

00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:59.159
I won't let anyone gloss over it
like nothing happened,

00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:02.462
but what right do you have to be
sorry when you weren't even
there?

00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:06.633
You're messing with us, aren't
you?! Just like that thug we ran
into before.

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:09.770
Answer me! What's up with you
Blood Mist frauds?

00:17:09.803 --> 00:17:10.737
Hey, Iwabe!

00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:12.372
(TSURUSHI) <i>Shut up, all of you!</i>

00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:13.039
[grunt]

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:16.242
Just who do you think you are?

00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:18.645
Hey, these guys are outsiders.

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:22.382
Oh, right. You brats are
visiting from the Hidden Leaf...

00:17:22.983 --> 00:17:24.017
Hachiya?

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:24.885
Hmph.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:29.422
Oh look, Kagura, another wimp.
Are you the one in charge here?

00:17:29.455 --> 00:17:32.659
Wagging your tail like a dog at
the outsiders.

00:17:32.693 --> 00:17:34.561
This is none of your business.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.462
Don't be stupid; sure it is!

00:17:36.496 --> 00:17:41.434
'Cause aren't you a contender
for the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of... the Blood Mist?

00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:44.070
Yeah and what of it?

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:47.641
I'll tell you what of it‐ if you
bow to them, they'll mess with
us too!

00:17:47.674 --> 00:17:51.878
In fact, these outsiders' got
some nerve walking around The
Blood Mist Village!

00:17:51.912 --> 00:17:55.348
Told you. What a bunch of
losers.

00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:57.984
Sounds like our 'nerve' is a
problem for you.

00:17:58.018 --> 00:17:58.752
Huh?!

00:18:00.453 --> 00:18:03.289
Hey, knock it off, Iwabe. Are
you trying to ruin the field
trip for all of us, or what?

00:18:03.323 --> 00:18:04.758
Back off, Boruto!

00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:09.796
I'm the field trip leader,
remember? If people act stupid,
I gotta stop 'em.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.633
(TSURUSHI) <i>Oh, I get it. It is</i>
<i>you.</i>

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:15.802
The spoiled brat of the Uzumaki
Clan.

00:18:15.836 --> 00:18:17.571
You leave my parents out of
it.

00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:19.439
Why should I?

00:18:21.107 --> 00:18:24.110
After all, if we can bring you
down, then that means we're
gonna be real famous!

00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:27.480
[grunt and gasp]

00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:30.617
[gasps]

00:18:31.685 --> 00:18:33.887
Just remember, you guys started
this fight first!

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.089
[pained grunts]

00:18:36.623 --> 00:18:41.427
[grunt and battle cry]

00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:45.231
What'll it be, Blood Mist? It's
up to you.

00:18:45.265 --> 00:18:46.199
[terrified squeal]

00:18:46.232 --> 00:18:47.033
Hold on a second!

00:18:48.702 --> 00:18:52.105
It's too late. We have to teach
'em a lesson now, or they're
gonna be trouble later.

00:18:52.138 --> 00:18:55.876
No, if you do this, we'll be the
ones who'll end up in trouble.

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:56.877
[grunt]

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.744
[strained grunt]

00:18:57.778 --> 00:18:58.478
Damn it‐!

00:19:01.147 --> 00:19:04.217
We... we'll let you go this
time, but watch your backs!

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.484
[panicked breathing]

00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:08.254
[roar and panting]

00:19:08.288 --> 00:19:11.558
Stereotypical delinquent types
in this day and age?

00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:13.660
That's right, scram! Don't ever
show your face around here
again, you hear me?!

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:17.764
Look‐‐ we've got one of our own.
He's a national treasure.

00:19:17.798 --> 00:19:20.466
Kagura, how's your hand is it
okay?

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.068
[gasp]

00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:25.405
[chuckle] Just a scratch it's
nothing.

00:19:25.438 --> 00:19:26.840
[gasp] Let me see it!

00:19:32.913 --> 00:19:36.883
Everyone, I'm sorry I got you
involved in this messy
situation.

00:19:38.018 --> 00:19:39.019
And you...

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.855
You were absolutely right.

00:19:41.888 --> 00:19:45.258
But still, you must let me
apologize. I'm sorry.

00:19:47.427 --> 00:19:48.194
[grunt]

00:19:55.268 --> 00:19:56.036
(SHIZUMA) <i>Well?</i>

00:19:56.402 --> 00:19:58.138
[whimpering]

00:20:00.306 --> 00:20:03.777
(SHIZUMA) <i>You got your butts</i>
kicked and slunk back here with
<i>your tail between your legs.</i>

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.813
(TSURUSHI) Uh... no, not
exactly... I mean...

00:20:06.847 --> 00:20:10.050
it's just
that Kagura, he...
[pained yelp]

00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:12.252
(SHIZUMA) <i>No excuses.</i>

00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:13.554
[trembling breath] Y‐Yes.

00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:19.059
(SHIZUMA) <i>You must show them how</i>
<i>we really do things in the</i>
Blood <i>Mist Village.</i>

00:20:21.962 --> 00:20:23.196
Yes... Sir!

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.533
Now, then...

00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:30.070
I wonder how Kagura will react
to this?

00:20:34.074 --> 00:20:38.244
I can't believe I found a place
that sells discontinued items!
[giggle]

00:20:39.379 --> 00:20:43.750
So heavy... I bought too much.
Huh?

00:20:49.389 --> 00:20:56.930
[straining]

00:21:00.834 --> 00:21:03.136
Hm? [muffled scream]

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:05.205
(TV ANNOUNCER) <i>The ninja</i>
<i>Kagemasa...</i>

00:21:05.238 --> 00:21:07.974

<i>dinner.</i>

00:21:08.709 --> 00:21:10.677
I wonder what's keeping him?

00:21:10.711 --> 00:21:12.979
You're right, he's a little too
late.

00:21:14.214 --> 00:21:14.615
Hm?

00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:15.616
Huh?!

00:21:21.688 --> 00:21:22.322
...the hell?!

00:21:25.926 --> 00:21:26.292

Your little friend is with us.

00:21:33.366 --> 00:21:36.803
If you want him back alive, come
to Pier number four.

00:21:37.437 --> 00:21:39.405
They kidnapped him!

00:21:39.439 --> 00:21:44.377
[muffled struggling and
screaming]

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.311
[gasp]

00:21:46.412 --> 00:21:48.114
Hey! You won't get away with
this! Just let me go!

00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:49.315
Huh?!

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.218
Do you want to die, kid?!

00:21:52.252 --> 00:21:55.522
You don't have the guts to kill
me, you're way to chicken!

00:21:55.556 --> 00:21:57.157
You shut up!

00:21:57.791 --> 00:21:58.324
[terrified squeal]

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.264
Besides, now we gotta go beat
the Hokage's son to a pulp. We
have a reputation to keep up,

00:22:04.297 --> 00:22:08.735
And you're the bait we're luring
him with. Ya got that?!

00:22:08.769 --> 00:22:11.171

<i>So please help us, will ya?</i>

00:24:03.584 --> 00:24:06.319
You're a pretty strong guy,
don't you think we can do this
