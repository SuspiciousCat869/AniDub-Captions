00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:11.712
I want you to analyze this
snake for me.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:18.018
Deep inside Ryuchi Cave, lives a
giant snake named Garaga that's
been giving me trouble.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.588
I want you to bring Garaga's
Reverse Scale to me.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:26.159
I understand. But if I bring it
back, then you'd better do what
I'm asking.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.563
Garaga lives down in the
deepest...

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:34.768
harshest recesses of Ryuchi Cave
in a nest that's simply teeming
with giant snakes.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.570
You still wanna do it?

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.372
Yeah, of course I want to!

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:47.014
So this, uh... "Reverse
Scale..." just what is it
anyway?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.652
I've heard that it's a scale on
the underside of a dragon's chin
that grows in the opposite...

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:52.586
direction than the rest...

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:56.790
You guys know the old saying,
don't you? If you touch that
scale....

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.026
you incur the dragon's wrath!

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.530
I know, but... do snakes even
have scales like that?

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.633
This place is called "Ryuchi,"
which means "land of dragons."

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.737
So I wouldn't be surprised if
the giant snake that lives
here has one.

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.540
That's right, during the class
back at the Academy...

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.552
...Konohamaru Sensei summoned
that weird, gigantic frog. You
guys remember?

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:26.720
Maybe this is
like that.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:30.624
So does that mean that we're
gonna be up against a weird
snake...

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.859
like that frog or something?

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.460
[nervous chuckles]

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.230
(BORUTO) <i>C'mon you guys... It's</i>
<i>no big deal!</i>

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:36.997
[gasps]

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.666
This is all just like a video
game.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:44.905
You take down a monster boss and
you get a special item. That's
it! Done!

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.441
You're awfully nonchalant about
all this...!

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.709
But, Boruto...

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:53.881
We still have to actually find
this Garaga, remember? Or we
won't be able to move forward.

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:58.619
Yeah! Sure! Let's get it real
quick and clear this level.
It'll be a snap!

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.521
And then we'll find Mitsuki and-

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:01.522
[gasp] Wait, look!

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.023
What is all this?!

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.125
[worried groans]

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.696
Was this track really made by a
snake?

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.366
Isn't it way too big for that?

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:16.036
I mean, if a snake made this,
then it's ridiculously big...

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.438
Hold on, don't tell me this
is Garaga's...

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.373
Uhhh...

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.607
Huh?!

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.242
[nervous groans]

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:38.392
What is all this?! What happened
here?! Doesn't it look like
something went completely wild?

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:42.029
[sigh] Remember what the White
Snake Sage said...

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:48.302
A long time ago during a battle,
Garaga was unfortunate enough to
lose one of his eyes.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:53.607
Ever since then, he's been a
real pest that flies into a rage
all over the place.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.512
He needs to be taught a serious
lesson, or it'll be hopeless.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:02.549
This Garaga... definitely seems
to be one tough snake.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.552
[nervous gasps]

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:52.759
What's this? A stone staircase?!
[grunt]

00:04:55.596 --> 00:05:00.167
Ah! He's here, he's here!
Ahhh! Omph!

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:01.635
You okay?!

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.537
[pain groan] Ow...

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.571
[gasps]

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:08.809
(BORUTO) <i>What are those? Who</i>
<i>put them all here?</i>

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.411
There's more over here, too!

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:14.548
Why are there so many statues of
snakes?

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:18.552
Aw man, they sure scared me!
Alright, c'mon, let's go.

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:23.624
Wait, hold on a minute! Doesn't
all this feel really creepy, you
guys?

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.292
Huh...? What is this...?

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.061
Huh?!

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:31.398
Oh, wait a second... It's just a
wall!

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.668
Hold on! This wasn't here just a
minute ago...

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.671
Yeah, you're right. I've got a
bad feeling about this...

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.740
[gasps]

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.744
[gasp]

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:46.280
What's going on?! What is
this?!

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:50.150
[gasps]

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:52.152
It can't be...!

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.757
[gasps and nervous groans]

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:05.933
[nervous groan] Wha-?! No! No
way! Ahhh!

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:09.903
[growl]

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:12.472
[nervous groans]

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:15.042
[growling]

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:16.910
He's missing an eye!

00:06:16.944 --> 00:06:19.680
[hissing]

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:21.882
He's gonna attack! Damn!

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:23.784
We're gonna have to fight it!

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:24.685
[hissing and grunts]

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:28.288
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:30.924
[growl]

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.259
[chuckle]

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:35.562
[roar]

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:36.597
Whoa!

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:40.367
[grunt] It's not working! He's
just too big!

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:46.406
[hissing]

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.408
That's it! That's the Reverse
Scale!

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:51.411
[hissing]

00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:52.279
[grunt]

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.616
[pained grunt and groan]

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.619
[pained grunts and groans]

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:04.057
[hissing]

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.425
Sarada! Get back!

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.428
[hissing]

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:10.430
[nervous squeal]

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:11.598
Sarada!

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:13.267
[grunt]

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.271
[hissing]

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:19.273
[gasp]

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:25.746
[hissing]

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.047
[gasp]

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.249
(CHO-CHO) <i>Sarada, over here!</i>

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:29.583
Huh?

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:35.756
[hissing]

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.559
Whoa! Who'd have thought
there'd be another one...?!

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:40.060
What do we do?!

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:42.763
There's no choice. We gotta
retreat!

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:44.498
Not gonna argue with that one!

00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.267
[hissing]

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:55.075
(MOEGI) <i>I've just returned.</i>

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:58.679
Moegi... You mean that you've
come back alone?

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:04.151
Well, you see... Shikadai and
the others on my team ended up
going with Boruto...

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:06.587
[groans]

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.822
They left this behind for me.

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:09.756
Hm...?

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:13.694
I see...

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.429
So, he went along with them...

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.598
Huh?

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:23.070
I don't have any doubt that
Shikadai's come to the same
conclusions that we have...

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.806
about this case.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:30.043
After finding Boruto, he must've
learned something that bothered
him about Mitsuki's departure...

00:08:30.077 --> 00:08:32.479
And that's why he went
with Boruto.

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:35.782
But what did he discover that
bothered him?

00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:38.485
I'm afraid I don't know what it
was...

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.286
[groans]

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.759
He's finally stabilizing now.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.896
[pained groans]

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:53.433
Hm... Based on his condition,
he should regain consciousness
soon.

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:56.470
Hm?

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:57.638
Hey, Yurito...

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:59.473
Yes, what is it?

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:03.644
I have a report intended for
Lord Seventh.

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:07.047
So take this to Lord Seventh?
Sure thing, Sakura!

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.650
Uh... You don't have to rush
you know?!

00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:11.151
Okay!

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:17.090
Hmph... The chunin that were
attacked are still unconscious.

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:19.493
We'd better get some fresh intel
soon...

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:24.665
Because I won't be able to hold
off those two advisors for very
much longer.

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:28.602
I'm sorry about all this.
Thanks, Granny Tsunade.

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:32.606
Under normal circumstances, this
issue could put the Hokage's
position at risk...

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:35.576
But thanks to you keeping the
<i>elders at bay...</i>

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:39.580
we've managed to avoid creating
<i>unnecessary chaos for the</i>
<i>village.</i>

00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:43.817
Ugh... Damn it! Just put
yourself in my place, hearing
them complain...

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:47.554
I don't think that I'm ever
gonna hear the end of it!

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.056
Excuse me!

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.592
Ah... What do you need, Yurito?

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.063
Sakura just asked me to bring
this report to you.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.599
I see. Thank you!

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:00.767
I'd better get back now.

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:06.573
Hmmm...

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:07.908
Finally! A little good news.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:08.742
Hm?

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:11.879
One of the chunin should be
awake soon.

00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:12.746
[gasps]

00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:18.051
Maybe now we'll be able to get
some details about the way
Mitsuki left the village.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.019
Let's hope.

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:23.056
Ino already looked into his
memories right up to the point
where he got knocked...

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.592
unconscious.

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:27.961
But we should be able to get
some more clues by talking to
him directly.

00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:31.598
Alright... I wonder what kind of
info we'll find...

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.472
Who knew that snake was gonna be
so big?!

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:42.910
How can we get the Reverse Scale
now?! With two of them, it's
just impossible!

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.711
Hmmm...

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:45.646
[sigh]

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.346
Hm?

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:48.549
What is it, Sarada? What's the
matter?

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:50.484
Huh? Well...

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.386
Hm...?

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.388
It's just that blue snake
before...

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:58.559
I got the feeling it was trying
to protect me or something...

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:01.061
[chuckle] Aw...Come on, there's
just no way!

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:05.132
I mean, monsters like that don't
have any kind of conscience or
anything.

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.000
Yeah, you're right...

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:10.737
Anyway, we've gotta think of a
way to get that Reverse Scale.

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:15.008
[gasps] What-?!

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.747
No way!

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.689
Oh no! It's here!

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.657
Oh, man! Just what we need-

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:31.291
Wait!

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.271
Hey! Sarada...?!

00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:46.573
So did you...

00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:48.742
...really protect me...

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.744
...during that fight?

00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:54.381
Hey, hold on!

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:55.182
[gasps]

00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:57.651
(AODA) <i>You are...</i>

00:11:57.684 --> 00:11:58.585
[gasp]

00:11:59.453 --> 00:12:00.687
(AODA) <i>...Lady Sarada, I</i>
<i>presume?</i>

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:05.425
I wondered when the day would
come that I'd finally meet you.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:13.400
My name is Aoda. I am a
Summoning Snake who has pledged
loyalty to Lord Sasuke.

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:15.068
To my Dad?!

00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:16.937
It's a talking snake!

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.373
Not only that, but he's super
polite!

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.441
Uh... Eh...

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:30.417
[hissing] Aoda, you piece of
trash! You've got some nerve
getting in my way!

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:38.025
I'll kill any human that comes
near me... no matter who it
might be!

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:41.395
[hissing]

00:12:46.667 --> 00:12:52.072
Ah, so you must acquire Garaga's
Reverse Scale to find this
youth, Mitsuki?

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:57.744
Huh? What's the matter?

00:12:57.778 --> 00:13:01.682
I was just thinking that
ordinary methods won't work...

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:06.420
Yeah, we know, believe me! So
could you help us, Aoda?

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.522
C'mon! Are you sure about doing
this?

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:13.961
Let down our guard, and this guy
might just bite all our heads
off when we're not looking.

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:18.532
Surely you jest. I have no
interest whatsoever in eating
humans.

00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:19.867
[chuckle]

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.969
Uhhh... You heard that?!

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:24.505
I'd like to ask you something...

00:13:24.538 --> 00:13:26.006
<i>Hm?</i>

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:28.308
I can see that you don't have a
Reverse Scale.

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:32.513
So does that mean that Garaga
is the only snake who has one,
then?

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:38.285
No. But snakes with a
violent temperament like Garaga
usually do.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:43.290
They become obedient once their
Reverse Scale has been taken.

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:48.529
Lady Sarada, it's too dangerous
to continue this fool's errand.

00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:51.698
I believe it's best not to
engage Garaga.

00:13:51.732 --> 00:13:54.434
Huh? But why?

00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:57.971
He's dangerous. What other
reason do you need?

00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:05.078
All the snakes who live here in
Ryuchi Cave despise him. None of
them will go near him.

00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:09.683
You see? Snakes are snakes,
after all. They're nothing but
trouble, I mean--!

00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:10.984
Whoa!

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:13.620
How rude! [snort]

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:21.728
I shall escort you to the exit,
And I shall protect you until
you reach the Leaf Village.

00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:26.967
Wait, Aoda, please! I already
explained to you why we can't
go home just yet.

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:28.035
Hm?

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:33.974
Listen, please help us! There's
no choice! We have to get
Garaga's Reverse Scale somehow!

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:36.443
Lady Sarada...

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:45.285
What's the matter, Shikamaru?

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:46.086
Hm?

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:48.522
I uh...

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.691
I was just thinking through some
things.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:51.625
Hm...

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.062
(SHIKAMARU)
Shikadai must've figured
something out on his own.

00:14:55.095 --> 00:14:58.599
That has to be why he went with
<i>Boruto...</i>

00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:02.035
And yet, based on the chunin
guard's memories...

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:04.938
everything we know points
to Mitsuki being guilty.

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:09.843
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm
working off that assumption in
my orders to the shinobi.

00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:15.415
But still, I wonder... What if
Mitsuki truly is being targeted
by somebody?

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:17.484
What do you believe would happen
then?

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:24.625
Mitsuki's origin is a highly
classified secret in the Leaf.
It's known to only a few of us.

00:15:24.658 --> 00:15:26.426
Just what are you saying?

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.428
(SHIKAMARU) <i>Access to that</i>
<i>data...</i>

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:32.633
...is limited to those
authorized to freely enter this
room. That's it.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.434
Hm?!

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.505
[chattering]

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:42.676
I wonder if Boruto and Sarada
are going to be able to return
safely...

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:46.880
The village is under a strict
watch. If we leave without
authorization...

00:15:46.914 --> 00:15:49.516
then we'll end up being labeled
as Rogue Ninja.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.687
[quivering] So if we're caught
by the trackers, then are we
gonna be killed?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.925
Hey, come on, now. I'm sure
they wouldn't go as far as
all that.

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.995
He's right. We'd just be brought
back here and punished, wouldn't
we?

00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:05.098
Sumire... what's the matter?

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:09.670
I was just wondering if there's
anything at all that we might be
able to do.

00:16:09.703 --> 00:16:11.438
[sighs and groans]

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.608
It's definitely frustrating...

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:15.609
What is, Iwabe...?

00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:20.747
I just mean that... I feel like
leaving the village right now to
go and help...

00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:22.282
But, I can't...

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:23.317
[gasp]

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:26.453
Because our mission's to stay
here and guard the village.

00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:31.525
If someone attacked the guards
at the gate, who knows what else
could happen...

00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:32.459
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:33.627 --> 00:16:36.296
I guess we just have to focus on
our mission right now.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.464
[sighs]

00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:43.971
Don't worry you guys! Boruto and
the others will handle all this!
Right, Sumire?

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:47.140
That's right! I'm sure they
will!

00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:58.585
Well... I'm going home to
change, so I'll leave it to you
for now.

00:16:58.619 --> 00:17:00.454
Right! I understand!

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:05.158
[heavy breathing]

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:09.096
You forget something? Oh, hey,
Yurito!

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:10.697
Where did Sakura go?

00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:13.667
She just left. Didn't you see
her on your way in?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.636
Mh-m.

00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:16.970
You wanna leave a message?

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:21.575
No, thanks. It's okay. Hey, I
heard that he might be waking up
sometimes soon.

00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:24.611
It'd be great if he could give
us new information.

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.514
(MEDICAL NINJA) <i>Yeah, I hope so.</i>

00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:32.085
Everyone is so on edge! It'd be
great to resolve all this soon.

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:34.521
Well... sorry to have
bothered you.

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:37.624
No! Thanks for providing
security, Yurito!

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.374
Oh!

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:54.975
Oh!

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:58.045
Hey, Hinata! You here to see
Naruto?

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:01.582
Yes... I just brought him a
change of clothes.

00:18:01.615 --> 00:18:05.652
Oh... I was going home to get a
change of clothes, too!

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:08.755
Seems like I'm gonna be here
for a while longer...

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:09.857
[sigh]

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.625
Hinata?

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:15.028
Sakura... I'm so sorry...

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:18.198
It's Boruto's fault that
Sarada's involved in all this.

00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:20.767
[gasp]

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:23.604
When they're brought back, she's
going to be punished for it, as
well...

00:18:23.637 --> 00:18:28.575
Sarada's responsible for her own
actions. You don't have to worry
about that kinda stuff.

00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:30.077
Sakura...!

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.946
They're both full-fledged ninja
now.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.084
They're completely aware they're
putting their rank as genin on
the line.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:40.521
[gasp] You're right...

00:18:40.554 --> 00:18:44.858
They left the village fully
aware of the consequences they
might face.

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:50.330
Unfortunately, all that we can
really do now is hope that
they'll return safely.

00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:54.168
But really!... Where are they
now? And what are they doing?

00:18:58.772 --> 00:19:04.678
Let me be clear that I will only
cooperate when Lady Sarada
gives me an order.

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:07.681
I am in no way your ally.

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:12.419
Oh, yeah, is that right? Well,
whatever... I just hope you
got our strategy down.

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:13.987
Hey, Boruto!

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:15.455
Sorry about that!

00:19:17.024 --> 00:19:20.928
It's fine. I just wonder what
Lord Sasuke would have to say
about this...

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:25.699
The keys to this whole strategy
are going to be Cho-Cho, Boruto,
and you, Aoda.

00:19:25.732 --> 00:19:27.601
I'm counting on you guys.

00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:29.036
[agreement reactions]

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:30.971
Alright, let's go!

00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:37.211
Heh?!

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:40.614

00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:48.055
Heh?!

00:19:48.455 --> 00:19:49.223
[grunt]

00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.592
Bring it on, big guy!

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:56.430
Huh?! Who are you? Eh, whatever,
doesn't matter!

00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:58.732
Huh?! What?!

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:00.801
Seriously?!

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:04.771
[straining] I-I can't breathe...

00:20:10.344 --> 00:20:13.580
Aggghhh!

00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:18.986
You think you got me? Well,
guess what? I'll still crush
you!

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:20.988
[hissing and biting]

00:20:21.355 --> 00:20:22.789

[grunt] I've got it! [heavy

00:21:12.406 --> 00:21:16.176
You think you can come in here

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.444
[gasp]

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:22.983
I've had enough! Back off, you
hear me?! Ahhh!

00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:26.587
[gasp] What is-?! Yuck, how
