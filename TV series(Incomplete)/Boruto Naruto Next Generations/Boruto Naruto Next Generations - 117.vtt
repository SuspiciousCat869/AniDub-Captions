WEBVTT

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.209
Now, please take your leave.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.682
Miss Remon, you seem
kind of different

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.451
than the last time we saw you.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:20.554
Remon.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.522
(gasps)

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.724
This is not the proper
way to treat people

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.192
to whom you're beholden.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.129
Please.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.998
We must thank them properly.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.133
The reason we came here
isn't to be thanked.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.936
And anyway, who are you?

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.971
Oh, I beg your pardon?

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.373
My name's Kankitsu Akitsuki.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:44.178
I'm Remon's fiancé, and
I'll soon be her husband.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.612
What?

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:50.350
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:08.035
-(singing in Japanese)

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:21.441
(Opening Theme Music)

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:29.816
I understand now.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.817
I'm so sorry.

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.719
I wasn't aware of the situation.

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:37.090
As you can see,
Remon's rather busy

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:39.226
with the preparations
for the wedding.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.828
We are quite short on time.

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:44.364
May I ask you to
take your leave?

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:48.068
Yes, but first, could I
return this handkerchief?

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:52.005
I forgot to give it back to
her the last time I saw her.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.575
Look, that's enough.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:59.713
Now please just leave.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.452
(Konohamaru grunts)

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:09.356
Yes. I see.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.092
-Sorry to bother you.
-Hm?

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.561
But big bro, you came to
return the handkerchief.

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:15.562
[Konohamaru] Forget it.

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:16.597
We're leaving.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.802
I just don't get what
happened back there at all.

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:24.171
Is that actually
what girls are like?

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:29.042
I mean, she treated us
like we were trespassers.

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.813
I thought that all of
us had become friends.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:33.814
Didn't you?

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:35.215
But I guess underneath it all,

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.317
she didn't feel
the same way, huh?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.322
On top of everything,
she has a fiancé.

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:46.727
Hey, I wonder what that
was all about, you know?

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.096
[Girl] Uh...

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.331
-Huh?
-Is it this way?

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:59.072
Hey, the sun's about to set,
so you ought to head home.

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:01.675
You shouldn't be playing out
here when nighttime comes.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.076
[Girl] I'm not playing.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.946
I'll try to figure out
the way to go to get home.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.315
[Boruto] The way home?
Well, where do you live?

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.350
Daidai Village.

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:13.587
But all of a sudden, I can't
remember which way to go.

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:15.822
(Boruto sighs)

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.224
Hey, come on.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.560
You really ought to learn
where your house is at least.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:20.561
There's no choice.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:23.230
We'll just have to take
her back to her village.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.098
Hold on, Daidai Village?

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:27.801
That's where Miss
Remon lives, isn't it?

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:31.038
(Konohamaru grunts)

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:33.340
[Kankitsu] What's the matter?

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.075
If it's about that handkerchief,

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.044
I'll buy you all that you want.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.049
[Remon] Please just let
me return to my room.

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:44.952
Yes, of course.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:46.720
Oh, and I forgot to mention.

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.756
For right now, until
the wedding ritual,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.060
you'll be staying in a special
room I've had prepared.

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.462
In a special room?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.804
But why do I have to stay here?

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:05.606
I've been feeling guilty.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.209
For far too long, I've
ignored you too much,

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:12.412
and frankly, I've left you in
an environment that's unsafe,

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:13.680
my dear Remon.

00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.215
So I've prepared a place for you

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.085
that's safer than anywhere else.

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:21.221
Still to be kept in
a place like this?

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:23.290
It feels like I'm a...

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.559
(gasps)

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:28.595
(melancholy music)

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:31.598
Poor lady Remon.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:37.538
I simply can't allow anything
to happen to my bride to be

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.806
before the wedding ritual.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.309
You must know that
too. Right, Remon?

00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:45.579
It's all for the
sake of the village.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.714
I understand.

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:55.189
Also, just in case, I'll
take this for safekeeping.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:58.625
Please, just wait.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.095
That precious hair clip
guards my memories from Soma!

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.364
Of course. I'm aware of that.

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:08.035
But still our wedding ritual
is right around the corner.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:12.606
To ensure nothing happens
to this hair clip,

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.443
I, your future spouse, will
hold onto it and keep it safe.

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:21.348
I don't know what happened,
but you've really changed.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.817
You weren't like this before.

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:27.221
(Kankitsu chuckles)

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:29.623
Anzu, where have you been?

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:32.226
Well it looks like everything's
turned out just fine.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.328
Yeah. All that fuss for nothing.

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:36.029
It was really weird.

00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:37.831
All of a sudden, I
couldn't remember

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:39.066
where the village was.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:44.037
(village people chattering)

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.344
You know, since we've
already come all this way,

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:53.614
what do you say we try to see
Miss Remon one more time, huh?

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:56.550
Since we didn't get a chance
to talk to her earlier.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.351
Don't be ridiculous.

00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:58.952
We can't do something like that.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:02.489
Oh come on big bro. Aren't
you worried about her?

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:05.692
She wasn't cold to us when
we met her in the Leaf.

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.061
Well, that's just...

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:13.100
That was such a cruel
thing to do to you.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.368
I don't understand.

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:17.204
Lord Kankitsu used
to be much kinder.

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:20.474
To take away your
hair clip. (sighs)

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:22.476
He's just nervous
because he's carrying

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.946
such a large responsibility
on his shoulders.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.948
We must make sure
that the ritual

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.450
just has to go smoothly
no matter what.

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:34.054
Actually, about that.

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:36.390
Huh?

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.959
Well, it seems that there's
another in the village

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:41.061
who's lost their memory.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.632
Oh no.

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:48.802
It was a little girl, and
because her memory was gone,

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.204
she'd gotten lost.

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.940
But luckily some travelers
who were passing by

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.575
came to her rescue.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.744
But why is this
happening so soon?

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:01.315
Nothing like this has ever
been spoken of in the legend.

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:04.184
I'm afraid I don't know.

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.321
We must hurry with
the wedding ritual.

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:12.726
-Lady Remon.
-(tense music)

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:17.097
[Boruto] What's going on?

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.466
Security wasn't anywhere
near as tight this afternoon.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.368
[Konohamaru] Yeah.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:22.803
[Boruto] It's strange
enough that Miss Remon

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.938
was so cold to us
all of a sudden,

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.673
but then the moment
we came to see her,

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.208
security suddenly got tighter?

00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:30.811
There's just got to be
something going on here.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.212
[Konohamaru] I
guess we should go

00:08:32.246 --> 00:08:34.081
try to find Miss Remon and
ask her what's happening.

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:35.082
(Boruto chuckles)

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:36.350
[Boruto] Roger that.

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:38.352
This is a personal
investigation, not a mission.

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:40.954
So unnecessary involvements
forbidden, okay?

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:43.223
Yeah, well you may say
that but you're the one

00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:45.826
who really wants to talk
to Miss Remon, big brother.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.828
Ah, that's not true.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.062
Hey!

00:08:56.837 --> 00:08:59.306
(soft music)

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:03.043
(gasps)

00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:06.446
(humming)

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:08.448
Hm?

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.351
Super sour!

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.954
Mr. Konohamaru, you
have to try this.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.189
Uh...

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:21.061
Okay. Here goes.

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.465
(grumbling)

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:34.408
Super sour! (coughs)

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.275
(giggles)

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:37.044
He said he didn't
like sour things,

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:40.214
but the way he choked
was too much. (laughs)

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:43.717
The face he made when he ate
that burger was so funny, aye?

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:46.720
[Konohamaru] Did I
really look that funny?

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.596
Mr. Konohamaru, you...

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:02.903
What are you doing in a
place like this anyway?

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.972
[Konohamaru] Who
did this to you?

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.174
Lord Kankitsu did.

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:09.743
Although he told me
that he put me in here

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.645
out of concern for my safety.

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:12.713
[Boruto] Concern?

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:15.415
I don't care how concerned
he is, this is cruel.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.752
Oh, I really don't mind.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.654
You're acting all
weird, Miss Remon.

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:21.889
You're different than you were

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.024
when we met back in
the Leaf Village.

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.260
And you're not wearing
your hair clip.

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:29.630
Yes, Lord Kankitsu
said that he'd

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.765
just hold onto it for me.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.368
Why? Does my hair look funny?

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:36.737
No, I'm so sorry.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.138
I didn't mean it that way.

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:40.174
-(Miss Remon laughs)
-Hey, it's not funny.

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:42.743
Wow. That's a relief for sure.

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:44.444
That's the Remon we know.

00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:47.147
Whatever the reason for
putting you in here might be,

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:49.449
we can't just leave
you like this.

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:52.119
Shall I go and talk
to Mr. Kankitsu?

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:55.822
-(Miss Remon sighs)
-It's all right.

00:10:55.856 --> 00:11:00.194
This is really the only way
that we can save the village.

00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:02.329
It's the only way
to save the village?

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:04.531
And just what do
you mean by that?

00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:09.369
Will you tell us
what's going on here?

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:15.275
The story begins 400 years ago.

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:19.179
Back then Daidai Village was
in danger of being destroyed

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:22.115
by a demon monster
by the name of Soma.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.920
Soma is an entity that
consumes human memories.

00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:29.056
Human memories?

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:31.325
[Remon] Once someone
loses their memories,

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.460
they don't recognize
their own families.

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:35.596
And they even
forget who they are.

00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:39.166
Supposedly they end up
wasting away and dying.

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.402
It's said to have
looked like this.

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:47.374
A monster with horns, huh?

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:51.645
So what happened to Soma, then?

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:53.547
To save the village, Lady Kuen,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.251
the shrine maiden back then,
set out to eliminate Soma,

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:02.623
but Soma was too strong,
so Lady Kuen wasn't able

00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:04.024
to completely destroy it.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.829
Lady Kuen was possessed by Soma,

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:12.432
but before her body was about
to be completely taken over,

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:16.270
she was able to seal Soma
away in stone just in time.

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:19.706
In order to extract
Soma from her body,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.543
she cut off the horns that
had grown out of the rock.

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:25.646
But in that moment, a
part of Soma's power

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:27.147
was locked within her.

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:32.319
After that Lady Kuen stepped
down as shrine maiden.

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:35.455
She was unaware that she'd
been tainted with Soma's curse,

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:37.157
and when she bore
twins later on,

00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:39.159
it was passed down to them.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.261
[Boruto] A curse?

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:44.798
When an afflicted
reaches 20 years of age,

00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:46.667
the curse appears as a marking.

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.570
The mark indicates
that whoever bears it

00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:53.140
acts as a connection between
Soma and the outside world.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:55.409
In other words,
they're a portal.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.312
And at that point, Soma
begins slowly draining

00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:01.515
all of the memories away
from whoever's been cursed.

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:03.016
Their memories?

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.620
Does that mean you're
saying you're a...

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:07.621
Yes.

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:10.057
I'm a descendant of the
shrine maiden Lady Kuen

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.558
who sealed Soma.

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:14.761
Lord Kankitsu's also a
descendant from a bloodline

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:16.730
that branched off 400 years ago.

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:20.167
The Akitsuki Clan's originally
from the same bloodline.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.568
Wait, hold on just a minute.

00:13:21.602 --> 00:13:24.004
You said people's
memories get stolen,

00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:25.639
but how can that be Miss Remon?

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:28.175
I mean, you still remember us.

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.043
All the memories are
only drained away

00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:32.880
little by little over the
course of several years.

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.414
But the women who become cursed

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:37.050
also inherit a tool
handed down by Lady Kuen

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:39.553
which helps them to
stave off that process.

00:13:40.554 --> 00:13:41.788
That's the...

00:13:41.822 --> 00:13:43.590
Yes, the hair clip.

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:47.027
It's a special item that
Lady Kuen herself made.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.396
It protects one's
memory from Soma.

00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:51.665
The hair clip does that?

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:54.468
Soma's power is enormous.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:57.304
The seal that's holding it
weakens every hundred years,

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.906
and that allows Soma to regain

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:00.541
at least a part of his power.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.910
When horns grow out of the rock,

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.445
that's the sign its
power is returning.

00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:07.881
So once that occurs,
that means Soma

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:09.149
is going to come back.

00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:12.019
To prevent that from
happening, every hundred years,

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:14.588
a man and a woman from the
two bloodlines manifest

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:17.424
the marking, and the
two of them are wed.

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:20.794
At that time, Soma's
horn is cut off

00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:23.330
and a ritual to
reseal Soma is held.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.433
Lord Kankitsu has also been
cursed with the marking.

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.903
All this means that we've
now reached the time.

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:32.272
When the hundred years are up.

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:35.008
And that means you
and Mr. Kankitsu...

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.579
But I don't get it.

00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:40.581
Why can't you just
perform the sealing ritual

00:14:40.614 --> 00:14:43.984
without having to go through
all the getting married stuff?

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:49.156
Lord Kankitsu
inherited the marking,

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.058
just the same as I have.

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:53.794
And this curse
connection to Soma,

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:56.196
it's draining his memories.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.666
The only way to break it is
through the wedding ritual.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.701
Miss Remon...

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:05.272
Leave it to us, you know.

00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:09.309
Big bro and I will destroy
the Soma creature, no problem.

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:12.546
And then you won't have to marry
Kankitsu, isn't that right?

00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:15.682
Thanks so much for your offer

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:18.285
but Soma doesn't actually
have a physical presence,

00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:21.788
so it can't be destroyed with
weapons or with ninjutsu.

00:15:21.822 --> 00:15:23.056
What? No way.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.191
I've never heard of that.

00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:26.927
No, things like that
really do exist.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.062
My grandpa died from
using a Forbidden Jutsu

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:31.331
where he entered into
a contract with a being

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.634
beyond human comprehension.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.702
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:39.673
Now you see, that's why I
have to marry Lord Kankitsu.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:44.111
(Konohamaru grumbles)

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:49.616
(insects buzzing)

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.019
Is he going out again?

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:55.122
But where does he go
at this late hour?

00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:57.024
(owl hooting)

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:59.526
Still, that Kankitsu's
a horrible guy.

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:01.929
Am I right, big bro?

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.530
Why are you asking me?

00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:04.598
No reason.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:07.067
Hey, come on Boruto,
don't tease adults!

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.302
(Miss Remon laughs)

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.037
You two are very close,
aren't you? (laughs)

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.406
I've known him since
he was a little baby,

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:15.509
but lately he's become
such a know it all.

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.411
Hey, no way. I am not.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.781
I have known Lord Kankitsu

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:23.417
since the both of
us were children,

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.386
but he wasn't always the
cold person you've seen.

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:29.556
He's changed so much.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.459
-Miss Remon, I-
-Okay, but still,

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.595
even if it was because
of the Soma monster,

00:16:34.628 --> 00:16:36.930
anybody would hate having
to get married to a guy

00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.799
who locked them up
like this, you know?

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:39.800
Hey, Boruto-

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.035
Don't you think so too, big bro?

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:43.871
Even if it's to seal Soma away,

00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:46.540
what's the point if Miss
Remon won't be happy?

00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:51.778
Boruto, I'm okay with this.

00:16:51.812 --> 00:16:53.046
Come on, Miss Remon.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.148
That's not how you
really feel is it?

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:05.025
It may not be right away,

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:07.327
but the Leaf just
might have a way

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:09.129
to combat this Soma entity.

00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:14.168
And if so, Miss Remon,
then your curse will-

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.571
Do you remember back in
the Hidden Leaf Village,

00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:20.641
when you told me about
your grandfather?

00:17:20.674 --> 00:17:21.642
Yes.

00:17:21.675 --> 00:17:23.010
When I think back on that,

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.445
I'm sure it was
destiny in action.

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:28.415
Hearing that story
greatly eased my anxiety

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.651
and allowed me to
make up my mind.

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:34.154
That story gave me courage right

00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:36.890
at the time when
I needed it most.

00:17:36.924 --> 00:17:39.159
I believe that your
grandfather must've felt

00:17:39.193 --> 00:17:42.162
the same way back then
as I do right now.

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:45.933
And you inherited
your determination

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:47.134
from your grandfather.

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:49.903
If you were in my position now,

00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:53.173
I think you would
make the same choice.

00:17:53.207 --> 00:17:56.276
-Isn't that right?
-(soft music)

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:09.489
I apologize that
it's so wrinkled.

00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:10.457
That's all right.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.659
I'm glad we were able
to talk once again.

00:18:14.628 --> 00:18:19.299
-Thank you for your concern.
-(soft music)

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:21.735
[Boruto] I just don't
get any of this.

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.036
[Konohamaru] Get what?

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.839
Why are you going to leave
Miss Remon like this?

00:18:25.873 --> 00:18:27.407
There's no way that
she actually wants

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:31.545
-to marry that Kankitsu guy.
-(soft music)

00:18:49.563 --> 00:18:51.031
Hey! Big bro?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.169
[Konohamaru] All right.

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.171
Hey, when I get
back to the village,

00:18:57.204 --> 00:18:59.506
I'm going to work real hard.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.507
(Boruto groans)

00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:02.276
-Pardon me?
-Huh?

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.279
My name's Asaki.

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:07.447
I'm from the Yoimura Clan,

00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:10.551
and I act as Lady
Remon's attendant.

00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:15.189
I've come to see
you today because

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:18.725
I want to make a request
of you Hidden Leaf Shinobi.

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:20.527
Yes? What can we do for you?

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:24.698
Please, I'd like you to
investigate Lord Kankitsu.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.167
Why is that?

00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:29.903
You may have already heard
this from Lady Remon,

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:34.308
but still, Lord Kankitsu
once was very kind.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:37.311
He and Lady Remon have
been the best of friends

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.546
since they were both children.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.616
But ever since the date
was set for the ritual,

00:19:42.649 --> 00:19:44.918
his personality has changed.

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:47.154
He's become very cold.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:51.058
So you're telling us that his
personality suddenly changed?

00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:53.160
And nearly every night it seems

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:56.163
he also goes off
somewhere all by himself.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.998
What should we do, big bro?

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:00.634
I understand.

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.169
We'll look into it.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.137
[Asaki] Oh, thank you very much.

00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:06.139
[Boruto] Come on.
Let's get going.

00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:13.146
-(crow cawing)
-(tense music)

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:18.452
Well, nothing weird so far.

00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:21.154
Let's keep watching
for a little longer.

00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:26.660
(tense music)

00:20:34.768 --> 00:20:37.371
He's going to where
Miss Remon is.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:38.405
Hm.

00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:46.780
[Kankitsu] You must
eat or you'll collapse.

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:50.184
(Miss Remon gasps)

00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:52.786
I'm not feeling very hungry now.

00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:54.421
That doesn't sound good.

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.057
We're going to be married soon.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.193
I don't think it's
a good idea for us

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:01.428
to have any secrets between us.

00:21:04.298 --> 00:21:05.199
Oh?

00:21:05.232 --> 00:21:06.567
Please, give it back!

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:11.505
Did an insect get
in here somehow?

00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:20.013
-Hm.
-(tense music)

00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:25.285
Nothing happened at all.

00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:27.287
After he left Miss Remon,

00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:29.556
he just went back to
his room and slept.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.526
No sign of anything
suspicious here, either.

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:33.694
There's no choice.

00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:36.530
I guess that we ought to go
report into Auntie Asaki.

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:41.668
(tense music)

00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:47.241
(dramatic music)

00:21:51.912 --> 00:21:52.980
How strange.

00:21:53.013 --> 00:21:55.249
What was I just about
to do right now?

00:22:00.954 --> 00:22:02.523
(Boruto groans)

00:22:02.556 --> 00:22:04.925
Boy, auntie's really late.

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:08.161
(Konohamaru grunts)

00:22:11.565 --> 00:22:14.234
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:35.255
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:45.392
I'm home.

00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:46.793
Welcome back.

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:48.629
Hey, uh, what happened?

00:23:48.662 --> 00:23:49.897
Your clothes are so muddy.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.031
[Boruto] Oh yeah.

00:23:51.064 --> 00:23:52.866
I think I must have
fallen or something.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:53.867
[Himawari] Big brother.

00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:55.402
Why do you have a hair clip?

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:57.304
[Boruto] What?
Hey, you're right.

00:23:57.337 --> 00:23:59.907
I have no idea why I have this.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.043
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:03.076 --> 00:24:05.179
"Something That
Steals Memories."

00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:07.014
Nevermind that, I gotta go try

00:24:07.047 --> 00:24:09.283
the latest burger that
they came out with.

00:24:11.952 --> 00:24:17.157
