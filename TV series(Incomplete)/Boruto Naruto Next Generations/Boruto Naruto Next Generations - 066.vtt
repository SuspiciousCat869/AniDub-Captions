WEBVTT

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.256
[smiling]

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.627
Thank goodness!

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.629
[chuckling]
Yeah.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.864
Oh, thank you,
Boruto!

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.533
Mom, it's okay!
Stop it--

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.600
Daddy!

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.571
-Welcome back!
-Welcome back, Dad!

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.109
<i>You okay, Big</i>
<i>Brother?</i>

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.244
Heh. This is
nothing!

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.419
<i>The attack by the</i>
<i>Otsutsuki Clan caused</i>
<i>a lot of damage in</i>

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:57.558
<i>the village, and it</i>
<i>meant that we had to</i>
<i>cancel the Chunin Exams.</i>

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.527
<i>The official report</i>
<i>was that the Five</i>
<i>Kage joined forces</i>

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.898
<i>and put an end to the</i>
<i>whole incident. And</i>
<i>soon... things began</i>

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:07.734
<i>to return to normal</i>
<i>in the village.</i>

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.904
<i>Dad also went back to</i>
<i>his usual hectic</i>
<i>schedule.</i>

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.241
<i>I get it now. Being</i>
<i>Hokage really is hard.</i>

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.279
<i>As for me...</i>

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.422
Are you sure that you
don't want me get you
a new one, Boruto?

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.590
Yeah!

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.225
It looks cool like
that.

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.603
I'm so sorry!

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:23.737
Uh!

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.406
D-Do you think an
apology changes
things?!

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:30.310
You're right. I can't
undo what I did.

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:33.780
But I just--I just
wanted to apologize
for...

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.315
... for putting you
through that.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.416
[scoffing]

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:42.022
Shinki...

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.962
I don't know exactly
what that Scientific
Ninja Tool is capable

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.698
of, but don't you
dare cheat like that
again.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.500
Later.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.173
You going around
apologizing to
everyone?

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:02.943
What's the deal, you
guys? If you're gonna
mock me, go home.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.945
The exams were
cancelled, so...

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.947
... maybe you should
just drop it.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.749
No, I gotta
own up to it.

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:11.718
Yeah, I mean, it was
all your fault to
begin with.

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:12.986
Mm.

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:17.457
All right already!
Why do you think I'm
apologizing?!

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.928
<i>I'm guessing this isn't</i>
<i>the end of things with</i>
<i>them, is it?</i>

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:24.331
I sincerely doubt it.
As long as they plan
on coming after the

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:27.935
chakra in this land,
I'm sure that they're
going to attack again.

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.104
Then for now, I guess
all that we can
really do is... keep

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:34.107
on investigating the
ruins left behind by
Kaguya.

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:37.477
What worries me right
now is the one who
got away.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.480
Yeah... but you'd
better be extra
careful!

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:43.483
According to Gaara
and the others, he
hasn't revealed his

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:44.785
full powers yet.

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.920
I know that.
See you later.

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:48.188
What, you're leaving?

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:51.992
Yeah. I'm the only
one who's able to
track him.

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.127
But... why don't you
stay here and rest

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:55.295
for just a little
bit longer?

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.800
You know, to hang out
with Sakura and Sarada,
that's all.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.002
You're in no position
to talk.

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.905
[awkward chuckling]

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:06.039
By the way...

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:08.475
About the results of
the Chunin Exams...

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.112
Even though we had to
cancel it, we did
still get to observe

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.614
everybody's
abilities.

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:17.184
Which means that the
next step is to meet
up with the other

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.920
villages to discuss
exactly how we should
move forward.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.121
Oh, that's right.

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.826
And we have to figure
out what we're going to
do about Katasuke and

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:27.828
the Scientific Ninja
Tools...

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:30.998
That reminds me... We
got word that Killer
Bee returned to the

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:33.133
Hidden Cloud Village.
He's okay.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.936
Old Man Bee is okay?!

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.038
Oh, man! Thank
goodness!

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.141
Oh, uh...

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.777
I was thinking
that... I'd like to
take some time off...

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.645
Huh?!

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.347
But I probably
shouldn't...

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.784
No, no! That's fine,
of course! You're the
Hokage, after all!

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.620
You can decide
whenever you want to
take time off!

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:54.788
R-Right!

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.790
But first, just make
sure that you take

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.592
care of all this
paperwork.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:05:59.326
[groaning]

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:03.030
How long is all of
this gonna take me?!

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.900
[chatting]

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:10.804
Ever since the Exams
were cancelled, we've
been so busy. I mean

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:12.105
I haven't even
had a break.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.775
After the Otsutsuki
incident, there's
been a lot of

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:17.811
cleaning up to do and
a bunch of other
little missions, too.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.347
After all, we are
pros at public works!

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.050
Well, I wouldn't go
stretching the truth
quite that far...

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:26.353
Mitsuki, how are you?
You feeling better
now?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.421
Yes, I'm okay.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.158
Thank goodness! You
were hurt so badly
back there we started

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.993
to get worried you
weren't gonna make
it.

00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:36.730
Oh, well, back then,
I infused more chakra
than usual, that's

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.332
why I was hurt more.

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.634
Yeah? Oh, I didn't
know that...

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.637
Yes. It was a good
thing my parent
made me strong!

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.405
That's what
saved me.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.307
Uh, your parent...?

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:48.775
Oh... Yes...

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.078
Man, am I tired!

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.815
How many missions are
we gonna have to go
on? What a drag!

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.149
And it's all
because...

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:58.986
...someone did too
well at the Chunin
Exams.

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:02.155
Hey come on... I gotta
try hard sometimes or

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.992
else my dad will
lose face.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.194
Besides, I don't want
to lose to Boruto.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:09.730
Uh!

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.031
[grunting]

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:18.739
[train whistle blowing]

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.284
[awkward sighing]

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.286
[groaning]

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:34.354
Look, Shikadai--!

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:34.755
Sorry!

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:39.393
Hold on... Why are
you apologizing to me
right now?!

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:43.163
Well, I mean, I told
you that I'd hear
what you had to say,

00:07:43.197 --> 00:07:45.299
but I've been so busy
and made you wait,
so...

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.901
That doesn't matter
at a time like this!

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.236
Of course it does!

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:51.705
Listen, I'm the one
saying sorry!

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:53.240
I'm apologizing, too!

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.311
[giggling]

00:07:57.344 --> 00:07:59.980
Hey, stop that,
Shikadai! Knock
it off!

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:00.747
Don't mess with me!

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:02.583
You're so slow. You
just noticed?!

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:04.318
Just shut up,
all right?!

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:14.361
[laughing]

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:16.763
So...

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:19.466
Anyway, in the end,
you had to take on a
whole bunch of stuff

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.968
all by yourself...

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.136
At least let me
apologize for that.

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:25.005
Hmm.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.141
So I'm sorry.

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.444
You're not supposed
to apologize first,
though...

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:31.745
Oh, right.

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:37.117
Anyway... I feel bad
I cheated. I'm really
sorry.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.185
Don't worry about it.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:45.425
So...? What was the
power of the Five
Kage like?

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:48.228
Those guys are like
crazy strong!

00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:50.197
And especially my
dad!

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:56.203
But, uh... I
haven't lost to
him yet, you know!

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:57.771
I swear, I'm
gonna be an even

00:08:57.804 --> 00:08:59.439
greater shinobi
than my dad!

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:02.409
Hmm. Heh.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:06.813
Hey, Boruto... Do you
remember the names
and faces of the guys

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:08.549
who took part in the
Chunin Exams?

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:09.616
Huh?

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.919
You remember what
kinda guys were
there, right?

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:14.288
Yeah, of course!
That's easy.

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:18.559
Shinki's the guy with
the Iron Sand. And
then... Hold on...

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:23.397
[chuckling] You were
hardly watching them
at all!

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.333
There were a lot of
amazing guys, you
know.

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:28.902
If you don't pay
attention, they'll
get ahead of you.

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:30.270
What does that mean?!

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:33.540
It means that I
didn't like losing to you
one little bit, either.

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:35.008
Mm.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.546
I've decided that I'm
going to become a shinobi
on my own terms.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.915
I won't let myself be
affected by what my

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:44.585
parents or what
my Clan says.

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:46.286
Yeah, I feel
the same way.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.456
[chuckling] We said
that we weren't gonna
follow in our

00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:51.058
parents' footsteps.

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:55.762
But we've been doing
it without even
knowing it.

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:04.238
That's why... I'm
gonna go further than
my dad ever even

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:05.205
imagined!

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:07.274
There you go, talking
big again!

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.911
But before that, I'm
gonna beat you!

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.113
[chuckling] Even if you
were to try using that

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:15.015
Scientific Ninja
Tool again.

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:17.451
Hmph! I'm never
using that thing
again, ya know.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.999
What is it, Shinki?

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:38.438
I was just thinking
about Boruto
Uzumaki...

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:42.042
<i>He's foolish,</i>
<i>reckless, and was</i>
<i>supposed to be just a</i>

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:45.179
<i>trivial low-level</i>
<i>ninja... And yet...</i>

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.116
<i>...he stood his</i>
<i>ground...</i>

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:54.621
... against a mighty foe
one couldn't hope to
defeat...

00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:56.390
...and he took him
down.

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:59.259
While you just looked
on passively, is that
right?

00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:00.127
[grunting]

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:04.464
Hey, I'm only
kidding. Don't
glare at me.

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:06.133
Sorry, okay?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.902
Shinki, I was the one
who held you back.

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:12.406
I didn't allow you
to go and fight.

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:16.777
I beg your pardon,
Father, but that isn't
the real issue here.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.912
Whether I had your
permission or not,

00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:21.281
I had no chance of
winning that fight.

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:23.317
Go up against Boruto
Uzumaki,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.552
and you'd defeat
him, hands down.

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:28.455
No mistake about
that. Isn't that
enough for you?

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:31.191
I-I'm able to fight
because I have you,
Shinki.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:33.126
[lightly grunting]

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.329
Don't be impatient.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:38.966
From my point of view
as Kage, you've all
just started on your

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.567
own paths.

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:44.938
Focus on the road
ahead not those who
walk beside you.

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:47.441
You must learn that
your Ninja Way

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:50.143
stretches far into
the distance.

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:52.980
Boruto Uzumaki.

00:11:54.648 --> 00:12:01.488
<i>[townspeople chatting]</i>

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:02.222
<i>Boruto!</i>

00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:03.156
Huh?

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:06.493
Oh! Sasuke!

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:14.501
[chatting]

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:18.005
Well, so far...
nothing else out of
the ordinary has

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:19.206
happened...

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:28.515
I haven't seen that
guy aside from that
one time. And I

00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:31.351
haven't had that
weird paralysis from
then, either.

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:34.221
That wasn't something
as simple as mere
paralysis.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.227
And it appears that no
one other than you, and
me of course with my

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.530
Rinnegan, seems to
have noticed what
occurred back there.

00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:45.332
[lightly grunting]

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:49.436
Look, I'm not trying
to scare you or
anything...

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:51.972
But what happened to
you back there wasn't
normal.

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:54.174
So be on
your guard.

00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:58.312
If you sense
something strange,
then tell me. You got it?

00:12:58.345 --> 00:12:59.279
Hmm.

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:02.950
[chuckling] No use
worrying about it
now. I'm just

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:05.352
gonna stay focused on
what's right in front
of me!

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:09.156
Uh- Oh, yeah.
This is yours.

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:12.359
For now... you hold
onto that.

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:14.294
Uh-

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:16.230
It's proof you're
my student.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.499
[gasping]
O-okay!

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:22.236
When you come
back to the village,

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:24.438
you're gonna train
me again, right?

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:27.741
Sure. But that's only
if you've mastered
the basics that I've

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:28.642
already taught you.

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:29.643
[grunting]

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:31.345
You can count on
that!

00:13:34.348 --> 00:13:37.184
So what were you and
Boruto talking about?
Huh, Dad?

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:40.487
It wasn't anything,
don't worry...

00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:43.357
[giggling]

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.760
So, how long are you
gonna stay in the
village?

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:49.963
It'll take another
day to fully analyze
all the data.

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.498
Then you know what
you should do?

00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:53.734
Keep me company
while you're waiting!

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:55.269
Okay, what do you
wanna do?

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:56.403
[chuckling]

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.006
Well... what I'd
really like to do is
to perfect my

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:02.342
Fireball Jutsu! Just
in case, for someday.

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:03.477
Sounds good.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.648
[giggling] All right!
Come on, let's go!

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.784
Oh! And tonight, Mom
said she'll be
waiting for us and

00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:12.186
making us a special
dinner!

00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:14.555
[chuckling] Come on,
let's go, Dad!

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:28.235
This is rare,... you
coming in person.

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:31.638
<i>I understand that you</i>
<i>almost used Sage Jutsu</i>

00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:33.740
<i>in front of everyone.</i>

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:38.345
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>revealing it to the</i>
<i>village would've meant?</i>

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:42.749
<i>That power cannot be</i>
<i>used in front of</i>
<i>others. Most people</i>

00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:45.519
<i>won't know what to</i>
<i>make of something</i>
<i>beyond their</i>

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.354
<i>comprehension.</i>

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:51.158
I don't really care
either way. What's
worse would be the

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.961
light of the sun
disappearing.

00:14:53.994 --> 00:14:57.464
<i>Is Boruto truly your</i>
<i>sun, then?</i>

00:14:57.497 --> 00:15:01.368
<i>In order to ascertain</i>
<i>that, you need to</i>
<i>stay and live among</i>

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.770
<i>them longer.</i>

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:06.840
<i>However, if you're</i>
<i>okay with it, I</i>
<i>suppose I have</i>

00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:08.809
<i>nothing more to</i>
<i>say...</i>

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:09.710
Hm.

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:15.516
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>
<i>If I linger too long,</i>
<i>then who knows what</i>

00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:16.717
<i>people will say...</i>

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.485
<i>So I should be going.</i>

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:26.760
<i>Come home once in a</i>
<i>while so I can see in</i>
<i>person how you're</i>

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:27.728
<i>changing.</i>

00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:33.767
<i>And thanks to the</i>
<i>efforts of the Five</i>
<i>Kage, the incident</i>

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.335
<i>was resolved.</i>

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:38.605
But regrettably, the
Chunin Exams had to be
cancelled as a result.

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:42.309
With us now is the
genin who was at the
scene and became

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.044
caught up in the
incident.

00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:46.980
Now, let's hear all
about it, in your own
words.

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:54.021
Yes, I see. So please
tell us, what do you
think the most

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:56.356
important thing is
for a shinobi to
have?

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.825
I'd say teamwork and
perseverance!

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:01.328
Oh, how wonderful!

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:03.697
You know, there's
something else I'd
like to add...

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.731
My dad said...

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:07.467
... What you got
up here, means less
than what you

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.136
feel in here.

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:12.039
Thank you for joining
us today for this
live broadcast.

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:15.809
Hey, how come all of
a sudden you're
acting like the

00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:17.678
spokesperson for the
rest of us?

00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:20.380
Actually, I was
interviewed as well,
though...

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:23.283
Look, I don't know, k?
I just showed up and
answered whatever

00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:25.185
questions they
asked, that's all.

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:28.155
[scoffing] Honestly,
you're always so
glib! I'm surprised

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:30.791
that you didn't drag
down my dad and all
of the others

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:31.758
right along
with you!

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:33.527
I can't help it if
I'm good!

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.663
Oh, man... I just
knew that I should've

00:16:36.697 --> 00:16:37.931
tagged along with
you guys!

00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:40.968
You know, you really
are pretty amazing.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.805
You are the Seventh
Hokage's son and the
Fourth's grandson.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:45.806
Heh.

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:46.473
Eventually--

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.041
Hey, Boruto?

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.511
You wanna be
Hokage...

00:16:50.544 --> 00:16:51.378
Well, don't you?

00:16:53.514 --> 00:16:54.948
Hmm.

00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:58.051
Being... the
Hokage...

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:02.356
Heh. Yeah, no
thanks!

00:17:02.723 --> 00:17:03.657
Huh?!

00:17:04.825 --> 00:17:07.728
Tell you what, when
you become Hokage,
I'll be your

00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:08.862
right-hand man, okay?

00:17:08.896 --> 00:17:10.597
I'll make sure to
guard you real well.

00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:13.033
Uh, what...?!

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:16.403
To me, being Hokage
is only one path.

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:19.473
Just 'cause my
grandpa and dad were
Hokage, that doesn't

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:21.608
mean I have to walk
the same one.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.978
But what I really
want...

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:27.014
Sarada...

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.316
... is to be a shinobi
like your dad.

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.152
Uh--

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.723
'Cause I...

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:38.625
I've got my own Ninja
Way.

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:46.900
Uh-- What is it?
What, do I have
something on my face?

00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:50.571
Huh? No, not
really. It's just...

00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:53.774
Heh-heh. I was just
thinking that your
eyes are much bluer

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:55.509
than Lord
Seventh's are.

00:17:55.542 --> 00:17:56.443
Huh?

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:59.513
Mitsuki and I were
talking about it
before! Right,

00:17:59.546 --> 00:18:00.814
Mitsuki?

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:02.916
Hmm? Oh,
were we?

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.219
[grunting]

00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:09.223
Mph. I gotta go. I just
remembered something
I have to do.

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:11.692
Uh--Hey!

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:13.861
What was that all
about?

00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:16.029
I guess everyone's
just busy!

00:18:16.063 --> 00:18:18.665
I should go, too. I
have to report in.

00:18:18.699 --> 00:18:20.701
Okay, see you
tomorrow!

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:29.676
<i>Heed this warning...</i>
<i>Beware, for those</i>
<i>blue eyes shall</i>

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.944
eventually...

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:33.680
... take everything
from you!

00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:38.485
<i>And know this, as</i>
<i>well...</i>

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:40.754
<i>That those who defeat</i>
<i>the gods...</i>

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:45.292
<i>... cannot remain</i>
<i>ordinary individuals</i>
<i>any longer.</i>

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.531
I'm home!

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.367
Oh! Dad!

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:54.735
Hey!

00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:56.003
Welcome home!

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.071
Your father bought
this for us.

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.674
Uh--What, he did?!

00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:06.713
Sorry I'm late,
but happy birthday!

00:19:06.747 --> 00:19:09.082
[giggling]
Thanks so much,
Daddy!

00:19:09.683 --> 00:19:11.051
Dad, you...

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:12.519
[grunting]

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:14.655
[groaning]

00:19:14.688 --> 00:19:17.524
So I guess you aren't
a Shadow Clone this
time, huh?

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:20.127
What's the big idea,
doing that out of the
blue?!

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.330
Ugh! But it was your
fault to begin with!

00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:24.498
What was that?!

00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:25.465
You guys! Me, too!

00:19:25.499 --> 00:19:28.468
Ah! Hey, come on!
Be careful, Himawari!

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:31.672
All right, that's
enough! Cut it out,
all of you!

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.440
Or I'm gonna put
the cake away!

00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:35.075
Huh?!

00:19:35.108 --> 00:19:36.009
You can't
do that--

00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:36.677
Please, mom! I'm
really sorry--

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.478
Sorry, mommy!

00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:39.980
[giggling]

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.149
[chuckling]

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.518
Come on! Let's
go eat the cake!

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:48.355
Yeah! Good idea! I'm
practically starving,
here!

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:50.190
Heh. Me, too!

00:19:50.224 --> 00:19:52.693
But Boruto, go and
wash your hands
first.

00:19:52.726 --> 00:19:54.695
Yeah, yeah.
I know.

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:57.164
Mommy! I'll
help!

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.533
[chuckling]
All right.

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:01.468
Uh, why don't you
get the plates and
set the table?

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:02.669
Yeah, okay!

00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:06.874
Hey... I can help you
guys out, too, you
know!

00:20:06.907 --> 00:20:09.142
Dad, you just go
ahead and sit down.

00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:10.377
I'm sure
you're tired.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.479
I mean, you've just
gotta be, at your
age...

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:13.614
Am I right?

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:16.216
Look, don't treat me
like an old man, you
know!

00:20:18.452 --> 00:20:20.053
Ahhhhh.

00:20:20.721 --> 00:20:23.524
Happy birthday! Make
a wish!

00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:25.993
[blowing and giggling]

00:20:26.026 --> 00:20:27.661
Cheers!

00:20:27.694 --> 00:20:32.232
<i>[laughing]</i>

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:36.270
Oh, no! I overslept!

00:20:36.303 --> 00:20:37.504
I'm late, too!

00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:40.107
Yeah, well that's
'cause you stayed up
all night playing

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.275
video games, ya
know?!

00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:44.344
I didn't hear you say
no! You were playing
just as much as me!

00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:48.015
[chuckling] Come on,
dad, get it together,
would ya?

00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:50.350
Give it your all,
Lord Seventh!

00:20:50.384 --> 00:20:52.019
Huh?

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:53.520
[chuckling]

00:20:53.554 --> 00:20:54.454
Uh-huh!

00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:11.638
<i>Destiny? I won't</i>
<i>remain ordinary?</i>
<i>Fine! Bring it on!</i>

00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:15.475
<i>Whether it's destiny or</i>
<i>a curse, go ahead and</i>
<i>try interfering with</i>

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:16.677
<i>my Ninja Way...</i>

00:21:18.478 --> 00:21:21.648
<i>I never planned on</i>
<i>being ordinary, after</i>
<i>all. I'm a ninja!</i>

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:24.785
<i>That's right... I</i>
<i>don't plan on</i>
<i>becoming Hokage.</i>

00:21:24.818 --> 00:21:26.687
<i>That was Dad's story.</i>

00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:31.124
<i>My story... starts</i>
<i>right now.</i>

00:23:10.023 --> 00:23:15.295
<i>Boruto Uzumaki, huh?</i>
<i>Yes, I see!</i>

00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:21.001
<i>So... that's the one</i>
<i>who Toneri was</i>
<i>observing!</i>

00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:24.104
He could pose a real
threat to us in the
future.

00:23:24.137 --> 00:23:27.474
It would be best to
take preemptive
measures now...

00:23:27.508 --> 00:23:30.110
Or, rather...

00:23:30.777 --> 00:23:34.381
[chuckling]

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:37.784
Either way, this is
all going to be quite
interesting...

00:23:37.818 --> 00:23:41.188
[chuckling]

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.394
<i>A mission to guard a</i>
<i>handsome actor?</i>
<i>Finally! Who knew</i>

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:49.296
<i>such an incredible</i>
<i>encounter would</i>
<i>happen to me?!</i>

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:51.398
<i>It's just so</i>
<i>beautiful.</i>

00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:53.867
Hey! Don't get
carried away, focus
on your mission!

00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:55.602
<i>Hey, Boruto, butt</i>
<i>out!</i>

00:23:55.636 --> 00:23:58.305
<i>A different kind of</i>
<i>story is about to</i>
<i>begin, a story of</i>

00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:01.175
<i>romance! Little kids</i>
<i>should get lost!</i>

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:03.177
<i>All right, starting</i>
<i>now, it's...</i>

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.181
<i>Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next</i>
<i>Generations:</i>

00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:09.416
<i>"Super Cho-Cho</i>
<i>Butterfly Mode!"</i>

00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:12.052
<i>... a story all</i>
<i>about me.</i>
