00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:20.642
How did you get that heart?!

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:24.348
I can feel power surging through
my entire body.

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:27.021
I never imagined that a pulse
could feel as good as this!

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:31.162
You're too dangerous. We have
to stop you.

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:32.799
You really did fool me.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.237
To think that you were hiding
your true nature...

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.976
People have many sides, not just
one!

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.347
Yeah, that's what it means to
be human!

(STRUGGLING)

00:00:46.727 --> 00:00:48.931

(CONCERNED)

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:53.173
We can't.

Wait! Please, hold on, Lord
Third!

00:00:57.047 --> 00:00:58.049
I must hurry!

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:03.561
This is one moment...

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.567

Now you're going to tell me
that's your will, is that it?

Mitsuki, why did you betray us?

00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:14.121
Both of us are man-made, after
all...

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:15.992
We should've seen eye-to-eye.

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:17.996

00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:29.786
Mitsuki never intended to join

(CHUCKLE) You know, I
wonder about that.

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:35.230
What're you talking about?

00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:37.301
Before he left the Hidden Leaf
Village...

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:40.307
he had ample opportunity to ask
others to help him.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.480
But he didn't. He came on his
own to meet us.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:46.486
He was happy to find others like
himself.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.323
He couldn't ignore his
curiosity...

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:50.862

You didn't notice the change he
was going through.

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.664
You have no right to say you're

It's an emergency!

You don't have to stick to the

00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:39.091
Look, how many times do I have
to tell you?!

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.528
We need your clearance to

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:42.231
enter the Land of

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:44.703
Shikamaru doesn't usually get so

00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:47.474
I could say the same thing about
you, right?

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:53.153
(REALIZING) Yes, well... I'm a
parent, too.

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:55.290
[SHIKAMARU] Just make sure that
<i>you notify</i>

00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:57.361

is trying to go to the Land of
Earth right now.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.047
Is it to save Boruto and the
others?

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.884
I say that we oughta go, too!

00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:10.420
Come on, use your head!

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:13.894
We've all been ordered to stand
by, remember?

00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:16.667
If we go, then we could lose our
rank of genin.

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:18.971
Yeah, but...

00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:21.375

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:28.489
Shikamaru, sorry you had to do
that.

00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:30.761
Just get the kids back. It's in
your hands.

00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:32.866

them all home.

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:44.523
Look, you guys...

00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:47.662
We all wanna help Boruto and the
others!

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:49.833
Please, Lord Hokage, let us
come, too!

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:52.337
(DISGRUNTLED) Well guys, the
thing is that, uh...

00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:53.941
I know how you must feel...

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:56.780
but there's no way I'm gonna put
your lives in danger.

00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:57.782
Forget it.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.953
All right, then we'll just go on
our own!

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:02.424
We are prepared to face the
consequences after.

00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:11.042
They're lucky to have friends
like you.

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:13.847
Lord Seventh!

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.116
All of you...

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.052
(NERVOUS)

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:19.893
That was pretty ballsy of you
guys.

00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:23.299
Did he just say... ballsy?

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.905
So, uh what're we
supposed to do?

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:30.080
(CURIOUS) Listen, I
didn't see anything.

00:06:31.082 --> 00:06:32.384
Let's follow them, then!

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:33.921
Right! (DETERMINED)

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.094
(CHUCKLE)

00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:45.477
Look, just come out, already!

00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:47.982
I know something like that
couldn't kill you!

00:06:53.594 --> 00:06:55.765
All right, let's do this! Cha!

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.938
(FRUSTRATED) There's no end
to it!

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:02.411
I wonder if Mitsuki actually
was...

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:05.851
searching to find some
real friends...

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:08.791
We've just gotta get to know
him better.

00:07:09.793 --> 00:07:12.632
You've done more than enough,
Boruto.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:15.437
But forget that for now. We
have to do something about this.

00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:16.940
Yeah...

00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:19.111
(SHOCKED) No way!

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:21.015
But how did-?!

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:22.017
(GASP)

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.292

doing here?!

(TIRED CHUCKLE)

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.905
Lord Third is here with me, as
well!

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:35.711
Boruto, where is Ku now?

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:39.953
I have to find a way to stop him
before it's too late!

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:42.090
But Old Man...

00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:45.798
Please, take me to where Ku is,
immediately! I beg you!

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.704
It's frustrating for me to pass
on this honor to you.

00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:51.375
But I just can't take another
step.

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.146
(CONFLICTED)

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:58.524
Damn it! I'm not just some pack
mule, ya know!

00:07:58.857 --> 00:07:59.659
Sorry...

00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:02.832
This place won't last long.
Can you get yourself to safety?

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:04.736
Yeah, of course!

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:07.240
Since my goal is to become the
Tsuchikage!

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:09.011
(CHUCKLE) Sarada, let's go!

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:10.548
Okay!

00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:19.833
Interesting... You had a power
like that up your sleeve, huh?

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:22.905
People can become wary about too
much power.

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:26.813
So I was discouraged from using
it around them.

00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:29.084
There's also the possibility my
body...

00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:32.592
won't be able to endure if
the power becomes too extreme.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:35.430
But, then... if it's to
protect Boruto...

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:37.802
then that really
doesn't matter to me at all.

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:38.837
Magnificent!

00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:40.775
With your body in our hands...

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:43.814
we can create any number of
perfect Fabrications...

00:08:43.847 --> 00:08:46.485
without any of the defects
currently holding us back.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.056
You ought to stop talking
nonsense.

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:51.596
Since I am unusually angry
right now.

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:55.971
(YANKED BACK)

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:05.891

[KU] <i>Don't overexert yourself.</i>

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:30.741
I can't afford to have your body
break down.

00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:39.024
But having said that, let me
weaken you a little bit more.

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:39.759
<i>[OHNOKI] Enough, Ku!</i>

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.738
Mitsuki, are you okay?!

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:49.846
You were created to protect the
weak, Ku. What happened?

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:53.019
When did you stray from the path
that we established?

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:55.791
But I haven't strayed from the
path at all!

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:58.964
Right now, you're being
controlled by hatred and anger.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.603
Please, Ku, you have to wake up!

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.609
What? Hatred?

00:10:04.642 --> 00:10:08.784
Yes, that's true. Then again,
I am merely a vessel.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:11.857
Which means that any kind of
hatred I might be feeling...

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.527
is merely something that you
were harboring...

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.031
all along and passed on to me!

00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:19.672
What was that? Hatred that
I've been harboring?!

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:21.610
(STRAINING)

00:10:21.643 --> 00:10:23.312

K- Ku, please...!

00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:30.694
Master, you have become old.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.567
You shall return to the earth
soon.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.038
But please, rest assured.

00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:40.480
Your greatest will shall be
carried out by me, your vessel!

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.317
Quick, Old Man, get up. This
is bad.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.292
<i>That sound...!</i>

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:48.597
All right, now just hold still.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.402
I have a use for your body
yet, Mitsuki.

00:11:19.224 --> 00:11:22.798
(CLEANING)

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:24.969
Hey now, the left side is dirty!

00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:28.309
That's a precious stone of the
Hidden Stone Village!

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.748
This looks like nothing more
than a plain ordinary rock!

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:33.319
This rock is a symbol!

00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:37.327
It carries inside of it our
village's Will of Stone!

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.396
Well...

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.335
Actually, you're right. This is
just an ordinary rock.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.370
<i>[OHNOKI] What?!</i>

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.809
What do you think you're doing,
<i>you stupid old man?!</i>

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:46.813
I can't tell which one it
is now!

00:11:46.846 --> 00:11:49.652
You see... if you simply put a
new one of them

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:50.821
on here like this...

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:52.324
no one would ever know it.

00:11:52.357 --> 00:11:53.727
Whaaaaat?!

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.396
Look, what's important is...

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.100
the Will of Stone inside you.

00:11:58.102 --> 00:11:59.606
Ohnoki...

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.676
Hidden within the will you
possess...

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.016
is the power to change the
entire world.

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:06.886
But if you aren't careful,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.395
I worry that precious will of
yours may disappear...

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:12.130
It'll disappear...?

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:14.969
Barriers!

00:12:15.003 --> 00:12:17.909
As you continue to run into
various barriers...

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:19.879
...you may abandon it,

00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:23.954
make excuses, or replace your
will with hatred.

00:12:24.454 --> 00:12:25.456
With hatred?

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:27.460
<i>Mr. Ohnoki!</i>

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:29.131
(SHOCKED)

00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:34.809
Mr. Ohnoki, sir, are you all
right?

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:37.982
(COUGH)

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:40.486
What an interesting place...

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:42.424
It's sacred.

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:46.432
It's a spot used for the purpose
of polishing your stone...

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:47.969
and confronting your will.

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:52.878
So did you findit?

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:56.886
Whatever it was you came here
looking for?

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.993
Before I left the Leaf, Mr.
Ohnoki said...

00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:03.466
If you find that you keep
hitting a wall...

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:05.069
but also keep clinging to it...

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:07.007
That's a sign it's your true
will.

00:13:08.844 --> 00:13:11.181
I've seen a lot since leaving
the Leaf Village.

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:18.195
People become stronger when they
<i>have something to protect.</i>

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.003
<i>Sekiei said that.</i>

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.178
I don't know if I'm empty
inside...

00:13:28.215 --> 00:13:29.017
But, still...

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:33.192
I'm completely sure now that
this is my will.

00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:39.772
(SHOCKED)

00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:40.908
He's coming.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.814
It looks like this is gonna be
our final fight.

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:48.924
Look, Mitsuki, about what Ku
said earlier...

00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:54.000
Back then, after you left the
Leaf Village...

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:57.107
I realized I really knew nothing
at all about you.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.013
We came because we want
to get to know the real you.

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:01.215
(TAKEN BACK) Boruto.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.386
And there's something else,
too...

00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:05.924
We came to give this back.

00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:08.930
(SHOCKED)

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:18.683
All right, I'll lure Ku away.

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:22.157
The two of you need to take Mr.
Ohnoki and get out of here.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.229
What?! Come on! There's no
way we're gonna do that!

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:28.570
I want to protect you. Because
that's also my will.

00:14:29.404 --> 00:14:31.008
And besides...

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:33.647
there are still clones of me in
the research lab.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.720
So don't be concerned. We'll
meet again, just as before.

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:38.089
You're wrong.

00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:39.625
(CONFUSED)

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:42.698
It doesn't matter at all if you
look the same or not.

00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:44.101
Because what's really
important...

00:14:44.936 --> 00:14:46.606
...is the will inside here.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.910
(TAKEN BACK)

00:14:48.944 --> 00:14:50.714
To me, the only real Mitsuki...

00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:54.354
is the one who's standing here
in front of me right now!

00:14:54.387 --> 00:14:55.289
Boruto...!

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:04.207
So this is where you are, human
weaklings!

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:05.209
Let's go!

00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:06.011
Right!

00:15:06.044 --> 00:15:08.115
Team 7 is back together!

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:10.854

No, damn it! I can't
move anymore!

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:30.099
(STRAINING) And now I'll take
that weak will of yours...

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:33.439
...and I'll turn it into dust!

It's just as you said.

[OHNOKI] I wasn't able to save
<i>Kozuchi...</i>

00:17:54.381 --> 00:17:56.351
<i>so I blamed the world,...</i>

00:17:56.385 --> 00:18:00.894
and I twisted that boy's will
<i>and his yearning for peace.</i>

00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:03.465
Isn't it too late for such
regrets?!

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:08.042
I rejected his will once, but I
must take up the mantle again...

00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:12.050
or I won't be able to face
him in death.

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:14.789

Oh... Sekki.

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:58.510
I must say I owe you a great
debt, as well.

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:01.148
No, please...!

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:05.189
So did you find it? The secret
of your will?

00:19:06.024 --> 00:19:07.226
I did.

00:19:08.262 --> 00:19:11.502
[OHNOKI] Carrying it out... is
<i>no easy task.</i>

00:19:17.548 --> 00:19:19.518

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:23.225
People can always rediscover

Even if you lose faith and
abandon it

00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:29.270
after running into
many barriers...

00:19:29.304 --> 00:19:31.642
...if you've had a chance to
face yourself...

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:34.949
you can pick up the pieces and
start over.

There are quite a few sides to
one's will, you know.

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:40.694
Yeah,... you got that right!

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:43.733
You simply... keep on
polishing it...

00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:46.038
...and over time...

00:19:46.071 --> 00:19:49.477
it shall become the strongest in
the world.

00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:53.385
That's what it means to live a
human life.

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:57.093
From now on... No matter how big
a barrier we hit...

00:19:57.126 --> 00:20:00.266
...I promise, we'll never let
it go!

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:05.376
Very well said. You must be
sure not to lose it.

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:09.250
You reclaimed it, too, Mr.
Ohnoki. You did it once again...

00:20:10.252 --> 00:20:14.729
But what I really wanted...to do
once more...

00:20:14.762 --> 00:20:17.300
...was eat the dumplings from
the Leaf...

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:19.404
Sure, you still can!

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:22.443
I wonder if that's true...?

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:26.786
...since I'm an old man... whose
days are numbered...

No way! Dad!

00:20:46.793 --> 00:20:47.961
I got word to him.

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.303
Well, it's all over now.

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.474
Anyway, I'll put the details
into my report.

00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:56.712
You've done good work.

00:20:56.746 --> 00:21:00.085
You were the one who rescued all
of them, right?

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:02.658
I didn't do anything.
Please, excuse me.

00:21:04.695 --> 00:21:05.664
Hey, Konohamaru!

00:21:10.674 --> 00:21:11.642

Hey, Mitsuki, I'm glad you
came back.

00:21:24.334 --> 00:21:26.004
Boruto, Sarada, I'm sorry.

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:28.810
This is all my fault.

00:21:28.843 --> 00:21:31.682
And I caused trouble for
Shikadai and the whole village.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.028
I guess this means I won't
be welcome back in the Leaf.

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:40.834
Oh, Mitsuki...

00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:43.071
Come on, don't be
ridiculous, Mitsuki!

00:21:43.105 --> 00:21:45.242
Look, it's your welcoming party.

<i>You're late, you guys!</i>

00:21:55.362 --> 00:21:57.500
Hey, Mitsuki is with them too!

00:21:57.534 --> 00:21:58.703
Oh, thank goodness!

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.041
<i>Are you okay, Mitsuki?!</i>

00:22:01.742 --> 00:22:02.811
<i>Hey, Mitsuki!</i>

00:22:02.845 --> 00:22:03.546
<i>Boruto!!</i>

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.882
<i>Hey!</i>

[SARADA] <i>I wonder what's going</i>
<i>to happen to Team 7 now...</i>

00:23:48.455 --> 00:23:50.426
[BORUTO] <i>This isn't like you,</i>
<i>Sarada!</i>

00:23:50.459 --> 00:23:52.998
<i>The three of us will</i>
<i>just start over, right?</i>

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:54.067
[SARADA] <i>Don't you get it?</i>

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.572
<i>We might not be able to see</i>
<i>Mitsuki again!</i>

00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:59.410
He might even decide to leave
<i>the village on his own!</i>

00:23:59.444 --> 00:24:01.047
[BORUTO] Look, there's nothing
<i>to worry about!</i>

00:24:01.081 --> 00:24:03.418
<i>Mitsuki's gonna be fine!</i>

00:24:03.452 --> 00:24:06.391
Next time on "Boruto: Naruto
Next Generations..."

00:24:06.424 --> 00:24:08.228
"A New Ordinary"

00:24:08.261 --> 00:24:12.169
[BORUTO] Because... this is the
place where Mitsuki belongs.
