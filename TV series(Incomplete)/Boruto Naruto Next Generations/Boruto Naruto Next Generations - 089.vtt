and they're bringing a heart for
Lord Ku!

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:30.811
[KIRARA] <i>I simply can't miss</i>
<i>this!</i>

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:34.248
Mitsuki...! I won't let him do
that!

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:38.619
You're so persistent! Whatever.
I'm going now.

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:41.488
So sorry! Playtime's over!

00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:45.993
Ah! When something precious is
about to break, my chest aches!

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:48.028
I can't bare seeing the end.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.030
So you just kill each other
however you want.

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:54.034
(PROUD SQUEAL) That was so human
of me just now!

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:55.969
Damn it!

00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:58.138
Hey, wait! (STRAINING)

00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:01.141
(STUNNED)

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:03.310
(SHOCKED)

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:10.450
(WORRIED)

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:25.465
Release!

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:30.604
That was close!

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:33.941
How did you undo it?

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:37.177
I used your sword to reflect my
Sharingan...

00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:40.347
and put myself under a genjutsu
to disrupt my chakra.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.316
But to be honest... I barely
did...

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:45.319
Let's hurry!

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:48.155
Mitsuki's over there.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:54.294
(EXCITED) <i>So this is it?</i>

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:57.364
And the hearts for us are going
to be ready soon, too...

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.365
aren't they?

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.200
(AFFIRMATIVE) The Doctor told me
that...

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:03.170
he's busy preparing the rest of
them right now.

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.005
Yes!

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:06.607
That's even faster than we
originally estimated!

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:11.512
Yes.

00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:14.314
We wanted to rush to complete
your heart first, Lord Ku.

00:15:14.348 --> 00:15:16.350
That's what the Doctor told us.

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.118
(HEART BEATING)

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:19.987
I see!

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.589
(INHALE)

00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:26.193
Now... we shall complete the
Master's plan.

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:30.364
And anyone who interferes will
be dealt with swiftly.

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:31.131
Yes!

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:34.268
Mitsuki, you've done very well,
too.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.803
You've helped to carry out the
Master's will...

00:15:36.837 --> 00:15:41.175
so I'm quite pleased that you
stayed on here with us.

00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:43.610
Now... bring that heart to me!

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:51.518
Wait!

00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:52.419
(NOTICING)

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.454
What?! Why are you two still
alive?!

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.523
Sorry to disappoint you.

00:15:56.557 --> 00:15:59.359
But we're not as weak as you
seem to think!

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:02.696
I still need to talk to Mitsuki,
and you're not gonna stop me!

00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:03.664
Hey, Mitsuki! Listen!

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.435
Lightning Style.
Snake Lightning.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.306
(SHOCKED)

00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:13.974
Earth Style: Reverse Antlion.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.677
(SHOCKED)

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.078
(FRUSTRATED)

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.514
Enough, Ku! Stop this!

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:23.317
You were all created to protect
humans, weren't you?

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.820
Which means it's wrong to take
the lives of the Stone's shinobi

00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:28.689
...and its villagers!

00:16:28.722 --> 00:16:32.292
[BORUTO] Mitsuki! Ku's wrong!
Don't help someone like him!

00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:38.699
Whatever you have to say, he's
not going to listen to you!

00:16:38.732 --> 00:16:41.101
Just hear me out, Mitsuki!
Please!

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:44.104
I had no clue about how you
felt.

00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:47.107
No, I- I didn't even try
to understand!

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:49.142
But it's different now!

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:53.013
[BORUTO] <i>I really want to know</i>
<i>what you're thinking!</i>

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:55.682
<i>I want to know why you</i>
<i>came to the Land of Earth.</i>

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:58.685
And I want to know what's making
<i>you want to stay here!</i>

00:16:58.719 --> 00:16:59.686
<i>Answer me, Mitsuki! Please!</i>

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:04.157
Boruto, don't interfere.

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.159
Mitsuki...

00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:09.463
Here, Lord Ku.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.635
No! Stop!

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:21.308
At last, a complete life is now
within our grasp!

00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.810
We'll become beings who surpass
humans.

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:25.345
And when that time comes...

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:27.848
we'll stand atop this village!

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:32.519
No... we'll stand atop the
entire world!

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:36.657
(SINISTER LAUGHING)

00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.159
(STUNNED)

00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:45.299
[KU] (STUNNED) What?!

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:48.101
Yes, Ku, this is my will.

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:59.146
No...! This can't be! Not my
heart!

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:06.987
(SHOCKED)

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:12.459
(DISCOMFORT)

00:18:12.492 --> 00:18:17.297
(FALLING)

00:18:17.664 --> 00:18:18.699
Lord Ku!

00:18:18.732 --> 00:18:21.635
You bastard!

00:18:25.472 --> 00:18:26.273
Mitsuki?!

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:31.478
(SURPRISED)

00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:35.449
What's that?

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:37.150
What's happening?!

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.615
Konohamaru Sensei. I'm in a
race against time now.

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:12.085
So I ask you... please, don't
try to stop me.

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:15.122
Mitsuki... do you realize just
what you've done?

00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:17.958
I'm sorry.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:21.261
But there's still something I
have to do.

00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:23.463
I'll accept punishment after
I'm done.

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:25.465
But for now...

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:30.270
I understand. So, then... what
are you planning to do?

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:32.840
Well, I...

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:34.608
Well I'm going to carry out
my will.

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:38.278
All right, but don't forget...

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:39.646
(TAKEN BACK)

00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:46.119
Whatever happens, you will
always be a member of Team 7.

00:19:47.654 --> 00:19:48.655
Yes.

00:19:58.332 --> 00:19:59.132
Mitsuki...?

00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:03.136
I fooled you all this time.
Apologies.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:04.972
(BETRAYED)

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:06.974
(GASP)

00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:08.141
How dare you!

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.913
Mitsuki!

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:17.417
Mitsuki, I will never ever
forgive you.

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:20.320
You should just forget about
completing your plan.

00:20:20.354 --> 00:20:23.156
By now, the people who were
going to be your heart donors

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.825
have all been set free.

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:25.993
What?!

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.661
(SHOCKED)

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:35.435
Sorry to keep you all waiting!

00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:38.105
Lady Fourth! You're okay!

00:20:38.138 --> 00:20:41.308
That's right. Thanks to a
certain masked shinobi.

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:44.344
As if I'd ever let a bunch of
clay dolls bring me down!

00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:46.380
Now it's time to strike back!

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:49.116
(EXCITED CHEERING)

00:20:53.287 --> 00:20:55.155
I can't stay in here anymore...

Boruto, I just...

00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:37.164
You know, why don't you tell me
about it later, okay?

00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:40.300
