<i>Yeah! Come on! You can</i>
do it, Cho-Cho! We believe in
<i>you!</i>

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:18.118
Go for it, Cho-Cho! Make sure
you finish strong!

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.922
Don't you dare do anything
careless out there to- Uh...?

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.558
Fight Cho-Cho! You can
do it!

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.795
If you win this match, you can
have all the Thunder burgers
you can eat!

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.601
What could be better?! All
you can eat burgers with your
Dad! Oh, and uh, your mom too...

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:38.739
Seriously, just burgers? That's
really not very enticing...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.910
The match has already
begun you know! What are you
waiting for?

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.145
Huh? Oh. Right, okay!

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.149
Your parents are quite
amusing...

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.452
Although now I feel bad...

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:56.924
That what they're going to be
witnessing here today is their
daughter's miserable defeat.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:01:00.427
Huh? Just who do you
think you are, you jerk?

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.330
You'll soon find out...

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.032
[grunt]

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.904

[cheering]

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.918
So tell me, just how would you
assess Cho-Cho's skill level,
anyway?

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:09.790
She's got a whole lot of talent.
but I feel that sometimes, she
lacks motivation...

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:14.995
[cheering]

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.463
Hurry up and attack.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.632
[stunned]

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.401
(SHINKI) <i>Neither you nor the</i>
others from Round Two are suited

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:24.972
I'll show you what reality's
truly like...

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.775
Huh? Alright, that's it! You
just ticked me off!

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.477
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:32.646
Aghhh!

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.983
Brute strength from the
start? How unrefined...

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:43.056
You know, the way that you look
down on people makes me really
mad! [grunt and struggling]

00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:57.671
[grunt]

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.777
What's that jutsu...?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.482
That's the one Metal and the
others were helpless against,
isn't that right?

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:12.886
I look down on people? Well, I
suppose you're not wrong about
that.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:22.429
[grunts]

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.798
You think she's going to be
okay, honey?

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:28.769
What's the point of you getting
so worried?! Cho-Cho's no idiot,
you know!

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.605
If close combat won't work,
she'll go long-distance.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.973
Yeah, you're right!

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:36.310
Long distance! Just move away
from him!

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:43.250
You really ought to be grateful
that you have parents who're
so concerned about you.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.753
Excuse me? I have no idea what
you're talking about right now!

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:51.592
[straining]

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.660
Just hurry and give up, already.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:55.429
[straining]

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.698
I told you, I'm no good with
discretion...

[grunt]

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:07.774
[gasp] Ow! Awww. And I just had
my nails done, too!

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.643
How're you gonna pay me back?!

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.479
If you're toying with me, you'll
pay. Big time.

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:16.450
[cheering]

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.620
Cho-Cho's eyes suddenly got all
intense!

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.354
Yeah...

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.290
Listen, don't try to get too
close to him!

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:24.525
[grunt]

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:26.493
[grunt]

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.162
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.999
[heavy breathing] Using the same
tactic isn't gonna work!

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:35.502
[grunt]

00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:39.339
Alright, Empty...

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:41.175
Crash!

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:49.650
I get it! You infused chakra
into the Iron Sand to manipulate
it.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:53.620
Even if you did figure that out,
the situation is the same.

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.556
[cheering]

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.825
Wow, your boy is pretty skilled.
Where did you find him?

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.763
[cheering]

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.498
When we met, he...

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.187

[pained breaths]

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:53.046
[gasp]

00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:04.625
Come along, little one. I'll
teach you how to use your power.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:05.559
Uh...

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:06.260
What's your name?

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:10.430
(YOUNGER SHINKI) <i>Shinki...</i>

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:14.234
[grunting]

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:20.440
Ah! [pained grunts]

00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:21.808
[gasps]

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.343

[pained grunts]

00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:41.195
Take this!

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.064
[grunt]

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:49.036
That's right... Show me more of
your desperation.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.505
[grunting] Why you!

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:55.609
Aghhh!

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.750
Huh?! Ahhh!

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:07.721
[pained grunts]

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:12.492
[pained groans and grunt]

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:16.763
No, Cho-Cho! You don't have to
get up. You've done more than
enough!

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:23.470
[pained breaths and groans]

00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:26.440
You know it's hopeless, but you
still get up?

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:31.678
[pained gasp] You know...
there's a limited edition potato
chip...

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.517
...that's spicy codfish roe 'n'
pudding...

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.618
...flavored...

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:38.318
Hmmm?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.758
You'd think... that something
like that couldn't possibly
taste good, right? Still...

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:47.861
I wanna try 'em.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:51.965
Sink or swim... I have to
taste-test them.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:55.669
You never know till you try,
right?

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:57.971
Wait! That sign...!

00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:00.974
Choji, she... she can't do that
one yet, right?!

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:05.012
No, you're wrong! She can! It's
just, uh...

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.481
She really hates using it,
that's all...

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:10.984
[cheering]

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:15.422
With the amount of chakra you
have left, nothing you try
will work.

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:17.057
[exhale]

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.526
Like I told you earlier...

00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:23.263
You're never really gonna know
until you try!

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.264
[grunt]

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:26.366
Why go so far...?!

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.136
I really hate using this, but...

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:33.507
Human Boulder! [grunt]

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:00.801
[grunt] Go on and-!

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:03.136
Do it, Cho-Cho!

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.306
[straining] Ahhh! Roll, roll,
roll, roll, roll, roll, roll!

00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:11.345
[satisfied breath]

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:19.987
Roll, roll, roll, roll!

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:29.997
[sigh and chuckle]

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:39.039
[weak breath] Hey... Did your
opinion of me change a little,
at least?

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:45.045
Well, actually... This just
confirmed that I'm better than
you, after all.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.649
Oh, I see. How frustrating...

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:52.186
[woozy groans] Omph!

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.057
(ROCK LEE) <i>The winner is Shinki</i>
<i>of the Hidden Sand!</i>

00:10:57.524 --> 00:10:58.358
Wow, he's strong...

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.896
Cho-Cho was using her full power
in that match. But even so...

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.699
She couldn't even put a scratch
on him.

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:10.037
His jutsu's like the Kazekage's,
but exceeds it because of the
Iron Sand's properties...

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:15.375
Damn it... Boruto and the others
don't have a chance against him.

00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:17.578
[woozy groans]

00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:18.712
(SARADA) <i>Cho-Cho!</i>

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:19.780
You okay?

00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:21.815
Well... she seems normal to me!

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:24.184
<i>A silly grin like always!</i>

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.485
[grunts]

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.287
Aw, man...

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:28.922
(SHINKI) <i>You're Mitsuki, right?</i>

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:31.558
You'd better learn well from
what you saw.

00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:34.628
Just what do you mean?

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:38.532
No matter what the reason may
be, going easy on an opponent
only shows contempt for him.

00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:43.237
In the next match, I'll bring
you down, and I say that on my
father's honor.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.708
You'll be sorry if you try to
pull what you did in the first
<i>round.</i>

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:50.777
Oh, on your father's honor, huh?
Don't make me laugh.

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:54.748
In a battle, the only one you're
fighting for is yourself, ya
know?

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:55.115
[chuckle]

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.719
And I'll defeat you in the match
after that.

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:00.787
If you're still around, that is.

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:05.492
Bring it on! But we'll see if
you're still so stuck-up after
you get beat!

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.498
Cho-Cho, no! No,
Cho-Cho!

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:15.669
She just used up too much
chakra. I don't think you have
to worry.

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:17.337
Oh, good. Thank you, Sarada.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:23.443
[groggy moans] Hey, Dad... Hey,
Mom...

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:27.648
Oh, Cho-Cho! What is it? Are you
feeling hurt?

00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:28.682
(CHO-CHO) <i>That guy...</i>

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.187
That guy was... handsome, don't
you think?

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:34.188
Huh?!

00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:36.623
(CHO-CHO) <i>He is who he is, but</i>
<i>damn!</i>

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:40.594
[exasperated sigh] I told you
there wasn't any need to worry,
didn't I?

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:45.032
(CHOJI) <i>Hey, watch it! Dad's</i>
pretty cool too, you know! You
<i>got that?!</i>

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.938
That is the end of the
elimination matches.

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:55.442
The first semifinal match will
be Boruto Uzumaki against
Shikadai Nara.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:58.512
That match will begin right
after a short thirty-minute
break!

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:02.950
This is turning out to be a real
drag...

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:06.987
This is the first time, isn't
it? That we've had a proper
fight?

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.625
I heard that you can produce up
to four Shadow Clones. Is that
true?

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:15.395
[chuckle] Oh, what? I was kinda
planning on surprising you
during our match.

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:19.933
[chuckle] Let's do this fair and
square. No hard feelings,
alright?

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:22.503
[chuckle] Don't cry when you
lose.

00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:47.227
(SHIKADAI) <i>Let's do this fair</i>
<i>and square. No hard feeling,</i>
<i>alright?</i>

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:49.229
Hmmm...

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:55.669
Oh, well... I don't need this
thing to win anyway!

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:59.473
(SHIKADAI) <i>You really didn't</i>
<i>have to take time to come</i>
<i>down, you know...</i>

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:03.844
Come on! What kind of thing is
that to say?! That's not very
nice!

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.480
Just don't get your hopes up too
high, okay?

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:11.151
Really?! Do you have to be so
much like your dad all the time,
Shikadai?!

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:11.618
Hm?!

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:15.489
Well, being able to stay relaxed
is a good thing...

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.559
But, listen... you really only
have one chance.

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:20.093
Yeah...

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.396
Believe me, I know.

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:27.334
Look, I don't mean to put
pressure on you here... But
don't lose to Boruto.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.203
(SHIKADAI) <i>What's that supposed</i>
<i>to mean?</i>

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:31.605
(TEMARI) <i>How is that not putting</i>
<i>on pressure?!</i>

00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:33.740
(SHIKAMARU) <i>I didn't mean-...</i>
<i>Just win, alright?!</i>

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:34.675
(TEMARI) <i>Yeah, win!</i>

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.043
(SHIKADAI) <i>Ugh, just go!</i>

00:14:41.682 --> 00:14:44.618
(ROCK LEE) <i>The semifinal match</i>
<i>will begin shortly!</i>

00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:47.554
Alright! Well... Guess I'll go
win a match!

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:51.992
You're awfully late, Shikamaru.

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:53.994
Oh, uh... Yeah, sorry.

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:55.696
So where ya been?

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.865
[chuckle] Oh, "around".

00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.399
[chuckle]

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:06.473
From the Leaf, Boruto Uzumaki!
Also from the Leaf, Shikadai
Nara!

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:09.977
[cheering]

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.612
Give it everything you've got!

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:14.481
Oh! It's Big Brother!

00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:24.324
[cheering]

00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:26.960
Match one of the semifinals...
Begins, now!

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:29.630
[cheering]

00:15:29.663 --> 00:15:31.231
Do your best, Big Brother!

00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:35.068
[grunt]

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.437
[grunts]

00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:42.075
[grunts]

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.946
Wow, they've each really
improved a great deal!

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:48.448
It's too bad this
isn't the final match.

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:53.654
They're doing great! The both of
them!

00:15:53.687 --> 00:15:56.490
Well, Shikadai is being serious
for a change...

00:15:56.523 --> 00:15:57.057
[chuckles]

00:15:58.325 --> 00:15:59.660
[grunts]

00:15:59.693 --> 00:16:01.061
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:04.798
[dodging grunts]

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:07.467
[grunt] That was a close one!

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:11.839
I was really hoping I could end
this before you use Shadow
Paralysis!

00:16:11.872 --> 00:16:14.408
Ha! Don't try to be funny,
alright?

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:17.277
[dodging grunts]

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:26.687
There, you see? Your Shadow
Paralysis has gotten much
sharper!

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.056
Just shut up! Let me catch ya!

00:16:32.226 --> 00:16:35.562
Don't panic, Shikadai... Just
<i>remember your training.</i>

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.232
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:40.868
Hey, little Shikadai, over here!

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:44.605
No, over here! Or is it over
here? Where are you looking?

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:45.272
Over here!

00:16:45.873 --> 00:16:46.807
Hey, quit jumping around!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.541
Over here!

00:16:50.377 --> 00:16:51.612
[grunts]

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:58.352
<i>I got behind him! With the</i>
clones as my insurance, I can do
<i>it now!</i>

00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:00.087
[grunt]

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:01.722
Gotcha!

00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:04.725
[grunt and straining]

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:08.395
[straining]

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:11.331
Yes!

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:16.737
Hm? Hey, what is that anyway?
How's he able to spread his
shadow out as far as that?!

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.508
[chuckle] Let's just say Boruto
wasn't the only one getting
special training.

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:23.644
[straining]

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:24.711
No way...

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:27.681
[straining]

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:32.186
I already figured out that
sooner or later, you'd resort to
using your Shadow Clones...

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:35.656
So my dad and I came up with and
practiced a counter-strategy.

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:37.224
[grunt]

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:40.994
You know, it would be great if
you just gave up now.

00:17:41.028 --> 00:17:41.695
[frustrated grunts]

00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:43.497
Guess that's the match...

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:45.399
[sigh]

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:50.070
Damn... [grunt] it...

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:56.210
[quivering breaths]

00:17:57.377 --> 00:17:59.379
How 'bout those Chunin Exams?

00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:01.181
I heard...

00:18:01.215 --> 00:18:01.548
Uh...

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.184
you passed the Second Round.

00:18:04.218 --> 00:18:04.718
Huh...?

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:06.720
Y-Yeah...

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:09.823
You did just great.

00:18:09.857 --> 00:18:10.557
Uh...

00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:13.727
<i>I can't lose here!</i>

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:16.096
Hmph!

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:21.535
[gasp]

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:23.837
[grunt]

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:24.705
[grunt]

00:18:25.873 --> 00:18:27.608
Damn it! Eh!

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.513
[chuckle] Still wanna do this?

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:36.717
[worried breaths and sigh]

00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:40.687
Fine, I give up.

00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:42.222
[relieved chuckle]

00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:44.391
[chuckling]

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:45.726
Oh, good grief...

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:47.561
Doesn't this scene look
familiar?

00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:49.363
[groan]

00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:50.230
[chuckle]

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.500
Boruto Uzumaki moves on to the
final!

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:56.503
[cheering]

00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:59.373
Yea, Big Brother! You looked
totally cool out there!

00:19:00.007 --> 00:19:01.508
[chuckle]

00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:05.779
[cheering]

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:09.383
Young Lord! Congratulations on
making it to the final round!

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:13.554
Oh, hey, what's up Katasuke?

00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:15.088
You were amazing!

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.661
Only one Shadow Clone's possible
at this stage in development,
but you used it ingeniously!

00:19:20.694 --> 00:19:22.095
Just marvelous!

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.730
Mm?

00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:26.400
This is a supplement.

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:31.205
I look forward to the final and
another impressive showing.

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:36.076
Yeah... I know; I get it...

00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:39.079
You and I, Young Lord...

00:19:40.547 --> 00:19:43.383
We are going to breathe new life
into this stuffy old world of
shinobi!

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.389
We'll breathe new life,
indeed...

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.068
Oh! Here you are.

00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:02.703
That's better...

00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:06.106
That was a close one.

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:09.543
Yeah, I know... All three of us
nearly made it through!

00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:13.380
I didn't think losing...

00:20:14.648 --> 00:20:17.317
...was gonna be as painful as
this, but...

00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:21.622
[chewing] Mmmm... Oh, really?

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:25.826
[exasperated sigh] Maybe you
should be hurting a little more
right now!

00:20:25.859 --> 00:20:31.231
You don't waste time on chips
when they're finished. So that's
why I just open up another bag!

00:20:31.265 --> 00:20:31.565
Ha!

00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:35.335
It seems that your brain is as
empty as that bag!

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:39.506
I really... tried my absolute
best.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.976
I truly did believe... that I
could win, you know?

00:20:43.844 --> 00:20:45.212
[sighs]

00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:50.551
We'll do better next time. Our
future's just getting started!

00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:54.354
We're just like lounge pants!
You know, the kind with an
elastic waist.

00:20:54.388 --> 00:20:58.625
There's lots and lots of room
for us to grow... to the max!

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:02.696
Your metaphors are questionable
at best! They don't make sense!

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:04.498
[chuckle] Seriously?!

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:07.000
This is your idea of trying to
console me?!

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:07.968
[chuckles]

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:10.971
[chukle] I guess you're right...

00:21:11.004 --> 00:21:14.007
Maybe being chunin isn't
our thing just yet.

00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:16.844
Yep! Uh-huh! And besides, first
things first!

00:21:16.877 --> 00:21:21.615
We should go crying to Moegi
Sensei and get her to treat us
to barbecue.

00:21:21.648 --> 00:21:22.516
Nice one.

00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:24.651
(SHIKADAI) <i>Okay, pity party</i>
<i>tonight!</i>

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:25.552
Huh?

00:21:34.027 --> 00:21:35.095
(SHIKADAI) <i>Boruto!</i>

00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:36.230
Huh?

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.601
You'd better not mess up in the
finals! You understand me?

00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:42.970
Uh... Yeah!

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:45.305
[chuckle] Just leave it to me,
ya know!

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:47.674
(SHIKADAI) [chuckle] <i>At least</i>
<i>try to sound convincing...</i>

00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:49.676
We'll be watching the matches.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.512
Do your best!

00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:53.680
Yeah! Thanks, guys!

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.216
(INOJIN) <i>Oh! I don't think Moegi</i>
<i>Sensei can afford BBQ on her</i>
<i>salary...</i>

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.520
What? But I'm in the mood for
their extra special kalbi!

00:21:59.553 --> 00:22:01.922
(SHIKADAI) <i>Yeah, I don't think</i>
<i>it's gonna happen...</i>

00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:05.559
(INOJIN) <i>Ugh! Just get by with</i>
<i>extra special kalbi flavored</i>
<i>potato chips!</i>

00:23:43.657 --> 00:23:46.960
(BORUTO) Make sure you're extra
careful around that Araya guy!

00:23:46.994 --> 00:23:50.130
(INOJIN) <i>Surprise attacks don't</i>
<i>even faze him, genjutsu</i>
<i>doesn't work!</i>

00:23:50.163 --> 00:23:53.433
What's going on here? Is that
<i>guy even human at all?</i>

00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:58.605
(SARADA) <i>As one would expect</i>
from a Sand Shinobi. Is he just
<i>stronger than me?! Wait...!</i>

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:02.109
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations:</i>

00:24:02.142 --> 00:24:03.977
"The Hidden Leaf vs. The Hidden
<i>Sand."</i>

00:24:05.946 --> 00:24:09.416
(SARADA) We're growing stronger
every single day! Don't you dare
underestimate us Leaf Shinobi!
