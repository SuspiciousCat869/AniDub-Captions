WEBVTT

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.348
(geese honking)

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.018
(goose honking loudly)

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.520
There there, guys.

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.989
Just sit tight for
little while longer.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.358
We'll be able to help
you out really soon.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.862
(buzzing sound)

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.698
(Jugo struggling)

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:36.003
(goose honking)

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.978
I wish we could take away
the bird's Curse Marks, too.

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:46.880
Then we'd be able to
take some of

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.849
the burden Mr. Jugo has to bear.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.484
(water splashing)

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:51.818
How did it go?

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.453
We haven't found any
more red-eyed birds

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:56.657
on the east, west, or
south sides of the lake.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.192
So just the north's left.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.627
Although there may still
be a few more of them

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.297
hiding in the bushes on the
lake shore here and there.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.532
We'll leave those
guys to you, Mitsuki,

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.935
and I'll go and check
out the north side.

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:08.936
All right. And I'll-

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.705
[Sarada] Boruto, you stay here.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.940
Wait, what?

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:15.676
Did you forget what
Konohamaru Sensei told us?

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.646
We're not supposed to take
our eyes off Jugo, remember?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.349
(goose honking)

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.252
Of course, yeah, you're right.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:28.121
We have to get rid of the
Curse Mark on the birds

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.024
and find out the cause
of this infection.

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:37.264
(Opening theme music)

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.730
(brooding music)

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.333
[Sarada] It's time.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.171
All right.

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:34.314
[Sarada] Please inject
yourself again in three hours.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.317
Oh, I see.

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.454
So you've decided to inject him
on a regular schedule, then.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.655
Yes.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.924
I figured that if he takes
it before the symptoms start,

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.260
he won't undergo Curse
Mark Transformation.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.328
It's certainly one way to do it.

00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.797
Although, while this
medicine does delay

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.369
Curse Mark Transformation,
it's a powerful tranquilizer.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.204
When I take it,
it dulls my senses

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.906
and it takes me
longer to extract

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.308
the Curse Mark from the birds.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:05.112
So till now, I'd inject myself
when the symptoms appeared,

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:06.813
and then I'd head to the cave

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:09.516
before the transformation
could begin.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.085
But still, once I undergo

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:14.321
complete Curse Mark
Transformation,

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:18.058
this medicine can no
longer control me. (sighs)

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:26.366
(geese honking)

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:31.772
(buzzing sound)

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.641
(Jugo struggling)

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:38.478
He goes through so
much for the birds.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:40.948
You see, that didn't
hurt at all, right?

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:41.949
(goose honking)

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.784
Off you go!

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:45.485
Seems like it's going well.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.321
Yeah, it's all
thanks to the effort

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.089
that Mr. Jugo's putting in.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.992
(goose honking)

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.029
Hold on, there's
still more out there?

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.203
Hey, cut it out already!

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:09.776
Wait, this is the only
one that's this color.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.777
Of course.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.979
That's a domesticated goose.

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.947
It probably belongs to
someone in the village

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.315
and wandered out here.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.820
You see, long ago,
people caught wild geese

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:22.022
and over time domesticated them.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:26.426
Why can't this one fly away?

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.596
Because it was raised by
people and became domesticated,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.165
the need to migrate
became unnecessary.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.902
Remember what I told you
before back in the Leaf

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:36.403
about one's genes?

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.306
Well, somewhere along the
line, this species of goose

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.277
simply lost the genes that
gave them the ability to fly.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.978
I don't really know
anything about genes

00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:46.947
and all that kinda stuff.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.918
But I'd like to help
this guy be able to fly.

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:52.853
You're such a dreamer.

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.688
Do you know that, Boruto?

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:55.956
And so what if I am?

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:58.292
Nothing wrong with
being a dreamer.

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.961
Anyway, I'll take this
one to Mr. Jugo, too.

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:03.664
(goose honking)

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.635
It's okay.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.070
It's not infected.

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.606
That's good news,
isn't it, little guy?

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.775
(goose honking)

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:18.045
Oh, are you so happy
you might fly now?

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.981
But he's not able to fly.

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.084
That's what Mr.
Tosaka told me, too.

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:25.819
But still, doesn't it
really all depend on

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:28.121
how hard he tries to fly?

00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:32.259
If everything's decided by
your genes, it's no fun at all.

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.928
There are some things that
effort alone can't accomplish.

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:37.631
The fact is, some paths
are simply predestined.

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.800
Like it is for me.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.135
I can't live like
the rest of you do.

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.371
Because of this Curse Mark.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.610
(goose honking)

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:51.612
Wild geese are migratory.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:55.115
Soon it'll be time for them
to fly to another place.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.418
If they do so before I'm able
to remove their Curse Mark,

00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:00.787
it'll spread
throughout the world.

00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:01.855
And if that were to happen,

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.025
then these birds
will have no future.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.862
I'm simply not going
to let that happen.

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.998
Somehow, I'll find
a way to save them.

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:18.639
(fire crackling)

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:21.074
Can you help me tomorrow, too?

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:23.310
Sure thing, you can count on us!

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:27.481
[Sarada] Are you
really going in there?

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.250
You've been getting
injections regularly now,

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.785
so you don't actually need to go

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.921
inside that cave
anymore, do you?

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.123
No, I still have to.

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:38.492
I'm starting to
build up resistance.

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:41.795
The medicine is beginning
to wear off sooner.

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:44.031
Before long, it
won't work at all.

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.603
The injections are gonna
stop working eventually.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.339
We're going to have to
hurry things up, then.

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:53.373
Sarada.

00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:56.176
Do you still have the injectors?

00:07:58.312 --> 00:07:59.980
This is everything
that we have left.

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:02.216
I think it's just barely
going to be enough.

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:03.917
Which means we'll
have to do something

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.352
before we run out.

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:10.824
We gotta let the Chief know.

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:12.059
You're right.

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.531
(geese honking)

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:19.533
(peaceful music)

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:20.534
(buzzing sound)

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:23.370
(Jugo struggling)

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:26.974
Whoa there.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.777
(wings flapping)

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.079
Go on!

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:34.982
(geese honking)

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:41.088
(buzzing sound)

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:44.157
(Jugo struggling)

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.999
(Jugo breathing heavily)

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:14.855
(goose honking)

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.657
[Sarada] It's time.

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:26.166
(geese honking)

00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:53.527
(geese honking in alarm)

00:09:55.529 --> 00:09:56.697
What's that?

00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:07.074
(dramatic music)

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.843
No way, all the
infected geese are gone!

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:11.078
Damn it, this is bad!

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.946
What's going on here?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.648
[Tosaka] You guys!

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:18.318
[Boruto] Mr. Tosaka,
what's going on?

00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:20.821
The geese all went through
Curse Mark Transformation.

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:22.923
They escaped and
Jugo chased them!

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:23.924
He what?

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:24.958
Where'd they go?

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:25.993
That way!

00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:31.932
(bushes rustling)

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.166
[Boruto] Mr. Jugo!

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:36.970
(dramatic music intensifies)

00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:41.074
(Jugo struggling painfully)

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:42.976
Boruto!

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.978
Quickly, run away now!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.948
Not good.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.683
He's gonna go on a rampage.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.989
(Jugo struggling)

00:10:57.891 --> 00:10:59.359
We have to inject him right away

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:01.728
and get him back
into the cave fast.

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:03.096
I'll go and get the shots.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.364
Okay, but hurry.

00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:06.333
We don't have very
much time left.

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:10.737
Kill you!

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.709
It's no good, get away!

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.077
Mr. Jugo, stay calm.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.012
Sarada's getting the
injection right now,

00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:21.014
so please, try to hold on.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.751
(Jugo struggling)

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.261
No way.

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:36.129
But how?

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:55.849
No way.

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.084
Why would...

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.458
(Jugo screaming)

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.028
Both of you!

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.634
Get away from me, go!

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.169
Sarada will be back really soon.

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:17.871
Just hang on a little longer.

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:19.306
Come on, Sarada, hurry!

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:26.613
[Konohamaru] Don't
take any chances.

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:28.315
And avoid combat at all costs.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.787
(Jugo screaming)

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.291
Boruto, all of the
injections are gone.

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:44.097
(Jugo growling)

00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:46.099
Total Curse Mark Transformation.

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:48.735
Well, it's too late now.

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:50.571
We'll have to stop him here.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.007
Kill you, kill you, kill you!

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:59.313
(dramatic music)

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:13.093
(daggers swishing)

00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.729
[Boruto] Rasengan!

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:24.404
Thanks so much.

00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:27.574
What?

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:30.010
He's gone.

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:31.879
But where did he go to?

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:33.080
To the village.

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:34.648
Oh no, this is bad.

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.751
He's sure to take down a lot
of people if he goes there.

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:38.986
Let's go!

00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.256
Wait!

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:44.324
I'm coming, too!

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:48.028
Don't leave me here by myself!

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.731
(dramatic music intensifies)

00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:52.199
(loud exploding noise)

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:55.702
(villagers screaming)

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:56.737
I'll kill you.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.905
I'll kill you.

00:13:57.938 --> 00:13:59.006
I'll kill you!

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:01.175
[Villager] A monster!

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:02.876
(villagers screaming)

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.844
No!

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:05.245
Get up, hurry!

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:12.085
(Jugo laughing)

00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:13.887
Get away from the child, now!

00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:15.122
Go on!

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:19.226
(villager gasping)

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:20.861
[Villager Child] No, Dad!

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:22.629
Just go, get away!

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.100
I'll kill you.

00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:34.875
(Jugo laughing maniacally)

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:36.109
No, stop!

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.747
(arrows swishing through air)

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:43.750
[Boruto] Mr. Jugo!

00:14:52.593 --> 00:14:53.594
Mr. Jugo.

00:14:58.465 --> 00:14:59.900
[Research Team
Leader] Restrain him.

00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:00.901
[Sasami] Yes, sir.

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.569
[Momo] Understood.

00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:03.570
And be careful.

00:15:03.604 --> 00:15:07.007
Hey, what do you think
you're doing to Jugo?

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.076
We gave him a strong anesthetic.

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:11.378
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.279
But, still!

00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:13.914
[Team Leader]
We have to do this.

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:16.517
We don't know when he'll
go on a rampage again.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.485
It's for the safety
of the village.

00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:24.258
Thank you for all your help.

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.627
[Team Leader] That was
quite a scare, wasn't it?

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.861
Is everyone all right?

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:30.597
Somehow, yes, we are.

00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:32.099
Who are they, anyway?

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:34.902
They're researchers
from the Land of Rivers.

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.036
[Tosaka] Huh?

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.071
Why are people from the
Land of Rivers here?

00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:41.542
I contacted them and
asked for their help, too.

00:15:41.575 --> 00:15:43.143
In case we needed it.

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:45.979
It was him?

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.183
You were right.

00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:53.187
It appears that this person is
the monster's true identity.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.557
He completely
deceived all of us.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.091
Deceived you?

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.594
And you guys are in
cahoots with him, too!

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.663
Yeah, we saw you together!

00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:07.835
You knew all along that he
was secretly the monster,

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:10.737
but you kept it
from us, didn't you?

00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:12.039
That's not,

00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:13.507
we were gonna tell you
everything as soon as

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.343
all the geese were
cured of the Curse Mark.

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.879
And you didn't only keep
the truth from all of them,

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.781
you didn't tell us, either.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.082
Like I said-

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:23.884
I hate to admit
it, but we had put

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:25.719
you under surveillance as well.

00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:29.089
If you'd just told us,

00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:31.391
things wouldn't have
ended up this way.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:33.927
And if it weren't
for these researchers

00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:37.264
who came here from the
Land of Rivers to help,

00:16:37.297 --> 00:16:40.167
I'd hate to imagine what
might have happened!

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:43.237
You get it now?

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.439
Will you just let us
handle things from here on?

00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:47.174
What about Mr. Jugo?

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:48.709
[Research Team Leader]
We'll take care of him, too.

00:16:48.742 --> 00:16:52.579
Look, Mr. Jugo was just
trying to save the wild geese!

00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:56.016
But he absorbed too
much of the Curse Mark.

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:58.552
And ended up like this, right?

00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:01.722
But he has medicine to
suppress his rampages.

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:04.725
When he keeps
injecting it regularly-

00:17:04.758 --> 00:17:06.260
[Research Team
Leader] Where is it?

00:17:06.293 --> 00:17:08.829
It all just suddenly
disappeared.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:12.266
So, you have no way to stop
him anymore, is that right?

00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:17.070
Well if that's the case,

00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:19.706
you can leave this
village right now.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.576
But our teammates who were
sent on this mission with us

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:23.911
are bringing back reinforcements

00:17:23.944 --> 00:17:25.712
from our village to help out.

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:27.347
Your teammates?

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.149
Are you talking about these two?

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.722
[Boruto] Wasabi! Namida!

00:17:35.756 --> 00:17:37.858
[Sarada] What happened?

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.226
It's the...

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.995
We discovered them
unconscious in the forest.

00:17:43.463 --> 00:17:46.533
They've been infected
with the Curse Mark, too.

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.402
Luckily, we got to
them fast enough,

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.437
and they're undergoing
treatment right now,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.606
so they should be okay.

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:53.607
And Sumire?

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.708
Where's Sumire now?

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:58.879
Wasn't there another
person with them?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.715
Sorry, but we only
found these two.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:02.749
That's right.

00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:05.252
Sumire.

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.899
(Sumire stirring in sleep)

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.568
(high intensity rock music)

00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:25.239
All right, now it's time
for me to have a little fun.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.621
Do you think something
like that will work?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.992
Wasabi!

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.265
(Sasami chuckling)

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:55.169
Little brats.

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:56.637
Don't underestimate us.

00:18:57.905 --> 00:18:59.106
Wasabi!

00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:06.446
No way!

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:11.251
Man, this is such a pain.

00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:13.187
Let's just kill them all.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.588
We can't, Big Brother.

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:17.624
Our orders were just to
stop them, not to kill them.

00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:35.742
Let's do this!

00:19:37.911 --> 00:19:40.647
(Sasami roaring)

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.557
Nue!

00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:51.592
Summoning!

00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:56.763
(Nue growling)

00:19:56.797 --> 00:19:58.398
Just what is that?

00:19:58.432 --> 00:19:59.399
Come on.

00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:01.702
Won't those two be
enough, Big Brother?

00:20:01.735 --> 00:20:03.871
Just leave it alone!

00:20:03.904 --> 00:20:04.872
No way!

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:07.407
I'm gonna bring that thing down.

00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:10.711
Okay, then that one
will be my prey!

00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:14.982
(Nue growling)

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:20.254
Nue, just leave me!

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:22.556
Go help Wasabi and Namida!

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:23.590
Huh?

00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:25.459
No, Nue!

00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:27.027
Please don't.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.996
Go back, help them.

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.333
(Sumire gasping)

00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:38.639
Wasabi.

00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:44.444
Namida.

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.183
Listen, don't worry.

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:51.151
We're going to do
everything in our power

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:53.187
to help your friends, too.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.890
Mr. Tosaka, would you
mind staying here with us?

00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:58.192
Huh?

00:20:58.225 --> 00:21:00.060
I've heard you're
an ornithologist.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:01.728
The knowledge you
possess would be

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:03.797
a great help to
our investigation.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.732
I'd appreciate your assistance.

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:06.733
[Tosaka] I understand.

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:08.168
If he's staying, then you oughta

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:10.571
let us the rest of
us stay here, too!

00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:11.505
Enough!

00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:14.174
I'm rescinding my
request for your help!

00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:16.210
So just leave this village, now.

00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:17.744
That's right, just go!

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:21.081
(villagers agreeing)

00:21:22.816 --> 00:21:23.984
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:21:24.017 --> 00:21:27.087
It's just, I think it's
beyond our control now.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.756
I think we should
let them handle it.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.892
But don't worry, okay?

00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:34.194
I'll take care of
Jugo and the geese.

00:21:34.228 --> 00:21:36.563
I'll take full
responsibility for them.

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.899
But what about Konohamaru?

00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:40.534
I'm not completely
sure, but I don't think

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.603
he's able to get
out of bed just yet.

00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:46.974
Boruto.

00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:48.742
Let's go.

00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.053
[Boruto Voice] I
can't believe this.

00:22:00.087 --> 00:22:01.755
Wasabi and Namida.

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:03.457
Big Brother.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.892
And Jugo.

00:22:04.925 --> 00:22:07.027
I couldn't do anything for them.

00:22:11.465 --> 00:22:16.436
(Ending theme music)

00:23:42.823 --> 00:23:43.790
(dramatic music)

00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:45.859
[Sumire] Wasabi,
Namida, hold on!

00:23:45.893 --> 00:23:48.262
I'm coming to save
you right now!

00:23:48.295 --> 00:23:49.663
Nue, follow their chakra!

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:53.033
What's wrong, Nue?

00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:55.869
Oh, so you sensed
my presence, huh?

00:23:55.903 --> 00:23:57.771
What an interesting summoning.

00:23:57.804 --> 00:23:58.972
[Sumire] Who are you?

00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:03.177
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.179
Jugo's reinforcements.

00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:07.414
I just wanna ask
you some questions.

00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:09.583
Is that all right
with you, young lady?

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:16.723
