WEBVTT

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.445
I got you this time!

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:15.682
I'm not letting you
get away again!

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:16.449
[grunt]

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.359
I found it!

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:29.730
Direction: 11 o'clock.
Location: 30 meters ahead!

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.399
Okay! I'm gonna settle
this thing once and for all!

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.134
[grunt]

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.076
Gotcha now!

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.114
Watch out, Mitsuki!
It's coming for ya!

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.415
I'll take it from here.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:04.931
Calm down now.
It'll be okay.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.466
So lame!

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:10.837
How did we get stuck with
a mission to find a lost cat?

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.238
[sigh]

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.242
[chattering]

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.244
Thank you all
so much for this!

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.780
What a relief!

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:01.848
Sometimes this little one
likes to run away and explore.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.517
No worries.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.520
I'm just glad we were able to
find your cat safe and sound!

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.123
[sigh]

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.058
As much trouble as
that mission was,

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.259
it was still boring.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.561
Don't you get it...?

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:16.429
Taking care of those kinds
of problems

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.231
is part of our job as genin.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.099
Deal with it!

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.601
I know that.

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:22.569
But the only thing we've been
dealing with lately

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.805
are minor problems
in the neighborhood.

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.273
Like when we removed
that hornets' nest...

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.010
Or when we had to calm down
a couple of drunks.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.412
Shouldn't we be getting
better missions?

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.215
C'mon, don't you feel
the same way too, Mitsuki

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.417
Well, I enjoy doing
all of them.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.252
And I get to do them with you.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.486
That's right.

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:44.124
I always seem to
forget that about you.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.459
Okay! Our next mission's
gonna have to be

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.029
something super
more challenging!

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.263
Mitsuki, let's go!

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.331
‐ All right, then.
‐ Hey, hold on!

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.098
What're you‐‐?

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.499
Oh, come on!

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:55.301
‐ [chuckle]
‐ (BORUTO) Look,

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.037
I'm just saying...

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.271
What would it hurt?

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.873
One of those
high‐profile missions

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.508
would be perfect for us now!

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:04.778
[sigh] There's nothing I can
do for you about that...

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.379
Ah, man.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.382
We're not gonna get anywhere
talking to you, Miss Suika.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:12.085
Let me go talk to
my stupid old man.

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.621
Oh! Please, Mr. Konohamaru!

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.322
Didn't I already tell you
not to do that?

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.958
Lord Seventh is busy,

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.994
so your mission orders will
come from the assignment desk.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:23.263
But don't you see that
we'll never prove ourselves

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.631
doing these dumb missions.

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:27.333
They're a complete waste
of our talents.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.536
I find it amazing that
you still don't understand

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.005
what a ninja's job really is
in this day and age.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:33.273
Huh?

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.341
Battles used to happen
all the time.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.544
But do you really think
that big, showy fights

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:40.280
are common in a time of peace?

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.882
Uh... Well I...

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.084
Fighting enemy ninja
on your first mission

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.319
probably gave you
the wrong impression.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.989
But missions like that
are actually very rare.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.624
Come on...
No way!

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:53.560
That's like saying we might
as well be handymen.

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:55.328
Don't think about it
like that.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.330
If we can serve the village
by helping people,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.332
then every job
we do is important.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:02.503
And besides, everyone gets
these types of jobs.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:04.505
All your classmates are
working on missions

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:08.041
just as low key as the ones
you've been assigned.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.610
So we're not
the only ones then?

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:11.111
(KONOHAMARU) No!
And don't forget that

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.347
the time you spend as a genin
is when you really learn

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.950
the everyday realities
of the village and the world

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.184
by doing ordinary work.

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:19.653
Hmmm...

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.889
That again? My dad fed you
that line, didn't he?

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:23.890
Huh?!

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.491
Now that we're all clear...

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:28.394
Please run along and take care
of your assigned missions!

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:31.665
I can't take it!
I don't wanna do this stuff.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.668
Maybe I shouldn't have become
a ninja in the first place.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:38.338
He's such a child.
A complete idiot.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.405
[chattering]

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.675
<i>We bring you breaking news.</i>

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.577
<i>The case of</i>
<i>the armed robbers who attacked</i>

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.279
<i>the Hidden Leaf</i>
<i>Central Department Store</i>

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:58.158
<i>Well, actually, I could've</i>
<i>easily handled this one</i>

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.459
<i>entirely on my own.</i>

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.695
<i>Now, I'll have even more</i>

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.569
<i>Trained muscles will</i>
<i>never ever let you down!</i>

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:10.571
<i>Uh, thank you very much.</i>

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:11.972
<i>That concludes</i>
<i>our live report.</i>

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:14.207
It seems like missions
that are really dangerous

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.441
are always settled right away

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.110
by someone like
those two guys.

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:20.180
And meanwhile, we're the ones
stuck doing the boring work

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.815
so these jonin
get to look good.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.684
<i>other organized</i>
<i>crime rings continues</i>

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.418
(BORUTO)
This is so boring...

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.620
Unless other people know

00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:28.288
what our hard work
is accomplishing,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.923
there's no incentive to do it.

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.024
Let's hurry home!

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.225
I wanna play this!

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.159
I can't wait
to get started!

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:34.595
Wow! What am I doing?!

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:35.696
I gotta get out of here!

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.299
(MALE STORE CLERK)
Thank you very much!

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:39.933
[chuckle]

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:42.869
I can't believe
I almost forgot!

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.438
The new Kagemasa game
got released today!

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.473
Really?
What kind of game is it?

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:50.544
You appear to be very excited
about getting it.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.312
(BORUTO)
"Super Ninja Hero Battle 2"!

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:53.880
You create your own ninja,

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.282
and then you make 'em stronger
so you can win battles.

00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:57.751
It's a super fun game!

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:01.688
I've been waiting for
like ever for this sequel!

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:02.956
Oh...

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.759
The first game was
completely amazing!

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.528
I stayed up all night
playing it

00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:09.596
and mom got really mad at me.

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:12.633
So, you wanna go play it?

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.768
I swear
you're gonna get hooked.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.103
If you teach me how to play,
then I will...

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:17.971
(SARADA)
There you are!

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:18.972
‐ Hm?
‐ Hm?

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:21.241
[heavy breathing]

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.809
I've been looking for you!

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:24.911
Huh?
Well, what's up, Sarada?

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.514
Konohamaru Sensei sent
an emergency summons!

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:29.583
Meh. It's probably
just another mission

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.285
to look for somebody's
lost dog or cat...

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.386
That's not what it's about!

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.621
There's a robber

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:37.223
who's barricaded himself
inside a bank!

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.992
Bank robber?!

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.460
Barricaded?!

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.462
Inside an actual bank?!

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:46.567
‐ [screaming]
‐ Don't move, kid!

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.403
<i>Didn't you hear me?!</i>

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.305
<i>[pained groan]</i>

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:53.740
<i>[pained grunt]</i>

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:57.077
A mission worthy of
my attention!

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.679
<i>[cheering]</i>

00:07:58.712 --> 00:07:59.880
Yes!

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:00.747
This is it!

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:05.185
My opportunity to shine
has finally arrived!

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:11.091
That's the crime scene?

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.860
It's sure different from
what I imagined...

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:15.095
(KOTARO)
Hey!

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:18.932
I've been waiting for you.
Are you guys Team 7?

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.568
We sure are.
Who're you, mister?

00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:24.571
I'm Kotaro Fuuma of
the Leaf Police Force.

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:27.674
I'm the officer in
charge of this jurisdiction.

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.409
Thanks so much for coming!

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:30.243
Uh, sure.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.581
It's nice to see you again,
Captain Kotaro.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.651
Is that you Sarada?!

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.319
I don't see you
for a little while,

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.854
and suddenly,
you're all grown up!

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.757
You know this guy?
Is he for real?

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.459
Quiet!
Don't run your big mouth!

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.595
Mr. Kotaro is a special jonin

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:50.797
and he's the captain of
the Police Force.

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:54.234
Please! There's no need to
be so formal with me!

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.468
That's right!

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:57.003
Haven't members of
the Uchiha Clan

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.239
served in the Police Force
for several generations?

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:00.641
Yes.

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.876
And I'm hoping Sarada
will also join the Force.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.344
All in good time, of course.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.846
We'll be here
whenever she's ready.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.782
Well, now...
I don't know about that.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:11.384
Whatever. What's going on
with your suspect?

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.619
We need to know
exactly where

00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:14.688
this dangerous bad guy
is holed up!

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.223
Well, uh...
I was just getting to that...

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.392
(HAGURUMA)
Uh‐hm...

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.794
Uh...

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.064
Uh...? Who's that?

00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:25.065
What is it now?

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:27.701
Have you decided
to peacefully surrender?

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.536
No way, are you kidding?!

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.572
You think I'm fooling around
with this?!

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:33.740
I'm really gonna set off
this bomb!

00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:35.341
I'm totally serious!

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:36.376
This isn't a joke!

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.178
That's the dangerous bad guy?

00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:39.479
I'm not laughing!

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:41.081
All right already.

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.249
It's not safe
to wave that thing around.

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:46.587
So... Go ahead and tell us
your list of demands.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.889
Well, I don't uh...

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.057
Please stand by
for a moment...

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.927
That's not right...
Just hang on!

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:56.630
What's wrong with him?

00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:59.365
That's not quite
how I pictured him.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.502
He's a unique bank robber.

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:03.870
Well, now you know what
we're dealing with.

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:05.539
Everybody else
who was in the bank

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.808
was safely evacuated
hours ago.

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.511
If we weren't brought here
to save the hostages...

00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:11.945
then we must be here
to try to

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:14.080
talk somebody out of
killing themselves, right?

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.316
That's why the mission
was passed on to us

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:17.818
and not assigned
to a jonin.

00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:20.554
Uh...This is not what
I was expecting!

00:10:20.587 --> 00:10:21.822
What happened to
the big fight

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:23.657
where we subdue the suspect?

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.160
Where's the moment where
I finally get to shine?

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:28.461
(MITSUKI) But there is
still a chance

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:29.796
the bomb could be real.

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.532
He's right.

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:32.966
And it's because of
that possibility

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.068
that we can't afford
to force his hand.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.303
That's why you were
called in to help us.

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:38.905
Now it makes sense.

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:41.575
You want to try to talk him
out of this?

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:42.843
And what about you?

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.678
If you want out,
then I'm perfectly fine

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.647
completing this mission
without you.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.749
[chuckle] Of course,
if that's the case,

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:50.250
I'll have to report back
to Sensei

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:53.019
that you weren't any help
at all this time.

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.890
And who said
I'm out of anything?

00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:57.791
‐ [smirk]
‐ [chuckle]

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:01.595
Ha! I'm gonna come up with
a solution so fast

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.830
it'll put those jonin
to shame!

00:11:03.864 --> 00:11:05.398
I'm gonna settle this.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:11.404
[sigh and groan]

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:12.739
Why on earth
did I ever think

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:14.240
this would be a good idea?

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:15.509
What a mess!

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.511
But now I've gone
too far to turn back!

00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:18.745
And since that's the case,

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.747
I'll go out
in a blaze of glory...

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:22.916
(BORUTO) You wanna go out
in a blaze of glory?

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:23.449
Huh?

00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:26.152
[panicking gasps]

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.588
Hey, just calm down!

00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:29.455
I'm not gonna do anything
to you.

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:30.857
The truth of the matter is

00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:33.359
we still don't even know
what the hell you want.

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:35.996
I thought we should talk
about it face to face.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:36.563
Uh...

00:11:36.597 --> 00:11:37.831
You see...

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.666
Think of me kinda like
a negotiator

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.234
for the officer who's
outside.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:42.636
I'll be your hostage.

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:44.938
[chuckle] Tell me what
you're really doing here?

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.406
You're just looking
for your chance

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.708
to arrest me, aren't you?

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.943
[chuckle]
I don't do things like that.

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:51.277
If you don't trust me...

00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:54.681
then go ahead and tie up
my hands or my feet.

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:55.415
Here...

00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:59.085
[nervous breaths]

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:04.224
He's really too reckless
to be left in there alone.

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:05.158
Are you worried?

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:06.793
The only thing
I'm worried about

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.829
is the safety of the suspect.

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:11.698
(HAGURUMA)
[grunts] Damn it!

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:12.933
This knot...

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:15.235
I just can't get it
tight enough.

00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:16.002
[yawn]

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.103
Hey...

00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:18.805
Want me to hold
that detonator for you

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:19.540
while you try again?

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:20.741
Huh? Yeah!

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:22.275
That would be great,
actually...

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:22.976
Argh!

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:25.345
As if I'd give it to you!

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:26.246
Nice and tight.

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:27.614
No offense, man,

00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:29.449
but you're really bad
at this kinda stuff.

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:32.285
Were you actually serious
about robbing the bank?

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:33.720
[grimace]

00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:36.322
I mean, you never even got
the safe unlocked...

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:38.859
[emotional breaths]

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:39.860
Let me guess...

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:41.327
The bank employees got away

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.463
and now, you're stuck
because you can't open it?

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:46.933
[groaning]

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:48.434
That's really
what happened...?

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:49.736
Yeesh.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.204
You don't seem like
the type of person

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:52.873
who'd wanna
get mixed up in crime,

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.508
so why'd you do this?

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:55.609
Well, I uh...

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:56.342
What's your name?

00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:59.312
Haguruma...

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:00.847
Listen, Mr. Haguruma,

00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:02.215
if you just turn yourself in

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.317
they're bound to go
easy on you.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.552
It's stupid to ruin

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.320
the rest of your life
because of this.

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:08.622
[scoff]
Really?

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:10.724
I'm gonna ruin
the rest of my life?

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:12.058
Well, it's already ruined.

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:13.259
Huh?

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:16.997
You see, I was fired from
my job two months ago.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.065
And it's all because my boss
went and accused me

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:21.001
of something I didn't even do.

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:23.169
What do you mean by that?

00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:24.470
(HAGURUMA) I used to be
a programmer

00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:26.072
for a video game company.

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:29.309
I worked behind the scenes
and had really intense hours.

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:32.212
But the work was fulfilling...
and I was good at it.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.181
My problems started during

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:38.552
the last programming project
I was assigned to.

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:39.920
The team leader gave me
a schedule

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:41.955
that seemed impossible.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.424
But I was ordered to meet it,
no matter what.

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:46.960
How'd it go?

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.829
Were you able to
finish the game in time?

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:50.063
(HAGURUMA) [chuckle]
Yeah, somehow.

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:51.164
[gasp]

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:52.498
(HAGURUMA) But several
of my coworkers

00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:55.702
got sick from exhaustion
'cause of the work load.

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:56.937
See, we just couldn't take

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.605
the team leader's abuse
any longer

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:01.508
and we were all planning to
file an appeal against him.

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:02.709
But then...

00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:04.678
The team leader
got wind of it.

00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:06.547
He accused me of selling
company secrets

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.081
to a rival company

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:10.817
and made up "proof"
to back it up.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.519
So I was fired.

00:14:12.553 --> 00:14:14.721
Wow, that's just awful!

00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:15.956
I became an example

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.658
for the other guys
who opposed him.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:21.194
Everyone immediately stopped
complaining and kept working.

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:23.363
How can something like
that be allowed to happen?!

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.999
That's ridiculous
and totally unfair!

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.069
Maybe it's hard for you
to understand

00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:31.204
at this point in your life.

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:33.907
But these things happen a lot
in the adult world.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.176
Especially in the times
we're living in.

00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:39.245
(SARADA)
So...

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.147
Why do you feel
the suspect in the bank

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:43.283
might be
a disgruntled employee?

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:45.385
Well...
after the Great Ninja War,

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:48.354
there was expansive
development in the world.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.691
Quality of life
generally improved,

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:53.493
but the gap between the rich
and the poor expanded as well.

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:57.263
After that,
I couldn't get any work.

00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:59.499
No other company was gonna
think about hiring me

00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:02.869
once they knew I was "fired"
for leaking company secrets...

00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:05.005
I got sick from
the shock of it all,

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:08.108
and went into debt to pay
for my medical expenses.

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:10.110
I borrowed money
from loan sharks,

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:12.613
and then, the debt I owed
them ballooned.

00:15:12.646 --> 00:15:13.780
‐ [sobbing]
‐ I get it.

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:15.582
I understand
how your situation

00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:16.650
made you this desperate.

00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:18.151
Damn it all!

00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:20.987
I really want to beat up
that rotten ol' boss of yours!

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:24.324
[chuckle] You're that angry
about what happened to me?

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:25.491
I appreciate it.

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:27.994
But I'm still holding onto
another grudge.

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:30.063
What type of grudge
are you talking about?

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.065
I was pretty happy at my job.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.667
I enjoyed working
behind the scenes

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.201
and programming games.

00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:36.870
I just wanted the people
who played them

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:38.805
to enjoy them
as much as I did.

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:40.173
But then...

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:42.643
I realized no one
knew how hard I had worked,

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:44.144
or that I ended up like this.

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.411
Once I realized that,

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.448
then nothing mattered anymore,
you know?

00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:48.549
[gasp]

00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:50.917
<i>Unless other people</i>

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.686
<i>know what our hard work</i>
<i>is accomplishing,</i>

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:55.589
<i>there's no incentive</i>
<i>to do it.</i>

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:56.690
[sigh]

00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:01.595
And that's why I pretended
that I was a bank robber...

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:02.996
But I'm done with that.

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:04.698
Uh... What do you mean?

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.503
I feel a lot better now.

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:12.506
I hadn't told anyone
about all that stuff.

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:13.674
Until now.

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:15.275
Really, Mr. Haguruma?

00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:19.412
You took the time to listen
to this old fool...

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:22.282
So I don't wanna drag you
any further into this mess.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.317
Hey wait...
You're not gonna‐‐!

00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:30.090
(HAGURUMA)
I just activated the bomb.

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:31.925
This place will blow
in five minutes.

00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.093
[gasp]

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:34.360
But the last thing
I want to do

00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:36.630
is for you to get hurt
because of me.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.465
So I'm going to go barricade
myself behind these doors.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.467
I'll blow myself up
with a big bang

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:43.904
as a final protest to
my damned boss.

00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:45.138
Hey...wait!

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.339
Look, there's gotta be
a better‐‐

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:47.073
Whoa!

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.441
(HAGURUMA) It's perfect

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.711
since today's the release date
of my game.

00:16:50.744 --> 00:16:52.445
This might even
make the news...

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:52.746
Huh?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.750
The last game I worked on
came out today.

00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:58.952
You probably don't know it,
but it's Super Ninja‐‐

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:00.854
Super Ninja Hero Battle 2?!

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:02.422
You kidding?!
Of course, I know it!

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:06.359
Look for yourself...
in my jacket pocket!

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.128
[grunt]

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:09.362
This is it...

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:10.997
My game!

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.398
(BORUTO)
Told ya!

00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:14.601
You're a...
You're a fan of my game?

00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:15.969
Really?

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:18.004
I played the first one
for hours and hours,

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.506
until I cleared
every mission.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.107
And I plan to play
this second one

00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:23.043
all the way to the end, too!

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:24.645
This is the first time...

00:17:24.678 --> 00:17:27.347
anyone's ever said something
like that to me personally.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.315
(BORUTO) I'll say it
as many times as you want!

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:30.383
Hey!

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.152
I'll tell you
what I think about Part 2

00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:33.687
after I finish playing it.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.724
But I won't be able to do that
if you're not here!

00:17:37.758 --> 00:17:41.762
[emotional breath]

00:17:41.795 --> 00:17:44.130
Yeah, you're right.
I guess not.

00:17:44.164 --> 00:17:45.298
I wouldn't want to
miss hearing

00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:47.033
what you thought about it.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.002
Do we have a deal?
Whaddya say?

00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:50.303
Mm‐hm.

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:52.906
I've decided
I'm not gonna kill myself.

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:55.609
[chuckle]
Now that's more like it!

00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:57.110
[chuckle]

00:17:57.143 --> 00:17:59.279
Hey, you know,
all of a sudden...

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.915
This thing's kinda
freaking me out.

00:18:01.948 --> 00:18:03.884
No kidding! Just hurry up
and turn it off!

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.318
Sure.

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:08.655
All I have to do is
press this button twice...

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:09.790
Ah, crap...

00:18:09.823 --> 00:18:11.792
Why isn't it working?

00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:13.193
[grunt]
Well, that's weird.

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:14.494
Is the connection bad?

00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:16.663
Is there some glitch in
the program?!

00:18:16.697 --> 00:18:18.198
A‐At this rate...

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:20.300
That's bad!

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:21.602
Can't you take the belt off?!

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:23.670
[grunt]
I purposely made the device

00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:25.138
really hard to take off.

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:27.541
I wasn't expecting to
change my mind!

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:28.374
[grunt]

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:29.142
I got it!

00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.577
Mr. Haguruma...

00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:32.879
You've gotta untie my hands
right now!

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:35.816
[grunt]

00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:37.651
All right!

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.188
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:43.256
What?!

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.193
That detonator runs
on electricity, right?

00:18:47.227 --> 00:18:48.962
‐ (HAGURUMA) Yeah.
‐ Okay...

00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:51.097
You're gonna feel
a little jolt.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.799
Apologies in advance!

00:18:57.871 --> 00:18:59.105
‐ Haaa!
‐ Haaa!

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.473
‐ Lightning Style!
‐ Lightning Style!

00:19:05.912 --> 00:19:07.247
No sign of Boruto.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.549
What's going on?

00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:10.617
Maybe the suspect
won't cooperate.

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:12.185
He said he would take
the detonator

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:14.120
the moment he had a chance...

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.822
Maybe the mission
was too difficult

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:16.923
to complete by himself.

00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:17.891
[gasp]

00:19:17.924 --> 00:19:19.125
(KOTARO)
Hang on a second!

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.161
(MITSUKI) Was that...
Lightning Style?

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.663
[heavy breaths]

00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:23.396
[gasp]

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.733
[chuckle]

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:27.768
Boruto!

00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:31.171
Another mission accomplished.

00:19:31.204 --> 00:19:32.405
We're all okay!

00:19:34.207 --> 00:19:35.542
(KOTARO)
Well done!

00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:37.611
And thanks to
your excellent work,

00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:38.645
no one was hurt!

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:40.380
[chuckle]

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:43.950
But now what?
Mr. Haguruma...

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:47.187
We now believe he was under
such extreme mental stress

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.822
that he couldn't
make sound decisions.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:52.292
Furthermore...after we
inspected the explosive...

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:54.661
we discovered that it was
just a worthless appliance

00:19:54.695 --> 00:19:56.496
that couldn't have caused
any fatalities.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.532
Huh?! Wait, what the hell?!

00:19:58.565 --> 00:20:00.233
And after causing
all that panic...

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:01.568
[chuckling]

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:03.103
Considering the circumstances,

00:20:03.136 --> 00:20:05.672
and his sincere regret
for his actions...

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:08.575
I believe his punishment
probably won't be too severe.

00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:09.576
[relieved sigh]

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.277
You should be proud
of yourself.

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.913
You did a good job.

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:14.247
All right!

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.048
(MITSUKI)
But...

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:16.382
Huh?

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:19.886
Regardless... What is he
supposed to do now?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.622
Yeah. I thought of that.

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:26.860
(DENKI) Hello?
How can I help you?

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.361
Oh! Hey, Boruto!

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:30.163
So tell me how
your mission went?

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:31.632
Huh?

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:34.300
Sure, let me know if there's
anything I can do...

00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:36.903
[sigh]

00:20:36.937 --> 00:20:40.306
If that's all you need,
then I think I can help you.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.109
The Kaminarimon Company
is always looking to hire

00:20:43.143 --> 00:20:44.444
exceptional people!

00:20:46.647 --> 00:20:48.882
Okay, so we've made
our report.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:52.118
Time for me to go home,
play my game and relax!

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:54.054
That sounds like fun.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.622
And I have to be ready
to go tomorrow,

00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:57.891
no matter what the request,
ya know?

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.092
You what‐‐?!

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:00.661
What caused
the change of heart?

00:21:03.063 --> 00:21:05.031
Well... How do I put it...?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.335
Even if there's no glory
in a job,

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:11.772
chances are it still
has value for someone.

00:21:11.805 --> 00:21:14.240
(SARADA) Did I actually
hear you say that?

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.242
I think I'm gonna see
pigs fly soon.

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.110
What was that?!

00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:18.344
Got a problem?

00:21:19.546 --> 00:21:20.847
Someone told the suspect

00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:23.116
he should barricade himself
in the bank?

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:24.317
Is that really
what you're saying?

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.886
(KOTARO)
Yes.

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:28.789
It eventually came out while
we were interrogating him.

00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:30.724
I wondered why
someone like him...

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:34.060
someone so timid would try
to pull off something so bold.

00:21:34.094 --> 00:21:37.564
<i>At first, I was gonna kill</i>
<i>myself without telling anyone.</i>

00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:40.500
<i>But just as I was about to</i>
<i>jump in front of a train...</i>

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.969
<i>a stranger walked up to me.</i>

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:45.238
And that's the person
who gave him the idea

00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:46.773
to barricade himself?

00:21:46.807 --> 00:21:49.676
Exactly. He told him
where security was lax

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.344
and even
the best time to do it...

00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:53.346
But who would do such
a crazy thing?

00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:55.415
(SECURITY NINJA)
Excuse me.

00:21:55.448 --> 00:21:57.050
Yeah, what is it?

00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:58.685
[whispers]

00:21:58.719 --> 00:21:59.686
No way!

00:23:46.727 --> 00:23:48.795
(KONOHAMARU) Looks like
that case you guys solved...

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.264
was just a well‐planned
diversion to distract us.

00:23:51.297 --> 00:23:52.398
(BORUTO)
Oh no! Damn!

00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:53.600
(KOTARO)
It's a group of guys

00:23:53.634 --> 00:23:55.201
who call themselves
"noble thieves."

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:56.069
(BORUTO)
The Byakuya Gang?

00:23:56.102 --> 00:23:57.437
They've been active

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.873
in several other villages
all over the place.

00:23:59.906 --> 00:24:01.174
They're anonymous.

00:24:01.207 --> 00:24:04.611
(BORUTO) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.645 --> 00:24:06.880
"The Byakuya Gang Surfaces!"

00:24:06.913 --> 00:24:08.314
Damn Byakuya Gang!

00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:10.551
I'm gonna get those guys
for sure!
