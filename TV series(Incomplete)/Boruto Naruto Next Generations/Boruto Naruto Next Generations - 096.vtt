00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.809
(upbeat music)

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.512
(crowd laughs)

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.490
Namida stay back and
protect our clients.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:24.491
Right.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.826
Sumire, Wasabi let's go.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.960
Right.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:30.397
(fighting)

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:41.375
Namida retreat for now.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.979
No, I'm fine I can
fight too Wasabi

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.514
-(man attacking)
-Just go.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.083
(upbeat music)

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.092
(Namida screams)

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:14.675
Oh Wasabi.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.079
(tightening the rope)

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:26.486
Namida your jutsu
is just amazing.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.788
Do you think so?

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:32.192
I get worried because it affects
everyone around me so much.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.228
I hope the merchants are okay.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:38.031
Your jutsu is amazing Namida.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.133
Well, we did protect
their merchandise

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.469
so they'll forgive
us, won't they?

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:43.971
I have to say Namida,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:46.006
your jutsu is amazing.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.109
Sumire, Wasabi, Hanabi Sensei.

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:53.514
No, don't tell me.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.519
(Namida screams)

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.025
♪♪ Japanese Opening Theme ♪♪

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:53.934
Namida, everybody is
gonna be just fine.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.069
The doctor says we just
need to give it

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:57.771
time and then we will be okay.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.573
Oh thank goodness.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:05.312
Hey, I heard you guys
captured the Garakuta Gang.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.148
That gang is composed
of deadbeat shinobi,

00:04:08.182 --> 00:04:10.083
who target antique
art pieces, right?

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:13.153
(the girls laugh)

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.056
Hey, are you listening?

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.559
What was that Boruto.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.628
I can't hear anything at all.

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:23.797
What is going on with you guys?

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.799
Everyone on the team
lost their hearing

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.001
for a little while
because of my jutsu.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:32.072
Well, your jutsu is
very strong Namida.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.474
Huh? What's the name of the
television show you like?

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:38.145
Yeah, I agree and that place
has really good desserts.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.948
No, we were just talking

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:42.983
about how strong
Namida's jutsu is.

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:45.352
What did you just say?

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.788
All I said was,

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:51.658
This looks a lot like a
bunch of old ladies talking.

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:52.926
But the doctor just told them

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.962
they're all gonna be fine.

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:56.930
If this always happens,

00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.266
then it might affect
your missions.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.070
One wrong move and you couldn't
have taken down your allies

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.405
Wha? What did you say?

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.908
Wait, what store are
you talking about now.

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.943
Like I said

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.144
You're talking so quietly,

00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:13.514
I can't understand
what you're saying.

00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:14.515
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:15.516
What TV show.

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:16.517
I think.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.317
That's the one.

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:19.620
I'm here on for everyone sake,

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.988
I won't cry anymore.

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.359
I'm going to start training
with the new jutsu instead.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.162
Now what, what's that Namida?

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:33.066
(upbeat music)

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.805
Water Style: Raging Waves.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.142
(firing Water Style)

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.612
Wow, who knew Namida
could use Water Style.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:48.682
(firing Water Style)

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:55.322
But it doesn't have the
power to bring down an enemy.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.824
You know, I think you
should just reevaluate

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.826
how you use your crying jutsu.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.595
That won't work.

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:04.331
I have to get stronger
with a new jutsu,

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.836
that's why I wanted to ask
Sensei how I could do that.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.638
(upbeat music)

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:14.975
I think that the problem is
with your chakra control.

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:17.544
My chakra control
is the problem?

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:19.479
Sumire.

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:22.049
(upbeat music)

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.721
Water Style: Suireiha!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.092
Wow, amazing.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.328
By focusing your
chakra into one point,

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.663
you increase the jutsu power.

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:38.699
You see when you're scared,

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.100
you start to cry right away

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.802
and let your emotions take over.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:44.171
and that ends up
disrupting your focus.

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:47.441
I knew it,

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:49.810
it's 'cause I'm
such a crying baby.

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:52.946
Hanabi Sensei what
should I do to fix it?

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.848
Please you have to teach me.

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:57.317
It's rare that we
see you so determined

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:59.820
that kind of resolve
is absolutely critical

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:01.021
for concentration.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:02.990
Right.

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.629
(Namida screams)

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:09.830
Hey, come on.

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.498
Where's all that spirit
you showed earlier.

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:14.434
Focus your chakra
and fight back.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:15.702
I can't it's impossible.

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:19.606
Listen Namida practicing
infusing chakra

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.575
while you're moving will
strengthen your ability

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.844
to control it subconsciously
in the future.

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:25.913
(Namida screams)

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:27.347
(speaks in foreign language)

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.017
(upbeat music)

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:33.720
Come on now,

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.155
you're not focusing your
chakra around your mouth.

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:36.957
If you have time to cry,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.091
you have time focus.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.426
(Namida cries)

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.829
Please Sensei, can we
just call it a day.

00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:43.997
No way

00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:46.333
I didn't know Hanabi
Sensei can be so strict.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.334
Uh huh.

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:56.910
Next up is distance.

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.612
See if you can make your jutsu

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.347
reach the very top of this path.

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.851
(Namida groans)

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:05.853
Now Namida.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:06.854
Uh Right.

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:09.790
(upbeat music)

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:13.093
(firing Water Style)

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:18.532
There's just no way I
can make it go that far.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.868
It's totally impossible.

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:21.835
You're wrong.

00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:23.237
You have to keep practicing.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.440
You asked for this, so you
will see it through to the end

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:30.210
And she's hyped up way
more than normal too.

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:33.313
You know how when you block
the end of a hose a bit,

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:35.949
the water comes out with
more force and goes farther.

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.951
This time just try
visualizing that

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:39.920
and focus your
chakra on your mouth.

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:41.154
A hose.

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:49.563
(firing Water Style)

00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:55.302
(upbeat music)

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.642
And now let's work on power.

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.277
Keep firing your Water Style

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.512
until you can knock
over that log.

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:08.148
(upbeat music)

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.220
(firing Water Style)

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:18.859
Namida control.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.093
Focus it onto one spot.

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:23.363
(firing Water Style)

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.775
I do it until I knock this over?

00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:35.976
Hey, no one told you to stop.

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:37.945
Go on, keep on hitting it.

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:39.413
This will not only
increase your power.

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:41.381
It will build up
your stamina too.

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.553
(firing Water Style)

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.990
She's going through all
this training for our sake

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:52.292
so she won't cry anymore.

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:54.995
But I think she's
crying on the inside.

00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:56.496
We ought to train too,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.931
so that we don't
give her a reason

00:09:57.965 --> 00:09:59.700
to cry during a battle.

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:00.701
Yeah, you're right,

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.469
we have to get strong too.

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:07.341
(firing Water Style)

00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:12.913
It hurts so much
right around here.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.549
I think I pulled a muscle.

00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:19.786
Well, that's because you
don't normally use it.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.923
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.259
Namida, don't worry,
starting tomorrow

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.327
we'll train right alongside you.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:29.830
We've got your back.

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:31.698
Let's all do our best together.

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:34.301
Yeah, we'll all get stronger.

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:37.504
Oh Wasabi, Sumire.

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:44.344
Alright for you two I
can endure any pain.

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:46.680
I'll do my best.

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:48.315
( the girls laugh)

00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:51.084
(upbeat music)

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:56.456
Summoning.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.459
(upbeat music)

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:00.494
Nue!

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.030
Nue!

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:04.998
Nue!

00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:08.101
Nue!

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.505
Still no good, next.

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:14.041
It's my turn now.

00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:17.945
Here I come.

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:18.979
Ahhhhh!

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.681
Come on.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.554
Sorry Namida.

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.458
It's okay, I'm not done yet.

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:34.094
(upbeat music)

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.597
Alright that's more like it.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.800
Namida really giving us
everything she's got.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:44.471
You know Hanabi Sensei, I didn't
realize you were so strict.

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:46.607
Although before
I've heard it said

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.774
that your family
is the strongest

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:50.143
in the whole Hidden
Leaf Village.

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:52.279
Yes well times have changed.

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:55.516
You know, Namida has never
really been very interested

00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:57.050
in trying to get stronger.

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:02.322
Like now she's working hard
to change all on her own.

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:04.825
Seeing that made me really happy

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.560
and it got me all fired up.

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:10.497
(upbeat music)

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:15.802
(firing Water Style)

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:18.071
Nue! Nue! Nue!

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:22.376
(firing Water Style)

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.361
(Namida laughs)

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:45.098
(firing Water Style)

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.747
I did it, Sumire, Wasabi,

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:01.949
I moved it a little.

00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:03.951
You did great Namida.

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.619
Yeah, your training's
really paying off.

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:09.489
I bet that you could even use
that jutsu on real missions now.

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:18.098
We we'll keep you safe till
we reach the national border.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.501
You again, you're protecting us?

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.669
I hope it'll be okay.

00:13:22.703 --> 00:13:24.338
Yes, I assure you that.

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.472
Don't you worry.

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:29.843
Well, anyway, the
merchandise we're carrying

00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:31.612
is extremely valuable.

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:34.281
Among the items that
we have is a document

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.450
that was written by
the First Hokage.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.152
It's considered to be
a national treasure.

00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:42.256
The leader of the Garakuta Gang

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:43.957
is still on the loose too.

00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.959
So I'm counting on you.

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:46.994
Right.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.166
(birds chirping)

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:10.651
Alright, what do you want?

00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:14.188
It looks like we've
got a feisty one here.

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:16.423
Hey boss, it's them.

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:18.926
They got big brown
on others before.

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:20.027
Oh yeah?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.295
(Namida gasp)

00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:22.296
(laughing)

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:28.001
Water Style: Raging Waves.

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:30.737
It worked.

00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:34.875
Huh? But how.

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:37.744
( the man laughs)

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:40.747
Water clones.

00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:49.156
(laughing and growling)

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:53.360
Water attacks have
no effect on water.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.797
Namida you stay back
and protect our clients.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.031
Right.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.368
Ahhhh!

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:06.740
Water Style: Raging Waves.

00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:12.412
Ahhh! Him too, no way.

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:19.887
If I cry everyone
would get hurt.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.154
Awww, What's wrong.

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.262
Namida!

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:32.132
Summoning!

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.903
(Nue growls)

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:37.137
What.

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.143
Enough Nue.

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:51.151
Wow, look Nue's sure bigger huh?

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:53.754
I think it's 'cause of all
the training we've done.

00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:57.758
Thanks.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:00.294
No, my merchandise.

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.602
Damn it, get them.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.504
Wait!

00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:15.709
I promise you that we'll
get your merchandise back.

00:16:15.742 --> 00:16:17.678
I'm going to go
after the thieves,

00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:21.448
the rest of you stay with the
merchants and keep them safe,

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.449
Right.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:23.584
Nue go.

00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:38.265
Listen Namida, it was
just a coincidence

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:40.634
that your Water Style
didn't work against them.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.436
So don't be sad.

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:44.771
But I trained so hard.

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:46.340
Yes, you sure did

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:48.509
and all your work isn't
gonna go to waste.

00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:51.545
Really I'm absolutely
certain about that Namida.

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:53.247
Sumire.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.849
Man that was a
really close call.

00:16:55.883 --> 00:16:58.085
I know, thank goodness,

00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:00.587
we were able to keep
this scroll safe.

00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:04.558
What, seriously you had it
hidden away all this time.

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:05.559
Uhhh... (laughing)

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:09.196
I knew it.

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.698
I figured that's what
was going on here.

00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:16.236
You merchants sure are a
sneaky bunch, but no matter.

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:19.840
Honestly, I'm just
grateful that you told me

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.009
where the treasure can be found.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:25.012
I'll be able to get
a real nice price

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.080
for a scroll from
the First Hokage.

00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:31.018
Sumire, you two
take the merchants

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.853
and make a run for it, go on.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.721
What, don't be so reckless.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.691
Ahhh!

00:17:41.962 --> 00:17:44.665
Namida, are you okay Namida?

00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:49.536
It's my fault you got

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.771
Don't worry about it.

00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:54.541
This is just about all that I
can really do for right now.

00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:57.911
What nice friends trying
to protect each other.

00:17:57.945 --> 00:18:00.747
How about I send you
all to hell together.

00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:03.617
Earth Style: Bottomless Swamp!

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:08.789
(struggling)

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:10.624
What is this?

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:12.426
Oh no, I can't get free.

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.296
This is really not good.

00:18:17.664 --> 00:18:20.033
Ah damn it my arm stuck bad.

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:21.268
Do you think that,

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.370
if I hadn't say I
would stop crying

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.639
maybe all of this
wouldn't have happened.

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:30.711
Or maybe if I just
gotten stronger.

00:18:30.744 --> 00:18:32.646
You have become stronger Namida.

00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:35.582
Your emotions,

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:38.418
you're controlling them with
a heart of steel right now.

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:41.455
Normally you'd be whining
and crying, right?

00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:42.723
But you're not.

00:18:42.756 --> 00:18:44.992
You're more than strong enough.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.327
Is that how it is?

00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:49.329
Thank you.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.698
I guess I'm pretty lucky

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:54.735
that you didn't start
crying all over the place.

00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:59.072
I decided that I wouldn't
cry anymore but still.

00:19:00.274 --> 00:19:03.844
No, you don't we can't have
you doing that now, can we?

00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:06.013
Alright, you guys
take care of them.

00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:08.849
What, hey boss.

00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:11.218
Namida, listen don't
worry about us,

00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:12.619
just let them have it.

00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:17.090
By focusing your
chakra into one point,

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:20.027
you increase the jutsu power.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.262
Increase its power.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.733
(gathering power)

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:27.734

00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:45.986
(breaking trees)

00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:01.768
My cry went in
one straight line.

00:20:01.802 --> 00:20:04.304
Wow, your power
is no joke Namida.

00:20:06.106 --> 00:20:08.108
It's all thanks
to your training.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:10.978
(disbelief)

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:13.280
Summoning.

00:20:18.652 --> 00:20:19.887
No way.

(upbeat music)

00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:22.589

Wait, retreat. (screaming)

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.743
Quickly Namida, go
ahead do it again.

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:43.911
I'm on it.

00:20:43.944 --> 00:20:45.913
The new version of my
jutsu will take care

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:47.247
of those guys (screams).

00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:15.542
What happened?

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:16.643
My chakra is.

00:21:18.545 --> 00:21:21.481
Oh Namida, you've got
a long way to go.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.985
(upbeat music)

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:29.590
Once again, team 15,
you did a great job.

00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:35.996
But didn't you say you were
gonna stop crying Namida.

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:41.101
Well, I'm still gonna need
a whole lot of training.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.437
Did you cry because
you got hurt.

00:21:43.904 --> 00:21:45.205
Ummmm nu-huh.

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:48.976
I did it to protect everybody.

00:21:50.677 --> 00:21:55.082
So from here on, I'm gonna
cry as hard as I can.

00:21:55.115 --> 00:21:56.750
And for the two of you,

00:21:56.783 --> 00:21:59.620
I'll do anything
humanly possible.

00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:01.722
Can I have to speak up Namida.

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:02.723
What's that?

00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:05.125
You're going where Namida.

00:22:06.927 --> 00:22:07.728
It's nothing.
