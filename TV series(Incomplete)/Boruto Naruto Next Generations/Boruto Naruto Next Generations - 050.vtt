WEBVTT

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.779
(KONOHAMARU)
Excuse me, sir...

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.483
Hm. Oh what?
Where's Lord Seventh?

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:21.087
Hm? Oh, he's over with
the Feudal Lord today.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.322
Thought I'd make
my way through

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.424
as much of this work
as possible.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.827
Otherwise, it just piles up,
ya know?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.962
The work never seems
to end does it?

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.130
(SHIKAMARU)
Oh, yeah...

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.832
I just came by to drop off

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.466
the report on
our last mission.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.769
Why don't you put it
in the box over there?

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.503
Sure thing!

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.273
Oh, is this‐‐?

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:44.210
Yeah. That's the outline
for the next Chunin Exams.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.246
It's already
this far along, huh?

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.681
It's our responsibility

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.150
because we're in charge
of the test this time.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.586
Every village is sending
their VIPs,

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.321
so there's a mountain
of prep work to do.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.858
Seems like things are
just gonna get busier!

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.159
It's busy already!

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.493
I'll contact you

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.195
as soon as the applications
are printed out.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.797
In the meantime...

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.000
you can think about what you
want to do with your genin.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.234
I will.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.237
The Chunin Exams, huh?

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.677
(SHINO) The upcoming
Chunin Exams

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.244
will be a huge event.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.447
There'll be many visitors
coming to our village.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.784
What a great way to
establish friendly relations!

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:06.653
But it makes the preparations
much more stressful...

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.590
and security for the event
is going to be an ordeal.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.992
I'm certainly not
looking forward to it.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.027
Now don't say that.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.428
The test is a big deal.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.131
The future of your genin
will be on the line.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.700
Well, of course,
you're right.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.267
Passing the Chunin Exam

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.671
is the only way to rise
to the level of team captain.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.372
It also means you bear
the responsibility

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.741
for unsuccessful missions

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.075
and your subordinates'
injuries or deaths.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.544
Yes.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.779
We need to know they meet
all of the qualifications,

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:35.148
so we can rest assured
they're up to the job.

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:37.918
Well, that said,
Shino Sensei himself

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.419
taught this year's
slate of rookies

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.054
with some of the most
problematic students

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:41.755
we've had in years.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:42.989
[panicking]

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.024
(KONOHAMARU)
Boruto, in particular...

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.425
has been getting into trouble

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.793
since the very day of
the entrance ceremony.

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:48.028
[panicking]

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.530
(KONOHAMARU)
I'll never forget it!

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:52.566
He rammed a Thunder Train
into the Great Stone Faces.

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.302
<i>Cho‐Cho Akimichi.</i>

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.038
<i>(CHO‐CHO)</i>
<i>Here.</i>

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.540
<i>Boruto Uzumaki.</i>

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:03.209
<i>Boruto Uzumaki!</i>
<i>Are you here?</i>

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.578
(SHINO)
The minutes ticked by,

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.446
and still,
he wasn't showing up.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.414
Just when people
were starting to talk,

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.283
something unbelievable
happened.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.957
<i>[ohh's and ahh's]</i>

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.532
<i>[sigh of relief]</i>
<i>We made it.</i>

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:35.542
<i>Boruto Uzumaki has arrived</i>
<i>on the scene, ya know!</i>

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:40.446
<i>B‐Boruto...</i>

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.215
(MOEGI)
[chuckle]

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:44.618
Now that was
a flashy entrance!

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.486
(UDON) It's nothing
to laugh about, Moegi!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.721
I was so appalled...

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.523
I was certain my heart
would stop!

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:51.024
(KONOHAMARU)
That stunt of his

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.694
was the worst incident in
the history of the Academy.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:56.763
If getting into mischief
is the sign of a good Hokage,

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.399
Boruto will easily
surpass Lord Seventh!

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.568
(MOEGI) That's hardly
something to brag about.

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.103
Now that you brought it up,

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.006
who ended up footing the bill
for all of those repairs?

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.407
(SHINO)
There were no issues.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.711
The Kaminarimon Company
paid for everything.

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:12.212
(KONOHAMARU)
It was never publicized,

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.847
but that whole thing happened

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.116
because Denki was rebelling
against his father.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.417
His father had forced him

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.485
into the Academy's
ninjutsu program...

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.755
and Denki just didn't
want to be there.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.423
(MOEGI)
If he was so set against it,

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.759
why did he decide to
continue on in the academy?

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.528
(KONOHAMARU)
I'm not sure exactly.

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:29.195
But once he met Boruto,

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.665
he decided he did want to
become a ninja.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.200
You mean Denki
from my team?

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:35.636
I didn't know that happened.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.904
How could you not
know about it?!

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:41.174
Denki wasn't the only one.
Iwabe got in trouble, too.

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.109
They both got in trouble
with Boruto.

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:44.545
Huh, really?

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.713
<i>I don't wanna be</i>
<i>your little friend,</i>

00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:48.148
<i>Hokage's boy.</i>

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:48.481
<i>[grunt]</i>

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.018
(KONOHAMARU)
Iwabe was really frustrated.

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.219
He had the physical skills,

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:55.255
but his grades were
so low back then

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.423
that he kept having to repeat.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.060
<i>But if I have to,</i>
<i>I'll take you on!</i>

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:03.664
<i>[grunts]</i>

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:06.833
<i>[grunts]</i>

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:09.803
<i>[grunts]</i>

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.739
(UDON) I had heard that
he had a temper

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:14.307
during his years
at the Academy.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.410
But actually taking part
in a duel...!

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.146
There was nothing about
that in any of his files.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.883
(SHINO) We try not to include
too many negative details

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:23.884
in a student's record.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:24.885
Because...

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:25.986
(UDON)
Uh, of course,

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.153
I understand why you would
want to do that!

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:28.488
(KONOHAMARU)
[chuckle]

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.323
Well, you rarely went to
observe the students

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:32.392
while they were training
at the Academy, Udon.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:36.029
(UDON) I‐I was busy and
had a lot of things to do!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:39.633
And sometimes, it's better
to not have any prior contact

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:42.903
or information that might
cloud your judgment.

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:45.972
Besides, we've had
no problems with Iwabe

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:47.473
of any kind since then.

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:50.076
(SHINO) Well, that is because
of his perseverance.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.277
After all...

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:52.946
he was willing to accept
Denki's help

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.549
in order to get through
the subjects he was weak in.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.485
<i>I'm not riding on</i>

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.722
<i>the Hokage's coattails!</i>

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:06.259
(KONOHAMARU)
By the way...

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.694
It was Boruto
who won that duel...

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:08.895
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.064
(MOEGI) That's really
nothing to brag about!

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.200
Because the truth is,

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:15.502
whenever there's an incident,

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:18.104
you will always find
Boruto Uzumaki

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:19.139
at the center of it!

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.607
I can't deny that.

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:23.076
Boruto is just like
Lord Seventh in that way.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.512
He has the same knack for
bringing people together.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.514
That's a polite way
of putting it.

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:28.882
(UDON)
Now that you mention it...

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.917
When the school building
got destroyed...

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.186
he was the catalyst
for that, too.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.120
(SHINO)
That's right.

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:34.521
Uh...

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.390
[gasp]
What's the matter, Shino?

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:38.124
Uh...

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:40.994
Oh, yes...

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:43.564
<i>(BORUTO)</i>
<i>Hey! Come on!</i>

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:44.831
<i>Drop that bun!</i>

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.399
<i>Sorry!</i>
<i>You snooze, you lose.</i>

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.634
(SHINO)
That time...

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.036
The problem started with
Boruto and Sarada

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.139
arguing over yakisoba buns.

00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:55.008
I figured we would turn
their confrontation

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.811
into a ninjutsu battle
at the new school

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:59.546
to help them understand
the different strengths

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.114
and weaknesses everyone has!

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:04.417
<i>All right!</i>

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.051
<i>Ready...</i>

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:06.753
<i>Begin!</i>

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:08.589
[<i>grunts and</i>
<i>heavy breathing</i>]

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:09.890
(UDON)
That took some resolve.

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:11.825
But everything
turned out fine, right?

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.459
(MOEGI)
Of course, it wasn't fine

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.295
or it wouldn't have
turned out like that!

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.063
(UDON)
Oh. I see...

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.967
(KONOHAMARU) Shino,
didn't you have paper bombs

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.736
planted throughout
the building?

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:23.770
(UDON)
Wait, what?!

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:24.805
Why would you do that?!

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.472
(SHINO)
Traps were set

00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:30.210
in order to make it
feel like a genuine battle.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.444
In hindsight,

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.547
I regret that
they may have been a bit

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.848
too powerful.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.249
(MOEGI)
Wasn't that part of the reason

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.918
that the building
was destroyed?

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.723
(KONOHAMARU)
Regardless...

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.691
the training was
still a success.

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.728
Even though they were new
at the Academy,

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:49.295
everyone worked hard.

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.865
They used the ninjutsu
their parents taught them...

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.167
as well as jutsu
and taijutsu skills

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.201
they had just learned.

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:57.403
And then...

00:08:57.437 --> 00:08:59.472
The girls got the upper hand
at first

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:01.241
and backed the boys
into a corner.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.609
It was do‐or‐die,

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.211
so Boruto's Shadow Clones
used their taijutsu

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:06.246
to get on the roof.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.417
However, the girls' team
managed to get to the roof

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:12.853
only seconds after them.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.722
[gasp]
And then what happened?!

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.057
Then this happened!

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.960
Boruto was forced to
take desperate measures!

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.029
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:25.465
(UDON)
A Summoning?!

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.900
He wasn't even a genin.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:28.468
Yet he used such
a high‐level jutsu?

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:29.736
(SHINO)
In class,

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.038
I had gone over
the basics of Summoning.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.776
I didn't teach them
exactly how to use it.

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.778
(UDON) So does that mean
he failed then?

00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:39.179
(KONOHAMARU)
That's the thing.

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:42.683
Something terrible
was indeed summoned...

00:09:42.716 --> 00:09:45.385
(MOEGI) Huh?
Don't tell me it was‐‐!

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.053
(KONOHAMARU)
Yup, you guessed it.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:47.888
It was Nue.

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:51.658
Still, I don't believe
Boruto was successful

00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:52.959
with his summoning.

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:55.061
It's more like his chakra
went haywire

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.864
and some of it flowed
into the outside world.

00:09:57.898 --> 00:09:59.666
Just a coincidence really.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.769
I didn't even understand
what it was at the time.

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.738
‐ [hiss]
‐ Ahhh!

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.774
<i>Rasengan!</i>

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:15.816
(MOEGI)
Oh, please,

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:18.118
I don't care about
what you did that day!

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.386
Because the school
still got leveled.

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:22.689
So then...

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:24.024
Are you saying

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.492
that's the first time
Nue ever appeared?

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:27.460
Well, no one told me that!

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:28.995
(KONOHAMARU)
Yeah.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.898
We didn't want to panic
anyone, so we kept it quiet.

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:33.767
But once Sai knew about it,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.503
he started
an immediate investigation.

00:10:36.537 --> 00:10:38.204
<i>Nu...e...</i>

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.411
(KONOHAMARU)
Danzo's dark legacy...

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:46.980
Nue.

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:50.116
(MOEGI) I couldn't believe
such a thing still existed.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.153
It sent shivers down my spine
when I heard about it.

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:54.487
(KONOHAMARU) Yeah...

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:58.224
The monster was created out of
the Foundation's hatred‐‐

00:10:58.258 --> 00:10:59.760
Danzo's hatred.

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:01.728
It crossed through time
to be resurrected.

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:02.929
And then...

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.831
it tried to destroy
the village.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:06.867
(MOEGI) Originally,
it was a living bomb...

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.870
developed specifically
to protect the Hidden Leaf.

00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:12.973
How ironic that it would
attack the village instead.

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.543
(KONOHAMARU) We have to
thank Lord Sixth,

00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:18.745
Sai and the Barrier Team
for their efforts.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.013
Because of them,

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:22.616
the worst‐case scenario
was averted.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:23.684
But it was still a close call.

00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:24.918
(UDON)
And to think

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.220
the daughter
of Tanuki Shigaraki...

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:30.290
Sumire Kakei brought it
into the village.

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:32.358
She blended in with
the other students and‐‐

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.595
(SHINO)
She's not to blame...

00:11:34.628 --> 00:11:35.562
[sniff]

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:36.496
Hm?

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.097
Ah!

00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:40.233
(SHINO) She was
a victim of circumstance,

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:42.869
molded by the environment
she grew up in.

00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:46.072
There is nothing wrong
with her character.

00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:47.373
As her teacher,

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:49.510
I know that better
than anyone.

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:51.177
Uh! I apologize.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.246
I didn't mean to single
her out for criticism.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.648
I was out of line

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.783
to insinuate she acted
from personal malice.

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:59.019
Udon knows that
it wasn't her fault.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.754
All of us know what
she's gone through.

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:01.688
‐ Mhm!
‐ Mhm!

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:03.924
<i>[inhale and exhale]</i>

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:06.126
<i>[gasp]</i>

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:14.134
<i>[deep breath]</i>

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.403
<i>I'm back!</i>

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:18.905
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.541
(KONOHAMARU) Boruto and
the others aren't affected

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:24.344
by old prejudices and have
accepted Sumire completely.

00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:26.947
Having them as friends
has been her salvation.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.416
So there's no need to worry
about her anymore.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.184
<i>[chuckle]</i>

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:34.521
<i>[quivering breath]</i>

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.433
(UDON) So everything's back
to the way it was.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:48.935
But ever since
that happened...

00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:50.504
Poor Shino's had to cut back,

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:52.806
and now, he can only afford
instant noodles for lunch.

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.207
Huh? You're kidding!

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.008
[chuckle]

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:57.010
You're too gullible, Moegi!

00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:58.344
[sigh]
You got me.

00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:00.547
‐ Don't scare me like that!
‐ [chuckles]

00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:02.516
That event was unimportant.

00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:03.650
‐ Huh?
‐ For real?!

00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:05.451
The incident united them.

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:07.721
It raised morale
of the students.

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.122
They accepted each other.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:10.791
They became better friends.

00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:12.926
And they began to
work more diligently.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.227
<i>Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!</i>

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:19.232
(SHINO) Shikadai Nara...
the heir to the Nara Clan.

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:21.802
He uses the jutsu passed down
from his father

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.303
and has a sharp intellect.

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:26.106
(MOEGI) In the past,
he'd shown a lack of ambition.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.274
But lately, it seems
something's happened to him

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.310
that really changed
his demeanor.

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:35.081
<i>Ninja Art:</i>
<i>Super Beast Scroll!</i>

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.287
(SHINO)
Inojin Yamanaka.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.557
He's mastered
the Super Beast Scroll jutsu

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.224
perfected by Sai.

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:48.128
(MOEGI) But like Sai,
he can be very sarcastic,

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.130
which could earn him
some enemies.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.433
It would be great
if he could tone that down.

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:56.136
<i>Partial Expansion Jutsu!</i>

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.604
(SHINO)
Cho‐Cho Akimichi.

00:13:57.638 --> 00:13:58.805
She's already mastered

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:01.207
the Akimichi Clan's
Expansion Jutsu.

00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:03.309
(MOEGI) I believe
her personal motto is

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.046
"Life can't be bound
by calories!"

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:08.882
I'll admit I kind of
envy her fearlessness!

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:13.419
The Ino‐Shika‐Cho trio...

00:14:13.453 --> 00:14:14.287
For this generation.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.488
Quite impressive!

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.158
A group of subordinates
you can be proud of.

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.528
The members of my team
work hard as well.

00:14:21.562 --> 00:14:23.429
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wall!</i>

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:27.500
(SHINO)
Iwabe Yuino.

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.936
It took some time,
but he's starting to show

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.238
the true scope
of his potential.

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:33.974
(MOEGI)
Repeating paid off.

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:36.943
Having to study the same thing
over and over again

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.445
gave him a very solid
foundation in jutsu.

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.447
(KONOHAMARU) It's admirable
that he stayed so tenacious

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:43.950
despite having to be
a repeat repeater.

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:46.152
(UDON) [sniff] Could you
please stop talking about

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.821
repeating and repeaters?!

00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:50.691
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:51.858
(SHINO)
Metal Lee.

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:53.894
He is proficient in taijutsu,

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.095
works very hard

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:57.831
and gets excellent grades.

00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.733
(UDON) But in regard
to his mental toughness,

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.301
he has a long way to go.

00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:03.236
<i>[grunt]</i>

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:05.471
(SHINO)
Denki Kaminarimon...

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:07.541
I think he has shown
the most dramatic growth

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.609
among all the genin.

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:11.377
But I predict
his fine intellect

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.747
will be his main asset
in the future.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.316
(MOEGI) His other two team
members act without thinking.

00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:17.784
He'll be like
the command center

00:15:17.818 --> 00:15:19.686
that keeps them under control.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.987
(UDON)
Well, yeah...

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.723
Though you could put it
more kindly.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.792
(MOEGI) But Iwabe might still
be repeating again and again

00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:27.728
if it weren't for this kid,
right?

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:28.995
(SHINO)
Can't deny that.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:31.064
(UDON) The two of you
are really harsh!

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:33.499
And finally,

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:36.069
there's Konohamaru's team
of troublemakers.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.604
Eh...!
They're not troublemakers,

00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:39.305
they're just misunderstood!

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:41.041
(SHINO)
First, we have Mitsuki.

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:43.209
He definitely has real skills.

00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:45.579
He's already mastered
countless types of jutsu.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:46.647
<i>Wind Style: Breakthrough!</i>

00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:57.558
<i>Snake Lightning!</i>

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:01.695
(KONOHAMARU) However, he is
a child of many mysteries.

00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:02.929
Even I still don't know

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:05.298
a whole lot about him
or his past.

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:07.868
(SHINO) [gasp] Oh what?
You don't know...?

00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:09.002
(KONOHAMARU) Huh? Know what?

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:10.203
(MOEGI)
I don't know either!

00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:12.773
(SHINO) I see...
Then let's move on.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.108
(KONOHAMARU)
Hey, hold on there!

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.777
(SHINO)
Sarada Uchiha.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.278
<i>I don't think so!</i>

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.412
<i>Chaaa‐‐‐!</i>

00:16:20.614 --> 00:16:22.916
(SHINO) She's Sasuke
and Sakura's daughter.

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:25.986
So naturally,
she excels at everything.

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:27.187
(KONOHAMARU)
She awakened her Sharingan

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.689
quite some time ago.

00:16:28.722 --> 00:16:32.325
Plus, she's inherited
her mother's great strength.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.327
She still needs to build up
her stamina,

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.462
but her future is
full of promise.

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.835
<i>Wind Style: Gale Palm!</i>

00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:43.604
<i>[grunt]</i>
<i>Take this!</i>

00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:44.838
<i>Lethal...</i>

00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:45.906
<i>Boruto...</i>

00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:47.207
<i>Stream!</i>

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.011
(SHINO) And finally...
Boruto Uzumaki.

00:16:51.044 --> 00:16:52.546
He has a lot of issues.

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:56.182
However, in terms of ninjutsu,
taijutsu and intellect...

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:59.753
he has demonstrated skills
only a prodigy could possess.

00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:01.021
During the field trip...

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.956
he stuck his nose into
a sensitive issue

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:05.959
for the Land of Water
and then settled it.

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.894
Even what happened with Nue...

00:17:07.928 --> 00:17:09.395
Sumire resolved
that situation

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:12.098
only after Boruto stepped in.

00:17:12.132 --> 00:17:13.667
(KONOHAMARU) No matter
what else you think about him,

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.335
his abilities are no joke!

00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:20.273
I see. So obviously

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:23.944
So obviously, he'll be taking
the Chunin Exams. Right?

00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:24.678
[gasps]

00:17:27.814 --> 00:17:29.049
(MOEGI)
Konohamaru?

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:41.261
You're not gonna let him
take the Chunin Exams?!

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:43.864
I haven't made
my final decision yet.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:46.132
But I'm on the fence about it.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:47.701
What do you think
I should do?

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.537
I think you should
let him take it, of course!

00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:52.005
[sniff]
Me too.

00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:54.174
If the students want to
take the exam,

00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:55.909
I think they should do it.

00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:56.442
[hiccup]

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.380
So what's making you hesitate?

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.381
[sigh]

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:06.086
This year's rookies
are basically all prodigies.

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:07.888
Especially Boruto.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.155
He doesn't want people
to think of him

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:11.424
only as the son
of the great Hokage.

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:14.327
So he tries to show up
his father all the time.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.162
If any other kid
acted like that,

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:18.264
you'd expect him
to fail miserably.

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:19.833
But he has this unusual knack

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:23.904
of overcoming every setback
and obstacle in his way.

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.405
(SHINO)
That's certainly true.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.307
Even during the Genin Exam...

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.943
when he was backed
into a corner by Lord Sixth,

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:31.111
he figured out a solution.

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:33.714
(KONOHAMARU)
When he went to file an appeal

00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:35.115
to change to another team.

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:38.084
He outwitted Mirai,
a higher ranked chunin!

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.753
And during their very
first mission,

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.188
he and his team members
brought down their enemy,

00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:46.192
even though he was
a powerful Rogue Ninja.

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:47.594
(MOEGI)
That's amazing!

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:49.563
So what's the problem
with him then?

00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:53.433
<i>Your time is up!</i>

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.568
<i>Cha‐‐!</i>

00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:57.337
But in each case,

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.673
he was lucky
to come out ahead!

00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:01.141
To become more powerful,

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:03.176
it's essential for shinobi
to face strength

00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:05.478
that totally outmatches
their own.

00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:07.047
They really haven't
been challenged.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.014
They're weak.

00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:08.882
Hm.

00:19:08.915 --> 00:19:10.416
I can't argue with that.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.184
C'mon.

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:12.318
That's all the more reason

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.454
they need to take
the Chunin Exams!

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.089
And if they can't
cut it there,

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:18.592
then maybe they'll realize
how naive they are.

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:19.392
No way!

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:21.161
The exam could crush them.

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.663
They might never
fully recover.

00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:23.897
Huh?!

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.498
That's what
you're worried about?!

00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:27.233
If that's all it takes
to crush them...

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:29.235
then go ahead
and crush 'em!

00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:30.771
Hey! There you are!

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:33.406
I just can't do it!

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:34.541
Whoops.

00:19:34.575 --> 00:19:36.977
I guess I came
at exactly the wrong time.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.947
Actually, Konohamaru needs
help with a dilemma, Hanabi!

00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:41.948
Ah...

00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:46.953
[gulping and big breath]

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:49.723
I totally get what you're
going through, Konohamaru!

00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:52.425
Oh yeah! You get what
I'm getting at, Hanabi?

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:54.695
How in the world did
we end up like this?

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:56.697
Oh I get you all right!

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.133
Just the mere thought of
something happening to Boruto

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:03.504
fills me with worry
and unrelenting dread!

00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:04.738
Because,

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:07.674
that Boruto's such
a good natured, honest kid.

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.009
(HANABI) Whenever
we see each other,

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.243
he calls me "Big Sis."

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:12.913
And it's just
the sweetest thing ever!

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:16.216
[gulps]

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:19.119
That reminds me of
something else about him!

00:20:19.152 --> 00:20:20.554
(KONOHAMARU)
It makes me so happy

00:20:20.587 --> 00:20:23.356
when he calls me
"Big Bro Konohamaru."

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:25.325
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>Big Brother Konohamaru.</i>

00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:26.760
And another thing!

00:20:26.793 --> 00:20:30.096
Big Bro Naruto has
entrusted Boruto to my care

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.265
and he's become
my precious kid brother!

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:34.034
Oh, wise Konohamaru!

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.069
I'm touched
by your strong emotions.

00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:39.039
You obviously care
about Boruto so much.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:39.973
[giggles]

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:41.241
This is stupid.

00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:42.576
The only reason
you don't want to

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:44.077
let him take the Chunin Exam

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.979
is because
you're overprotective.

00:20:46.012 --> 00:20:48.281
Fine.
Call me overprotective!

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:49.716
Yeah, That's right!

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.052
Aren't you gonna
say anything, Udon?!

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.387
[snores]

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.358
Come on! Aren't you gonna
back me up, Shino?!

00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.528
Well, I suggest discussing
this when everyone's sober.

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:03.730
You're on our side,
right, Shino?

00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:04.831
Come on.

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:06.733
Here, have a little a drink.

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:08.635
No, thanks.
I don't drink alcohol.

00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:11.371
Aren't you concerned
about Boruto's well‐being?

00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:12.773
Sure.
It's not that‐‐

00:21:12.806 --> 00:21:15.609
‐ Then have a drink with us!
‐ [grunts]

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.412
[grunts]
I'm so sorry.

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.882
[gasps] Is everything
all right, Shino Sensei?!

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.987
Hey! Why do you ask?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.354
Uh, isn't the reason

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:29.923
Shino Sensei
doesn't drink because...

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.491
Yeah.

00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:36.062
It's 'cause he can't control
the insects inside of him.

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:36.797
[hiccup]

00:21:37.764 --> 00:21:39.199
Hm? What was‐‐?

00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:40.366
[screams]

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.835
Sensei, get ahold of‐‐

00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:43.236
[screams]

00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:46.507
[screams]

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.842
(NARUTO)
Hello, Hokage's office.

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:50.511
Yeah, I just got back.

00:21:50.544 --> 00:21:54.548
What?! You mean Shino's
insects are outta control?!

00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:56.349
What the heck is going on?

00:21:56.382 --> 00:21:58.384
I never even got
to sleep last night.

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:00.787
Uh.

00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:01.988
(NARUTO)
What do you mean he's been

00:22:02.022 --> 00:22:03.924
discussing the Chunin Exams?

00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:05.859
Since this afternoon?!

00:22:05.892 --> 00:22:06.993
[sighs]

00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.361
(NARUTO)
Ugh, it doesn't matter!

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:09.896
I'm heading out there
right now!

00:23:44.691 --> 00:23:46.860
(BORUTO) Hmph. It was all
just like I thought.

00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:48.294
That stupid old man!

00:23:48.328 --> 00:23:49.696
Of course, it's not like
I had my hopes up

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.097
that he'd actually be here,
anyway.

00:23:51.131 --> 00:23:52.633
(SARADA) There must have been
an emergency.

00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:54.400
I mean, he is the Hokage.

00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:55.969
(BORUTO) Sure.
I guess it was so important

00:23:56.002 --> 00:23:59.239
that Lord Hokage couldn't help
but blow off my birthday.

00:23:59.272 --> 00:24:00.774
(SARADA) Boruto...

00:24:00.807 --> 00:24:03.109
(BORUTO) I honestly don't care
if it's for me, but...

00:24:03.143 --> 00:24:07.347
(SARADA) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.949
"Boruto's Birthday!"

00:24:08.982 --> 00:24:11.785
(BORUTO) You'd better come
home for Himawari's birthday!
