WEBVTT

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:13.313
That thing is awfully small...

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.114
[gasp]

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.251
(SASUKE) <i>I'd be hard-pressed to</i>
<i>even call it a Rasengan.</i>

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.552
[grunts]

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.586
But the basics are-

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.320
Damn it!

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:27.895
Ah, I see! That is a difficult
situation...

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:32.099
But you're lucky you ran into
me, 'cause I have just the
thing...

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.968
You'll get exceptionally good
results, trust me.

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:41.308
With this ninja tool, you'll be
what every shinobi of your
generation wants to be!

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.311
Don't you agree?

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.115
[gasp]

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.117
If you have this...

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:55.522
...Fire Style, Wind Style, even
the Rasengan are at your
fingertips.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:01:01.094
Now... Let's choose the ultimate
technique that's perfect for
you, young Lord!

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:50.137
Damn it...

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:53.507
I just can't get it to bend!

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.178
Rasengan!

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.986
Well? So?

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:07.588
Hmmm...

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:14.394
And you managed all that from
just one day of training, huh?

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:18.031
[chuckle] I'm not like my dad!
I've got serious skills, you
know!

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.169
It seems you are quite different
from Naruto.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.139
Fine. You can be my student.

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.576
[chuckle]

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:32.412
[grunt]

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.319
You came all the way here just
to tell me that?

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:45.158
That's right. Your subordinate
will be under my care. We'll
need to submit a notification...

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.162
Hm. Thank you very much.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.364
Hm...?

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.100
(KONOHAMARU) <i>Boruto admires you</i>
<i>a lot...</i>

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.803
...the exact opposite of how he
feels about his father.

00:03:56.837 --> 00:04:01.241
He probably feels that Lord
Seventh doesn't acknowledge him
and treats him like a child...

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:03.343
and that's why Boruto's
rebelling against him.

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.550
I've never seen Boruto as
determined and focused as he's
been lately...

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.986
Hmph. Well, anyway... I leave
him in your hands.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.657
You're wrong.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.894
When it comes to raising a
child, I have no right to say
anything against anyone else.

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:23.263
But I will accept him as
my student.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:27.801
Uh... Is something the
matter...?

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:30.003
I hear you've been really good
to Sarada.

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:34.374
Mm. [gasp]

00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:35.342
[chuckle]

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:40.514
I wish the two of them would
just come to the front door for
a change, though...

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:46.553
[sipping] Ah.

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:50.123
Hey, Sensei...? Can you tell me
everything you know about my
dad?

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:57.631
Back when he was a kid, he just
went around saying he'd be
Hokage one day.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.266
He was quite the loser.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:04:59.633
A loser...?!

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.302
Yeah, and stubborn as hell, too.

00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:03.170
No, not that!

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.007
What I wanna know is... like
what are my dad's weaknesses?

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.109
Weaknesses?

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.411
Yeah! Does he have any?

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:15.883
Oh, yeah; plenty. I don't have
enough fingers on my hands to
count them all.

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:16.149
Huh?

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:22.022
(SASUKE) <i>Listen, he was full of</i>
<i>weaknesses. He was a</i>
<i>good-for-nothing.</i>

00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:25.626
Uhhh...

00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:31.765
(SASUKE) <i>But he pulled himself</i>
<i>up with his own strength and</i>
<i>became the Hokage.</i>

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:37.304
What you need to know now isn't
the current Naruto, but the
Naruto who made it this far.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.338
Mm.

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:40.974
What does that mean?

00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:47.981
(KONOHAMARU) <i>No-</i>

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.416
<i>No way!</i>

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:52.452
Alright!

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:55.255
I'm not gonna lose to him, no
matter what.

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.257
[grunts]

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.025
Oh...!

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.494
[gasps] Huh?

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.829
Hey, guys! You're really
training hard, huh?

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.666
What's going on, Sarada? You
spying on us?

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.269
What're you talking about? I
don't do that kind of thing...

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:12.739
Wait, why? Is there a reason I
should be spying on you?

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:16.076
[growl] I will not stand for you
saying such things!

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.112
Yeah, that's right! We're all
out here training really hard!

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:22.349
We're not going to lose! To you
<i>or to Boruto!</i>

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.550
[chuckle]

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:26.720
Oh, yeah? You guys have gotten
pretty bold!

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:28.555
[cowering]

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.724
(SARADA) <i>Well, I'm looking</i>
<i>forward to it.</i>

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:31.425
Huh?!

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:36.597
I mean getting to battle all of
you! [chuckle] We're not gonna
lose either!

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.297
That sounds great!

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:37.631
Alright!

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:39.199
We'll be ready for ya.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.001
[chattering]

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:43.937
As long as we're participating,
we should try to win!

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:44.505
[sipping]

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:46.707
B-But, uh...

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.877
That might mean that we're just
going to end up having to fight
against each other...

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.246
Well, I'm really looking
forward to it!

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.415
I just can't wait to fight
against everyone that we know!

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.218
We've all worked hard to get
where we are...

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.587
Boruto's fighting style centers
around close-quarter combat...

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.925
so it's best to use a
long-distance attack to inflict
damage and slow him down.

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.295
Against Sarad's Sharingan, it's
important to avoid looking into
her eyes...

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:13.767
The best move is to stay hidden
and then surprise her from her
blind side. As for Mitsuki...

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.735
Sumire...

00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:18.205
Uh, do you think about stuff
like that all the time?

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.607
'Cause it's sorta scary...!

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.309
[nervous laugh]

00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:23.977
[grunt]

00:07:24.978 --> 00:07:26.880
Is that really all you've got?

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:31.218
Cho-Cho, take the lead this
time, and Inojin, you back her
up from behind.

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:34.254
Hey, what's up?! How come you're
acting so eager lately?

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:38.592
Oh? So you don't care if you
lose to Boruto's team, then?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.060
I'm not down with that.

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:44.264
Come on. No one really wants to
see me lose my composer, do
they?

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:47.334
Ha! Alright then, quit
complaining and get moving!

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:48.135
Incoming!

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:53.340
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:54.474
[roars]

00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:55.442
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:58.545
[roars]

00:07:58.579 --> 00:07:59.179
[determined grunt]

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:03.083
Yes!

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:07.588
[gasp]

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:10.824
And you were so close, too!

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:13.093
[straining groans]

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:16.396
[pained grunts and groans]

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.966
Alright, let's just call it
quits for today.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.000
Damn it!

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.604
Honestly, you should've started
taking this more seriously
earlier.

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:29.109
This time, Gaara's genin will be
participating, too. YOu'll have
many rivals.

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:33.747
I know that Lord Gaara
is the Kazekage, but he's your
younger brother too, right...

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.348
Auntie Temari?

00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:38.385
Yes, that's right. He's also
adopted a son.

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:42.055
I met the boy recently and
sensed extraordinary chakra in
him.

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.457
[worried gasps and groans]

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.094
He said that he's going to take
part in the Chunin Exams.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:50.030
At this rate, you have no chance
<i>against him.</i>

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:00.340
[grunt]

00:09:03.577 --> 00:09:06.446
[groan] <i>Damn it!</i>

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.150
I can't bend it at all! I can't
be wasting my time with this
kinda training!

00:09:10.184 --> 00:09:14.054
I just have to bring down my
dad, no matter what it takes.

00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:17.157
[sigh]

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:29.136
[grunt]

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:34.975
Amazing!

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.347
He's right, this Scientific
Ninja Tool's great! [chuckle]

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:51.191
[grunt]

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:21.755
It's finally time!

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.258
[grunt] Good luck! Do your best!

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:26.426
You're energetic this morning,
Mom.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.265
Is it Dad coming home after such
a long time that's making you so
happy?

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:34.935
What?! No! Don't be silly! It's
silly how silly you're being!

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:38.238
Just give it up mom. I
can tell these things.

00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:39.339
Uh...

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:41.742
Anyway, I'm outta here!

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.779
[chuckle] You're just as happy
he's back, Sarada.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.147
[chuckle]

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:57.958
[chattering]

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.661
So, you convinced my
Dad, huh, Boruto?

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:02.996
Yeah! Of course!

00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:06.266
Well, then...

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.702
What are you gonna do now that
you've become my Dad's student?

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:11.405
[chuckle] I'll learn all about
my dad's weaknesses.

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:12.039
What?!

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.141
[sigh and inhale]

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.643
Look, I don't mean to criticize
you or anything...

00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:17.578
Mm?

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.280
But before you challenge the
Lord Hokage...

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:24.251
I think that we'd better become
chunin at least, ya get it?!

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.286
That's exactly why I wanna
train!

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.789
I wanna learn a lot from Uncle
Sasuke.

00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:32.392
And then I can show it off
during the Chunin Exams...

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:35.529
...My power that's gonna topple
my dad someday!

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.497
You mean "our" power!

00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:40.501
Seriously... what are you
thinking with all this?

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:42.503
What do you mean by that?!

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:47.407
It's obvious! I'm thinkin' we're
gonna come out on top at the
Chunin Exams.

00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:47.975
[gasp]

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:55.115
I don't mean to sound overly
critical of you or anything...

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.951
But sometimes, you're not that
bad.

00:11:57.985 --> 00:12:00.254
And please don't forget about
me, okay?

00:12:00.287 --> 00:12:00.587
Hmmm?

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:03.156
(BORUTO) <i>Mitsuki!</i>

00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:19.173
(MOMOSHIKI) <i>This one's bad, too?</i>

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:21.441
(KINSHIKI) <i>So it seems.</i>

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:26.180
Not a single one of Kaguya's
scrolls remain.

00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:28.649
[growl]

00:12:28.682 --> 00:12:30.584
(URASHIKI) <i>Lord Momoshiki!</i>

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:32.452
You're still here, huh?

00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:35.255
How's the search for the Chakra
Fruit coming along?

00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:40.327
It's been so long since we've
seen each other, and that's all
you have to say?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.727
[annoyed grunt]

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.730
Okay. Yes, yes. Of course, I
checked into it.

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:50.871
(MOMOSHIKI) <i>That's the region</i>
<i>Kaguya was in charge of?</i>

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:53.440
I can't wait to get ahold of
that chakra...

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.377
Ah! Hey, wait a minute. You're
going already?!

00:12:58.478 --> 00:12:59.379
[gasp] Hey!

00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:07.020
I see that you're as unsociable
as ever... my dear Momo...

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:14.795
You mean the chakra of the
Divine Tree

00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:18.298
was dispersed and has taken the
shape of nine monsters?

00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:21.935
That's right. The people down
there call them the Tailed
Beasts.

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:26.573
And the ones who took these
Tailed beasts into their bodies
are known as Jinchuriki.

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:30.377
Hmmm... So... these "Jinchuriki"
possess chakra?

00:13:31.512 --> 00:13:34.648
Correct! And not just possess
it. For some reason...

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.551
these Jinchuriki have tremendous
amounts of it.

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:41.922
Hmmm... So they keep Tailed
Beasts inside their bodies to
amass chakra.

00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:45.993
The people here do
very strange things...

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:48.262
Right now, there are two
Jinchuriki...

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:52.466
...Eight Tails inside Killer Bee
and Nine Tails in Naruto.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:58.138
These creatures... They may be
vulgar, but I do sense enormous
chakra.

00:13:58.172 --> 00:14:00.340
(NARUTO) <i>At the ruins connected</i>
<i>to Kaguya...</i>

00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:03.777
we're beginning to see more and
more movement of White Zetsu.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.415
The two that Sasuke reported
about, the ones who seem to be
from the Otsutsuki Clan...

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:12.653
No matter how you slice it, they
seem to be connected to all
that.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:16.089
Let me get this straight: to
resist some kind of threat...

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:18.125
Kaguya had the White Zetsu
prepared...

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:20.961
And now they're starting to
become active, which means...

00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:23.030
...that the threat is getting
closer...

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.032
Hmmm...

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.171
Hm?

00:14:31.972 --> 00:14:34.474
This one's a Jinchuriki?

00:14:34.508 --> 00:14:37.311
He definitely possesses
tremendous chakra.

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:39.580
Just like the fellow with the
Rinnegan...

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:42.983
this one appears to have an
extraordinary amount of power,
too.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:48.255
Yeah, that's right! I'm a
Jinchuriki! I have the power of
a hundred men, you see!

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:51.859
Killer Bee of the Eight Tails,
that's me! Ya feel me?

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:55.195
Haaa! Fool, ya fool! Awww,
yeah!

00:14:58.198 --> 00:15:02.236
Hey, c'mon. Get serious. They
<i>seem to be pretty nasty...</i>

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:05.439
They're ignoring me? What? For
real?

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:07.174
He's quite irritating...

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:10.310
Now... I shall take you.

00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:10.711
Huh?

00:15:19.653 --> 00:15:20.487
[gasp]

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:29.496
Awww, yeah!

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:30.397
Ah...

00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:32.633
The Tailed Beast..

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.003
Ahhh!

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:41.008
Huh?!

00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:01.161
Imagine that...

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:05.165
To find what we seek in the form
of an unsightly beast.

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:08.001
<i>Tailed Beast Bomb!</i>

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:10.170
You mean you're still able to
move...?

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:22.182
[gasp]

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:27.454
<i>That guy absorbed the Tailed</i>
<i>Beast Bomb so easily!</i>

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:31.425
I was just about to go see
Naruto, but what an obstacle,
yo!

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:34.795
When it comes to Tailed Beasts,
I'm his mentor, ya know?

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.964
<i>It's no time to be rapping!</i>

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.065
Well, my, my...

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:42.202
I guess that we'll just have to
retrieve it one by one then.

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:49.376
<i>What's that?!</i>

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:55.616
Magnifying your jutsu as easy as
that is cheating! It looks like
my victory is fleeting...

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.986
I'll send it back twice as
strong.

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:02.322
Ahhh!

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.126
Well, that wasn't too hard...

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:42.462
If Kaguya had just produced a
Divine Tree in this region...

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:45.933
it would've spared us from
having to go through all this
trouble.

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:50.470
It seems that Kaguya developed
an attachment to someone on this
planet and betrayed us...

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:54.007
And even more than that... she
bore his children.

00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:56.777
Huh!...

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.779
She disgraced our clan.

00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:03.517
That must be why the chakra she
was supposed to provide us with
never came.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.184
Yes.

00:18:05.953 --> 00:18:09.923
Kaguya betrayed us and feared
our existence so much that she
even tried building living...

00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:12.025
weapons to use against us.

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:16.630
But ultimately, she was stopped
by her very own children, who
sealed her away.

00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:18.465
[chuckle]

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:19.032
Hmmm?

00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:23.403
Then they saved me the trouble
of having to punish Kaguya
myself...

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:27.541
And for doing that, I do have to
commend the vulgar creatures...

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:29.176
(KINSHIKI) [chuckle] <i>Yes...</i>

00:18:31.979 --> 00:18:34.515
Is that all you have?

00:18:34.548 --> 00:18:38.285
Now, now... There's still
another Jinchuriki left.

00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:42.456
Lord Momoshiki, there's an even
greater reverberation to the
east.

00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:47.194
I believe the massive
accumulation of chakra we seek
is there.

00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:50.631
[chuckle]

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.441
The Chunin Exams finally start
tomorrow. Are you all mentally
prepared?

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:03.844
Yes, sir!

00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:09.416
We three swear to you that we'll
win... I promise you that we
will not dishonor your name...

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:10.017
Father.

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:12.920
Just try to relax a bit, Shinki.

00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:13.453
[gasp]

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:20.160
You really shouldn't be focusing
on me right now... but on your
rivals from the other villages.

00:19:20.194 --> 00:19:22.362
Other villages won't be a
problem.

00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:23.197
[chuckle]

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:29.169
Never mind. In any case, make
sure to get plenty of rest on
the Thunder Train.

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:30.370
Yes, sir.

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:33.640
Take care of them.

00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:36.743
I'll set out as soon as I've
completed my duties.

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:40.848
I should reach the Hidden Leaf
Village around the start of
Round Two.

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:45.619
Yeah, I got it. I'll make sure
to visit Temari when I arrive
there.

00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:46.620
Yes...

00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:55.262
<i>Gaara!</i>

00:19:55.295 --> 00:19:59.199
[grunt] Wait, is that...
Shukaku?

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.771
It's been a while... You never
initiate contact...

00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:09.142
[cackle] <i>Which just goes to show</i>
<i>this is important!</i>

00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:14.414
<i>My connection with the Eight</i>
<i>Tails was suddenly cut off.</i>
<i>Something is up.</i>

00:20:14.448 --> 00:20:18.018
And is it only with the Eight
Tails this is happening?

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:24.024
Yeah. I'm still connected with
Naruto and the others. But I
have a bad feeling about this...

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.225
I see...

00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:30.564
So anyway, I warned you. How you
deal with is from here on is
<i>up to you!</i>

00:20:30.597 --> 00:20:32.633
I'm grateful, my friend.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.002
[cackle]

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:46.613
How's that, huh?

00:20:46.647 --> 00:20:49.750
So you're able to bend it a
little bit now.

00:20:49.783 --> 00:20:51.151
That's the next one.

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:51.485
Huh?

00:20:52.953 --> 00:20:56.456
(SASUKE) <i>And I want you to go</i>
around the other target to hit
<i>it.</i>

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.758
What?! No way!

00:20:57.791 --> 00:21:00.194
That's impossible. There's no
chance it can hit--!

00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:04.031
Huh?

00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:10.771
No fair! I mean, if I had that,
even I could've-!

00:21:10.804 --> 00:21:15.709
That was just one example. There
are likely countless other ways.

00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:17.411
Don't expect an immediate
answer.

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:20.113
Just try to use your own head a
little.

00:21:20.147 --> 00:21:23.617
[grunt] Yeah, I know...

00:21:29.189 --> 00:21:32.025
(KATASUKE) <i>You will win for</i>
<i>sure... Young Lord!</i>

00:21:36.997 --> 00:21:38.198
Don't worry...

00:21:39.566 --> 00:21:42.703
When you're in a bind, this
ninja tool will come to your
rescue.

00:21:42.736 --> 00:21:44.671
There's no need to worry at all!

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:01.622
The Chunin Exams start
tomorrow...

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:07.394
And I swear I am not gonna lose!

00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:45.292
(SHIKAMARU) <i>Right here and</i>
<i>now...</i>

00:23:45.325 --> 00:23:48.896
you're all being given the rare
opportunity to battle against
<i>ninja from other villages.</i>

00:23:48.929 --> 00:23:52.566
<i>Remember to freely</i>
demonstrate the fruits of your
<i>training!</i>

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:56.703
(SHINKI) <i>Hmph! I wish I had the</i>
chance to demonstrate my true

00:23:56.737 --> 00:24:00.707
(BORUTO) Hmph! Whoever I go up
against, no way am I gonna lose!

00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:05.512
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
Generations: "Rivals, Gather!"

00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:08.482
