00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:14.262
On matters with the Land of
Waves, our Feudal Lord Ikkyu
Madoka has said this:

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.934
"The security risk they
currently pose to the middle
seas, cannot be ignored.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:21.136
(Newscaster) Thus we will remain
<i>resolute."</i>

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.471
Well, that's rather
unsettling to hear.

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:28.376
What it means is a majority of
people still refuse to believe
the war has ended.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:34.816
Exactly, well put. We're lucky
our village's recovery went
well. Am I right?

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.452
Well, it's all thanks to
everyone's hard work!

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:39.855
Yes, true.

00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:46.728
<i>(Iruka) To secure peace in the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf Village, everyone</i>
<i>worked together.</i>

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:48.630
<i>And they did a brilliant job.</i>

00:00:48.664 --> 00:00:51.032
I'm extremely proud of
that.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.468
[chuckles]

00:00:53.502 --> 00:00:58.039
However, the one thing I'm still
worried about is that you're the
current Hokage.

00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:01.242
[grunts] I know what's
coming next...

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:04.680
You often got into trouble
as a kid, as I recall.

00:01:04.713 --> 00:01:06.648
[groans]

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:11.620
Anyway, what's so urgent that
the busy Lord Hokage would come
to the Academy personally?

00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:13.421
What did you want to tell us?

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:15.356
Oh, of course.

00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:19.327
<i>(Naruto) As you can see...</i>

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:23.865
I've been in regular contact
with the Land of Water...

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.568
and we're finally about to reach
a settlement.

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:28.537
Hmm?

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.974
Starting from this year on, the
Academy's field trips are gonna
be much more extravagant!

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:36.545
What, to the Land of Water?
Without a mission?

00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:38.647
Don't you think
it's a great idea?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.516
I don't know, is it?

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.720
Without a doubt, it will
require a bit of courage.

00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:47.989
But, maybe it's time we took a
step forward.

00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:51.059
Hmm?

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:55.897
[sighs] I can't do this as well
as Mitsuki can.

00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:57.599
Maybe it went like this.

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:58.800
[gasps]

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:02.037
Boruto! Just what are
you doing?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.041
Well, don't get mad, but
everyone says you wear a wig, so
I had to try and...

00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:07.408
[groans]

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:11.580
Was that a Wind Style there?
That's not part of your
curriculum yet.

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:14.850
Uh, yeah, right! That's what I
was trying to show you.

00:02:14.883 --> 00:02:19.655
I've been practicing and
sharpening my skills at
formulating ninjutsu.

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:21.222
Don't you lie to
me, wise guy!

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:24.425
Alright Boruto, the
truth, now.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.027
Uh!

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:28.263
Ugh, so lame! What're you
doing here, Dad?

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:31.933
A little something
called "working."

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.403
If you're gonna pull pranks, at
least do it with some finesse
and don't be so damn obvious.

00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:39.541
Hey, shut up! Like I need you
to tell me anything about that,
Dad!

00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:40.776
What did you say?

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.544
Aw, you heard me!

00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:43.344
[growls]

00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:45.046
Again with these two.

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:33.922
[muffled protest grunts]

00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:36.191
[worried groans]

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.782
So, what'd he do?

00:04:38.815 --> 00:04:40.850
Oh, the dummy tried to prank
the principal yesterday.

00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:43.086
Well, it's a creative
punishment.

00:04:43.787 --> 00:04:46.890
Figures. What an idiot.

00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:49.025
For the first time in the
school's history...

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:51.895
we will conduct a field trip
outside the village.

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:54.898
This is truly a
milestone.

00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:58.568
<i>(Shino) Now, everyone must</i>
<i>exercise extreme caution.</i>

00:04:58.602 --> 00:05:00.003
The Land of Water?

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:04.908
The ocean, fresh fish
on a grill, delicious.

00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:07.744
This means I get to buy a
cute new swimsuit!

00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:09.078
[happy shrieks]

00:05:09.112 --> 00:05:11.848
The Land of Water, and
the Hidden Mist Village,
huh?

00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:14.450
This can't be a good idea. Are
we gonna be okay?

00:05:14.483 --> 00:05:17.954
But that stuff happened
so long ago. Why worry?

00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:21.024
Well, yeah, I suppose
it's got nothing to do
with us.

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:24.794
You will be representing
our village.

00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:27.631
And a word of warning:
Don't cause any trouble.

00:05:27.664 --> 00:05:31.367
If something should happen,
consider the field trip
cancelled immediately.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.838
I just realized, this means no
classes for a while, then!

00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:36.439
Yeah, awesome!

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:39.375
Wait a second guys, you
know field trips aren't
for fun, right?

00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:41.144
<i>(Doushu) Why you gotta</i>
<i>ruin everything?</i>

00:05:41.177 --> 00:05:42.779
<i>(Houki) Yeah, you're such a</i>
<i>buzzkill, dude.</i>

00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:45.582
[sighs] Why are boys so
predictably moronic?

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:48.384
[clears throat]

00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:52.889
Okay, I'll be needing a student
leader for this field trip. Any
volunteers?

00:05:54.658 --> 00:05:58.261
Really? Not one of you?

00:05:58.294 --> 00:06:01.430
<i>He's got to be kidding. Who'd</i>
ever want to play babysitter for
<i>this bunch of delinquents?</i>

00:06:01.464 --> 00:06:04.634
Who would want to volunteer for
such a thankless job?

00:06:04.668 --> 00:06:09.939
[wincing] Please don't pick me.
<i>Please, please, please don't</i>
<i>pick me!</i>

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:12.876
<i>(Sarada) Sensei!</i>

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:17.446
I think Boruto Uzumaki would be
an excellent choice for our trip
leader! How about it?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.082
[grunting protests]

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:23.486
Hey, great idea! I think he'd be
the perfect choice for this too,
Sensei! Don't you?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.825
I mean, he's always the center
of attention. He's cheerful and
energetic and loud.

00:06:28.858 --> 00:06:30.527
Really, there's no one
better, right?

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.861
Yeah, I agree!

00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:33.062
Uh‐huh, I agree, too!

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:37.400
[students agreeing]

00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:40.770
<i>(Inojin) After all he has to</i>
<i>be in the lead, anyway!</i>

00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:43.306
I see. Are you sure,
then?

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:48.645
So, this is actually what Boruto
meant by us being classmates?

00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:49.746
[muffled screams]

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:50.947
But, but I...

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.318
[muffled] Class Rep, help me,
please! Come on!

00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:56.385
[winces]

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:57.286
[muffled scream]

00:07:02.058 --> 00:07:05.461
[muffled screaming]

00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:09.332
I think our field trip leader
has something he's trying to
say.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.403
What's the matter with
you guys? Can't you think
for yourselves?

00:07:14.437 --> 00:07:17.674
You don't get to make
decisions for me without
my say‐so!

00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:20.977
What about my opinion? You gotta
respect what I want!

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.647
Oh yeah, and also!

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.416
Don't let us down now, leader!
We're all counting on you, ya
know?

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.587
Whatever, you guys made
this decision, not me!

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.824
But the honest truth is, you
really are the best one for the
job!

00:07:34.858 --> 00:07:36.560
For real?

00:07:36.593 --> 00:07:41.565
(Denki) Uh‐huh. You'll be great
<i>at getting the class to come</i>
<i>together.</i>

00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:45.869
Jeez, then I guess I have no
choice! Looks like you guys have
to listen to me, then!

00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:47.203
You bet!

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:51.775
Nice work. You've gotten really
good at handling Boruto.

00:07:51.808 --> 00:07:53.743
[chuckles]

00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:59.448
Hey? Slacking off again already?
Don't embarrass us like that
when we're in another village.

00:07:59.482 --> 00:08:01.585
Man, it's gonna be such a
drag.

00:08:01.618 --> 00:08:05.655
Really. Do you guys ever do
anything else besides mess
around?

00:08:06.656 --> 00:08:09.659
And speaking of which...

00:08:09.693 --> 00:08:12.195
It sounds to me like the Hidden
Mist Village is right in the
middle of nowhere.

00:08:12.228 --> 00:08:14.030
Do they even have
anything to do?

00:08:14.063 --> 00:08:15.599
Don't worry about that.

00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:19.002
If I have any say in it, you
know we're totally gonna liven
things up.

00:08:19.035 --> 00:08:20.604
All this confidence, now?

00:08:20.637 --> 00:08:23.840
For better or worse, you
guys made me the leader.

00:08:23.873 --> 00:08:28.177
I wish I could see the same
resolve in you during regular
school hours.

00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:33.116
[scoffs] Don't get too
carried away, now.

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:37.386
Not long ago, that place used to
be known as the "Bloody Mist
Village."

00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:39.422
Huh?

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:43.192
It's bad news, you guys.

00:08:43.226 --> 00:08:46.129
Did you have a tough
time there, Iwabe?

00:08:46.162 --> 00:08:48.965
<i>(Iwabe) Not really.</i>

00:08:48.998 --> 00:08:54.671
Although, if anything happens,
I'll pulverize them I promise.
Later.

00:08:54.704 --> 00:08:58.842
If anything happens? Are you
kidding? Weren't you listening
to Shino Sensei?

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:02.546
Sarada seems a little over
excited to me, don't ya think?

00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:03.613
Hmm.

00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:10.887
Handkerchief, a change of
clothes, some school supplies,
anything else?

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.660
Plenty of snacks, games, my
chargers, my Shinobi Bout
deck!

00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:20.196
Do you really need to
take all of that?

00:09:20.229 --> 00:09:23.032
This stuff will help me pass
the time while I'm away.

00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:26.803
Well, I hope your teacher
doesn't scold you for bringing
all the wrong things.

00:09:27.837 --> 00:09:29.773
You're so lucky, Big Brother!

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:34.778
I know, right? Don't worry,
I'll bring back lots of
souvenirs for you.

00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:36.646
You have to promise,
okay?

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.415
I don't know how things are in
the Land of Water now...

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:41.284
but they might be very different
from here.

00:09:41.317 --> 00:09:44.420
And don't you dare do
anything too careless or
dangerous.

00:09:44.453 --> 00:09:47.456
And don't forget, follow all of
your sensei's directions, and...

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.327
Hey. It's okay, I know! I'm off
now, see ya!

00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:54.631
Have the best time ever!

00:09:54.664 --> 00:09:56.199
[sighs]

00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:30.834
[giggling]

00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:33.703
[giggling]

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:39.909
I packed so much stuff, it's
ridiculous. Look at all this!

00:10:39.943 --> 00:10:42.445
Hmm. Wouldn't
expect any less!

00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:44.180
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Hey! You want one?</i>

00:10:44.213 --> 00:10:45.749
<i>(Sumire) Oh, thank you!</i>

00:10:49.653 --> 00:10:50.920
It's amazing!

00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:53.723
What's amazing?

00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:58.327
On the other side of that ocean
are other lands and so many
different villages.

00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:00.930
<i>(Sumire) It's hard to even</i>
<i>imagine.</i>

00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:02.799
Totally.

00:11:02.832 --> 00:11:05.502
[chewing]

00:11:05.535 --> 00:11:08.237
Oh, come on. Why are
you so sentimental?

00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:10.139
Well, I'm allowed to be!

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:11.841
Hey, can I ask you.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.242
Hmm?

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:17.413
In class the other day, why'd
you pick Boruto as the trip
leader?

00:11:17.446 --> 00:11:18.815
Uh.

00:11:18.848 --> 00:11:22.351
Good question! It could've
been anyone else, couldn't it?
So why?

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:25.354
Well, because I, I thought that
he...

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:27.557
Hey, you talking about
me?

00:11:27.591 --> 00:11:31.327
Ugh, mind your own business!
It's nothing, go away!

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.565
Why? I have every right
to be up on this deck and
look at the ocean, too!

00:11:35.599 --> 00:11:39.202
You take nothing
seriously! [chomps]

00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:41.838
Yeah well, you're too
tense, you need to calm
down!

00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:46.042
(Boruto) You've been really high
<i>strung lately, even for you!</i>

00:11:46.075 --> 00:11:47.243
Got a problem?

00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:50.346
Course not. You can be
as stressed as you want.

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:54.050
I'm not interested in becoming
the Hokage, anyway.

00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:58.922
You're the only one in the
entire village who can't see how
great Lord Seventh is.

00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:03.226
And yet, I'm also the only one
who sees what a loser my dad
actually is.

00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:07.664
You know what everybody says?
That your dad was unbelievably
strong.

00:12:07.697 --> 00:12:10.166
Don't you think that's like way
cooler?

00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:12.602
So what? We're not
talking about him.

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:16.405
My goal is to become a
shinobi, just like Lord
Seventh!

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:20.443
Oh yeah, well, if you're that
determined to become Hokage...

00:12:20.476 --> 00:12:23.379
then maybe you should take over
as the field trip leader.

00:12:23.412 --> 00:12:24.180
<i>(Sarada) [giggles]</i>

00:12:24.213 --> 00:12:26.082
Hmm?

00:12:26.115 --> 00:12:29.485
Hmm. I nominated you to be the
leader for this to keep you from
going off on your own...

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.555
and making trouble, like
always.

00:12:31.588 --> 00:12:33.623
I had to make sure our
trip'd be fun!

00:12:33.657 --> 00:12:38.127
You're so sneaky! Nice way to
act, for someone who wants to
be Hokage!

00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:39.328
[giggles]

00:12:39.362 --> 00:12:40.897
[mocking giggles]

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.031
It's not funny!

00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:43.266
Ha ha!

00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:45.502
(Boruto) Ha ha! Shut up, I said
<i>it's not funny!</i>

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:48.772
There is no way I'm getting
involved with that.

00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:51.040
Huh?

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.078
<i>[children chatting]</i>

00:12:55.111 --> 00:12:57.080
<i>(Denki) Here!</i>

00:12:57.113 --> 00:12:59.148
Ugh! So you're the one
who had that card!

00:12:59.182 --> 00:13:02.418
Damn it! Why don't I have any
red cards in this stupid hand?

00:13:05.622 --> 00:13:07.957
Oh, yes! And I
win this one!

00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:12.729
Aw, it's so unfair! Every single
card in my hand was useless.

00:13:12.762 --> 00:13:14.764
[disappointed sigh]

00:13:14.798 --> 00:13:16.666
For a while there, I figured I
might have had a chance.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.802
You so got your
butt kicked, Boruto.

00:13:18.835 --> 00:13:22.706
Shut up. Besides, I wanna win in
one big sweep, anyway!

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:25.274
What's the point, though, if you
don't have the hand?

00:13:25.308 --> 00:13:28.912
[grunts] Okay.
One...more...hand!

00:13:28.945 --> 00:13:30.246
[chuckles] Fine by me!

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:33.416
Great! That means you
can lose yet again!

00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:35.652
Not this time!

00:13:40.056 --> 00:13:41.925
This game sucks now.

00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.026
Nothing but mist.

00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:46.395
(Denki) The view outside hasn't
<i>changed at all!</i>

00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:48.832
I wish we were there
already.

00:13:49.933 --> 00:13:51.668
Kids these days.

00:13:54.538 --> 00:13:58.708
[sleeping breaths]

00:13:58.742 --> 00:13:59.809
[sleepy grunt]

00:14:01.978 --> 00:14:02.846
Huh?

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:04.914
<i>(Boruto) Mitsuki?</i>

00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:07.116
You alright, Boruto?

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.955
I needed the bathroom. But this
boat is so big, I got a little
lost.

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:14.658
What about you?

00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:15.859
Hmm.

00:14:16.926 --> 00:14:18.828
Figured as much.

00:14:19.262 --> 00:14:21.965
Hey, wait!

00:14:21.998 --> 00:14:26.002
That thing you can do, it's kind
of a "swoosh." So cool, how do
you do it?

00:14:26.035 --> 00:14:27.704
You mean, the Wind Scythe?

00:14:27.737 --> 00:14:32.742
Yeah, that one. I keep trying
it, but it still isn't working.

00:14:32.776 --> 00:14:35.645
If it were easy, everyone
could do it.

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:37.280
<i>(Boruto) Oh, is that right?</i>

00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:40.617
I don't have it yet, but I'm
almost there.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.120
Besides, you don't know about
Chakra Natures yet. Uh.

00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:47.924
(Mitsuki) Oh, field trip leader.

00:14:47.957 --> 00:14:49.225
Hmm?

00:14:49.258 --> 00:14:50.727
(Mitsuki) It's coming into view.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.128
[awed]

00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:54.564
The Village Hidden
in the Mist.

00:15:02.305 --> 00:15:04.207
Pretty amazing, right?

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.642
Yeah.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.178
I'd heard this place
was really rural.

00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:12.115
But it's even more modern than
the Hidden Leaf Village!

00:15:18.955 --> 00:15:22.759
Alright everyone, it's time to
line up for roll call. Move it!

00:15:22.792 --> 00:15:26.195
And please, let's
stay together!

00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:30.900
Our guide from the Hidden Mist
will be arriving shortly, so
please be on your best behavior.

00:15:31.568 --> 00:15:33.336
We're getting a guide?

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:35.872
Do you think they'll be a
teacher from here?

00:15:38.374 --> 00:15:42.111
Hello! Welcome to the Hidden
Mist Village.

00:15:42.145 --> 00:15:45.549
[surprised/impressed
reactions]

00:15:45.582 --> 00:15:49.819
My name is Kagura Karatachi. And
I'll be your guide today.

00:15:52.756 --> 00:15:53.389
Hmm?

00:15:53.422 --> 00:15:56.693
[gasps/awes]

00:15:56.726 --> 00:15:59.896
Lord Kagura, thank
you for coming.

00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:03.567
It's my pleasure. I'm
honored to be your guide.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.736
The Mizukage's aide, Kagura
Karatachi.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.106
<i>(Anko) Incidentally, he's not</i>
<i>much older than any of</i>
<i>you.</i>

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:11.407
<i>[girls] What?</i>

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.745
<i>(Namida) He's not like any of</i>
<i>the other boys in our class.</i>

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:19.516
Huh, sure, he looks pretty hot
on the outside, but does he have
a good personality?

00:16:21.585 --> 00:16:25.889
(Boruto) He's kinda like, well,
<i>like a sword.</i>

00:16:25.922 --> 00:16:26.956
<i>(Boruto) Huh?</i>

00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:29.492
[nervous grunt]

00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:32.929
It is truly an honor.

00:16:32.962 --> 00:16:38.101
A warm welcome, son of Naruto
Uzumaki, the legendary Seventh
Hokage and his classmates.

00:16:38.134 --> 00:16:39.936
Aw, just knock it off!

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.271
Hmm?

00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:48.411
Please, let's just leave my dad
out of this. Boruto Uzumaki.

00:16:48.444 --> 00:16:51.014
But you can call me
Boruto, 'kay?

00:16:51.047 --> 00:16:53.082
[chuckles] As you wish.

00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:56.085
<i>(Kagura) Then, I insist you</i>
<i>call me Kagura.</i>

00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:58.755
<i>(Boruto) Great! Nice to meet</i>
<i>you, Kagura!</i>

00:17:18.107 --> 00:17:30.954
[street chatter]

00:17:31.955 --> 00:17:35.692
I'd heard the rumors, but
it's amazing here.

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:42.265
Sensei!

00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:44.033
Could you take a pic?

00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:53.276
<i>(Boruto) Whoa! This version of</i>
<i>Shinobi Bout isn't even</i>
<i>available in the Leaf Village!</i>

00:17:53.309 --> 00:17:55.044
Looks like a limited
edition.

00:17:55.078 --> 00:17:58.582
Oh, yeah. Now what? Do we buy
it?

00:17:58.615 --> 00:18:00.349
Maybe if we split the cost.

00:18:00.383 --> 00:18:04.420
This lively port town is the hub
of distribution and trade.

00:18:04.453 --> 00:18:07.757
<i>(Kagura) We get our goods and</i>
<i>products from various lands.</i>

00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:10.794
<i>And it's a bustling tourist</i>
<i>destination.</i>

00:18:10.827 --> 00:18:13.763
Wow, the Hidden Mist
Village is so awesome.

00:18:13.797 --> 00:18:16.833
That's wonderful to hear. I
thank you.

00:18:18.535 --> 00:18:21.304
We're very proud of our village.

00:18:21.337 --> 00:18:23.640
Uh. [gasps]

00:18:23.673 --> 00:18:27.143
Hey! Are you a
Kagemasa fan, too?

00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:31.715
Uh, yeah. His movies are great,
aren't they?

00:18:31.748 --> 00:18:36.452
Whoa! That's a super‐rare
premium gift that you can only
get at theaters!

00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:37.687
<i>(Denki) Name your price!</i>

00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:40.056
Just tell me how much you
want for it!

00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:42.859
There it is, and the
rich boy comes out.

00:18:42.892 --> 00:18:45.061
[uncomfortable laugh]

00:18:45.094 --> 00:18:48.497
Hey! Why didn't you say so
before! So cool! Heh.

00:18:48.532 --> 00:18:49.999
[chuckles]

00:18:50.033 --> 00:18:54.170
Hey, no fair! The boys are
hogging all of Kagura's
attention!

00:18:54.203 --> 00:18:57.273
I just hope their stupidity
doesn't rub off on him.

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:01.711
Hmph.

00:19:03.412 --> 00:19:04.313
Hmm?

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.957
Iwabe, wait!

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.628
[exhausted breaths] What's
up? Don't go disappearing on us!

00:19:18.662 --> 00:19:21.064
Yeah, Iwabe! C'mon.

00:19:21.097 --> 00:19:25.669
Boruto, you're friends with
Iwabe, right? So go and look
for him.

00:19:25.702 --> 00:19:27.937
<i>(Sarada) Denki, keep an eye on</i>
<i>him.</i>

00:19:27.971 --> 00:19:29.606
[groans]

00:19:29.639 --> 00:19:32.208
Where I go is nobody
else's business.

00:19:32.241 --> 00:19:35.612
You can't just go wandering off.
It's not our village.

00:19:35.645 --> 00:19:38.715
Yeah, but it is pretty amazing.

00:19:38.748 --> 00:19:41.851
<i>(Denki) I'd almost call it</i>
<i>over the top.</i>

00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:43.386
<i>(Iwabe) It's all a cover‐up.</i>

00:19:43.419 --> 00:19:45.388
Hmm?

00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:48.658
It's true. I told you this used
to be a terrible place.

00:19:48.692 --> 00:19:53.362
Their shameful history, was
hidden by all these fancy new
buildings.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.101
[cheering]

00:19:58.434 --> 00:19:59.703
Hmm.

00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:02.105
Yeah, but that's all in
the past!

00:20:02.138 --> 00:20:04.708
This is supposed to be
our field trip.

00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:09.078
So, let's enjoy ourselves!
[grunts] Whoa! [grunts]

00:20:09.478 --> 00:20:10.379
Boruto!

00:20:10.413 --> 00:20:11.314
Oww.

00:20:11.347 --> 00:20:15.652
[laughing] Whoops, sorry! C'mon,
let's go.

00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:18.087
Hold up a second.

00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:20.924
You know I just saw you
bump into him.

00:20:20.957 --> 00:20:25.194
Yeah? So what if I did?

00:20:25.228 --> 00:20:29.265
You Hidden Leaf rats have no
business snooping around here.

00:20:29.298 --> 00:20:30.700
What, now?

00:20:30.734 --> 00:20:32.435
[gasps]

00:20:32.468 --> 00:20:36.973
Hang on. You mean you already
knew we were from the Hidden
Leaf Village?

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:41.277
Yeah, I could tell right away
'cause of your ugly faces.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.914
Guess this village isn't
so cool, after all.

00:20:44.948 --> 00:20:49.185
[grunts] I'm gonna teach you
some manners, you punk!

00:20:53.056 --> 00:20:54.157
Ha!

00:20:55.659 --> 00:20:57.861
<i>(Shizuma) Stop it, Hassaku.</i>

00:20:59.729 --> 00:21:00.830
[grunts]

00:21:00.864 --> 00:21:03.700
Leave these poor kids alone and
walk away.

00:21:03.733 --> 00:21:05.735
You're just embarrassing
yourself.

00:21:05.769 --> 00:21:08.471
[scoffs] Whatever you say,
Shizuma.

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:17.547
<i>He's so fast! [grunts]</i>

00:21:19.282 --> 00:21:24.220
So, you're Boruto, the
Hokage's son, huh?

00:21:24.253 --> 00:21:25.655
[grunts]

00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:28.792
[chuckles] You have nice eyes,
kid.

00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:31.260
Huh? You, you really think so?

00:21:31.294 --> 00:21:37.133
Yeah. And you also stood your
ground against Hassaku. That
took guts.

00:21:40.804 --> 00:21:43.472
That right there is ninja
material.

00:21:43.507 --> 00:21:45.041
[nervous breathing]

00:21:46.676 --> 00:21:49.378
Let's go, Hassaku. C'mon.

00:21:49.412 --> 00:21:51.147
[scoffs]

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.553
(Shizuma) Sorry about that! You
<i>boys enjoy your time, here in</i>
<i>the Bloody Mist Village.</i>

00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:57.521
[gasps]

00:22:01.224 --> 00:22:02.425
Mist?

00:22:03.627 --> 00:22:04.861
Oh.

00:23:48.097 --> 00:23:50.399
<i>(Boruto) Those guys from</i>
<i>earlier, and Kagura.</i>

00:23:50.433 --> 00:23:52.401
We don't see anyone like them in

00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:56.405
(Mitsuki) Kagura Karatachi, he's
<i>a top aide to the Sixth</i>
<i>Mizukage.</i>

00:23:56.439 --> 00:23:59.909
<i>He's in line to be the head of</i>
the new Seven Ninja Swordsmen of
<i>the Mist.</i>

00:23:59.943 --> 00:24:03.112
<i>(Cho‐Cho) He seems like a man</i>
<i>with great prospects for the</i>
<i>future.</i>

00:24:03.146 --> 00:24:06.315
He's kind, considerate, best of
<i>all, he's competent!</i>

00:24:06.349 --> 00:24:12.155
<i>(Boruto) Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations: The</i>
