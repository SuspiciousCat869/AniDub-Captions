WEBVTT

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.982
[lugging burden efforts]

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.317
[setting down burden]

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.820
Okay, we should be safe
this far in.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.354
Man, what a haul!

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.590
There's nothing like robbing
the Thunder Train, huh?

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:24.891
And even better is

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.060
finding this perfect place
to hide out!

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.462
No one in town'd ever guess
we came here!

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.465
Yeah, this mining tunnel
was abandoned ages ago.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.234
No one's gonna come
in here now!

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.737
Man... you sure are
a sly one, Boss!

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.339
[laughter]

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.507
Huh?

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.576
Hey, wasn't there another one
of you guys here

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.277
just a second ago...?

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.713
Huh?
Yeah, you're right...

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:47.714
Where'd he go?

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.617
Hey! You down there?

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.521
[shocked, frightened]

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.058
[frightened]

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:46.232
[relieved sigh]
It's finally over!

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.268
They said it was gonna
be a bodyguard mission,

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.536
but not what kind!

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.204
Yes, who would've ever
thought that

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.939
we'd be guarding
somebody's pet.

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.875
It sure was a surprise, huh?

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.109
But now that
it's all finished,

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:58.178
I guess it really
was a piece of cake!

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.445
Don't get too comfortable.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.347
It's not always
gonna go so smoothly

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.482
on missions, you know.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.384
You don't have
to tell me that!

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.419
Anyway, let's get something
to eat!

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.288
Sarada, what do you feel
like having?

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.623
Uh...
[considering]

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.392
Mitsuki, is there anywhere
you wanna go eat?

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.460
I'm happy to go
wherever you want, Boruto.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.597
Okay! Then let's go to
Thunder Burger!

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.865
They just put some
new stuff on the menu...

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.168
[retching]
Hamburgers again?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.469
Hey, look.
Check it out.

00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:25.772
There go those rookies
from Team 7.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:28.909
I heard their mission
success rate's 100%.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.410
And they're younger than us!

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.278
I guess prodigies
are different.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.015
Well, that's to be expected,
right?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:35.816
[peeved]

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.019
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I hurt your feelings?

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.855
Yeah, we're just feeling
a little jealous, that's all.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.023
So just ignore us.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.691
Still, it must
be pretty nice.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.594
I know!
I wish I was the Hokage's son!

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.798
I just don't
understand them...

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.801
(SARADA) Look,
don't let guys like that

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.503
get to you. Okay?

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:59.139
(BORUTO)
Don't worry. I don't.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:03:59.906
It's just that...

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.541
Just what?

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.875
[annoyed]

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.578
I'm always being judged
by my connection to my dad,

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.780
and it bugs the hell outta me!

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:07.914
(SARADA)
Boruto!

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:09.382
Aren't we getting hamburgers?

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.985
(BORUTO)
Sorry, I've lost my appetite.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:12.986
[conspiratorial considering]

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.793
<i>Who cares about</i>
<i>the Hokage, anyway?</i>

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:22.929
<i>Even back then...</i>

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.197
(HINATA)
Come on in!

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.131
[curious]

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:26.399
Thank you for having us!

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.002
And happy birthday
to you, Boruto!

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:31.337
Thank you so much,
Aunt Sakura!

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.006
So you came along,
too, huh?

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.541
Disappointed?

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:38.311
Well, I only came along
'cuz Mom said that I had to.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:39.880
Hey there!

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:42.783
[chuckle] It looks like
you've made yourself at home!

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:44.117
It's very fun.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.119
This is my first
birthday party.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.420
[nervously carrying]

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.591
(HIMAWARI)
Here's your cake, Big Brother!

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.693
Awesome!
Thank you, Himawari!

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:55.395
As I'd expect,
that's some cake!

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.631
I decorated
the whole thing myself!

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.866
(SAKURA)
You did great, Himawari!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.834
[giggle]

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.403
So where is Naruto today?

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.972
He said that
he'd be home really soon.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:07.508
Isn't that good news?

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.676
[scoffing] Yeah, right,
gimme a break.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.412
I couldn't care less if
my old man came home or not.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.916
(SADARA)
The cake was really delicious!

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:16.817
Thanks!

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.184
(HINATA) Oh, I'm so glad!

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:19.319
Right, Mom?

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.221
[drinking]

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:21.955
[angry]

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.057
You father...

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.058
He hasn't returned yet...

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.031
Hello?

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:33.767
What? My husband?

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.036
(HINATA)
Yes...

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.572
Yes...

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.074
I understand.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:51.652
Boruto...

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.956
[chuckle] It was all
just like I thought,

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:57.891
that stupid old man!

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.726
Of course, it's not like
I had my hopes up

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.295
that he'd actually
be here anyway...

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.630
[sympathetic inhale]

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:05.298
There must have been
an emergency

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.033
that he couldn't
put on hold...

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:09.302
I mean...
He is the Hokage...

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:09.703
Oh yeah, sure...

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:13.273
I guess whatever it was
was so important that

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:18.344
Lord Hokage couldn't help but
totally blow off my birthday.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.546
Boruto...

00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:59.553
Big Brother sure is late.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.121
[realizing]
You're right.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.127
<i>I'm really sorry, Hinata.</i>

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.761
<i>I just got home‐‐</i>

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:08.529
[worried]

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.330
<i>Are you okay, Naruto?</i>

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:11.064
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:12.999
<i>Except I‐‐</i>

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:15.101
<i>This is for him.</i>

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.638
<i>[downcast sigh]</i>

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:19.272
<i>I really let him down,</i>

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:22.075
<i>so I thought I should</i>
<i>at least get him a present.</i>

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.376
<i>But when I went to get one,</i>

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.745
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>I don't even know</i>

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.580
<i>what kinds of</i>
<i>games he likes...</i>

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.016
<i>[sympathetic, sad]</i>

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.654
I know that deep down,

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:36.523
the two of them care
very deeply about each other.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:44.531
[frustrated]

00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:46.700
Damn it,
it makes me so mad!

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.369
You appear to be in quite
a bad mood tonight.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.037
Did something happen
during a mission?

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:52.038
[taken aback]

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.674
Whenever something happens,

00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:56.610
you come down here in order to
clear your mind, Young Lord.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.512
No, it's nothing like that.

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:06.252
Hey, Old Man Katasuke...

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:07.688
Do you think that grown‐ups

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.790
still think of me
as a little kid?

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:12.458
[considering]

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.528
No, I don't think
that's the case.

00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:16.162
After all, I'm a grown‐up

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:19.533
and I know just how much skill
you possess, Young Lord.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:23.403
[confident chuckle]
You do, huh?

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:25.005
I guess so, right?

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:26.540
Although...

00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:29.576
There may be others who
don't think the same way...

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.646
I'm sure some are
jealous of you, for example.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.315
You could also say
that they fear you...

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.850
and your talent.

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.152
You're saying that
I make them nervous?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.386
Yes, that's right!

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.755
That's why
they can't appreciate

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:43.456
your strength in
an honest manner.

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:44.825
They make excuses,

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.927
like you're the Hokage's son
and so forth.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.129
Well, I mean, it's not like
I'm the Hokage's son

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:51.898
because I actually
want to be, you know?

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:53.634
Who needs a stupid dad
like that

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.970
who forgets his own
kid's birthday, anyway?

00:08:57.003 --> 00:09:00.140
Well, eventually everyone
will come to understand

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:03.877
and they'll see
your true power, Young Lord.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.379
And when that time
finally comes...

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.414
When the time comes, huh?

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:10.050
[struggling with video games]

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.552
[annoyed at defeat]

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:14.555
Oh, man, I wish it could
be that time now.

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.056
Right, Young Lord.

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:16.489
Well, here!

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.891
[curious]

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.627
I'm sorry that it's late,
but it's a birthday gift.

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:23.396
Naturally, I didn't forget
your special day.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:24.364
Oh...

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.199
Uh, thank you!

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.500
So what is it?

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:29.503
Is it like a toy
or something?

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:30.904
This one's very practical.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:34.875
It may come in quite handy
during your missions,

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.910
so I hope you'll accept it.

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:39.980
It's a Scientific Ninja Tool.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.081
[considering]

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.520
I'm home!

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:48.288
Welcome back, Big Brother!

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.657
Oh, hey.
What're you doing, Hima?

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:53.627
Well, you see...
It's for my birthday...

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.161
Daddy was too busy
with work,

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:58.599
so he couldn't make it to
your birthday party, remember?

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:00.667
I thought if I started
doing this now,

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:03.203
Daddy would be sure to
come home for mine!

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:03.904
Hima...

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:06.640
[quick chuckle]
Listen, who cares if

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:09.175
that stupid old man
doesn't show up to the party?!

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.443
Mom and I will still be here

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:12.078
to celebrate
your birthday with you.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.748
And I can invite all
my friends over, as well!

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.282
[affirmative, agreeing]

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:17.383
But still...

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:19.352
I want Daddy to be here, too.

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.323
Hey, Big Brother?

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:26.426
Do you think Daddy's gonna
miss my birthday, too?

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.794
[taken aback]

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:31.264
He won't be too busy
to come home, will he?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:31.932
No way!

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:33.499
[curious, hopeful]

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:35.168
That won't happen.

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.469
I promise you.

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.004
Don't you worry, Himawari.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:40.941
I swear to you that
it won't go down that way.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:44.310
I'll make sure that Dad
comes home for your birthday!

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:45.946
Big Brother...

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:46.747
Really?!

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:48.114
[chuckle]

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.683
You bet!
Don't worry!

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:56.022
Ugh.
[yawn]

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.224
Why'd we have to
meet so early this morning?

00:10:58.258 --> 00:10:59.192
‐ [annoyed]
‐ (KONOHAMARU) Okay, good.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.460
You're all here.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.862
All right, you three,
this time around,

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.263
our mission is
going to be capturing

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:05.932
a group of thieves who
robbed the Thunder Train.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.104
So these guys
just disappeared

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:12.539
after they jumped off
of the Train?

00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:13.874
Is that correct?

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:15.509
(KONOHAMARU) There's
a mining town near there

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.043
along with some
abandoned mines

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:18.411
that haven't been used
for ages.

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:19.913
Ah, I see.

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:22.348
So the thieves could be
hiding out inside of them.

00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:25.151
How many thieves are there
in the gang, anyway?

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.419
Like ten or twenty?

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:27.521
What, can't you read?!

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:29.089
It's right there
in the report!

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:30.791
It says there are
four of them!

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:33.293
What, seriously?
There are only four...?

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.696
Why can't the townspeople
handle it themselves?

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.831
Can't they just go and
round up the thieves?

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.233
No, I'm afraid that's
just not possible.

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:43.103
The mines are laid out in
what's basically a giant maze.

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.771
The thieves could
lie in wait to attack,

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.807
so it's too dangerous
for civilians.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.074
And that's where
our team's mission comes in,

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.409
is that it?

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:53.379
That's why we've gotta go
all the way out to the sticks?

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:54.915
Catching thieves
is cool and all,

00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:56.650
but it'd be way more exciting
if they were

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:59.520
a big‐time organization
like the Byakuya Gang...

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:00.954
What is up with you?

00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:02.889
There's no such thing as
"big" or "small" missions.

00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:04.357
Didn't you learn that

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.127
back during the whole incident
with Mr. Haguruma?

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:12.232
Yeah, I know that.

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:13.233
But still...

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:15.736
Unless I'm able to
do something big,

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:18.572
people are never
going to acknowledge us.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:21.174
In any event,
we leave in one hour.

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:22.442
For now, dismissed!

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.813
[considering]

00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:28.248
So another ruin
that's connected to

00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:30.884
Kaguya Otsutsuki
has been discovered?

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.720
That's right,

00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:35.889
and this makes
the third one so far.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.357
So what do you wanna do?

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.627
I'm gonna go and check it out
myself, of course.

00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:44.698
I really don't want to put any
more on your plate, though...

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.232
But you don't get
to decide that.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.133
It was agreed on

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.235
at the Five Kage Summit,
remember?

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.538
Anything that involves
the Otsutsuki Clan

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:52.973
is top secret.

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:55.108
I know.
And there's no doubt why.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:57.811
Since Kaguya was able to
build living weapons,

00:12:57.844 --> 00:13:00.514
like an army of White Zetsu,
to stop any threats.

00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:00.814
Yeah...

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:04.317
It's been ten years
now since all of that...

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.853
It's possible something
even worse than White Zetsu

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.321
was sleeping in there.

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:09.155
Anyway, look...

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.024
If we're going to protect

00:13:11.057 --> 00:13:12.726
the peace
we've managed to build,

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:15.095
we have to find every ruin,
check all of them,

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.997
and crush
any possible threats.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.398
I get that, really.

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:21.868
But haven't you been
working too hard lately?

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:25.238
You've been at home even
less frequently than normal.

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:26.540
[downcast sigh]
Well that's‐‐

00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:28.274
I heard about it from Hinata..

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.512
You missed Boruto's birthday
the other day, right?

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:33.013
Yeah...

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:36.116
I feel really bad for
letting him down like that.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:36.850
But...

00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:41.955
I'm the Hokage of
the Leaf now.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.356
Everyone in the village

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.926
is part of my family
that I have to protect.

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.598
It's Dad...

00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:53.099
[taken aback]
Boruto...

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.606
Sarada, Mitsuki.
You guys go on ahead.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.374
I gotta talk to
my dumb old man.

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:02.408
[taken aback]

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:03.844
[peeved, worried]

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.780
All right, Naruto,
I'm gonna go on ahead, too.

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:08.515
Okay. Sorry.

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:09.983
(MITISUKI)
Let's go, Sarada.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.217
[affirmative agreeing]

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.090
Listen, Boruto,

00:14:17.123 --> 00:14:19.359
I didn't apologize to you
well enough.

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:20.360
[nervous sigh]

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:21.828
About your birthday
the other day...

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:22.395
(BORUTO)
Forget it.

00:14:23.096 --> 00:14:24.330
You were super busy

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.700
with all the Hokage business,
right?

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.269
I never had
very high hopes, anyway.

00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:30.336
Boruto, I...

00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:32.372
But listen up!

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:35.075
You'd better be home
for Himawari's birthday!

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:38.579
I honestly don't care

00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:41.948
if my stupid old man won't
come home for my birthday.

00:14:41.982 --> 00:14:43.283
But Himawari...

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:46.520
She's still young
and innocent.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.522
And she wants you there.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:53.527
So promise me right now!
You better come home for hers!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.361
Yeah. I promise.

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:58.098
Look, this is for real!

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.901
If you break your word,
then I'll never forgive you!

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.271
[warm proud chuckle]

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:08.509
[surprised]

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.577
[annoyed]

00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:12.078
[annoyed]

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.070
It's like I said.
We're way out in the sticks.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.005
There's nothing
but mountains out here!

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:41.975
Listen, Boruto, can you stop
saying stuff like that?

00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:45.679
Are you the ones
from the Hidden Leaf?

00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:47.080
That's right.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.516
We're here to find
and apprehend the robbers.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.417
Actually, about that...

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.821
The situation has changed
quite a bit now...

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.422
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.693
[frightened, shaking]

00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:00.894
Who's this?

00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:02.796
That man is one
of the robbers.

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:03.864
[taken aback]

00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:04.765
(KONOHAMARU)
Wait a second...

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:05.999
You went into the mine

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:07.968
to capture him without
waiting for us?!

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:11.304
(VILLAGER) No, he came
running out all by himself.

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:13.940
He was in a panic and
made a huge commotion.

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:15.208
We questioned him,

00:16:15.241 --> 00:16:17.443
but couldn't make sense
of what he said.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:20.080
Hey, what happened to
the rest of your gang?

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:22.783
[frightened]
It's all over!

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:24.551
They're dead! All dead!

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:29.022
So they all died...?

00:16:29.055 --> 00:16:30.724
All of them...

00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:31.992
All of them were...

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:34.561
killed by that monster!

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.032
<i>[pain yell]</i>

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:41.502
<i>[struggling yell]</i>

00:16:41.535 --> 00:16:43.804
<i>[shocked, frightened]</i>

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.471
[frightened, overwhelmed]

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:46.840
A monster?

00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:50.110
He's been like this all along,
making no sense at all.

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:52.445
He must've been scared
out of his wits.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:55.015
(THIEF) [frightened]
Keep me safe!

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:58.885
Please keep me safe!
[frightened]

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:00.821
Where's the mine
that he ran out of?

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.523
I posted guards
at the entrance.

00:17:02.556 --> 00:17:03.857
No one's gone inside yet.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.125
It's not as though

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:07.861
we completely
believe his story, but...

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:09.930
His abject terror
has left us frightened

00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:11.665
of what's inside, too.

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:12.966
Understandably!

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:14.935
All right then,
our mission's changed.

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:16.169
We need to go into the mine

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.539
and find out just
what happened there.

00:17:18.572 --> 00:17:22.142
Hey, what exactly
did you see in there?

00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:25.111
H‐He's...!
He's coming for us!

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:26.346
The white one!

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.582
He's coming for all of us!

00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:29.282
[shocked]

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.084
The white one...?

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:40.426
So this is the place
where it all went down...?

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.197
I wonder what it really is...
this "white monster..."

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.499
A white monster, huh...?

00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:47.734
What's the matter?

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:50.270
[hesitant]
Oh, it's nothing...!

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:51.605
<i>It couldn't be...</i>

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:53.206
Well, whatever.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.709
C'mon, let's just hurry up
and deal with this, you guys!

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.010
Hey, hold up, Boruto!

00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:59.145
Don't just go taking off
on your own!

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.046
(KONOHAMARU)
They may be robbers,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.281
but if they're alive,

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:03.283
rescuing them is
a part of our mission.

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:05.118
This could be
a life‐or‐death situation.

00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:06.553
Yeah, I know that!

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:09.623
That's all the more reason
why we can't waste time!

00:18:09.656 --> 00:18:10.390
(KONOHAMARU)
Hey!

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:13.193
Seriously, what is with him?!

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:20.567
This mine is pretty big...

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:24.771
It looks like it continues
deep underground.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.510
You're irritable today.

00:18:29.543 --> 00:18:30.076
[peeved]

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.477
I mean, you know,

00:18:31.512 --> 00:18:34.047
even more irritable
than you usually are...

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.115
No, I'm not.

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:36.983
That isn't true at all.

00:18:37.017 --> 00:18:38.585
By any chance,
did something happen

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:41.722
between you and Lord Hokage
earlier this morning?

00:18:41.755 --> 00:18:42.689
It's nothing like that.

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:45.959
Although if my dad
weren't the way he is,

00:18:45.992 --> 00:18:47.794
everything would
be way easier for me,

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:49.195
that's for sure...

00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:50.330
[exasperated sigh]

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:52.799
(KONOHAMARU)
Keep up, you two.

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:54.635
Or you'll be left behind.

00:18:54.668 --> 00:18:56.402
Be right there, Sensei!

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.705
Just knock it off
and grow up, will ya?

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.307
Sure, yeah,

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.209
if everybody stopped
treating me like a kid,

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:04.410
maybe I would.

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:06.513
And it's not like I'm upset

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:08.348
just for my own sake,
either...

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:14.220
(KONOHAMARU) We're deep
into the mine now...

00:19:18.258 --> 00:19:19.025
[taken aback]

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:20.226
Hey, come here...

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:22.228
What's up, Mitsuki?

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:23.664
Wait, is that‐‐?!

00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:26.833
(BORUTO) [shocked]
Is that one of the robbers?!

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.605
And I found others down
this passageway...

00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:32.706
There were two more.

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:35.375
So that means this guy's
entire gang was...

00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:38.912
(MITSUKI)
It seems they were slashed

00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:40.313
with a very sharp blade.

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:42.215
The two I found
were charred...

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:43.650
Almost as if they'd
been struck by

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:46.452
a bolt of electricity
or something like that.

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:48.722
You think it was
more than one ninja?

00:19:48.755 --> 00:19:49.856
Well, I'm not sure,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.992
but there's a good chance
of that.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.727
But then why'd that guy
keep going on

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.061
about a "white monster"?

00:19:55.095 --> 00:19:56.530
(MITSUKI)
Maybe it's this, Boruto...

00:19:56.563 --> 00:19:57.531
Huh...?

00:19:57.564 --> 00:19:59.733
Look at these footprints
right here.

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:02.669
Something came running
at them from further in,

00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:03.336
and...

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:04.705
[shocked, confused]

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.345
(KONOHAMARU)
That footprint's huge...

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:15.215
Whatever made it
must be huge too.

00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:17.651
Is that what
killed all these men...?

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:18.752
Well, if it is,

00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:21.021
then it's able to use
multiple jutsu.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.523
So further inside,

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:25.592
there's a monster capable
of doing stuff like this...

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:30.631
From here on,
be prepared for battle.

00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.799
Don't lose focus,
even for a second.

00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:58.959
[shocked]

00:20:58.992 --> 00:21:00.126
The footprints...!

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.362
Why'd they stop
all of a sudden?!

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:06.299
Is this a trap...
just intended to lure us in?!

00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:09.035
[groaning growling]

00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:10.336
(KONOHAMARU)
Everyone,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.673
keep a close eye on
your surroundings!

00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:13.674
(BORUTO)
Damn it!

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:16.342
Where are they gonna
come at us from?

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:27.087
[heavy breathing,
groaning growling]

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.522
[shocked, realizing]
Up there!

00:21:32.526 --> 00:21:34.094
[straining efforts]

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:34.961
Big Brother!

00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:36.462
Konohamaru Sensei!

00:21:37.998 --> 00:21:39.299
[groan]

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.170
You okay, Big Bro?!

00:21:44.204 --> 00:21:47.073
I'm fine.
However...this thing is...

00:21:53.013 --> 00:21:55.181
[shocked, worried]

00:21:55.215 --> 00:21:57.984
[growl]

00:21:58.018 --> 00:21:58.719
[shocked]

00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:02.488
White Zetsu!

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.759
(KONOHAMARU)
Why is he here?!

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:10.864
[growl]

00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:46.793
(BORUTO) What the hell
is that monster?!

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:48.629
(KONOHAMARU)
He's called White Zetsu.

00:23:48.662 --> 00:23:51.832
He's basically a living weapon
created by Kaguya Otsutsuki.

00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:54.835
(BORUTO) What are those
flat‐looking black flames?

00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:57.437
(KONOHAMARU) Flames that
only one man can control,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.906
that can completely
burn anything...

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.607
Amaterasu!

00:24:00.641 --> 00:24:01.207
(SARADA)
I knew it!

00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:02.709
Dad!

00:24:02.743 --> 00:24:06.279
(BORUTO) Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:07.681
"Sasuke's Shadow"

00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:10.016
Sarada's dad?
But why?

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.618
What was he doing in here?!
