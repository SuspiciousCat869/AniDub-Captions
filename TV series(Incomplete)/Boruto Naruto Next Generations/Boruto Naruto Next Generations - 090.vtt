And he can't turn back.

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:30.651

seen as an enemy to humans.

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:32.986

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.756

That is why I want

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:11.692

your friend!

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:22.336
Now quit running away! Come out
and fight me, Mitsuki!

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.309
I'll show you my full strength!

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:32.346
Fighting against each other like
this is just pointless.

00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:36.450
Oh, yeah? Is that so? All
right, then...

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.752

me.

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:40.687
