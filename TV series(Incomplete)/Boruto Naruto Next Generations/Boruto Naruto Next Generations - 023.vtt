00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.494
I'm sorry I thought I'd made
things clear to Sarada, but I
guess I didn't.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:32.664
No, it's actually my
fault.

00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:35.334
You don't need to
apologize to me.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:39.070
Don't underestimate her,
my wife's not weak!

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.610
(Sarada) I wonder how he really
<i>feels about Mom?</i>

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:50.849
<i>And what's the real</i>
<i>story? What happened</i>
<i>between the two of them?</i>

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:53.852
Uh?

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.088
Lord Seventh?

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.527
<i>Hmm. I'm gonna save all this</i>
<i>thinking for later.</i>

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:07.031
<i>Right now I just wanna save</i>
<i>Mom! That's all that matters!</i>

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:10.502
They should be nearby,
Naruto use your sensory
ability.

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:11.470
On it!

00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:30.922
I am the only one truly worthy
of carrying out Itachi's wishes,
and the Uchiha name!

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:37.128
(Shin) My goal is to revive the
Akatsuki and stir up conflict
throughout the world once more.

00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:42.867
You said "my goal" huh?

00:01:43.368 --> 00:01:43.935
Hmm?

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:46.571
Then it's pointless for
me to worry about it.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.574
(Sakura) Since you don't seem to
<i>have any friends.</i>

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:50.542
Any friends?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.447
All I have to do is take you
down, and everything will be
settled!

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:06.358
You're done here. I won't let
you go after my husband and
daughter!

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:57.035
So this is Shin Uchiha's
hideout!

00:03:57.802 --> 00:03:58.703
They're coming!

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:04.709
What? Three of them have
the same face?

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:06.678
I get it now, these
are the clones!

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.983
Father's orders. Get rid of
intruders.

00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:15.654
[grunting]

00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:16.488
[grunts]

00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:18.056
Hmph!

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.824
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Hey, Sarada!</i>

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:20.725
Hmph!

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:22.494
[grunts]

00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:23.428
Oh!

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:27.499
Sorry Lord Seventh, but I'm
heading in there! I'm gonna
go rescue Mom!

00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:32.237
[grunts] Sasuke, go with her!
I'll handle these guys myself!

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.606
Huh? Then what about
me?

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.775
Didn't I already tell you
that I'd protect you?

00:04:36.808 --> 00:04:38.109
Oh!

00:04:38.142 --> 00:04:39.678
First we'll shut
em down. Huh?

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:44.249
Creepy!

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.117
Just how many more of these
weird guys are there?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.356
Father's orders. Get
rid of intruders.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.757
Intruders. Intruders.
Father's orders.

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:55.694
Man, damn that Shin.

00:04:55.727 --> 00:04:57.929
Why aren't you doing anything
Lord Seventh? Aren't they the
enemy?

00:04:57.962 --> 00:04:59.364
We should just take
them down!

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:02.501
No way. I can't do that to them.

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:06.705
Whether they're clones or
whatever, they all think of Shin
as their "Father."

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:07.606
Hmm.

00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:11.109
A parent should never do
something like this to their
child.

00:05:11.142 --> 00:05:14.012
It's wrong and it should
never happen!

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:20.485
Hiya!

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:25.524

[winces] [gasps]

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:36.861
Dad!?

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.469
What's the matter? Let's go.

00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:46.104
Hmph.

00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:08.727
[screaming]

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.464

Amaterasu!

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.159
You can heal your wounds
yourself, right?

00:07:41.192 --> 00:07:44.896
Yes. Thanks, dear. I
appreciate it.

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:50.635
[relieved exhale]

00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:52.871

[painful grunting]

00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:58.810
You won't be moving far
with that leg.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.914
We'll examine you thoroughly
back at the Leaf.

00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:11.323
It's the boy!

00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:16.194
Move aside. I have no quarrel
with you.

00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:19.498
I will not. I will protect
Father.

00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:21.433

00:09:29.801 --> 00:09:32.537
[evil chuckling]

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.240
As I expected, you're all
weak!

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:39.911
Your worthless parental feelings
toward your children have
oppressed you completely.

00:09:39.944 --> 00:09:42.180
<i>(Shin) And this is the result!</i>

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:42.947

Sasuke! [grunts]

00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:46.685
Do not move.

00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:49.788
You cannot hope to escape
my Sharingan.

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:52.224
[grunts]

00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:55.093
You are a disgrace
to the Uchiha clan.

00:09:55.126 --> 00:10:00.765
Now I will carry out Itachi's
will, and I shall revive the
Akatsuki.

Huh?

Something like this, isn't
enough to defeat your dad.

[inhales]

00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:13.445
Trust us.

00:10:13.478 --> 00:10:17.682
Your father and I, we will
protect you, no matter what!

00:10:19.918 --> 00:10:20.919
Hmph.

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:22.421
Hah!

00:10:23.855 --> 00:10:26.458
It's useless trying to run. I'll
impale the three of you, as a
family!

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:52.016

<i>(Cho‐Cho) What's going on?</i>

00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:14.273
I don't really know. But I think
Sasuke's group got things under
control.

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.140
So let's get going!

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:23.948
Sarada!

00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:27.051
This is over, Shin. You're done.

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:32.123
I'll have to use the Shins as a
distraction and retreat for now.

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:35.760
[arrogant chuckle] Oh, not yet.

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:40.665
All of you! [inhales]

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:43.535
Kill them! [grunts]

00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:54.613
<i>(Young Clone) Enough.</i>

00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:58.250
<i>We are to dispose of old</i>
<i>useless flesh.</i>

00:11:58.283 --> 00:12:00.952
That is what you taught
us, Father.

00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:06.658
You! But I am...I am...the
original! I am!

00:12:06.691 --> 00:12:11.195
Your Visual Prowess grows
weaker, just like you, Father.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.800
From this point on we will
evolve. Exactly as you taught
us.

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:20.205
That is logical. We
will do it.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:25.944
What do you think? Is this it?
The evolution you were hoping
to create?

00:12:25.977 --> 00:12:27.479
[uncomfortable grunt]

00:12:40.191 --> 00:12:43.795
Hey, hang on! There's still even
more of you guys?

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:49.401
When did so many get
made?

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:55.940
We made more of ourselves. We
don't need you, Father. Not
anymore.

00:12:55.974 --> 00:12:59.344
Whoa! It seems like they made
some plump ones too!

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.680
Looks like they couldn't
clone accurately.

Uh, Sarada?

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.090
Huh?

00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:28.893
Your eyes are just like
your dad's!

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:31.162
[gasps]

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:32.264
[sighs]

00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:37.936
<i>(Sakura) Sarada! [sighs]</i>

00:15:37.969 --> 00:15:42.140
Oh, why do you make me worry
so much?

00:15:42.173 --> 00:15:44.709
[inhales] I'm sorry.

00:15:46.177 --> 00:15:48.547
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.750
Mom, you're squishing
me too much!

00:15:51.783 --> 00:15:54.886
Oh! Sorry about that.

00:15:58.857 --> 00:15:59.891
Dad!

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:06.298
Um Dad, are your feelings really
connected with Mom's?

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.768
Yeah.

00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:12.070
How can you say that and
be sure?

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:16.208
Because you exist...

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:18.877
<i>(Sasuke) Sarada.</i>

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:29.354
You're a lucky girl. Real lucky.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:32.457
<i>(Naruto) [chuckles] All right!</i>
<i>Let's go home!</i>

00:16:37.662 --> 00:16:42.434
<i>(Kabuto) First of all, we'll</i>
<i>need to give each one of you a</i>
<i>name for convenience.</i>

00:16:44.035 --> 00:16:48.307
<i>Hmm. There are so many</i>
<i>of you. Before we do that.</i>

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.278
<i>Let me explain that</i>
<i>you'll all be living here</i>
<i>starting today.</i>

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:57.081
<i>In other words, we're all</i>
<i>going to be a family.</i>

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:00.018
My name is Kabuto.

00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:02.821
There's no need to be shy.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.758
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Aw man!</i>

00:17:08.693 --> 00:17:11.963
<i>This was supposed to be my</i>
journey to find my real dad, but
<i>you found your dad instead.</i>

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:15.767
Are you going to keep searching?
Looking for your real dad?

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.038
Well, the one I've already got
isn't all that bad.

00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:23.308
I guess I'll just have to make
do with him for now.

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:24.543
You'll make do with him?

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:30.315
[sigh] I wonder where in the
world my real dad could be? Huh?

00:17:31.783 --> 00:17:35.620
[gasps] Who's that cool guy
standing over there?

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:38.257
Um, excuse me, would you happen
to be?

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.761
Hmm? Oh, hey, Cho‐Cho! Did you
come over here to get me?

00:17:43.928 --> 00:17:45.630
<i>(Choji) Thank you!</i>

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:48.199
Hmm. That's how it felt!

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.735
That feeling!

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.137
Uh. What? What's the matter?

00:17:53.171 --> 00:17:56.308
Oh, I get it! She's never seen
you like this, Choji.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:59.110
Cho‐Cho doesn't recognize you in
that physique.

00:17:59.143 --> 00:18:00.312
Huh?

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.452
Huh? For real?

00:18:08.052 --> 00:18:09.288
Daddy?

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:10.455
Yeah, it's me!

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:14.626
What is this? Is it some secret
Akimichi Clan Jutsu?

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:17.095
Uh, it's kinda like that.

00:18:17.128 --> 00:18:21.233
I wanna learn how to do it, too!
Can you teach me tomorrow, Dad?
Huh?

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:26.871
Oh, Choji! Cho‐Cho has been
looking for you all this time.

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:29.741
I was on a mission.

00:18:29.774 --> 00:18:33.878
Oh, Sasuke? [laughs] It's been a
long time!

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:36.681
Huh? What's the...?

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:38.182
[embarrassed laugh]

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.953
[giggles]

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:43.988
<i>(Karin) Huh?</i>

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.261
That's so ridiculous! Sarada is
truly and indisputably Sasuke
and Sakura's daughter!

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:51.796
But what about that
umbilical cord?

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.032
It belongs to Sarada and Sakura!

00:18:54.065 --> 00:18:57.736
I was the one who delivered
Sarada when Sakura went into
labor!

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:58.403
Heh.

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:03.942
Are you telling the truth? I
remember you used to be pretty
crazy about Sasuke, Karin.

00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:09.047
You idiot! All I ever really
wanted was for Sasuke to find
true happiness.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.117
And besides, women can be just
friends with guys too, you know.

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:14.786
Really? Hmm.

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:18.657
So does that mean you're no
longer interested in Sasuke
then?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.459
Wha?

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:23.662
[sighs]

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:28.733
(Karin) You seriously don't get
it at all, do you? Bonds come in
<i>all kinds of shapes.</i>

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.502
<i>But never mind that.</i>

00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:31.069
<i>(Suigetsu) Huh?</i>

00:19:32.103 --> 00:19:33.272
(Karin) Go apologize to Sarada,
<i>Suigetsu!</i>

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:33.872
<i>(Suigetsu) Huh?</i>

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:37.242
<i>(Karin) And you can take her</i>
<i>this new pair of glasses while</i>
<i>you're at it!</i>

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.577
<i>I bet she's entirely</i>
<i>outgrown her old pair.</i>

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.044
<i>(Suigetsu) Right now?</i>

00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:43.982
Seriously? C'mon you guys.

00:19:44.015 --> 00:19:48.119
Of course you are my real
daughter and I definitely gave
birth to you!

00:19:48.152 --> 00:19:50.088
Silly kid!

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:52.591
I...

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:56.495
I'm sorry too. Dad I...

00:19:56.528 --> 00:20:01.500
Don't worry about it. I get
suspicious and jump to
conclusions, too.

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:02.667
Hmm.

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:12.677
When will you come home
again?

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:19.284
Uh.

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.594
Oh, Dad.

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:32.063
Don't make such a sad
face.

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:34.399
[sighs]

00:20:39.604 --> 00:20:41.506
Till next time. Kay?

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.777
[laughs] So then tell me,
what's even better than a kiss,
huh?

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.978
[gasps]

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:50.315
I'll tell you about it,
next time we talk.

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:53.652
[laughs] You'll understand when
you see your dad.

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:57.989
[crying]

00:20:58.022 --> 00:21:00.959
[giggles]

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:03.428
Hmm.

00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:06.130
[giggles]

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.935
Here. I packed your lunch.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:11.536
Thanks.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.004
Hmm?

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:15.307
[embarrassed]

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.579
Uh.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.146
Uh, see you!

00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:24.816
I have to get going.

00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:30.021
<i>[sighs] Another raincheck for</i>
<i>me? Cha!</i>

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:37.262
That's it. I've decided.

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.123
<i>(Boruto) [sighs]</i>

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.526
Hey, thanks.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.760
Thanks for what?

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:20.299
You know, taking that
lunch box to my dad.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.637
You're welcome. It actually
helped me figure out my goal.

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:29.208
So really I should be
thanking you.

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:32.611
What is your goal?

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:37.749
I can't very well deliver lunch
to every single person in the
Village, so...

00:23:37.782 --> 00:23:40.885
I've decided, to become Hokage!

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.186
Uh.

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.556
Hmm.

00:23:49.494 --> 00:23:52.264
(Sarada) I've decided I'm gonna
<i>become the Hokage.</i>

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:55.166
<i>(Boruto) Wasn't all that long</i>
<i>ago, you were making fun of</i>
<i>ninja.</i>

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:56.768
What prompted the sudden change
<i>of heart?</i>

00:23:56.801 --> 00:24:00.104
<i>(Sarada) Unlike you, I choose</i>
<i>not to be childish anymore.</i>

00:24:00.138 --> 00:24:01.840
<i>(Boruto) What's childish about</i>
<i>me?</i>

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:04.609
<i>(Sarada) You mean, what's not</i>
<i>childish about you?</i>

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:07.412
<i>(Mitsuki) I was just thinking</i>
<i>that you two make a very nice</i>
<i>duo.</i>

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:12.517
<i>(Boruto) Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations:</i>
<i>"Boruto and Sarada!"</i>

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:14.753
<i>(Boruto/Sarada) Uh, no way!</i>
