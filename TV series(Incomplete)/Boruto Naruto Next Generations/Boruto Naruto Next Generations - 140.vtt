WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.076
(upbeat music)

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.445
[Villager] Hey stop!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:15.816
(chuckles)

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.584
That was way too easy.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.689
Just as I thought,

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.691
I knew that you'd end up here.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:25.959
Awesome job, Shikadai.

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.828
Seriously you were totally right

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.496
to ambush this guy right here.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.733
Damn it are you guys
messing with me?

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.937
(woman shrieks)

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.706
It looks like I hadn't
run out of luck just yet.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.047
(gentle upbeat music)

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.618
Just back off!

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.454
Any of you guys take one step
toward me and she's dead.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.699
Not good the moon's
light's been blocked.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.534
Inojin, use Mind Transfer.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.403
Huh?

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.339
But I haven't been
able to do it right before.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:15.709
And if I mess up, her
life's gonna be in danger.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.711
Inojin.

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.080
Okay.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.582
I said get back.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.188
Go on get outta here!

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.324
Now's my chance.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:34.962
I can't move.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:40.200
Time to give it up.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.539
Everything's gonna be okay now.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.307
All right, we're done here.

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:58.519
(opening theme music)

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:37.818
[Boruto] I heard you
guys totally nailed

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.286
your mission yesterday.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.354
Sure did.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.489
Shikadai predicted the
date and time, right?

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.958
He even guessed the
escape route didn't he?

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.360
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.962
To be honest, there was a minor
incident during the mission.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:50.831
But Shikadai was able
to take care of it,

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:51.965
just like that.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.367
If it weren't for
Shikadai's does help,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.068
I don't think we
would have been able

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:57.070
to resolve it so quickly.

00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:59.506
This may sound weird,
but Shikadai's manliness

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.709
has increased about
1.5 times recently.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.512
That's oddly specific.

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:08.515
It's like they say carrying
the weight of responsibility,

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.717
really does make
someone more mature.

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.452
Yeah that's exactly it.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.189
Inojin?

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.658
What is it?

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.426
If you aren't going to eat that,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.861
then can I have it?

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:22.863
Oh yeah, I guess so.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.331
Great. Thanks.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:29.703
They're cold.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.572
If you weren't going to eat
it, you should have given

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.807
it to me while it was still
fresh and hot.

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:35.809
I was planning to eat it myself.

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:37.945
But after I ate that burger.

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:39.713
Besides, you know
what's going to happen

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:41.348
if you keep eating so much.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.217
So what? My dad
says I'm awesome,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.352
no matter what anyway.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.354
I can't even believe
you right now.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:06.173
Hey Inojin is something wrong?

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:08.642
Huh? Why'd you ask?

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.545
Why else? Because you didn't
eat any of your fries.

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:12.513
Like I already told you,

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.349
I just got full from
the burger that's all.

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:16.817
And there's another thing too.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.952
You didn't even call
me Chubs back there.

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:22.089
Oh, Oh, I didn't huh?

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.524
Come on now just fess up.

00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:26.093
There's something
bothering you isn't there?

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:28.629
You're annoying.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:30.731
Nothing's going on.

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.807
Is it Shikadai?

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.842
What's that?

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.076
Is what Shikadai?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.712
Well I mean he did make
chunin before we did.

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:49.449
That stuff doesn't bother me.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.485
Okay all right.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.389
You know, lately I've been
doing a lot of thinking,

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:58.492
and I wanna refine the jutsu
that my dad passed down to me.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.994
Just like Shikadai
did with his jutsu.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.229
What's this about?

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:04.364
This doesn't sound like you.

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:07.100
Oh yeah well, you know
how the old saying goes,

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:09.436
a little bit of worrying
makes a girl cuter.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.207
No one says that.

00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:20.581
[Newscaster] - It was a
beautiful sunny day today,

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:22.115
in the Hidden Hill Village.

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.719
Mom, dad, well umm.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.688
Yes?

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.224
What is it Inojin?

00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:34.461
Could you help me train my
mind transfer jutsu tomorrow?

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.495
What?

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.532
Yeah, of course We'll help you.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.968
I'm just glad you're
finally stepping up.

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:43.437
Come on that really hurt.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.573
(bright upbeat music)

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:58.952
So auntie used mind transfer
jutsu on the tanuki?

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:00.721
Is that what happened just now?

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.856
Uh-huh mom's mind and spirit,

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.358
entered the tanuki's body.

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.760
And now it's completely
controlling it.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.863
Okay auntie now hear me out,

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:10.931
it's my day off,

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:12.499
but I'm still going
to help Inojin,

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:15.035
while he's out here doing
this training today.

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:16.603
You sure changed your
mind super quick,

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:19.673
when I told you that I
treat you to a burger.

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:21.708
Come on stop venting to my mom.

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:23.210
Take this seriously.

00:07:26.513 --> 00:07:29.550
You need to take it
seriously she said.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.318
What? No she didn't.

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:35.489
Yes I did.

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:42.329
Okay. Now it's your
turn to give it a try.

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:51.171
Ninja art, mind transfer jitsu.

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:57.344
Hey look seems like it worked.

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:04.618
Oh wow.

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:12.092
All right that's enough.

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:22.669
Not bad.

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:24.338
Well it's only a small animal,

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.340
so its spirit isn't that strong.

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:28.242
Next steps the real challenge.

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:31.578
Attempt to use the mind
transfer jutsu on Cho-cho.

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:33.547
Okay.

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.492
wow they smell so good.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.961
Those potato chips
are calling my name.

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:49.363
Try controlling Cho-Cho,

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.865
so that she can't get to
her favorite potato chips,

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:52.966
and eat them.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.535
Got it.

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:55.769
You really think

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:58.205
you'll be able to overcome my
deep love for potato chips.

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:02.209
Let's go on Ninja art,
mind transfer jutsu.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.052
Oh right I got her.

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:15.722
I wanna eat those potato chips,

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.324
and I'm gonna you hear me?

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:22.095
Damn it! She kicked
me out so quickly.

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:25.632
Try again.

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.038
Mind transfer jutsu.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:33.941
I wanna eat those potato chips,

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:36.176
and you aren't gonna stop me.

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.224
Don't stop yet,

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:52.059
it's too soon to quit Inojin.

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:02.336
Inojin, your willpower's
gotta be stronger,

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:03.937
than your opponent's willpower.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.439
That's the trick to it.

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:11.578
My Will's gotta be strong.

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:13.380
Your will to win,

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:15.082
Has gotta be stronger
than Cho-Cho's will

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.951
to get those potato
chips come on.

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:21.054
Potato chips.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.762
I got 'em hahaha.

00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:36.670
What! Seriously?

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:38.071
Come on again.

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.708
I can't, I'll never get it.

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:43.210
What are you saying?

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:46.079
Training is all about
overcoming your weaknesses.

00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:48.081
You don't just
throw in the towel.

00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:49.349
Okay? Calm down.

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:52.119
Inojin, want to switch gears,

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.321
and try super beast scroll?

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:56.323
Yeah, sure.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:59.359
Hey don't just barge into this,

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:01.495
I'm still in the middle
of training him here.

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:03.964
He's nowhere near close
to being finished.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.832
Fine but it's no
good overwhelming him

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.201
with this willpower talk.

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:09.503
I just don't think he's going
to be able to understand

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:11.505
until you explain
it to him logically.

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:15.375
What? strong willpower's
essential for this jutsu.

00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:18.812
Oh right that's not what
I was saying though.

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:21.181
That's enough Just
be quiet would you?

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:25.385
He's the one that came to us
wanting to do this you know,

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:28.255
that's why we need to
be strict about this.

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:31.091
Well, maybe you're right.

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:33.861
Then could you just
stop butting in already?

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:36.496
Inojin this is
kinda bad isn't it?

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:41.802
So I guess that auntie
is really upset, huh?

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:42.936
Yeah but at this point,

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.571
it's totally out of our hands.

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.840
And What about uncle?

00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:49.343
Is he going to blow
a fuse at some point?

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.545
I really doubt that'll happen.

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:52.946
It Kinda is your fault,

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.381
that they're fighting right now.

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.950
So you ought to do
something to stop it right?

00:11:56.984 --> 00:11:58.218
Seriously?

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:14.334
Oh man, this is bad.

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:30.317
Mom. dad, please stop this.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.187
Come on, please don't fight
over my training okay?

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.189
We're not fighting
about that now.

00:12:35.222 --> 00:12:37.958
This is something
between him and me.

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.527
Inojin, please just stay back.

00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:42.062
No, not, you too dad.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.697
Just get out of the way!

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.170
You're gonna have to do
something to stop them.

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:52.372
But what am I
supposed to do? Huh?

00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.142
What about that?

00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:57.377
try using the mind
transfer jutsu,

00:12:57.411 --> 00:12:58.412
don't you think?

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.681
What, just to stop my
parents from fighting?

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:04.418
I mean, is there
really any other way?

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:08.789
But that's, I mean I couldn't
even get it to work on you.

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:09.790
There's no possible way

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.458
that it'll work on mom and dad.

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:14.194
I just can't do it.
It's impossible.

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.036
Tell me Inojin how
come you always give up

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.671
before you even try?

00:13:32.613 --> 00:13:35.315
All right then you ready
to do this or what?

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:38.285
Or are you just going to stand
there looking down on me?

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.320
I'm not looking down on you.

00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:43.257
I just don't think
this is worth my time.

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:47.694
How dare you say that to me?

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.473
Oh boy uncle's Sai
just crossed the line.

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.507
This isn't good.

00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:02.176
Inojin?

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:03.177
Yeah all right, fine.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.012
Well go on then, hurry up.

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.247
Hey. I was just about to do it.

00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:11.919
I'm gonna stop my
mom's movements first.

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:14.521
Ninja art, mind transfer Jutsu.

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:28.368
What? You think you can use
mind transfer jutsu on me?

00:14:30.204 --> 00:14:33.006
Beat it you're on your league.

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:41.148
She's way too powerful.

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:45.652
I couldn't even make a dent,

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:47.554
in mom's mind and spirit.

00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:50.090
Then you just need to
use it on uncle Sai.

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:51.458
But even if I do that,

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:54.194
I'm probably just going to
get beaten up by my mom,

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:56.163
after I use the jutsu on my dad.

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.031
Whoever said you have to fight?

00:14:58.065 --> 00:14:59.166
Wait What?

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.767
Wouldn't a better
solution than fighting,

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:02.769
be making uncle
calm aunt Ino down,

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:04.137
by trying to use nice words,

00:15:04.171 --> 00:15:06.273
and actions on her instead?

00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:09.176
Like what kind of nice
words and actions?

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.410
Oh, well I guess this

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:13.013
might be too difficult
for you Inojin

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:14.081
No, that's not true.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:15.682
If I can just perform the jutsu

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:19.019
then I'll be able to calm
her down in 10 seconds flat.

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:20.621
Watch I'll handle this.

00:15:20.654 --> 00:15:22.122
Mind transfer jutsu.

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:27.995
Go get him.

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:29.763
Inojin?

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:31.298
Hey dad?

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:33.534
I'm gonna leave mom to you.

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.603
Sorry, but I give up.

00:15:36.637 --> 00:15:38.238
Okay dad, on it.

00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:45.379
I'm so sorry.

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:52.052
Begging right off the bat?

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:54.688
Seriously hands and knees huh?

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:56.557
Okay. Fine

00:15:57.558 --> 00:15:58.559
Yes! Success.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.328
But before I forgive you,

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:03.297
tell me what you did wrong.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.567
I wanna know that you know
why you're saying sorry.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.668
See, I knew it.

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:09.870
It's so obvious he's just
trying to end the fight,

00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:11.271
by saying sorry.

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:14.241
doing that's only made
it worse for himself.

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:18.278
Oh no what do I say?

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.884
You know, for uh, everything.

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:26.286
And just what you
mean by everything.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.056
Go on list each thing
you're apologizing for,

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:30.891
one after another.

00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:32.125
I can't do this.

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:42.603
Wait a minute.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:44.872
were you under Inojin's mind
transfer jutsu just now?

00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:47.574
You're unbelievable.

00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:49.877
Just cause you can't get
things under control,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.880
don't make our kid try
to clean up your mess.

00:16:52.913 --> 00:16:55.015
All that I've done
is make things worse.

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:57.351
Oh good grief what
are you doing?

00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:58.151
Like I said,

00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:00.020
I can't do this okay?

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:01.655
Look, are you serious
about stopping

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.656
auntie and uncle's fight,

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:03.690
or aren't you?

00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:06.293
I know that you can do this.

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:08.161
You just have to
put your mind to it

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.931
and not give up like usual.

00:17:10.964 --> 00:17:12.599
Just try it, give it
all that you've got.

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:15.135
I mean, what do you
really have to lose?

00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:19.039
If you can just stop
auntie from moving,

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:20.541
with your mind transfer jutsu,

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:23.043
I'll be able to take
care of uncle okay?

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:24.912
What do you mean by that?

00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:26.180
Just do it.

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.414
[Ino] Well guess again Mister.

00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:29.049
-Yeah all right.
-I'm never gonna forgive you.

00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:31.485
[Sai] That wasn't my
intent at all I swear.

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:32.686
Mind transfer jutsu.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.289
Guess you've been too busy
to come home for dinner,

00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:37.124
'cause you think I'm nagging.

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.394
You're really gonna
try this again Inojin?

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.296
Come on, go back.

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:44.531
Mind transfer isn't
going to work on me.

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:46.633
No way I can do it.

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:47.768
I need willpower,

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.436
stronger than my
opponent for this.

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:51.605
That's what you said
to me, right mom?

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:53.106
That that's the trick.

00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:56.810
Look right now,

00:17:56.844 --> 00:17:58.612
I seriously want
to stop the fight

00:17:58.645 --> 00:17:59.613
between you and dad,

00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:01.915
that started 'cause of me.

00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:04.484
I know I haven't been
able to completely

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:06.153
master this jutsu.

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:08.322
I always mess up
halfway through,

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:11.558
'cause I can't seem to
overpower my opponent's will.

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.030
But one time dad told me,

00:18:17.064 --> 00:18:19.299
when he was in trouble
a long time ago,

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:22.002
you saved him with
mind transfer.

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:24.638
The jutsu, passed down
through the Yamanaka clan.

00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:28.876
I wanna master the
mind transfer jutsu,

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:30.043
and make it my own,

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:31.678
so that I can help everybody.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.148
Inojin.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:43.557
He stopped aunt Ino.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:46.994
Uncle Sai,

00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:51.198
okay so, (whispers)

00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:52.900
What? you mean here and now?

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:53.901
Well if you don't,

00:18:53.934 --> 00:18:55.669
then this isn't going to end.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.005
I guess you're right.

00:18:58.038 --> 00:18:59.406
Yeah, of course I am.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.279
It's okay now Inojin.

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:21.061
So what exactly happened?

00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:23.030
All's well that
ends well I guess.

00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:25.899
And it's thanks to your
mind transfer jutsu.

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:27.100
Wait what?

00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:40.747
Anyway look at you Inojin,

00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:42.883
you were able to
use the jutsu on me.

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:44.618
You said I was out of my league,

00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:46.019
and not to bother.

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:48.155
Oh, well, no you did great.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:51.058
I could feel the strength of
your willpower surpass mine.

00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:53.460
It was a perfect
mind transfer jutsu.

00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:55.629
It looks like you've
figured it all out.

00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:56.630
Right dear?

00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:57.631
Don't you think?

00:19:57.664 --> 00:19:59.032
That's right.

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:06.974
[Ino] I was surprised.

00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:09.142
How about you?

00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:11.745
Yeah.

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:13.514
Well that ended up just great.

00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:15.649
I'll say.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.885
What's up?

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:19.920
Tomorrow, I'll treat
you to a burger.

00:20:19.953 --> 00:20:21.655
Just like I promised you.

00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:23.490
Awesome. Thanks.

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:24.892
Fries too.

00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:28.161
Really? Wow you're so generous.

00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:29.663
No shut up Chubs.

00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.266
Uh-huh there it is.

00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:43.544
[ Boruto] Are you serious?

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:46.046
Yep that's right. That's
the way the two of us

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:50.150
were able to end their fight,
just perfectly.

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:52.619
You used jutsu just for that.

00:20:52.653 --> 00:20:55.122
Yeah Well, I mean so what right?

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:00.294
Cho-Cho, it's all yours.

00:21:00.327 --> 00:21:02.796
Oh yes. I'm going
to dig right in.

00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:03.797
Thanks.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.066
Hey Inojin, so I heard,

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.002
that you refined your
mind transfer jutsu.

00:21:09.036 --> 00:21:10.871
That's amazing.

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:13.874
So can you give us a
little demonstration?

00:21:13.907 --> 00:21:17.044
What? No, I'm not going
to do it right here.

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:19.513
Come on we just want a peak.

00:21:19.546 --> 00:21:20.747
Yeah, come on do it.

00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:21.748
Show them,

00:21:21.782 --> 00:21:23.016
they wanna see it.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.017
Like I said,

00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:25.285
I don't wanna.

00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:30.157
Oh, don't be such a meanie.

00:21:38.232 --> 00:21:40.767
Mind transfer Jitsu complete.

00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:42.636
Guess she's not
gonna to get to eat

00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:44.137
these fries after all.

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:46.607
Inojin?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.008
So you switched?

00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:49.743
Yeah I finally did it.

00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.044
At last,

00:21:51.078 --> 00:21:53.347
I'm able to overpower Cho-Cho's
strong love for fries.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.515
Amazing.

00:21:55.449 --> 00:21:58.252
Well, I think that's
probably enough for now.

00:22:01.054 --> 00:22:03.290
Oh man, fries are so good.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.972
(closing theme music)

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.358
Boruto Uzumaki,

00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:47.561
You've committed a serious
crime unbecoming of a Shinobi.

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:50.030
So you've been sent
here to Hozuki Castle.

00:23:50.063 --> 00:23:52.065
Wait, I haven't done anything.

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.200
No excuses.

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:54.434
Once you serve your time,

00:23:54.468 --> 00:23:56.036
and show that you've
been rehabilitated,

00:23:56.069 --> 00:23:57.037
you'll be free.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.505
Until then, reflect on

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:00.274
and atone for your crimes.

00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:03.610
[Boruto] Next time on
Boruto Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:03.644 --> 00:24:04.878
The Shinobi Prison.

00:24:04.912 --> 00:24:06.013
Hozuki castle.

00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:08.515
[Boruto] I'm telling
you I'm not a criminal.

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:17.124
(closing theme music)
