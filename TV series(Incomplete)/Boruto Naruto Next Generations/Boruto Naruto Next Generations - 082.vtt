That's right! This place is
well known back in our village.

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:37.865
So we made a special trip to
come here, ya know!

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:40.534
This place is really that well
known, huh?

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:41.335
[ALL] Of course!

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:45.172
Well then, I'd better do my
best to make you guys happy!

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.675
(RELIEVED SIGH)

00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:51.845
<i>Wow, that was delicious!</i>

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:54.681
Okay, now what'll it be for
dessert!

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:56.250
You're seriously gonna eat
more?!

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:58.418
All right, we've mostly had our
fill...

00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:02.089
so now how do we go about
finding this Ohnoki guy?

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.091
Well, he's the former
Tsuchikage...

00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:07.127
so maybe we should
try the Tsuchikage's office?

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.664
It's risky. One mistake And we
could end up like this.

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:14.968
Oh, man. We really don't know
where Old Man Ohnoki could be?

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:17.337
Here you go. One Rocky ice
cream.

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:20.073
Huh? But we didn't order that!

00:12:20.107 --> 00:12:23.010
She liked the food so much
that, well...

00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:25.412
...I just thought... have
some on the house!

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.814
Wow, thanks! You're just the
best, gramps!

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:32.419
I hope it's okay to ask, but...
You kids know about Lord Ohnoki?

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:35.189
Huh? Well, yeah! Of course we
do!

00:12:35.222 --> 00:12:38.792
Ohnoki the Fence-Sitter is a
famous hero in the shinobi world

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:40.627
from the Fourth Great Ninja War!

00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:41.461
Yeah, that's right!

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:44.598
I'm impressed that a young'n
knows so much about him!

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:47.100
Most kids these days don't have
any idea...

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:50.237
about Lord Ohnoki and
how great he is!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.441
But I... I have the utmost
respect for Lord Ohnoki...

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:55.576
who despite his age...

00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:58.245
<i>...fought so hard to protect</i>
<i>all of us...</i>

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.248
during the Fourth Great Ninja
<i>War.</i>

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.650
Can't believe that old man did
that...

00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:07.855
We owe Lord Ohnoki for the peace
we are currently enjoying.

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.790
I think these young'ns
today...

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:10.924
...oughta be more grateful
to him

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.960
for all that he's done for us!

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:14.695
He sounds just as incredible as
we imagined.

00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:17.598
Oh, ho! So you get it, too?!

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.100
All right, then! For that, you
get to have another

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.768
Rocky ice cream on the house!

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:23.103
Oh, yeah! That reminds me!

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.772
No one's seen Lord Ohnoki around
much recently.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.074
I wonder where he could be.

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:28.942
[OLD MAN] <i>Hm?</i>

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.844
If I'm not mistaken, ever since
he retired...

00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:32.246
...he hardly ever leaves his
home.

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:36.183
'Cause an old ailment of
his got worse.

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:37.818
(CURIOUS)

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:40.320
Oh, really? Is that so?

00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:42.923
And his house is somewhere down
on the south side...

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:43.924
isn't that right?

00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:45.792
What are you talking about?!

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:49.196
I can tell ya right where he
lives.

00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:54.001
Now we know exactly where to
find him!

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.670
Yeah, so let's head over there
right away!

00:13:56.703 --> 00:13:58.172
You can thank me
anytime you want!

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:00.841
What? Thank you?

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.943
Yeah! It's all thanks to my
stomach...

00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:05.078
that we figured out where we can
find him!

00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:08.148
Huh?! Seriously!? All
you did was eat some food!

00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:10.517
[CHO-CHO] <i>You were eating too,</i>
<i>you know, Boruto!</i>

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:18.759
(CURIOUS)

00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:20.294
[INOJIN] <i>Hey, Akuta!</i>

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:22.296
(NOTICING)

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:25.532
Come on... How many times do I
have to tell you to stay inside?

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:28.669
(DISAPPOINTED)

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:31.305
(CONSIDERING)

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:34.074
You don't really seem to like
being called by the name

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.576
the enemy gave you.

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:38.078
Okay, then... I'll come up with
a name for you...

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:40.447
but you gotta do as I tell you.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.348
(CONFUSED)

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.821
AKKUN

00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:49.356
Okay, I think that's good
enough.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.092
So which one do you like?

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:54.761
Your fate is entirely in your
own hands right now.

00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:56.630
(LEAPING)

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:57.497
[INOJIN] <i>Dorobozu?</i>

00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.532
(RECONSIDERING)

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.701
<i>Hedorokamen?</i>

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:02.202
(HESITANT)

00:15:02.503 --> 00:15:03.504
<i>No?</i>

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:07.174
Iwatchi!

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:10.978
Akkun?

00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:12.212
(EXCITED)

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.749
Huh? That's the one you like?

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:17.284
Akkyoon!

00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:18.218
(LAUGHTER)

00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:19.953
Well, then...

00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:22.256
since you decided and picked all
on your own...

00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:24.591
from here on out, you'll be
"Akkun."

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:27.261
Akkun! (HAPPY)

00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:30.097
[INOJIN] <i>He sure is a strange</i>
<i>one, though...</i>

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.798
<i>I thought he was an</i>
<i>enemy...</i>

00:15:31.832 --> 00:15:33.600
<i>'cause of how he came at us,</i>
<i>but...</i>

00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:36.103
(HAPPY)

00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:39.506
(STARTLED) Hey! Don't step on
me! C'mon!

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:46.513
So this is where the old man
lives...

00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:50.184
<i>Stop there!</i>

00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:55.522
(SHOCKED)

00:15:56.356 --> 00:16:02.095
(WORRIED)

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.363
Not good, not good!

00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:06.533
Ah ha! You must be Boruto,
right?

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:10.304
It's just as the Hokage relayed
to us, eh?

00:16:10.337 --> 00:16:13.507
Huh?! What?! I don't get it.
What are you talking about?

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:17.911
The Hokage called us to let us
know...

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:19.746
that you guys might be
coming here...

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.281
...to the Land of Earth.

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:22.216
(GASP)

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.053
Soon after... Kurotsuchi just
vanished into thin air.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.188
The Tsuchikage did?!

00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:31.124
But, wait... Wouldn't the
Tsuchikage's disappearance...

00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:33.760
...have caused chaos and panic
throughout the village?

00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:36.697
The cover story is that she's
gone away on a recon mission.

00:16:37.531 --> 00:16:38.799
Although...

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:41.268
Kurotsuchi has never gone away
without telling me first...

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:44.071
... and I doubt she did this
time, either.

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:45.939
I was walking through the
streets

00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:47.774
trying to figure out what to
do...

00:16:47.808 --> 00:16:48.742
...when I heard something.

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:49.676
(REALIZING)

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:52.513
(PROUD CHUCKLE)

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.083
(CHUCKLE) I was caught
completely by surprise...

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:58.452
...when I discovered that you
were already here...

00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:00.320
inside the village!

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:02.489
We're sorry... we should've
asked permission first.

00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:06.660
It's fine. Thanks to you, I
have some useful intel.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:11.131
Kokuyou and Sekiei... I'm
absolutely certain of it.

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:14.134
Those two have something to
do with what's going on here.

00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:16.904
Akatsuchi... I came all the way
to the Stone...

00:17:16.937 --> 00:17:20.407
...because I thought that Old
Man Ohnoki could help us out.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.408
And as we speak,

00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:25.179
my friend could be in seriously
big trouble.

00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:30.684
So, please! Will you take us to
see Old Man Ohnoki?

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:32.186
Boruto...

00:17:33.187 --> 00:17:34.421
[AKATSUCHI] <i>You're right,</i>
<i>Boruto.</i>

00:17:34.454 --> 00:17:35.422
(SURPRISED)

00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:37.791
I, too, think it would be
best...

00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:39.259
...if we were to go and seek
out...

00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:41.595
Lord Ohnoki's help in this
matter.

00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:44.264
And besides, I think that he'd
be overjoyed...

00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:47.401
...to see someone that he's
invited has come to visit him.

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:48.335
Akatsuchi!

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:50.771
(HAPPY)

00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:53.006
Is Lord Ohnoki here right now?

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.475
Sorry. But I'm afraid that
he's not.

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:59.079
I think that he might be down in
the old part of town.

00:17:59.112 --> 00:18:00.180
The old part of town?

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:02.416
It isn't very far from here.

00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:05.519
I can take you guys there right
now.

00:18:14.695 --> 00:18:16.230
[AKATSUCHI] <i>Lord Ohnoki!</i>

00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:19.533
Akatsuchi?

00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:22.169
I thought that I might find you
here.

00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:24.304
What's up?

00:18:24.338 --> 00:18:27.407
Did you come to check on me to
see if I'm all right?

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:30.210
Well, yes, that, too, but... I
brought some guests.

00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:36.216
(SHOCKED) Wait, it's- it's you!

00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:40.354
Hey, Old Man!

00:18:40.387 --> 00:18:42.689
B- But what are you doing here
in the Stone?

00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:45.526
We came here to ask you for your
help.

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:47.694
My help?

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:52.366
We're out of our depth by
ourselves, so we need you.

00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:56.970
And besides, I do remember you
saying we could come any time.

00:18:57.004 --> 00:19:01.041
Oh, yes. I did say that. I
can't deny it.

00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:03.277
I suppose that I...

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:07.114
just never thought you'd
actually come such a long way.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:10.050
I know! And we had a super
hard time getting here, too!

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:12.319
Yes, I bet you did!

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.922
But just as I'd expect of
Naruto's son...

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:17.090
you nonetheless made it all the
way here!

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:19.259
(PROUD CHUCKLE)

00:19:19.293 --> 00:19:22.062
And Sarada's here, too! It's
great to see you once again!

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:23.363
Yes!

00:19:24.198 --> 00:19:26.500
(PLEASED CHUCKLE)

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:27.768
You must all be tired.

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:31.405
You're welcome to come stay at
my residence and rest.

00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:34.241
Akatsuchi, treat them as my
important guests.

00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:37.344
Sorry, but we don't have
time to relax, Old Man.

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:38.679
Hm?

00:19:39.546 --> 00:19:41.248
Do you remember Mitsuki?

00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.083
He left the Leaf Village...

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:45.419
and joined up with some
Stone shinobi.

00:19:45.452 --> 00:19:46.353
(CONCERNED)

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.792
And we've all come here to bring
him back to the Leaf.

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:54.261
Mitsuki is somewhere in the Land
of Earth.

00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:57.531
That's why we came to see you
and ask for your help, Old Man.

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:01.969
(TAKEN BACK)

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:04.404
I don't think I'll be able
to help you...

00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:08.075
with any of that. Sorry, but I
just can't.

00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:11.011
What? You gotta be kidding me!

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.280
Look, anything you can tell us
will help out!

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:17.484
Akatsuchi, I'll be fine here
all by myself for a while.

00:20:17.518 --> 00:20:21.021
Please see these young people
back to the Leaf, personally.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:23.257
But what made you change your
mind?

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.425
You just said they were
important guests!

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:27.694
Yeah, that's right! What's
going on?!

00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:29.429
Yes, I'd like to know that, too!

00:20:29.463 --> 00:20:32.099
Something strange has
definitely been happening here

00:20:32.132 --> 00:20:33.200
...in the village!

00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:35.569
Please, sir! I'd really like you
to help Boruto!

00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:39.339
No, I won't. All of them need
to go back home to the Leaf!

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.511
Why, Old Man! Tell me!

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:51.351
Why won't you tell me anything?!

00:20:54.388 --> 00:20:55.189
What the?!

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.492
(MENACING GROWL)

00:20:58.525 --> 00:21:00.194
Is that-?! (GASP)

00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:02.462
Akuta?!

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:05.098
(GROWLS)

00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:07.167
What are these guys doing here?!

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:09.903
Akatsuchi, they're really
dangerous!

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:11.738
Let's protect the Old Man!

00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:14.274
You got it! (NOTICING) What-?!

00:21:14.308 --> 00:21:15.209
(SHOCKED)

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:19.680
Who are you?

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:22.683
Hey, stop!

00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:31.191
Lord Ohnoki, he's behind you!

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:40.200
(GASP)

00:21:44.004 --> 00:21:46.507

It can't be...!

[BORUTO] <i>What is going on, Old</i>
<i>Man?!</i>

00:23:46.293 --> 00:23:48.428
[OHNOKI] <i>I'm doing this</i>
<i>for your sake.</i>

I'm doing all of this for the

[BORUTO] <i>What does all this have</i>
<i>to do Mitsuki?</i>

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:55.102
Why'd you take him away from us?

00:23:55.135 --> 00:23:56.270
<i>Just give him back!</i>

00:23:57.538 --> 00:23:59.306

"Ohnoki's Justice"

00:24:04.478 --> 00:24:07.247
[OHNOKI] You see... Mitsuki's
cooperation will be essential...

00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.683
<i>...if we're going to</i>
<i>make the plan work...</i>
