WEBVTT

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:16.483
(KAGURA) <i>In the past, Yagura,</i>
<i>the Fourth Mizukage... ruled</i>
<i>this village through fear.</i>

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.549
<i>I am Yagura's grandson.</i>

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:25.049
The blood of that mass murderer
<i>courses through my veins.</i>

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:30.883
I could never succeed him as one
of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen and
<i>lead this village.</i>

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:33.783
<i>I should be satisfied to be</i>
<i>Chojuro's aide.</i>

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.316
<i>At least, that's what I</i>
<i>thought...</i>

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:38.949
<i>...until I met...</i>

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:41.949
<i>Boruto Uzumaki.</i>

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:52.949
[grunt]

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.249
The test... to wield the
Hiramekarei Swords...

00:00:57.283 --> 00:00:59.316
I would like to take it.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:50.249
I believe I am ready to wield
Hiramekarei, the Great Twin
Swords.

00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:53.249
I would like to take the test.

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:56.383
You would, would you? I'm glad
to hear it, Kagura.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:59.416
Before you were born, our
village in the Land of Water was

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.549
involved in a conflict known as
the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.316
By the end of that war...

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.749
more than a fifth of the men
and women fighting for the
Allied Shinobi Forces

00:03:07.783 --> 00:03:09.549
fell and were lost.

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.883
I have nothing but the greatest
respect for you,

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:15.116
and for all who fought so
bravely to end the war.

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.483
There were many shinobi who
sacrificed themselves to make
that outcome possible.

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:25.116
They all believed in and shared
the same vision for the future.

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.883
A future where each and every
village and villager had a
stake.

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:32.283
<i>And that is why... I want to</i>
<i>pass on the Hiramekarei...</i>

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:35.549
<i>to a young shinobi who</i>
<i>can carry that torch.</i>

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.483
I'm sure those who went before
us would agree.

00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:47.616
I will take the utmost care of
it.

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:02.316
Hiramekarei... the Great Twin
Swords.

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:18.283
[grunts]

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.549
(BORUTO) <i>Pretty sweet sword you</i>
<i>got there.</i>

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:32.349
So what's up? Why'd you want to
see me so late, huh?

00:04:32.383 --> 00:04:37.783
Sorry about that. I wanted you
to see this before I showed it
to anybody else.

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:38.949
Huh?

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:42.383
The person entrusted with the
possession of these swords...

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:45.716
will be the one to forge the
future of our village.

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.216
Boruto... your words helped me
come to my decision.

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.849
Aw, c'mon, I didn't do anything
really!

00:04:51.883 --> 00:04:54.549
Not so. You spoke the truth.

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:56.883
In the end, blood ties aren't
what matters.

00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:59.949
I'm the only one who can
choose how to live my life.

00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:01.749
That sounds great, Kagura!

00:05:01.783 --> 00:05:05.549
If you're gonna be the village
leader, then I know it'll be in
good hands.

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:08.749
I only hope I can live up to
such a great honor.

00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:11.249
Oh I completely guarantee you
will.

00:05:11.283 --> 00:05:12.983
You're gonna be awesome!

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:16.649
It's strange, but just hearing
you say that makes me believe I
can do it.

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.949
Well, I'm a good judge of
people, ya know.

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.616
[laughing]

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:26.483
[chuckling]

00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:29.316
[gasps]

00:05:29.783 --> 00:05:30.683
[groans]

00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:32.783
[panicking]

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:34.483
[snarl]

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:43.916
It's been a while since we
met... Huh, Kagura?

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.116
[gasp] It's you!

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:46.783
Huh? Ah!

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:49.983
What're you doing?!

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.449
Shizuma, sir!

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:55.549
Hello, Kagura... And there's
Boruto Uzumaki with you!

00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:58.383
[gasp] Wait. You were with the
guys at the harbor!

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:01.016
My name's Shizuma Hoshigaki.

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:06.549
It seems some of my errand boys
caused you a bit of trouble
yesterday. So sorry.

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:09.883
Does that mean the guys who
kidnapped Denki answer to you?

00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:13.249
Well! We ended up beating them
all at their own game anyway.

00:06:13.283 --> 00:06:15.716
It seems the younger ones are
quite riled up.

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.783
And I blame all of it on the
senseless reconciliation policy.

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:21.316
[irritated grunt]

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.949
So why'd you decide to come here
tonight? You've sure got a funny
way of introducing yourself.

00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:27.449
Mr. Shizuma...

00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:28.283
Hm?

00:06:29.416 --> 00:06:31.283
Seeing what happened during your
most recent mission...

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:33.316
shouldn't you be showing
more self‐restraint?

00:06:33.816 --> 00:06:34.449
Yet here you‐‐

00:06:35.883 --> 00:06:38.483
That's not really how it works.
One must cast off their
self‐restraint.

00:06:38.983 --> 00:06:39.783
[speechless]

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.083
Yeah‐ I totally agree with that
line of thinking!

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:44.883
And after all...

00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:48.449
it won't be long before we don't
have to take orders from our
current Mizukage.

00:06:48.483 --> 00:06:49.216
Hm?

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:50.616
What exactly do you mean?

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:56.483
What else could I mean? The time
has finally come for a war to
reclaim our dignity.

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:58.449
What did you just say?

00:06:58.483 --> 00:07:02.249
Ah, come off it! You've gotta be
crazy or half‐asleep!

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:03.316
[seething]

00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:05.949
[grunt]

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:10.749
Oh, I'm perfectly sane and
these eyes are wide open.

00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:16.316
Kagura... you now have the Great
Twin Swords. It is time for you
<i>to act.</i>

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:22.016
We kill the Hokage's son first,
and then we declare war.

00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:25.783
What?! That's insane! There's
not gonna be any war!

00:07:25.816 --> 00:07:27.649
He's right, Mr. Shizuma!

00:07:27.683 --> 00:07:31.016
The world has only just started
down the path to peace.

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:34.349
And I am determined to use this
sword to further that purpose.

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:40.716
"The path to peace"? Don't be so
naive‐ Mei Terumi and Chojuro
are merely stringing you along.

00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:43.183
I believe Lord Chojuro; he's a
noble man.

00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:48.549
This village was once ensnared
in chaos and he's doing all he
can to keep it peaceful.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:51.216
That's exactly what he want's
you to believe.

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:54.049
Let me tell you the truth. It's
all for show!

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:57.783
Chojuro has his own plan:
to get rid of everyone who
doesn't agree with him.

00:07:58.416 --> 00:07:59.483
Impossible...

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:05.249
Countless villagers were scarred
by the war and every day their
suffering continues.

00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:07.883
<i>Don't tell me this is news to</i>
<i>you.</i>

00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:10.749
I know you, Kagura... and how
you've suffered.

00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:14.283
You've endured so much more than
anyone else in the village.

00:08:14.783 --> 00:08:16.949
[taken aback]

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:18.916
[stunned groan]

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:21.283
[trembling]

00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:22.916
[powering up yell]

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:31.249
[grunts and groans]

00:08:31.283 --> 00:08:32.783
I give up... please!

00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:34.216
[growl]

00:08:34.249 --> 00:08:35.849
Ahhh!

00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:36.483
[grunt]

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:38.916
[gasps]

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:40.783
[whimpering]

00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:45.283
[grunting and growling]

00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:47.383
[straining]

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:50.483
[shocked gasp]

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:56.383
Stop, Kagura. That's quite
enough...

00:08:56.416 --> 00:08:57.983
[worried breaths]

00:08:58.016 --> 00:09:00.083
(SHINOBI) <i>Kagura, what on earth</i>
<i>are you doing?!</i>

00:09:00.116 --> 00:09:02.749
Sh‐Shizuma, sir, I...

00:09:02.783 --> 00:09:04.116
He's got Yagura's blood.

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:07.349
Everyone know's he's the
grandson of that horrible mass
murderer.

00:09:07.383 --> 00:09:11.283
(STUDENT) <i>How could Lord Chojuro</i>
<i>let a guy like that into the</i>
<i>Academy?</i>

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:14.949
(SHINOBI) <i>When he wields the</i>
sword, he loses control and
<i>goes berserk.</i>

00:09:14.983 --> 00:09:19.483
Even if he does have the
skills... we can't endorse a
shinobi like him...

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:25.549
What am I... What am I?!

00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:27.216
(SHIZUMA) <i>You're the way you</i>
<i>should be.</i>

00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:29.049
[gasp]

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:33.216
Fighting to kill is the one true
way of the Blood Mist shinobi.

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:35.483
There's nothing wrong with you
at all...

00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:37.283
Kagura Karatachi.

00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:39.949
Really, Mr. Shizuma...?

00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:41.649
[gasp]

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:48.316
One day very soon we will usher
in a new age. And we will need
warriors just like you.

00:09:48.783 --> 00:09:50.549
[gasp and tremble]

00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:54.483
Kagura... I will always be there
to protect you.

00:09:56.283 --> 00:09:59.283
[trembling breaths]

00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:01.483
[grunt]

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:06.116
Mr. Shizuma! I know you've
defended me for many years and
I'll always be grateful.

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:10.183
But you've reached a point where
I cannot go along with you.

00:10:10.216 --> 00:10:13.549
If you keep inciting this kind
of trouble throughout the
village...

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:16.183
I'll be forced to obey
orders and punish you.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:22.216
Punish me? [chuckle] The only
person you really need to be
punishing is Chojuro.

00:10:22.249 --> 00:10:23.316
[gasp]

00:10:24.283 --> 00:10:24.783
[wincing]

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:29.483
Chojuro's the one. He's been
using assassins to get rid of
insurgents.

00:10:30.283 --> 00:10:31.283
[gasp]

00:10:31.316 --> 00:10:33.283
Hey! Kagura! What's going on?

00:10:35.316 --> 00:10:37.383
It never made sense to you, did
it?

00:10:37.416 --> 00:10:39.716
There was never any way this
kind of "reform"

00:10:39.749 --> 00:10:42.183
would be possible in
the Blood Mist Village.

00:10:42.216 --> 00:10:46.949
He may appear to be calm and
righteous, but behind the
scenes, he is ruthless.

00:10:47.249 --> 00:10:48.583
Huh?

00:10:48.616 --> 00:10:50.249
The proof is quite undeniable.

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:54.083
My clan's name is no longer on
any of the memorials. Do you
know why?

00:10:54.116 --> 00:10:58.249
The current regime wants to
simply erase every vestige of
those villagers

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.983
who were once considered
a nuisance.

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:03.083
The same goes for your family.

00:11:03.116 --> 00:11:03.783
[gasp]

00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:06.916
We will fight so that those
whose very existence

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:09.916
has been unjustly erased can
finally rest in peace!

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:11.483
Now come along, Kagura.

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:16.349
Remember this?

00:11:18.283 --> 00:11:20.249
[gasps]

00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:22.516
This is the scar you gave me.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:28.549
Ever since that day, I've looked
out for you. No matter how hard
you try to change...

00:11:28.583 --> 00:11:31.283
you will always belong with me.

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:33.949
[overwhelmed breaths]

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:36.783
Kagura, what's the matter?!

00:11:37.283 --> 00:11:38.549
Look old man...

00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:42.083
Old man? I may not look it, but
I'm only 18

00:11:42.116 --> 00:11:42.783
[taken aback]

00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:45.083
Whatever, knock it off.

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:47.583
Don't try to fill my friend's
head with all your ridiculous
nonsense.

00:11:47.616 --> 00:11:49.649
You think I'm making it all up?

00:11:49.683 --> 00:11:52.183
You can't even begin to tell the
truth from nonsense

00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:54.249
because you've been nothing
but pampered your whole life.

00:11:54.283 --> 00:11:55.483
Just shut up!

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:56.283
[chuckle]

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:57.283
[powering up]

00:11:57.983 --> 00:11:58.783
[grunt]

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:04.749
What is it? Have I done
something to upset you?

00:12:04.783 --> 00:12:05.949
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:09.449
Time to give it a try...

00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:12.816
[grunts]

00:12:18.249 --> 00:12:19.283
Really?

00:12:20.716 --> 00:12:23.049
You like that‐ you can't deflect
those with your sword, now can
you?!

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:27.783
Hmph! That's more like it. It's
not worth killing you if it's so
easy.

00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:29.283
Shizuma!

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:33.316
[chuckle] You will address me as
"Mister Shizuma!"

00:12:36.283 --> 00:12:37.316
Address these!

00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:38.449
[grunts]

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:39.949
Buntan.

00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:43.783
Huh?!

00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:46.549
This childish Lightning Style of
yours is nothing.

00:12:46.583 --> 00:12:49.449
It doesn't compare in any way to
the real thing, kid.

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:53.249
(SHIZUMA) <i>Ichirota.</i>

00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:54.383
Right here.

00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:55.483
(SHIZUMA) <i>Hassaku.</i>

00:12:55.783 --> 00:12:56.916
Here!

00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:58.249
(SHIZUMA) <i>Hebiichigo.</i>

00:12:58.283 --> 00:12:59.549
Here and awaiting your orders!

00:12:59.583 --> 00:13:01.849
Who the hell are all these guys?

00:13:01.883 --> 00:13:02.483
(SHIZUMA) <i>Kyoho.</i>

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.016
(KYOHO) [powering up yell]

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:06.316
Whoah!

00:13:08.816 --> 00:13:09.949
Ahhh!

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.949
[grunt] You really had to summon
all of them?

00:13:13.983 --> 00:13:18.483
It's my way of showing the
Hokage's son a little respect
before he meets his death.

00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:20.949
Enough messing around.

00:13:21.749 --> 00:13:24.116
I know more than Lightning
Style.

00:13:24.149 --> 00:13:25.949
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:13:30.116 --> 00:13:34.283
And now this!... My own attack
Lethal Boruto Stream!

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:35.316
[grunt]

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:40.483
[powering up yell]

00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:41.616
Water Style.

00:13:42.116 --> 00:13:43.383
Water Forge Jutsu.

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:44.283
[pained grunt]

00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:50.949
[pained grunt]

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:58.549
[chuckle] That was your "Lethal
Boruto Stream"? You almost had
me scared.

00:13:58.583 --> 00:14:01.216
He's so completely pitiful, it's
not even funny.

00:14:01.249 --> 00:14:02.949
Oh, look at the poor thing.

00:14:02.983 --> 00:14:06.216
It's so sad; he doesn't even
have the sense to realize he's
about to die.

00:14:06.249 --> 00:14:07.316
[pained groan]

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:12.316
This is exactly what the term
"fighting to kill" means.

00:14:12.349 --> 00:14:14.283
He paid a high price to
learn it.

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:17.183
Boruto![grunting]

00:14:17.216 --> 00:14:18.216
[gasping]

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:19.949
[gasps and coughs]

00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:22.149
Now let me make this clear...

00:14:22.183 --> 00:14:26.649
You are looking at the new Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Blood
Mist!

00:14:27.483 --> 00:14:27.949
Ha!

00:14:29.116 --> 00:14:31.549
Too bad there's only six of you!

00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:34.483
Oh. You still don't understand,
do you...

00:14:35.283 --> 00:14:37.483
Kagura... Kill the bastard.

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:38.283
[speechless]

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:45.316
Are you saying... I'm the
Seventh?

00:14:49.983 --> 00:14:50.283
[stunned]

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:57.683
In the lands around the
Middle Sea, villagers are
feeling tense.

00:14:57.716 --> 00:15:02.649
<i>The flames of war could ignite</i>
<i>any moment. If the son of the</i>
<i>Hokage were to be killed...</i>

00:15:02.683 --> 00:15:06.049
<i>it wouldn't only sink the</i>
<i>peace treaty, but lead to war.</i>

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:10.249
In the chaos that will surely
erupt, we shall measure out
Heaven's punishment.

00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:12.383
Yes, that is correct.

00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:14.449
We would go to war again?

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.283
What? The old man's not coming
home again?

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:21.549
It sure looks that way.

00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:24.083
But the reason your father works
so hard is because

00:15:24.116 --> 00:15:27.549
he's doing the best he can to
make sure you two live in peace.

00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:30.483
<i>He wants there to never be</i>
<i>another war.</i>

00:15:32.416 --> 00:15:34.116
You've got to be completely
crazy.

00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:39.216
As if I would ever let another
war happen. Absolutely not!
[pained groan]

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:40.283
Mm?

00:15:41.283 --> 00:15:42.783
You still have enough strength
to keep talking?

00:15:43.416 --> 00:15:44.949
Get on with it, Kagura.

00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:47.783
[grunts]

00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:52.283
[stunned groan]

00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:54.483
Kagura...

00:15:56.116 --> 00:15:59.783
You made the decision to accept
that sword for the good of all
<i>your village.</i>

00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:03.783
You can't just let guys like
<i>this change your mind!</i>

00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:07.349
That's right. That's the way
forward, Kagura.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:13.283
And I will keep on protecting
you just like I always have.
Huh?!

00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:17.283
Why you little‐! [grunt]

00:16:20.283 --> 00:16:21.549
Mr. Shizuma...

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.549
Are you telling me you'll forge
a future that

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:26.349
is more just than the one
we are trying to build now?

00:16:26.383 --> 00:16:31.283
On my life, I swear it's the
truth. And I don't plan to end
my life in disgrace.

00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:34.783
Go, Boruto, get out.

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:36.783
But, Kagura...

00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:39.216
My hands...

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:42.549
Like my blades... Are blood
stained.

00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:45.883
And I don't want... to have to
kill you.

00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:48.216
You gotta be kidding, don't be
so naive!

00:16:48.249 --> 00:16:53.483
No, it's alright. My dear friend
has drawn his sword but it's
only in order to make a request.

00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:54.783
[grunt]

00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:59.083
(SHIZUMA) <i>And since Kagura's of</i>
<i>a certain mind, if we were to</i>
<i>take him on...</i>

00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:00.916
<i>we'd be the ones</i>
<i>cut dow.</i>

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:01.783
[gasp]

00:17:04.249 --> 00:17:06.216
[trembling breaths]

00:17:06.249 --> 00:17:07.283
Huh?

00:17:08.516 --> 00:17:11.216
(SHIZUMA) <i>Your life's been</i>
<i>spared, Hokage's son.</i>

00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:16.316
Now go tell your father... Go
tell him the revolution has
already begun!

00:17:17.616 --> 00:17:18.483
Let's go.

00:17:23.283 --> 00:17:25.316
[troubled breath] Kagura don't
go!

00:17:27.983 --> 00:17:28.316
[sigh]

00:17:32.216 --> 00:17:36.949
I will always be the grandson of
Yagura... that is who I am.

00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:43.783
Kagura, no! [pained groans]

00:17:50.449 --> 00:17:55.316
Boruto... Boruto. Boruto!

00:17:56.649 --> 00:17:58.583
Uh...

00:17:58.616 --> 00:17:59.916
Sarada...

00:17:59.949 --> 00:18:01.916
Oh, thank goodness you're awake.

00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:05.383
How in the world did you know I
was‐ [pained groan]

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:07.216
Please be careful

00:18:07.249 --> 00:18:09.316
I knew because he came to tell
me.

00:18:10.249 --> 00:18:11.949
Um... Hey...

00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:16.916
I know who you are! You're just
a thug, one of those guys who
works for Shizuma!

00:18:16.949 --> 00:18:17.483
[pained groan]

00:18:17.949 --> 00:18:19.283
[gasp]

00:18:19.816 --> 00:18:21.649
No! Not anymore I'm not!

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.183
What? What the heck does that
mean?

00:18:24.216 --> 00:18:26.716
They beat him up so badly he ran
away from them.

00:18:26.749 --> 00:18:29.749
Seems the Shizuma guy had just
been using him from the start

00:18:29.783 --> 00:18:32.216
and once he was done with him,
he assaulted him.

00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:35.049
[quivering] Th‐that's when
Sarada found me;

00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:38.283
she was the one who treated my
wounds! I owe you guys my life!

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:40.283
[sigh]

00:18:40.316 --> 00:18:43.116
Boruto! Just what the heck were
you doing?!

00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:44.383
[sheepish moan]

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:47.049
I‐I'm so sorry!
I really didn't know!

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:51.716
I had no idea Mr. Shizuma
was actually gonna try to start
a real war. I swear!

00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:54.283
That's it? Not knowing clears
you of guilt?

00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:58.016
[quivering] But‐but he
just kept telling us that
we were all going

00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:01.249
to do something real great
together. I admired that.

00:19:01.283 --> 00:19:01.949
[crying]

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:06.216
I thought I told you that you
were not to cause any trouble
during our field trip.

00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:08.416
So now what are we
supposed to do?

00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:11.316
The one thing that has to be
done... ya know?

00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:17.016
I have to go find Kagura and
save him.

00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:19.149
How are you gonna do that?

00:19:19.183 --> 00:19:22.316
[sobbing]

00:19:25.449 --> 00:19:29.049
Hmmm... Shizuma Hoshigaki?

00:19:29.083 --> 00:19:33.883
Well he's definitely got skills,
but he was always more famous
for his bad behavior.

00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:36.949
And now this guy's gonna stage a
coup d'etat?

00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:37.949
Hm?

00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:44.283
So you slipped away?

00:19:45.949 --> 00:19:46.783
Huh.

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:50.749
So it was this Shizuma fellow
who took Kagura as his hostage?

00:19:50.783 --> 00:19:51.849
No.

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:52.616
Huh?

00:19:53.849 --> 00:19:56.016
Not as a hostage; they were
trying to get him to join them.

00:19:56.049 --> 00:19:56.949
What?!

00:19:58.283 --> 00:20:02.483
Hey... So, Hachiya! What
happened between Kagura and
Shizuma?!

00:20:03.249 --> 00:20:03.816
[deep breath]

00:20:05.216 --> 00:20:08.249
I don't think Kagura will be
able to defy Mr. Shizuma no
matter what!

00:20:08.283 --> 00:20:09.316
Why not?

00:20:10.449 --> 00:20:13.583
Because years ago... Kagura hurt
Mr. Shizuma really bad.

00:20:13.616 --> 00:20:17.883
[gasp] So that's how he got that
scar.

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:21.716
Kagura is a very powerful
swordsman. That much is
obvious.

00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:26.183
Problem is he just can't control
his emotions. He's been
traumatized...

00:20:26.216 --> 00:20:31.516
Explains why Kagura doesn't like
using swords. Well, I guess it's
as good a reason as any.

00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:35.649
If Kagura still feels a sense of
obligation because he once
injured the guy...

00:20:35.683 --> 00:20:39.249
Shizuma might be able to use
that weakness to manipulate him.

00:20:39.283 --> 00:20:42.049
Mr. Shizuma wouldn't hesitate to
do that.

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:46.249
Taking advantage of someone
else's feelings... That's
heartless‐!

00:20:46.283 --> 00:20:48.483
We have to notify all the sensei
right now!

00:20:49.283 --> 00:20:50.283
Uh...

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:52.816
Don't give me that look! You
can't be serious!

00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:56.549
I'm sorry, Sarada. But this
one's my call as the trip
leader.

00:20:56.583 --> 00:20:58.783
Nothing bad's gonna
happen on my watch.

00:21:01.249 --> 00:21:02.283
[sigh]

00:21:03.949 --> 00:21:07.016
It's useless trying to stop you.
So I guess I'll just have to go
with you then, huh!

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:07.949
Wait‐ what?!

00:21:09.516 --> 00:21:11.749
Well, you know it is my
responsibility to keep an eye on
you during this trip.

00:21:11.783 --> 00:21:14.949
And my job is not finished...
till the trip is over.

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:17.383
Unfortunately for me.

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:21.516
Listen, I'll never forgive
myself for the things I've done
to Kagura.

00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:22.483
Ehhh...

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:26.549
Alright, then! The three of us
are gonna have to save Kagura
together!

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.716
Even if we can keep this all a
secret,

00:21:28.749 --> 00:21:31.383
what happens if those other
guys start stirring up more
trouble...

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:34.016
Oh, no! You think there'll
really be a war?!

00:21:34.049 --> 00:21:37.316
Don't get panicky. I've already
come up with an idea.

00:21:37.616 --> 00:21:38.616
Mm?

00:21:38.649 --> 00:21:39.783
Uh‐huh...

00:21:41.116 --> 00:21:44.416
Now listen up... This thing
isn't the beginning of any
war...

00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:46.449
Just a fight between us and
them!

00:22:02.516 --> 00:22:04.383
[grunt]

00:22:04.416 --> 00:22:08.483
[snickering] Alright. It's time
to get this war started!

00:22:09.616 --> 00:22:12.283
[snickering]

00:23:46.783 --> 00:23:49.783
<i>Now we have the right blade to</i>
<i>start our revolution.</i>

00:23:49.816 --> 00:23:54.349
(KAGURA) <i>This sword has grown</i>
<i>even heavier. Perhaps, I don't</i>
<i>have the right to wield it.</i>

00:23:54.383 --> 00:23:57.749
(SHIZUMA) <i>The noble blood of the</i>
<i>great Lord Yagura flows within</i>
<i>you.</i>

00:23:57.783 --> 00:24:01.083
<i>To be the next Mizukage</i>
<i>is your destiny.</i>

00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:02.949
(KAGURA) <i>We cannot change the</i>
<i>past.</i>

00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:09.383
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto:</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations! "The</i>
<i>New Seven Ninja Swordsmen!"</i>

00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:10.916
(SHIZUMA) <i>I'll build you a new</i>
<i>village...</i>

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:15.316
<i>one the blood coursing through</i>
<i>your veins can be proud of!</i>
