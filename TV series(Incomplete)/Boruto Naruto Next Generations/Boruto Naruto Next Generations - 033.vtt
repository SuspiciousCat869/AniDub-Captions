WEBVTT

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.017
All right!

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.952
Inojin? Do you have a minute?

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.253
What's up?

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.856
The Academy has an event coming
up where I

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.726
Huh? What are you doing? Making
drawings?

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.864
Oh, all of this? It's so tedious
having to draw every time we get
into a battle so...

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.666
I decided I'd make copies in
advance.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.901
It's much more efficient than
starting from scratch.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.003
Now how's that for a great idea?

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.672
But that's...I mean...

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.507
(INOJIN) I've been thinking
about it for a while now.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.809
Drawing pictures each and every
time is boring...

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:45.879
So I thought there had to be a
better way to get it done.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.948
Doesn't that make
perfect sense, Dad?

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.115
No, well actually...

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.685
(INO) Inojin!... Honey!...Time
for dinner!

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.754
Coming!

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.690
We're starting practical skill
sessions to prepare for
graduation exams.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:00.126
I'm gonna use these during
Ino‐Shika‐Cho training tomorrow.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.595
Well, traditionally...

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.996
Just wait until I try it.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:05.632
There's more than one way of
doing things.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.302
C'mon, we'd better get
downstairs. Or we'll both hear
it from Mom.

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:12.773
(Sigh)

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.076
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.312
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.649
If that's really all you got,
you'll never beat me.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.352
Gotcha now!

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:29.523
Hmmm

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.626
(struggling)

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.328
(gasp)

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:39.633
And away
ya go!
Whaaaat?

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.101
Huh?

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.138
(moaning)

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:49.576
Hmm... Your fighting strategies
are becoming much too
predictable.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.745
And you're not even
infusing your chakra.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.447
It's not fair when we're up
against your brute strength.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.483
Hey! I've got something really
good up my sleeve!

00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:59.553
(Cho‐Cho) Well, show us, Inojin!

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.655
Just watch this!

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.158
Super Beast Scroll!

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.595
Very interesting.

00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:12.332
Huh?

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:13.299
Huh?

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.938
(Cho‐Cho) That's it? úThat was
your great move?!

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.075
Well that was weird. Why
wouldn't a copy of the drawing
work?

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:22.976
(CHOJI) Pay attention!

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.144
huh?

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.278
(Panicked Yelps)

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.014
I get that it's a drag, but
can't you get your act
together?

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:30.584
Yeah...But drawing is a drag.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.220
Super Beast Scroll!

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:41.161
What? My Super Beast Scroll
doesn't work anymore?

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.739
Why couldn't I get the Super
Beast Scroll to work?

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.742
Wasn't this drawing good enough?

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:37.878
No.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:43.650
That isn't the reason I wasn't
able to do the jutsu. And I know
I infused enough chakra...

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.752
And if the problem really is
with the copy,

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.822
then it's weird that it won't
work when I draw it from
scratch.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.991
(SAI) Well, that's probably the
reason.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:51.858
What?

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:53.727
What are you saying?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.032
(SAI) Why don't you enter this
competition?

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:02.035
(INOJIN) Why would I want to
enter an art contest for little
kids?

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:04.671
It's pointless. I don't want to
do something like that at my
age.

00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:09.242
But forget about that ‐ just
tell me why can't I do my
Super Beast Scroll anymore.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:11.978
You must know a bunch of ways to
fix it, right?

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:16.149
Nothing I say is going to help.
Advice alone won't solve this
problem.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:20.754
You must find the answer,
Inojin, and you must find it for
yourself.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:21.888
(confused)

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.961
I wish Dad could just give me a
straight answer.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.897
Why can't he just tell me what
I'm doing wrong already?

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:33.567
Fine. I'll just have to win this
thing then, right?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.270
Not that I know why that would
make a difference.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:41.041
Beating little kids at an art
contest will hardly be a
challenge.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:49.415
Wha ‐!!!

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.352
(INOJIN) Himawari Uzumaki?!

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.089
(INOJIN) Okay what Is going on
here?!

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:59.392
My drawing is obviously much
better than hers...

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:02.362
(SAI) But Himawari's drawing is
really quite good.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.497
No, her drawing is really quite
awful.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.033
And yet Himawari has just won
the contest.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:11.237
Oh, that's it‐I get it now. This
is all about having the right
connections.

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.473
Sure, she's the Hokage's
daughter.

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:17.377
I hope he doesn't get this
carried away every time he
wants to show her off. Damn!

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.579
(disappointed)

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:21.515
So... Did that have some kinda
hidden meaning?

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.717
No. ú I guess it didn't have any
meaning.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.485
Huh?

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.495
At this rate... you might find
you'll never be able to use the
Super Beast Scroll again.

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:37.898
Huh?!

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:42.335
However, if you still want the
ability to perform the Super
Beast Scroll...

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:49.009
Think about Himawari's drawing.
Then think about your own. And
consider how they are different.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:50.944
(confused)

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.322
(INOJIN) I just don't get it.

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.357
What does he mean by
"different"?

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.961
They're different because one's
really good and one's really
bad.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.362
(Knock at the door)

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.864
Yeah?

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:11.665
(INOJIN) What's up?

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:16.136
I know the timing may seem bad
and I apologize in advance...

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:22.375
(SHINO) Starting today, Sai will
be coming in as a guest
lecturer.

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:23.443
Hello, class.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.445
Why does Dad have to do this?

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.247
When you are on tracking
missions,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.951
there will be times when you
will need to draw maps or even
people.

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:33.486
If the drawings aren't
reasonably good, they'll be
useless.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.258
I draw quite often, so I will
evaluate your completed work ú
at the end of every lesson.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:42.295
Today you will be drawing a
fellow classmate's portrait.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.064
Ahhh.

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:47.467
All right then! I'm going to ask
the pretty girl in the back to
be our model.

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.836
Pretty? I'm pretty?!

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.907
Umm... He just called Cho‐Cho
"pretty." Your dad's super
weird.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.676
You don't even know.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:08:00.581
Okay, everyone! I give you
permission to draw my gorgeous
body to your heart's content.

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:03.617
Here...you...go!

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.989
Dad. What's all this about?

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:14.928
I'm really sorry. This is just a
coincidence. Shino invited me
many months ago.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.362
Yeah, whatever.

00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:20.166
To be honest, I think this might
actually be a good opportunity
for you.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.434
Hmm?

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:23.169
I'm done!

00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:26.239
Yeah! It turned out just the way
I wanted it to.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.941
Let's see it then...

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.013
I gotta say that is genuinely
interesting.

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:36.016
You mean genuinely awful. A
complete fail.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.953
You've gotta be kidding! I think
it's pretty good. Look at it
from this angle.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:44.525
Huh? Which angle? I could draw
upside down with my foot and it
would look better than this.

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:48.094
It's fun and interesting. I
rather like it.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:48.729
(disbelief)

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:49.830
You see?

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:52.599
(pensive agreement)

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:55.902
Judging by this attempt, I think
you could possibly do the Super
Beast Scroll Boruto.

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:59.573
You think so?! Maybe I should
start practicing.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:05.546
Do the Super Beast Scroll? With
<i>a terrible drawing like that?</i>

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:15.822
(sigh)

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:18.925
Super Beast Scroll!

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:26.299
Damn it! Why can't I do it
anymore?

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:32.072
Think about Himawari's drawing.
Then think about your own. And
consider how they are different.

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.775
So it doesn't really matter if a
drawing is good or bad?

00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:37.944
Should I Just keep a stack of
Boruto's drawings ready to go?

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.714
No! That would be no different
than working with copies.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:44.417
And I don't know why but they
don't work for the Super Beast
Scroll...

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.719
Aw man!

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:49.189
(CHO‐CHO) Hmm... This is an
unusual sight.

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:52.425
What's unusual?

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:56.630
Seeing you all worked up. You
generally keep your cool
especially out in public.

00:09:56.663 --> 00:10:01.434
I can't hold back. If I can't
get a bag of my potato chips
right when I want them,

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:06.406
I start hating them, even though
I totally love them. So I
understand!

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.409
It kinda hurts your pride to
love something so much, right?

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:14.414
You're nuts! You couldn't be any
more wrong about me, chubs!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:19.853
I'm not upset about this at all.
I don't care if I never do the
Super Beast Scroll again!

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.658
I may be chubby but I've still
got moves!

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.828
Hey, you're forgetting all of
your stuff!

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:32.265
I've realized drawing only makes
me feel irritated. I'm over it.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.268
Super Beast Scroll isn't the
only jutsu around you know.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:39.506
I'm just gonna start using my
mom's jutsu from now on. See ya
around, chubs!

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.575
(worried)

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:44.277
Uh, you are so obvious.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.814
(SHINO) From this point on, you
will be fighting only in
three‐man teams.

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:52.485
Teams who perform poorly ú may
not qualify to take the
graduation exams.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:53.887
(worried murmurings)

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.489
So try not to lose your focus.

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:57.958
(frustrated)

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:07.000
Okay, guys. Those three have
been rolling through everybody
lately

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.569
so they're gonna be trouble.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:10.571
I hope you're up to this,
Inojin.

00:11:10.604 --> 00:11:12.839
I'll be fine this time. I'm
ready for 'em.

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:14.575
All right. Start with your Super
Beast Scroll.

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:16.076
Just watch over my body, okay?

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:17.343
Huh? Wait! What do you mean by
that?

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:18.044
The team battle...

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:19.513
...begins!

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:20.514
Ninja Art!

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:23.183
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:25.519
(surprised)

00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:26.286
(surprised gasp)

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.154
Uh? Hey?! Inojin?

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:33.594
(confused exhale) What was that
about?

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:35.562
You good, Iwabe?

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:40.867
Oh, yeah. I'm good alright. I'm
thinkin' we should've been using
this technique all along.

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:43.937
I... I think Iwabe's smiling
too much...

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.907
<i>Okay. What shall I do for my</i>
<i>next move?</i>

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:49.475
(pain grimace)

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.611
(quick or grimace)

00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.879
(shocked) What is happening
now?!

00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:55.448
Is he using Aunty Ino's jutsu?

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:56.316
(coming around)

00:11:56.349 --> 00:11:57.884
You see the problem?

00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:01.087
You haven't practiced that one
anywhere near enough to infuse
chakra properly.

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.122
(groan)

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.890
You've really done it this
time...

00:12:03.924 --> 00:12:06.092
Now we will show them how it is
done!

00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:07.594
Yeah. Let's go!

00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:08.328
Right!

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:12.766
Watch out!

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:15.502
(METAL) Haa!

00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:17.337
huh!

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.140
Damn it!

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.108
Humph! How's that?

00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:26.312
They're trying to split the
three of us up. Ready, Inojin?

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:27.280
Hello?!

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:30.684
(CHO‐CHO) Inojin!

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:31.885
Huh?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.921
Don't just sit there in a daze.
Draw! Do it now!

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.158
(stealing himself)

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:47.668
uhh...

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.302
You are open!

00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:57.844
[panting]

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.380
Team Iwabe wins the match!

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:01.014
All right!

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.649
We were successful, Denki!

00:13:02.683 --> 00:13:04.184
I never dreamed we would really
win!

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:09.623
I guess their team improved and
our team didn't. What a drag.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:13.259
Just what has been going on
with you? You haven't been
yourself lately.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:18.398
What's gonna happen if someone
who loves potato chips finds out
they can't have them anymore?

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.303
(INO) How did Inojin do in
class?

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.038
(SAI) He seemed bored.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.777
He actually came to me this
morning and asked me to teach
him the Mind Transfer Jutsu.

00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:35.115
I'm afraid he's going to
completely give up. Isn't there
any advice you could give him?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.619
As he loses interest, his
results will just get worse,
right?

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:43.824
It's a conundrum. But he has to
discover the truth for himself,
otherwise he will never learn.

00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:45.325
But what if...

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:45.759
ohh...

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:47.561
It will be fine.

00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:49.262
Because he is our son.

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:55.869
W‐What are you doing? Just stop
it with all that stuff!

00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:59.005
I connect with people through
my art.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:01.742
That's why I love to draw.

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:04.545
You know maybe you should tell
Inojin that...

00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:08.715
Tell him? I don't really need to
spell it out for him, do I?

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:09.883
(laughs)

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:12.753
You're as oblivious as ever.

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:15.689
Well! The sooner you tell him
the better!

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:16.623
Hmm?

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:26.900
(surprised murmurings)

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:28.001
What is going on?!

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.003
[happy short chuckle]

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:32.739
Why's Himawari in our class?

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:35.041
Her drawing won the art contest.

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:37.778
So I asked her to come and teach
here today.

00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:40.480
Big Brother, I get to be your
instructor!

00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:42.048
If Boruto's her big brother...

00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:43.750
She's his little sister?!

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:46.052
She's just too cute!

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.288
I never expected him to bring
her here...

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:50.857
Your dad just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:55.261
You entered your drawing in a
contest, so you must enjoy
creating art.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.763
Yes! I love it!

00:14:56.797 --> 00:15:01.134
And there's nothing more fun in
the world than making drawings
of my dad!

00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:02.569
Humph...

00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:06.507
Inojin, don't you have any
questions you want to ask
Himawari Sensei?

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.741
No, I'm good.

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.409
Himawari!

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:12.813
Inojin's drawings actually move!
Because his jutsu makes them
amazing!

00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:15.782
They really move? How awesome!

00:15:15.816 --> 00:15:17.751
Let her see how it works. Draw
something.

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:18.652
(curious murmurings)

00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:19.953
(HIMAWARI) I wanna see! Show me!

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:21.822
(nervous)

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:23.624
(yawn)

00:15:23.657 --> 00:15:27.460
I'm sorry. I'm not really
interested in drawing anymore.

00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:29.630
Why not?

00:15:29.663 --> 00:15:33.299
I just realized I never had any
talent for art in the first
place, not really.

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:34.601
What?!

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:38.371
Let him be, Himawari...
Inojin's going through a rough
patch.

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:39.806
Ohh...

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.341
I understand.

00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:56.256
You're throwing them away? All
of them?

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.292
It's not like I need to hold on
to them anymore.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:02.295
So... How did Himawari do today?

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:07.367
She kept asking me to draw. I
told her my drawings really
weren't that interesting.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.203
You may think that way right now
but you're wrong.

00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:12.839
They don't move and they don't
win any prizes...

00:16:12.873 --> 00:16:15.141
It's a waste of time for me to
keep at it.

00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:19.713
It was just something I was good
at, that's all. Ahhh...

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:21.515
Nah, I was pretty bad.

00:16:21.548 --> 00:16:22.883
(INO)
(chuckle)

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:25.852
Well, you drew that when you
were little! Do you remember
that?

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:30.123
I couldn't believe how happy
your dad got when you showed him
that drawing.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.735
This made him happy?

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:46.439
It brings back memories. And
it's drawn really well, you
know...

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:58.685
That move completely took me by
surprise! After that, Metal took
me aside and he said...

00:16:58.719 --> 00:16:59.520
(INOJIN)
Boruto!

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:00.420
Hmm?

00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:03.289
Do you have a minute?

00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:04.925
Hmm?

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.260
He wants to become my pupil?

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:08.361
Uh...

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.363
He wants you to teach him what
you know about art.

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:16.402
I've got a lot of questions and
I really need answers! So I'm
serious... Please teach me!

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:17.904
Okay then...

00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:19.472
What do I to do now?

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:21.274
Uhh...

00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:25.411
Well, Hima...Why don't you tell
us what you think about when
you're working on your drawings?

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:27.347
I think about...

00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:30.283
Daddy!

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.252
(BORUTO)
What?! You think about
Dad?!

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:36.990
Of course. When I put my entire
heart into my drawings Daddy
always thinks they're great!

00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:38.792
Uhh...

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:45.899
<i>The difference between our</i>
<i>drawings? Is this what Dad was</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:48.635
C'mon! Let's draw something
together!

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:49.636
Uhh...

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:53.139
What's wrong? Don't you wanna
draw anymore?

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:54.474
Well I'm...

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:57.911
Hey, I believe Himawari
Sensei just asked you to draw!

00:17:57.944 --> 00:18:01.081
I did! So you better start
drawing, Inojin!

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:02.783
(INOJIN)
O‐Okay...

00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:05.752
(determined grunt)

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:06.653
(BORUTO)
Here you go!

00:18:06.687 --> 00:18:07.621
Huh?

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:10.423
Sensei chose this to be your
reference today.

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:11.792
All right!

00:18:12.492 --> 00:18:15.629
Ahh, very nice brushwork there!

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:17.263
(Grunt)

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:19.566
Super Beast Scroll!

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:21.968
Ahh!?!

00:18:22.002 --> 00:18:24.237
Not good! At this rate...

00:18:25.806 --> 00:18:26.940
Huh?!

00:18:26.973 --> 00:18:27.541
My drawing of Daddy!

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:28.609
(Gasp)

00:18:28.642 --> 00:18:30.176
(determined grunt)

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:33.780
Ahh!

00:18:33.814 --> 00:18:34.948
Damn!

00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:36.382
Come back!

00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:38.384
(runnings)

00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:44.257
(light panting as she runs)

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.960
(BORUTO)
Find it?

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:47.794
No luck!

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:49.062
(HIMAWARI)
Big Brother!

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:50.196
Huh?

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:52.599
(gasp)

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.168
It's gonna fall in!

00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:56.369
(BORUTO)
Don't worry!

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:08.314
<i>(INOJIN)</i>
<i>Is Himawari's drawing...</i>

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:11.284
<i>(INOJIN)</i>
<i>the same as the drawing</i>
<i>I made copies of?</i>

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:14.220
<i>(INOJIN)</i>
<i>Or is her drawing...</i>

00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:17.457
<i>(INOJIN)</i>
<i>the same as the new</i>
<i>drawing I did for the contest?</i>

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:22.763
<i>(INOJIN)</i>
<i>No, hers is different!</i>

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:30.136
<i>(INOJIN)</i>
<i>Her drawing is full of</i>
<i>emotion!</i>

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.405
<i>(INOJIN)</i>
<i>I can't let it get lost!</i>
<i>No way!</i>

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:35.942
<i>It's okay! I'll get it right!</i>

00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:38.612
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:39.713
Ahh!

00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:49.856
That's amazing!

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.593
His drawing is really moving!

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.196
(chuckle)

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.433
Here you go. Your drawing is
safe now!

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.668
(HIMAWARI)
Thank you!

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:05.038
No need. I'm the one who should
be thanking you!

00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:07.407
Hey...Can you make my drawing
move?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.876
Uh, well...I úI don't know...

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.578
Come on! Do it! Do it!

00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:13.046
But... But I ...

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.615
(BORUTO)
Yea why not?

00:20:14.648 --> 00:20:15.081
Uh...

00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:16.349
(chuckle)

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:19.219
Okay now...

00:20:19.252 --> 00:20:20.854
Super Beast Scroll!

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.624
(laughs)

00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:25.158
Wow!

00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:27.427
Now this is super awesome!

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.133
(happy laughter)
Amazing!

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:35.869
Man, it really is a fun, happy
drawing!

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:40.006
Huh? I didn't hear you! I want
you to make more drawings that
move!

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.642
(chuckle)

00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:44.277
Whatever you want!

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:49.716
<i>Thank you, Sensei! Thanks to</i>
you, I finally remembered what's
<i>important.</i>

00:20:52.953 --> 00:20:55.388
(surprised)

00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:59.459
You've regained your ability?

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:02.328
I guess I'd just been thinking
about it all wrong.

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:05.031
Art is more than just the means
to do a jutsu.

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:08.902
You should only draw things that
mean something to you.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:12.472
When I was desperately trying to
save Himawari's drawing...

00:21:12.506 --> 00:21:15.542
I could feel chakra passing
right into mine.

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:20.814
Anyhow... I failed so many
times, I'm probably the last
person who should explain it.

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:28.589
Of all the drawings in the
world, this is my favorite.

00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:33.326
I knew you'd be able to do it
again, because you drew this.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.062
And I think you'll be fine, from
now on.

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:37.598
(surprised)

00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:40.534
(Chuckle)

00:23:15.295 --> 00:23:17.197
Huh?!

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.400
You mean the people in your
drawing disappeared and never
came back?

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:21.868
Uh‐huh!

00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:24.137
This happened because I used the
Super Beast Scroll...

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.772
I'm so sorry!

00:23:25.806 --> 00:23:27.440
No, it's okay!

00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:29.075
Huh? Are you sure about that?

00:23:29.109 --> 00:23:31.978
Of course it is 'cause I can
always make another drawing!

00:23:32.012 --> 00:23:35.415
And Daddy will be even happier
with the next one!

00:23:35.448 --> 00:23:37.250
You've still got a lot to teach
me, Sensei!

00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:41.722
You think so? Then let's draw
some more! Something even more
fun this time!

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.057
All right then! Let's get
drawing!

00:23:47.628 --> 00:23:51.765
(BORUTO) Man, I hate this kinda
stuff! Everyone's so serious
about training.

00:23:51.798 --> 00:23:53.834
(BORUTO) No one wants to just
hang out anymore!

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:55.802
(BORUTO) I just don't get what
the big deal about graduation
is.

00:23:55.836 --> 00:23:58.238
(SARADA) It must be nice, not
having to worry.

00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:01.074
(SARADA) Everybody else has a
lot to deal with right now.

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:02.676
(SARADA) You probably shouldn't
bother them.

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:05.245
(BORUTO) But friendship is
supposed to be eternal, right?

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:09.816
(BORUTO) Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations: The
Night of the Shooting Stars.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.720
(SARADA) I think you might be
the only one who believes
that...
