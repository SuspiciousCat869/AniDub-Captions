00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:56.056
[howling]

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.230
You don't have to
talk to me like that

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.199
just because
we were a little late!

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.701
The whole reason that
we're late is

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.102
because you lost the map!

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.537
Seriously!

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.839
Well, maybe we should've
simply let

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:54.808
Sarada lead the way.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.476
Come on!
I said I was sorry!

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.111
Stop ganging up
on me, guys!

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.245
[annoyed grunting]

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:00.947
[giggling]

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.951
Hey! Class Rep!

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:05.351
Huh?

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.022
I'm not the class rep
anymore, though.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.657
Oh! Right!

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.392
So, you heading over
to Ms. Suika's?

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:12.492
Yeah.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.196
We just got back
after finishing a mission.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.463
But thanks to
a certain someone,

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.399
it took a lot longer
than it had to.

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:20.634
I said I was sorry!

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.935
Yeah, kinda.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.136
[giggling]

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.638
You get along so well!

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.772
What?! How?!

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.842
Like that! See?

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:29.409
Hmph!

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:31.377
Mm!

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:38.151
Our mission is to
capture animals?!

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.253
That's right!
Or actually,

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.356
to recapture the animals
that escaped from Fire Park.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.692
That's the request
we received.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.294
To locate all of the animals
and capture them.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.896
I think that'd be
a perfect mission

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.364
for our team!

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.999
Yeah? You think so?

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.367
I do! I love animals!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.436
It sounds like
a whole lot of fun!

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.971
Doesn't it, Wasabi?

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.405
Yeah, it does!

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.473
Wow!

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.308
It's been so long
since I've gotten

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.178
a positive reaction
after assigning a mission.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.680
Usually it's...

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.181
<i>What?!</i>
<i>Don't you have anything</i>

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.316
<i>more exciting</i>
<i>to give us?!</i>

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.217
<i>[sighing]</i>

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.853
<i>Man, what a drag.</i>

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:15.756
But now, thanks to
the three of you girls,

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.093
I've been reminded of just how
worthwhile my job actually is!

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.361
[giggling]

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:22.629
Well, anyway,

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:24.798
here are the details
of the mission.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.069
Hmm...

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.504
So, someone stole the keys

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:34.007
and opened the cages in
the animal enclosure.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.242
That's what
the report says...

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.578
And do we know why?

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.146
The reason behind it
is still a mystery.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.048
Oh. I understand...

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:43.550
All of the animals that
escaped were

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.152
born and raised right
there in the park.

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:47.453
So it's going to be
difficult for them

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.222
to adjust to life in the wild.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.757
Ah!

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.760
Well, then we have to
find them as soon as possible!

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.629
Yes, please do!

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:56.362
Uh...

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.497
So, this is the list of

00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:59.900
all the escaped
animals, huh...?

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.234
Well, at first glance,

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:03.269
I don't see any
dangerous animals here.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.971
So you can handle
this yourselves!

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:05.371
Huh?!

00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:09.342
Handle it ourselves?!
But, Hanabi Sensei...

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.644
I want the three of you

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.513
to complete this mission
all by yourselves.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:13.880
I think you're ready

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.249
to tackle something
like this on your own.

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.784
Huh?!

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:21.988
It'll all be just fine!
I'm sure you guys can do it!

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:23.323
[hesitating]

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:25.025
Right!

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.192
Listen...

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.427
Of course,
skill and technique

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.095
are very important on
a mission,

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.631
but the most important
thing of all

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.933
is your trust in each other.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.067
Yes! Understood!

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.069
[sighing]

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.541
Oh! Hey, Sai!

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.677
How are things with
Team 15?

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.146
Or, rather,
with Sumire Kakei?

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.347
Good!

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.815
She's used to
going on missions.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.551
She's doing great!

<i>‐ Yes, sir!</i>

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:55.756

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.358

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.878
<i>Thanks!</i>

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.380
Even back then,

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.848
you still had faith
in Sumire,

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.984
so you made sure to bring
her back into the Academy.

00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:25.318
And I have to say,

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.320
I think that it was
really good for her.

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:28.354
Yes.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.690
Although,
the Gozu Tennou

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.492
hasn't been completely
extinguished yet.

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.294
So we still have
to be careful.

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.495
Yes.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.599
Also... What about
the other two?

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:40.200
Do they know that Nue
is the same one

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.735
from the incident?

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:45.238
No...I don't think that
she's told them yet.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.473
Do you think maybe
I should go ahead

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:49.576
and talk to the two
of them about it?

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.678
I believe that soon
they'll realize

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:53.346
the true importance of
working together

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.315
as a team on missions.

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.017
Maybe for a little
while longer,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.219
you should just stand by
and watch over them.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.787
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:03.690
Heh.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:05.225
I think
you'll do fine.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:05.526
Huh?

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:10.697
Keep up the good work,
looking after Team 15.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.970
[city chattering]

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:21.107
We're supposed to trust
in each other, huh?

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:22.442
But how can we when

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.645
I haven't
told them everything?

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:27.848
I guess I gotta
be honest with them.

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:28.649
But then...

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.522
No way! I have to focus
on the mission right now!

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:38.124
And do whatever I can

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:39.526
to help out my team!

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.794
Yeah, that's right!

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.198
[birds chirping]

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.035
Well, so far...

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.872
We haven't been able to locate
any of the escaped animals.

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:53.039
But I'm sure

00:07:53.073 --> 00:07:55.609
that they must be hiding
around here somewhere!

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.410
Yeah! Actually...

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.980
I've been to Fire Park
a bunch of times before.

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:03.083
There were always so many
cute animals to see in there!

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:06.553
It's no wonder you know
so much about it!

00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:08.421
But who would do this
to the animals?

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.423
I mean, releasing them
into the wild like this

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.726
is just such
an awful prank to pull!

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:14.561
Like Hanabi Sensei told us,

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:16.296
we have to find all of
the animals quickly,

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.764
the poor things!

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:24.104
So, um...

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:28.575
Huh? What are those, Sumire?

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:30.877
Well, these suits are supposed
to mask the scent

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:34.080
that humans
give off, so, uh...

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.883
If we wear these things,

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.452
then it's gonna be harder
for the animals to sense us?

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:39.886
Is that it?

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:44.390
But, uh...
Isn't transformation faster?

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:45.526
Oh, yeah!

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.160
I guess
you're right, huh?!

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.328
Mmm...

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.296
They are pretty
cute, though.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.932
Ahhh!

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:55.602
I guess that doing this wasn't
such a good idea, after all,

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:57.538
huh?! I messed up.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:04.511
Don't tell me you made
these suits all by yourself!

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:05.746
Yeah...

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.681
But I didn't have
a whole lotta time,

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.483
so they didn't turn out
all that well.

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:11.885
Hmmm...

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.119
Hmm!

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:16.557
I think these'll work great!

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.824
They will!

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.027
Really?

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:25.265
Okay! Now let's go catch
those animals!

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:34.875
[animals squeaking]

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.948
It says six Taiko Tanuki...

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:46.352
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.321
Yup! Got 'em!

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:50.190
We've sure caught
a lot already!

00:09:50.223 --> 00:09:53.694
Yeah, we're getting
this done really fast!

00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:56.062
I think it's thanks
to these.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:10:00.133
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm so glad you like them.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:00.734
Shh!

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.811
Let's see...

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:13.479
Found it!
It's this one!

00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:14.848
The Pseudo Hare.

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:17.618
Oh! There it is!

catch the female one.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:41.407
[screeching]

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.546
Hey, are you okay?

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:46.713
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:47.881
Female Pseudo Hares
are known

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:49.983
to instinctively protect
the males.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:52.418
You have to catch
the female first.

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:54.020
Why didn't you tell me
that sooner?!

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:54.955
Oh...

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.190
Well, I meant to,
but then, uh‐‐

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:59.826
Something caught me
off guard, and...

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.563
Besides, you weren't even
listening at all, Wasabi!

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:04.064
You just jumped in there!

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:04.965
[grunting]

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:07.333
So‐

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:10.971
Hey, guys, why don't
we take a little break, okay?

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.207
I, uh...I made some lunch
for us to eat!

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.142
[peeps]

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:20.013
I...might've...
made a bit too much,

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:22.883
So please, have as much
as you want.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.552
Thanks! I'd love some!

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:27.954
How 'bout a little lunch,
Wasabi?

00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:28.755
[grunting]

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.391
Mmm.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:33.393
Umm...

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:38.131
Hey! All that's left
is the Miniature Monkey.

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:39.199
Oh.

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:41.735
That one seems to
be pretty intelligent,

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:43.637
so it might be
more difficult.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.106
We're really gonna have
to work together!

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:47.107
What?!
Arrrrgh.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.307
Huh?

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:51.211
My omelet was right there,
but now it's gone!

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:53.947
I was really looking forward
to eating it.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.849
Namida, you ate it,
didn't you?

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.652
No way! I'd never do
something like that!

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.687
Then why's it
missing now, huh?!

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:03.023
How would I know?!

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:03.990
[growling]

00:12:04.024 --> 00:12:04.457
Ah!

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.959
Hey...

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:08.962
Please, you guys, just
hold on for a second, okay?!

00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:09.362
Huh?

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:10.931
[gasping]

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:14.668
That's the one!

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:15.536
Huh?

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.003
[hooting]

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.339
Quick! Get it!

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:20.306
Right!

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.542
[animals squealing]

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:23.944
[birds squawking]

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:35.689
I wonder where
that monkey went...

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:36.857
It sure is fast!

00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:39.760
Leave it to me, okay?

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:43.897
Ninja Art! Cat Cloak!

00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:50.904
Hm.

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:53.507
[sniffing]

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.776
The scent of
the Miniature Monkey.

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:56.910
This way!

00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.212
Wait, hold on!

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:00.647
[panting]

00:13:00.681 --> 00:13:02.549
[panting]

00:13:02.583 --> 00:13:04.084
Where is it?

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:04.618
Oh!

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:06.019
[running]

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.454

[slowing down]

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:17.731
I've reached my limit.

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:20.233
[grunting]

00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:23.870
Are you okay,
Wasabi?!

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.371
Did you find it?

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.273
Ow, man,
that super hurt...

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.577
I was just about to
grab the little guy, too!

00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:34.147
What I need now is a cat
that runs a little bit faster.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.718
All right!

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:39.419
Listen, shouldn't
all of us

00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:42.088
just figure out a strategy
together instead?

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:45.225
No, this'll be fine.
Just be quiet, Namida!

00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:46.159
But I‐‐

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:48.629
Come on!
Look, just shut up!

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.531
[whimpering]

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.032
Oh, great...

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.668
It's so annoying when
you start bawling like that.

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:55.135
[whimpering]

00:13:56.469 --> 00:13:59.472
Wait, just hold on, you guys!
Please don't fight!

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.641
We're not fighting.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.175
This is just Namida,

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:05.912
having another one of
her little crying fits again.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.648
Wasabi, you've been
so mean to me since

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.950
what happened back there.

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:12.385
I don't even
care anymore!

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:13.587
Namida, wait!

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.320
Hmph.

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:19.459
Who knew there were some
animals missing from the list!

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:22.796
I hope Sumire and the others
are doing okay out here...

[monkey eating]

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.981

Sumire and Wasabi.

Um...
Hey, so, uh, Wasabi...

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:26.727
Yeah, what is it?

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.393
[lightly grunting]

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.830
You're thinking that
we shouldn't be

00:15:29.863 --> 00:15:31.598
fighting over
trivial things.

00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:32.833
Is that right?

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:34.535
Yeah...kinda.

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:37.704
Well, it's not trivial!

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:39.272
Because Namida is
always choking up

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.341
at the most
important times!

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:42.909
But, Wasabi...

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.010

All right, here's the plan.

I'm gonna lure it in
and mark it,

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:11.632

down with your jutsu!

Yeah, okay.

to hold him off for too long.

Listen, Namida,
I'm sorry about before.

I guess I just...

Mm‐mm.

00:18:32.813 --> 00:18:35.315
I'm the one who
should be saying I'm sorry.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.752
Yeah, I should, too.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:39.419
Hmm?

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.825
I owe you guys...
a big apology...

00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:45.759
Huh?

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.928
You saw earlier, right?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:48.729
Uhh...

I summoned Nue so that
he could come

00:18:57.037 --> 00:18:58.939
and help us out...

00:18:58.972 --> 00:18:59.873
...just now.

00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:02.576
Nu...e...

00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:10.350
[roaring]

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.488
[roaring]

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.359
Back then,

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:23.530
I was the one who made Nue
attack the Leaf Village.

00:19:23.564 --> 00:19:24.865
We knew.

00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:25.465
[gasping]

00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:27.634
We figured that in time

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.736
you'd tell us when
you were ready to.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.540
And we've just been waiting
for that day to come.

00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:35.441
You guys, I...

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:36.910
[sobbing]

00:19:36.943 --> 00:19:38.078
[whimpering]

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:39.345
Oh, come on!

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:41.982
Why are you
crying now too, Namida?

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:45.051
Well, because,
Wasabi, you know.

00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:46.720
Good job, you guys!

00:19:46.753 --> 00:19:46.920
[gasping]

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:50.857
It looks like the mission
has been accomplished!

00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:52.125
Hanabi Sensei!

00:19:52.158 --> 00:19:53.794
When did you get here?

00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:56.129
Oh, just a little while ago.

00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:58.031
It seems that somehow
the Giant‐Maned Wolf

00:19:58.064 --> 00:19:59.533
got left off of the list.

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:01.602
I got worried and
came to check on you.

00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:03.904
I guess I was worried
for nothing!

00:20:03.937 --> 00:20:04.871
Wait, what?!

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:06.372
What do you mean
by that?!

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:07.841
That wasn't very nice,
Sensei.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:09.142
I'll say!

00:20:09.175 --> 00:20:11.011
That wolf was
really scary, you know.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.113
And it was
super dangerous, too.

00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:14.480
If it came down to it,
of course,

00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:16.917
I would've jumped in
to help you guys out.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.586
But there wasn't any need
to do that, was there?

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.656
Your teamwork was
absolutely awesome to see.

00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:24.891
You guys are really
getting in sync.

00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:26.426
[giggling]

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:28.061
Yeah!

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:29.462
All right!
Team 15,

00:20:29.495 --> 00:20:32.599
your animal‐capturing mission
is now complete.

00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:33.600
Now, then...

00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:35.435
I know it's sad,
but you're gonna have to

00:20:35.468 --> 00:20:37.771
return to the park now,
little guy.

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:41.575
[giggling]

00:20:41.608 --> 00:20:43.043
He's so cute.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:46.580
<i>(thinking) Looks like</i>
<i>Sumire's gonna be just fine...</i>

00:20:46.613 --> 00:20:47.681
<i>Sai.</i>

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:49.783
[giggling]

00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:53.920
[chatting and laughing]

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:54.855
[satisfied sighing]

00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:58.592
It almost feels like
I've come back to life!

00:20:58.625 --> 00:21:00.661
But we afford to
can't relax yet.

00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:02.663
The Chunin Exams
are coming up!

00:21:02.696 --> 00:21:03.363
[grunting]

00:21:03.396 --> 00:21:05.566
Aw, what am I gonna do?!

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:07.433
Oh well,
it'll work out somehow.

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:09.870
Really? You think so?

00:21:09.903 --> 00:21:13.540
But I've heard that becoming
a chunin is seriously hard!

00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:14.741
Hey!

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:15.876
Congrats, you guys!

00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:18.211
I heard you brought down
a Giant‐Maned Wolf!

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:19.212
Huh?

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:20.280
Mm!

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:23.216
That must've been tough.

00:21:23.249 --> 00:21:25.085
It was a piece of cake!

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:26.352
Oh, yeah?

00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:27.721
I bet Big Sister
Hanabi was

00:21:27.754 --> 00:21:29.790
the one
who handled it, right?

00:21:29.823 --> 00:21:30.691
No way! You're wrong!

00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:31.792
Don't forget.

00:21:31.825 --> 00:21:33.660
On our team, we have
Sumire's Summoning

00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:36.630
and Wasabi's Cat Cloak
Jutsu at our disposal, too!

00:21:36.663 --> 00:21:38.331
Yeah! And besides
all of that,

00:21:38.364 --> 00:21:39.900
Namida has her wailing!

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:43.069
So a Giant‐Maned Wolf's
got absolutely nothing on us!

00:21:43.103 --> 00:21:44.370
Oh. Really?

00:21:44.404 --> 00:21:46.172
I guess there's nothing
more fearsome

00:21:46.206 --> 00:21:47.874
than a woman's tears.
Right?

00:21:47.908 --> 00:21:48.975
All right.

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:51.077
Well, hang in there,
you guys!

00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:54.280
Yeah, okay!
You guys, too!

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:57.150
What's up?!
My dumplings are gone!

00:21:57.183 --> 00:21:58.451
Hey, mine are, too!

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.453
Yeah, and so are mine!

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:03.289
What is going on here?!

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:03.924
[monkey hoot]

00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:05.191
[sighing]

00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:07.528
[eating]

00:22:08.862 --> 00:22:10.631
Not again!

00:23:44.124 --> 00:23:45.391
The Chunin Exams,

00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.794
where a genin's future
is on the line.

00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:50.163
We need to make sure
they meet the qualifications

00:23:50.196 --> 00:23:51.798
so that they'll be a good fit.

00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:54.167
Well, this year's rookies
are the most problematic ones

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.336
we've had in several years

00:23:56.369 --> 00:23:57.671
Whenever there's an incident,

00:23:57.704 --> 00:24:01.074
Boruto Uzumaki is always
at the center of it.

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:01.708
Th‐That's...!

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:06.146
Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:10.116
"The Chunin Exams:
the Recommendation Meeting"

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.553
As expected,
my team is...
