WEBVTT

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.451
Children?

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.653
Are you trackers, too?

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.454
Hey, that's the...!

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:04.258
Wanna come with us to the Land
of Earth?

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.627
The answers that you are seeking
can be found there.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.995
Wait.

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:12.266
Yeah, no doubt about it.
But...

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.636
<i>He brought down all these</i>
<i>shinobi...</i>

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.873
Did he turn the tables on
those guys? And what's that
monster?!

00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:22.442
[groan]

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.913
[chuckling] It looks like
we hit the jackpot!

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:26.680
Hey, Boruto.

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:32.252
Mitsuki's just up ahead, isn't
he? So you're gonna have to
move aside.

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:35.155
Oh? You seek to test my mettle?

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.492
What? "S-seek..."
Man, you must be pretty ancient.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:39.459
Wait, Boruto!

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:42.129
Any way you look at it, he's
dangerous.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:43.964
Yeah? Well, so what!

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.033
We're so close to Mitsuki now.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:51.071
You're right. Besides, we
can't very well let the rest of
them go, either.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.842
[grunts] I guess that you two
are on the same page, huh?

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:58.445
Allow me to present myself. I am
Kokuyou.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:02.449
I have powers far beyond you
humans. And...

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.990
[growls]

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.160
[confused]

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:19.433
This...

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.001
...is an Akuta.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:24.271
Akuta? But what exactly is it?

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.173
Well, not a puppet.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.410
Maybe there's a nasty secret
behind it, something beyond our
comprehension...

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:33.146
Knowing the answer to that
question is...

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:35.616
...unnecessary!

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:36.316
[gasps]

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:39.286
[grunts]

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:42.256
Shikadai! Boruto!

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.158
[roars]

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:47.661
It's fast!

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:51.465
No way. Seriously?! [grunts]

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:55.869
Clashing against the formidable
allows me to evolve even
further.

00:03:55.903 --> 00:04:01.909
Power that surpasses humans is
what a non-human like myself
desires most!

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:05.078
So those who are weak are
worthless.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.681
[chuckles] What the hell is
this guy talking about?

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:09.149
[chuckles]

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.151
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.490
[attacking yell]

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.625
[grunting]

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.296
He hasn't seen my jutsu yet!

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:25.632
[gasps]

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:33.140
Allow me to posit: the clones
were bait, part of some clever
ruse. But...

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.875
Hm?

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:35.442
Agh!

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.282
I already know... what
your intent is.

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:43.750
[roars]

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.285
[grunting]

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.991
[grunting]

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:53.026
This is...! [worried inhale]

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:56.196
[grunting]

00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:58.165
[gasps]

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.033
[grunting]

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.270
[straining]

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.505
[grunts]

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.009
[grunts]

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.149
I cannot use jutsu.

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:22.456
However, to reach the pinnacle
of strength, all I need are my
hands and feet.

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.360
We finally made it this far...

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.064
Mitsuki's just a little ways up
ahead of us!

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:34.034
I'll tear through anyone who
gets in my way!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.571
And get to where Mitsuki is,
no matter what!

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.674
Wind Style!

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:42.142
Gale Palm!

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:43.677
Sarada!

00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:45.913
[grunting]

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:47.614
Cha!

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:49.249
[gasps]

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.186
[grunts]

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:56.623
[grunting]

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.362
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.298
Ah, I see...

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.968
All right, you first...

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:13.040
[grunting]

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:22.249
Oh?

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:27.454
Way to go, Sarada. Nice assist!

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.990
Well, I mean, you and I have
been fighting together for a
while.

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:33.260
By now, I can pretty much read
your mind.

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.761
That makes it three against one!

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:39.399
I see... You're quite adept...

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:42.269
I mustn't treat you like mere
children, then.

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:43.670
[gasps]

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.606
[attacking yell]

00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:48.876
[gasps]

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:49.877
Too slow!

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.011
[grunts]

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:55.282
Sarada!

00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:00.587
[gasps]

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:05.459
Even if your eyes can follow me,
your body can't keep up. You're
first!

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.028
[grunting]

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.164
Hey! What did you do to Sarada,
damn it?!

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.967
[gasps]

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:20.440
Take this!

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.714
Cho-Cho?! Why are you here?!

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:29.750
[chuckles] C'mon.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.620
Don't you know, Sarada? A
beautiful woman always shows up
fashionably late to the party.

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:38.992
Hey, don't forget that I'm here,
too!

00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:43.797
Wait, but I thought you guys
went back to the village!

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.766
Yeah, we were on our way...

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.236
But we ran into a group
of Leaf shinobi that had been
attacked.

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:52.206
[sigh] We were hesitant at
first, but...

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.608
We realized that you
guys might be in trouble...

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.612
so we couldn't just go home and
leave you to face it all by
yourselves!

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.247
I swear. Damn it, you guys!

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.919
Now, Boruto, Sarada! We'll
handle things here with this
guy.

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:08.922
You go on ahead and catch up to
Mitsuki!

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:11.258
Huh? Why? I mean, he's
already...

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:15.629
[determined yell]

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:19.466
Uhhh?!

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.167
Seriously?

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:24.438
If he manages to delay us
here, then we won't get to
Mitsuki.

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:28.041
Shikadai... I owe you one for
this!

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.277
Cho-Cho, Inojin, be careful!

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:33.780
Guess we don't get a
say in what we're doing.

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:35.282
Oh, well! No big deal, right?

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.287
C'mon, guys... Let's use the
Ino-Shika-Cho combination.
Show him what we've got!

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.625
Fine... Then you can see for
yourselves...

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:47.160
...how weak humans truly are.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.003
Hm, Kokuyou's late.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.472
Are you worried?

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:02.576
Mhm, I expected
that he'd have wrapped things up
already and returned...

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:05.112
I guess you really trust him,
don't you?

00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:08.782
Trust him? No, that isn't it!

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:13.687
Kokuyou's just very strong,
that's all. Becoming stronger
is his whole reason for living.

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:16.623
Hm.

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:19.159
[grunt]

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:24.498
It seems that they're here for
us. After all, we're really
close to the border now.

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.266
So, what's up?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.502
[mumbles]

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.671
Huh?! Uh-huh... I see...

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.440
You can understand?

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:35.142
Yeah, they're kinda like
my siblings.

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.444
And what did they say?

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:42.482
It appears that some trackers
got past Kokuyou and are headed
this way right now.

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:45.752
They're child ninja... Two of
them.

00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:47.487
They're two children...?

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:53.894
They actually beat Kokuyou?
Now I'm really curious about
what they're like!

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.028
I'm coming with you.

00:09:57.164 --> 00:10:01.134
Sorry, I can't let you do
that. Kokuyou gave me orders.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:07.608
(SEKEI) I don't like doing stuff
like this...But they'll stay
here to guard you.

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:11.445
Sorry, Mitsuki. I'll be back
really soon!

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:17.017
Boruto...

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:22.990
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.932
<i>I'm finally gonna get</i>
<i>to see you again!</i>

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:36.770
I have so much to say, so many
questions! I can hardly think
<i>straight!</i>

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.138
<i>(SARADA) Isn't this great,</i>
<i>Boruto?</i>

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:39.006
Huh?

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.276
I'm pretty sure I know what
you're thinking right about
now.

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:44.745
I've been looking forward to
seeing him too!

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:46.346
He is our teammate, after all.

00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:48.982
[chuckles] Yeah, you're right!

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:53.153
All the same, I'm still gonna
have to tell him a thing or two
when we see him.

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:56.423
He acted selfishly, even more
than someone else I know...

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:59.826
Yeah, suppose so! Well, we
can hear all about it from
him...

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.261
Uh.

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:03.197
<i>(BORUTO) A butterfly...?</i>

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.764
[gasps]

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:07.601
<i>(SEKIEI) Hey...</i>

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.606
How did the two of you make it
past Kokuyou?

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.008
No way. There's another one?!

00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:21.415
My name's Sekiei.

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:23.450
And I'm really quite curious
about you.

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:32.159
Hold on, isn't he--?

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.828
Yeah, he's one of the guys who
convinced Mitsuki to leave.

00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:36.964
So, your name's Sekiei, huh?

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:40.067
Tell me... just what are you to
Mitsuki?

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.436
I'm so curious about it!

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:45.672
Just shut up! You're gonna
bring Mitsuki back to us!

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:52.579
Oh, sorry...! He's actually
betrayed you already. He's
become one of us now!

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:55.349
What'd you say...? Like we'd
ever believe that!

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.017
Boruto, you've gotta stay calm.

00:11:57.518 --> 00:11:58.285
Right...

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.456
That doesn't sound like Mitsuki
at all. I know you're just
lying to us!

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:06.193
Hm, just where does that
confidence come from?

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.195
Oh well, never mind.

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:23.310
Hmph!

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.816
A bomb? Is that what caused the
blast before?

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.453
You infused chakra into the clay
to make it explode, is that it?

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:36.623
[impressed] Wow, you're really
smart!

00:12:36.657 --> 00:12:40.727
This jutsu was implanted in me.
I think it's called Detonating
Clay...

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.931
Are you two curious about it?

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:45.732
Did you say it was implanted?!

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:52.172
Yep! When Kokuyou and I were
created, we were each given
special powers and jutsu.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.475
[chuckles] The way you
talk...

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:58.212
You'd almost think you
guys weren't actually human or
something.

00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:01.481
Wait, don't tell me... you guys
are like those Akuta things?!

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:05.719
Yup, they call us
fabrications. Made to be better
than human.

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:08.889
Oh dear.

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:10.724
They'll be mad at me for telling
you that.

00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:12.659
Oh well, who cares?

00:13:13.861 --> 00:13:16.063
You two are gonna die now,
anyway.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.802
[gasps]

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.971
[grunting]

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.441
[grunts]

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.910
[laughing]

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:35.349
That's great! Now, c'mon, show
me more about just how
interesting humans are!

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:38.151
Do you even have a secret weapon
or two?

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:42.022
[grunts] We can't waste any
more time here with this guy.

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.991
Fine, I guess I'll have
to show you...

00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:45.726
...my secret weapon.
[eager chuckle]

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:53.333
[knocked back]

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.304
Huh?!

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.474
N- No way!

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.976
[cocky laugh]

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.811
You actually summoned him!?

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:07.481
[laughing]

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:11.919
Amazing! You're simply
amazing! You can do stuff like
this?!

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:14.454
I'm even more curious now!

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:16.490
All right, I'll handle this from
here on out.

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:19.326
Garaga! Get it.

00:14:19.793 --> 00:14:20.661
Hmph!

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.402
So, uh... uh...

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:29.203
Hm?

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.673
Go on! Hey, didn't you hear
me, Garaga?!

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.241
I don't wanna.

00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:35.676
What?!

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:40.314
Didn't you hear me? I said I
don't wanna, ya little brat! Now
get off!

00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:42.649
[grunting] Ahh!

00:14:43.684 --> 00:14:45.786
Hmph!

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:48.622
Hey! You entered into a contract
with me, or did you forget?!

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:53.293
Don't get the wrong idea. I
don't remember saying anything
about helping you.

00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:55.796
The fight doesn't involve me.

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:57.731
[groans] Why, you...!

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:03.604
[laughing] How funny!

00:15:03.637 --> 00:15:06.340
I'm beginning to regret having
to kill you!

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:09.009
But that's exactly what I'm
going to do.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.978
Damn it!

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:14.648
[grunts]

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:16.316
[grunts]

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.787
[groans] He's, like, super
strong!

00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:25.092
[weary laughter] You know,
maybe we shouldn't have come
back here, after all...

00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:29.663
[grunts] Hey, c'mon, you guys!

00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:34.635
It's not a bad formation... But
still, your strength is nothing
compared to mine.

00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:38.472
Think! What strategy will work
<i>here?!</i>

00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:43.677
In order to let those two get
away, you three will
perish.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.279
All because you are
too weak.

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:46.079
Hmph!

00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:47.347
Uh?

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.016
Inojin!

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:51.084
Sealing Jutsu: Crouching Tiger
Bullet!

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:52.953
[growl]

00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:56.290
[straining]

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:58.192
Hold tight, Cho-Cho!

00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:00.394
Hurry up!

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:06.733
[grunts]

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:12.506
They chose to retreat...
They're weak but wise enough.

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:17.177
Or... could this somehow be a
strength that humans possess...?

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.179
Right now...

00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:26.453
[heavy breathing]

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.856
We were completely out of our
league.

00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:33.627
I hate to say it, but...He's
right, we're weak. Damn it!

00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:37.197
[grunting]

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:39.800
If this keeps up, then...

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.268
[grunting]

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:46.807
[laughing] It serves you
right!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:52.446
Weren't you going to meet up
with this Mitsuki guy? At this
rate, you're going to die first!

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:54.815
[grunts] Just shut up!

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:58.285
If you're not gonna help me
fight, then just stop talking!

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:04.191
Your audience just got bigger,
huh? Hey, do you really wanna
see Mitsuki that badly?

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:05.659
Of course, I do!

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.496
I mean, Mitsuki... is my
friend.

00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:12.065
Your friend, huh...?

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:22.309
Isn't that something you just
decided arbitrarily on your own?

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.045
[chuckle] Maybe it is...

00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:28.315
All the same... that's the
reason...

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.218
...why I have to see him
again...

00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:35.189
...so I can actually get to
know him for real.

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:41.461
[determined] And why...
there's no way I'm gonna
lose to you right now!

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:46.466
[laughing] Are you
looking for sympathy or
something?!

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.471
Stop acting so proud! You really
want my help, don't you?

00:17:52.206 --> 00:17:52.639
Huh?!

00:17:54.308 --> 00:17:59.613
If you bow your head and agree
to become my underling, I just
might consider it. Eh?

00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:04.685
Oh, shut up! Listen, I don't
even want your stupid help
anymore, snake!

00:18:04.718 --> 00:18:06.019
Just get lost already!

00:18:06.053 --> 00:18:07.821
What did you say?

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:10.457
What, are you guys
breaking up?!

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.061
Well, this is getting
boring... Time to end it!

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.497
[grunts]

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:21.134
[grunts] Ah!

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:22.336
What?!

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:23.170
[gasps]

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:28.942
Listen... I have no intention of
following orders from him...

00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:35.182
...but no one tells me to get
lost! It's my decision alone if
I rampage or not!

00:18:35.983 --> 00:18:37.184
[attacking yell]

00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:41.355
Seriously?! What is up
with this snake, anyway?

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:45.459
Take this! And this!

00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:46.126
[grunts]

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:51.331
Interesting. But I still have
other tricks up my sleeve.

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:52.499
[gasps]

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:57.070
[grunting]

00:18:57.304 --> 00:18:58.338
Huh?

00:18:58.372 --> 00:18:59.072
Now!

00:18:59.106 --> 00:19:02.242
Damn it, why now?! [gasps]

00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:05.379
Let's end this!
[attack yelling]

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:08.448
[grunts]

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:11.318
[gasps]

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:16.623
<i>(BORUTO) Mitsuki?</i>

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:18.492
What are you doing here?!

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:21.361
Mitsuki! You're okay!

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:24.198
[relieved chuckle] It's great to
see you!

00:19:25.866 --> 00:19:28.168
But... Why did he do that...?

00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:32.639
So that's Mitsuki?

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:39.479
[chuckles] You know, we
had a really rough time catching
up to you!

00:19:40.514 --> 00:19:42.482
But I'm really glad I get
to see you...

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.051
Huh...?

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:46.053
Mitsuki...?

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:49.923
You okay?

00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:52.326
Yeah... Well, I'll manage.

00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:54.161
Hey...

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:55.529
...Mitsuki?

00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:00.200
Sorry, Boruto. I'm
going with them.

00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:03.704
What did you just say...?!

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:07.508
Really?! You're seriously going
with them?!

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:11.178
Yes.

00:20:12.813 --> 00:20:14.381
You see, this... is my will.

00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:15.649
[gasps]

00:20:16.483 --> 00:20:18.619
I see...

00:20:18.652 --> 00:20:22.022
I truly thought that you'd go
back with these two.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:26.293
You were spying on us? That's
really not nice.

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:28.495
Well, some of my suspicions
have been allayed.

00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.933
But... Mitsuki...

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:35.903
You're kidding, right? Let's
get going!

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:40.307
Come on! We can all start
heading back to the Hidden Leaf
Village now. Together.

00:21:08.502 --> 00:21:09.469
[gasps]

00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:12.806
Lightning Style.
Snake...

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.473
...Lightning!

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:16.210
AH! [grunts]

00:21:18.478 --> 00:21:19.179
No way!

00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:31.325
Mitsuki... But I'm your
friend...

00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:35.863
[harrumphing chuckle]
Serves you right, brat!

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:40.200
Believe in silly ideas like
friendship, and you end up
getting betrayed!

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:45.172
Let's go. Sekiei needs
tending to.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.175
[harrumphing chuckle]
Just a husk...

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.178
You're not even worth killing.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.921
[grunting]

00:22:00.954 --> 00:22:08.195
Mit Ãº suki... Wait... Mitsuki...

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.959
<i>(Sekiei) Mitsuki... have you</i>
<i>ever cried?</i>

00:23:45.993 --> 00:23:48.028
<i>(Mitsuki) I haven't. Why?</i>

00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:50.197
<i>(Sekiei) I'm really curious</i>
<i>about it.</i>

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.735
Would you cry if Boruto died?
<i>Weren't you friends?</i>

00:23:54.768 --> 00:24:00.941
(Mitsuki) Boruto's larger than
life... and blindingly bright.
He was like the sun in my sky.

00:24:00.974 --> 00:24:06.146
<i>Next time on Boruto Naruto</i>
<i>Next Generations: "Mitsuki's</i>
<i>Friend."</i>

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.484
But... maybe even these feelings
<i>were simply just... created.</i>
