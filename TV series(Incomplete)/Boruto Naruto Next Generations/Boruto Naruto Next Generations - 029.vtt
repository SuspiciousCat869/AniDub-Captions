WEBVTT

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.214
Oh, yeah.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.751
Finally!

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.121
We found them!

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:33.133
My father's swords are with
me, where they belong!

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.040
[chuckles]

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:43.710
[sighs]

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:44.377
Uh!

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:58.058
Look, puppets. How vulgar.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:03.063
Perfect timing though. Let's
indulge, we can test our Mist
Blades!

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.072
Creating destruction with
countless Paper Bombs.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:15.408
The Explosive Blade Shibuki, the
Spatter.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.779
How beautiful!

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.183
The alluring Long Blade
Nuibari, it sews things
together to halt movement!

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:27.453
Oh my! I wish there was a
human to try it on, now.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.423
Oh!

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.358
Kabutowari!

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:34.127
[grunts]

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.632
This one's a lot of fun, the
Executioner's Blade.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:42.168
No doubt about it, a sword
worthy of the Demon Zabuza!

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:50.777
Lightning Blade, Kiba the Fang!
The beloved sword of my
father, Raiga Kurosuki!

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:55.148
Come on now, don't hog them
all, leave some for me.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.482
[laughing]

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:01.822
[laughing] Whatever. Now we have
the right blades to start our
revolution.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:06.059
Do you seriously think you can
pull something like this off?

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.095
Merely by the assembly of the
seven Mist Blades?

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.066
Oh, Kagura, haven't
you caught on yet?

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.906
I have people backing me up.
People connected to the Feudal
Lord of the Land of Water.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.274
What?

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.612
They're on our side. Not with
weak, timid moderates such as
Chojuro.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:29.215
Once we're done with this,
we'll replace the Mizukage.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.184
<i>(Shizuma) With you.</i>

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.755
What, me?

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.390
That's right, you. Remember
what I told you back then?

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:42.896
How I promised that I would
always protect you?

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.230
[gasps]

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.335
[grunts]

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:55.008
Lord Yagura's kin will once
again rule over the Blood Mist
Village.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.577
Beautiful!

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.178
[laughing]

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.015
Besides, we've already made a
move against the Hokage's brat
of a boy.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.349
But, but, that's.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:08.054
It's too late to turn back
now.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:08.955
[gasps]

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.793
<i>(Shizuma) Don't worry. I'll</i>
create a place for you when this
<i>is over.</i>

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:17.664
(Shizuma) The noble blood of the
<i>great Lord Yagura flows within</i>
<i>you.</i>

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:20.801
To be the next Mizukage is
your destiny.

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:26.339
Tell me, Kagura, have I ever
lied to you?

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.274
No, but...

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.746
Oh relax, Kagura. Obviously
we'll take care of the fighting.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:37.317
As our leader, all you have to
do is stand back and watch us
be amazing.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.385
Please. Just wait.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:46.159
We can't change anything now.
Neither the village, nor the
true destiny of your bloodline.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:53.266
I'll build you a new village,
one the blood coursing through
your veins can be proud of!

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.902
[paralyzed with fear
breath]

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:51.184
The key to this vault should
be almost impossible for
someone to duplicate.

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:53.319
Who has the key now?

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.522
Kagura has it.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.626
(Mei Terumi) Shizuma Hoshigaki.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.263
Clearly he hasn't changed his
mind.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.498
Did he force Kagura to give
him the key, then?

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:10.436
It's more like he probably
coaxed Kagura into it.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.106
He can be quite persuasive
when it suits him.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:19.045
This is a declaration of war
against us. What will you do
now, Lord Sixth?

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.582
Does anyone else
know about this?

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:24.284
Nobody but your
closest aides and I.

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:29.990
I'm imposing a gag rule. The
Seven Ninja Swordsman are
symbols of the Hidden Mist.

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:33.527
<i>(Chojuro) If they dare pose as</i>
<i>the Swordsmen and try to harm</i>
<i>the village...</i>

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.032
it is our duty...to execute them
all!

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:44.404
Are you saying that
includes Kagura, too? Think
very carefully.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.009
Yes.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:58.985
<i>(Boruto) Hold on a minute!</i>
<i>[panting]</i>

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.688
Boruto Uzumaki! What
are you doing here?

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:03.356
[panting]

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.392
Oh, no... Did
Shizuma and
his gang...

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:11.565
Kagura's a good guy. Shizuma
is only trying to exploit his
weakness!

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.433
Hmm.

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:17.137
I know the only reason he went
along with them was to rescue
me!

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.674
That may be, but I'm afraid
this isn't a concern of yours.

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:22.943
It's solely a Hidden Mist
problem.

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:27.781
All that matters here is he
turned on his village and
everyone in it.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:28.815
[gasps]

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.186
What they all really want is
to turn it back into the Blood
Mist Village again.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:37.157
Who are "they?" Are you really
lumping Kagura in with them?

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.828
He doesn't want to do this!
You know that better than
any one of us!

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.066
Now listen. I appreciate
your kindness.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:52.372
But he's a shinobi too. If he
breaks the rules, he must suffer
the consequences as one.

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:57.611
Consequences? But you
don't really want to kill
Kagura, do you?

00:07:58.444 --> 00:07:59.546
Hmm.

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:04.284
Does a true Mizukage sacrifice
a life to save a village?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:09.322
Because the Hokage that I
aspire to be would never do
that!

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.824
Hmm.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:17.698
I can't force you to
understand. But this is all I
can do now.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.301
[sighs]

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:26.640
Uh. Wait a minute, if this
wasn't a revolt, it'd be fine!

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.610
What are you saying?

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:32.245
Those guys are just cheap
thugs, not the New Seven Ninja
Swordsmen.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.749
Kagura and I just got into a
big fight with them, that's
all!

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:38.251
Boruto, what are
you trying to do?

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:42.022
I mean, now's our perfect
chance to get back at them,
right?

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:45.425
Just a fight between kids who
don't know any better!

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.160
[gasps]

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:51.464
[chuckles] I get it, just
a simple fight, Huh?

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.000
[giggles] That's all it is.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.470
[sighs] And that's the best
idea you could think of?

00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:01.474
But we have roll call at ten
tonight. We have to get
back, or else Sensei will...

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:05.411
Oh, don't even worry! This'll
totally be wrapped up by then!

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:11.451
Quite clever, I'll admit.
Although, what made you think
we'd approve of it? Do tell.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:15.321
Ow ow ow ow ow ow! It's the
injury I got when I fought
them!

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:21.227
If I go home all beat up like
this and Dad sees me, he's not
gonna be happy.

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:25.498
What do ya think? Cause it
could become a diplomatic
incident.

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:27.568
You...Are you kidding me?

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:32.272
[chuckles] You've got some guts,
kid. Well done.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:36.442
It's up to you, Chojuro. What'll
it be? Yes, or no?

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:38.612
Fine, but I have one
condition.

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:43.650
Whether you like it or not. I'm
coming with you.

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:46.286
[gasps] Really, you are?

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:52.058
I'm not going as the Mizukage.
I'm merely being a guide for
the field trip.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:55.629
[chuckle] Now that's more like
it!

00:09:55.662 --> 00:10:01.267
Remember, there is a time
limit, so we will have to be
thorough. If we exceed it, then.

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:04.971
Eh, don't worry. I'll make sure
that won't happen!

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:09.543
In that case, we'll check on
their whereabouts now.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:13.580
Go and take care of whatever
you see fit to.

00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:16.750
Thank you! We'll see you
later, then! C'mon.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.485
Now, Chojuro.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.621
Hmm.

00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:23.690
You must swear to protect that
boy's future.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.992
As the Mizukage.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.261
I will.

00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:32.398
I didn't think you'd have the
guts to bring up Lord Seventh
for this.

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:35.301
[scoffs] Trust me, it was the
last thing I wanted to do.

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:40.373
But, if I can't help out a
friend, that's way worse.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:52.619
We have all the Ninja Blades
and we have Kagura with us.

00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:55.889
It's everything we need. We
can finally start.

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:56.757
[chuckles]

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:01.628
It's about time. We're going
to rip this feeble village to
shreds.

00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:04.397
The Samehada would be proud.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.332
[snickers] Sounds good to
me.

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:10.470
I'm so sick and tired of
this pathetic little village.
Everyone is.

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:11.972
We're all behind you.

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:17.210
I'll endure hardship, if it
means I'm with comrades who
share the same vision.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:21.281
That's the way my father chose
to live and die. And that's
what I want.

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:28.855
Mmm, exactly. We're gonna
live in this era, as shinobi
were always meant to!

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:35.295
<i>What do I do? I can't go up</i>
<i>against Shizuma.</i>

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:38.164
<i>It's not because of past</i>
<i>obligations...</i>

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.601
<i>or the fact that I wounded him</i>
<i>so badly with a sword.</i>

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:45.806
(Kagura) He is, and always was,
the only one who accepts me for
<i>who I am.</i>

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.545
<i>So Boruto, if you appear</i>
<i>before me again...</i>

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:54.848
<i>Even if it's you, just know</i>
<i>this.</i>

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:01.287
<i>We cannot change the past.</i>

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:06.593
<i>My destiny, isn't going to</i>
<i>play out like a game.</i>

00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:13.834
<i>This sword has grown even</i>
<i>heavier. Perhaps, I don't</i>
<i>have the right to wield it.</i>

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:24.678
I haven't seen Boruto since
this morning. Do you have
any idea where he went?

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:26.813
No, and Kagura's
not here, either.

00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:29.850
Wait. Yeah, now
that you mention it.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:32.853
I'm going outside
to get some air.

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.955
I wonder what's up?

00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:36.657
<i>(Boruto) Hey, Denki!</i>

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.591
Uh.

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:39.025
Hey, Boruto!

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.995
Sarada and I have some important
official field trip leader...

00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:45.566
business we gotta go take care
of right now.

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:49.770
Since, you know, we have to
make sure you guys have fun
during the field trip, got it?

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:52.673
Uh, what? What's going
on?

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:55.909
Oh, um, this and that.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.613
So, if we don't make it back
by roll call, can you just
make up some excuse for us?

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.682
Bye! We're counting on you!

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:02.849
Wait, hold on!

00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:04.951
Okay, what was that?

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:07.253
Sketchy, is what it was.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.591
Maybe he's gone and gotten
himself mixed up in some
trouble again?

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:15.962
So we can't ignore it like the
last time. That just wouldn't be
right.

00:13:18.532 --> 00:13:22.636
[sighs] Boruto told me to leave
Kagura to him and not to worry
about it.

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:25.706
But, I still wonder if he'll
be okay!

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:26.507
<i>(Iwabe) Hey!</i>

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:26.973
[gasps]

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:30.110
What's up? Why why are you
talking to yourself about
Boruto?

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:32.813
[winces]

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:40.186
I sensed it all along. I knew
someone was watching me.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.322
Suigetsu.

00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.626
If you were planning to rescue
Boruto, forget it.

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:50.230
He said to say, don't get
yourself involved in this mess
any further.

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.932
And why is that?

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:54.668
<i>(Suigetsu) I don't know!</i>

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:57.604
Regardless, if the Hidden Mist
finds out about your association
with us...

00:13:57.638 --> 00:14:00.507
we'll have some serious
problems.

00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:02.709
<i>(Suigetsu) Oh, please. Don't</i>
<i>give me that look.</i>

00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:05.679
I couldn't wait for a mission
that would take me back home...

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:08.348
after all this time but now
this?

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:13.453
[sighs] Why are losers like that
calling themselves the New Seven
Ninja Swordsmen?

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:17.423
(Suigetsu) [scoffs] Spoiled
brats with zero war experience.

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:21.027
I see. Sounds like you don't
like them much.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:23.964
You might as well tell me
about the rest of it, then.

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:26.933
Uh. Tell you about
the rest of what?

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:30.837
You have to be investigating
something. You came here.

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.874
You want to find what makes
them vulnerable.

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:38.679
Like I told you, you're not
getting involved anymore, and
that's it.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:44.417
But if I know him, he's already
banking on the likelihood of my
doing whatever I want.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.854
(Suigetsu) And you always ignore
orders, which is why I'm keeping
<i>an eye on you.</i>

00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:50.023
We went looking for Boruto,
but instead.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.159
We wind up stumbling onto
something really bad.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.761
So now what?

00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:56.663
Well, first we have to...[gasps]

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:57.998
(Suigetsu) Alright, don't move.

00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:01.702
Or I'll kill you, got it?

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.905
So, what mischief are we up
to?

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.842
Stop messing with them.

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.677
<i>(Mitsuki) They're my friends.</i>

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:13.914
Yeah, I know. I was only joking,
right?

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:15.448
[uncomfortable laugh]

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:17.884
Never thought I'd see
you two look so scared.

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:19.886
Hey, c'mon, now...

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.923
Oh, That's it!

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:26.927
Being outnumbered, and then
confronted with hostility, that
would be a good excuse.

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:29.963
Hey, Mitsuki. Easy, now.

00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:42.876
[sighs] Whatever. Seems like
you'll be the one who gets to
crush Shizuma in my place!

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:46.613
I knew it. You really don't
like that guy.

00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:50.884
Thank you. I think we'll be
able to save Boruto, because
of you two.

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:53.086
I don't get it. What's up?

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.422
To be precise, grown‐ups were
using our field trip...

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.660
as a cover for conducting some
of their own nasty business.

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:08.735
[scoffs] Look at this gaudy
memorial.

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:12.873
It's a way for them to keep
forcing us to live in the past.

00:16:12.906 --> 00:16:16.076
What do you think about it.
Kagura?

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:18.545
What do I think?

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:20.781
If you mean that you'll
fight for the forgotten ones...

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:24.084
the people who haven't been
honored at the memorial here...

00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.152
<i>(Kagura) Yes, I will support</i>
<i>you.</i>

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:29.155
That gives me strength. And
hope.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.992
Now! New Seven Ninja
Swordsmen!

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:37.130
Right on this hallowed site, we
light the first fires of
revolution!

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:38.331
[laughing]

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.837
Stop, you bastards! Show
some respect!

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.105
Boruto?

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:49.576
You're here..? I told
you not to come.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.147
<i>(Shizuma) [laughing] It's the</i>
<i>Hokage's son, and he's an even</i>
<i>bigger idiot than I expected.</i>

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:57.383
Why are you here? Have you
come to die?

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.920
Yeah, because I'm an idiot.

00:16:59.953 --> 00:17:02.723
Actually, I came so I could
fight you.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:05.258
Fight him? Please, no.

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.261
You heard him correctly.

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:12.032
Mizukage!

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:12.999
What the hell?

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.367
[gasps]

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.169
You're alone?

00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:20.907
(Shizuma) You misjudged us. You
think you can take us all on by
<i>your sad little self?</i>

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:27.514
Yes. As Boruto just said, this
is a minor scuffle among some
rowdy kids.

00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:30.751
And I merely happened to pass
by in time to break it up.

00:17:30.784 --> 00:17:32.919
Don't mock us!

00:17:32.953 --> 00:17:36.256
Shizuma, this is our chance
to finally take the Mizukage's
head.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.959
Yes, you're right.

00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:40.426
Let's proceed!

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:45.065
Crimson Mist Barrier.

00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:48.702
No way! The same as
Hachiya's!

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:52.706
Don't insult me, this trick is
much more sophisticated.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.108
Get back!

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.244
[gasps]

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.085
The Long Sword Nuibari, sews
everything together to prevent
movement! [giggles]

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.453
Hey, Chojuro look out! [grunts]

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:08.421
[grunts]

00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:11.024
[terrified gasp]

00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:12.793
[screaming]

00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:15.095
Sarada?

00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:23.303
The Explosive Blade, Shibuki can
blast solid earth to bits.

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:27.240
And one by one, you'll all
become fertilizer.

00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:29.643
Damn it, this mist.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:38.118
Can we hurry this up? Those
little snots are just getting
in our way.

00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:40.954
You think so?

00:18:40.987 --> 00:18:44.290
Because they have far more
promise as shinobi than your
sorry lot do.

00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:50.263
[grunting]

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:54.134
I fell pretty far down. I
have to get back, quickly!

00:18:55.268 --> 00:18:58.138
[flipping effort]

00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:02.776
I think I'll get more of a fight
out of you than that pampered
brat.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:07.147
But let's face it, you don't
stand a chance. You're just
a kid.

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:10.183
Hmm.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:16.723
Give up already. You lost
the Hiramekarei.

00:19:16.757 --> 00:19:20.126
Our three Ninja Blades will
cut you down before you can
blink!

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.796
[grunting]

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.766
I'm getting the feeling you
all truly despise me.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:30.136
Hah! Damn right we do! Do
you even know what you did to
our village?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:35.408
You turned it into a cheap
tourist trap for a quick profit.
And it makes me wanna puke!

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:37.778
We are shinobi, through and
through!

00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:41.848
(Hebiichigo) Our parents passed
<i>on jutsu to us, but who can</i>
<i>we use them on?</i>

00:19:41.882 --> 00:19:46.252
What good are such powerful
blades if we aren't using
them?

00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:48.989
But Shizuma understands the
truth.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:53.226
Instead of watching us rot
with the village, he gave us a
reason to belong.

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:56.429
Revolution! [roars]

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.965
[grunts]

00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:07.340
[giggles] Flesh is being ripped
from the bone, I can feel it
through the threads!

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:10.977
I admit, there is some merit
to your dissatisfaction.

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:16.282
Failure to ease the
strains between us lies on my
shoulders, as the Mizukage.

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:19.452
Hah, you're damn right.

00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:23.489
So you can make it up to us by
dying willingly in front of the
memorial stone!

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.325
Uh.

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:27.427
(Hassaku Onomichi) Don't try to
<i>deny it.</i>

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.897
<i>There are those who weren't</i>
<i>respected enough to be laid to</i>
<i>rest here...</i>

00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:34.367
<i>in this sacred monument they</i>
<i>built for the war dead!</i>

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.904
Meaning, the Fourth Mizukage
Yagura and his team.

00:20:37.938 --> 00:20:43.209
They'd been a part of an
abhorrent past, so their very
existence was just erased.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.045
[crying]

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:51.051
So that's why we're here to
honor and represent the ones
you never recognized!

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:55.255
So what Shizuma's really
aiming to do is harness your
fury and discontent...

00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:57.958
and to attempt a coup d'etat
with it?

00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:01.027
That's right! I told you he
was different than you.

00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:04.230
<i>(Hassaku Onomichi) He</i>
<i>appreciates our anger. He even</i>
<i>encourages it!</i>

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:09.202
And Kagura is a part of us
now, the New Seven Ninja
Swordsmen.

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:11.905
Do you think? I'm not so
sure.

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:16.009
Kagura may want a fairly
different kind of life than
this.

00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:17.944
Hah! Little too late for that.

00:21:17.978 --> 00:21:21.848
The only place he can stand
now is right beside Shizuma.

00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:24.951
How can you afford to be
concerned about Kagura?

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:28.221
I'd think you'd be worried that
we're about to kill you!

00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:30.190
[roars]

00:21:30.223 --> 00:21:31.692
[attack scream]

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:32.593
[attack laugh]

00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:34.595
[grunts]

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:44.337
Simply shameful. Those three
are just wasting time with all
that talking...

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.240
when they should be finishing
him.

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:51.044
However, I don't blame
them, considering how long
we've been suffering.

00:21:51.077 --> 00:21:55.982
Still, who knows when
reinforcements will arrive.

00:21:56.016 --> 00:21:59.385
(Ichirota Oniyuzu) Don't toy
with them for too long, Shizuma.

00:22:02.188 --> 00:22:04.424
Kagura, where are you?

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:49.395
(Buntan Kurosuki) The Sharingan,
I've only heard rumors about it.

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:53.466
<i>To think that I get to</i>
<i>experience the real thing,</i>
<i>right here and now!</i>

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:57.904
<i>I'll gouge out both of your</i>
<i>eyes with my Lightning Blade,</i>
<i>Kiba the Fang!</i>

00:23:57.938 --> 00:24:00.373
<i>(Sarada) You want these</i>
<i>Sharingan that badly?</i>

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:01.608
<i>The only thing I'm thinking</i>
<i>about...</i>

00:24:03.376 --> 00:24:05.646
<i>wrapping this up so we can</i>
<i>make it back in time for</i>
<i>roll at ten o'clock!</i>

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:09.015
<i>(Boruto) Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations:</i>

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:12.152
<i>"The Sharingan vs.</i>
<i>The Lightning Blade, Kiba the</i>
<i>Fang!"</i>

00:24:12.185 --> 00:24:16.089
<i>(Sarada) Anyway, I need to</i>
<i>figure out her Lightning Style</i>
<i>right away!</i>
