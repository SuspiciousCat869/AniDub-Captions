WEBVTT

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.782
(BORUTO) <i>You guys?!</i>

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:18.585
Team 10! What are you doing
here?

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.420
Seems I was right.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:24.291
I figured you guys went after
Mitsuki and would be right
around here.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:28.262
And my Super Beast Scroll made
it easy to catch up to you.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:31.098
You mean you were sent out to
capture Mitsuki?!

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.166
Well, almost. But not quite.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:35.736
[gasp] Watch out!

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.773
[gasps and grunts]

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:42.442
[growl] Look, don't waste our
time!

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.477
What's the big idea?!

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.713
We ought to be asking you that!

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:50.384
It's only natural to interpret
your actions as desertion.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.754
So we were sent out here to
bring the two of you back to
the village!

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.789
Even though we
don't like it...

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:58.592
You mean Team 10 is hunting us
down?

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:03.597
Sorry, but orders are orders.
And if you resist, then we'll
have to use...

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.365
...force.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.433
[nervous grunt]

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.467
<i>Shikadai!</i>

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.612
We're bringing you guys back to
the village. Because that's our
mission.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:03.517
I'm sure you know, but... if you
refuse, you'll be branded as
Rogue Ninja.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.188
That's right, and we really
don't want to see that happen!
So, come on, Sarada!

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:09.823
Cho-Cho...

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.492
Just hold on for a minute, would
ya, guys?!

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:17.164
I have to see Mitsuki one more
time and find out the truth from
him!

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.333
I understand you're worried
about your friend.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.469
But investigating the incident
isn't your mission, now, is it?

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:26.139
[grunt] You're telling me I
can't help a friend unless it's
a mission?!

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.508
No, that's not it!

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.412
I'm saying that you're making
this situation dangerous cause
you're rushing in all frantic!

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.515
You saying I'm being
irrational?!

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:35.015
(SHIKADAI) <i>Yeah!</i>

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.952
I get why you'd wanna rush in.
Mistuki's a friend.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:44.024
But it's exactly because he's a
friend that you should be cool
and rational about this, right?

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:46.527
[grunt]

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.463
I can't do that.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.132
[grunt] Boruto!

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:56.036
Shikadai, I can admit you're
making a strong argument.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.773
But all the same, I just have to
go and find Mitsuki!

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.108
You mean...

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:05.679
[sigh] Sadly, I don't think
we're gonna be able to convince
them to come.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:08.182
Ughhh!

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.784
[gasp] Get ready.

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.120
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:15.756
[grunt]

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.360
Partial Expansion Jutsu! Ahhh!

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:25.799
[grunts]

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.167
That was too close!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.304
[grunt]

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:33.307
[grunts]

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.177
I'd expect as much from Moegi
<i>Sensei. I've got no choice!</i>

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:47.654
[grunts]

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:53.660
I'm sorry. You're eyes are truly
amazing... But I'm not a jonin
for nothing.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:58.031
Don't worry though. I'll do
my best not to hurt Konohamaru's
student!

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:00.667
[grunts]

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:01.668
They're strong...

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:06.507
It's hard for any of us to use
jutsu that might be lethal to
you...

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.611
Luckily, there are lots of other
methods that we can use to
capture you.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.479
Yeah! Exactly!

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.148
Sealing Jutsu: Crouching Tiger
Bullet!

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:20.454
Not good! [grunts]

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.524
Boruto! [grunts]

00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:27.995
Sorry, Sarada! We're taking you
home. If it has to be like this,
then fine!

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.297
[straining]

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.433
What is-?! I-I can't move!

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:37.437
This is a new special move that
my Dad just taught me. Bet you
didn't know about this...

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:38.005
did ya?!

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:43.477
Even a problem child who won't
listen can't escape if he's
gotten sealed away in a scroll!

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.179
[grunts] Oh, yeah?

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.081
[grunt]

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.952
Huh? Ah!

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:52.586
What's that?!

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.988
[grunting]

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.623
Huh? What the-?

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.325
Sorry, Cho-Cho!

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.093
Ah! Ahhh!

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.362
Wait! Stop!

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:07.434
[grunts and heavy breathing]

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:08.569
[gasp]

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:15.475
No!

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:16.510
They got away...

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:19.980
What was the jutsu Boruto just
did?

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:22.516
He had a special jutsu up his
sleeve, huh...?

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:26.920
I figured out the pattern to
<i>their actions.</i>

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:29.189
Twenty-seven more moves and it's
<i>over.</i>

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:39.633
Hey, Yurito. You just loafing
around again, or-?

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.435
So this is where you are...!

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:42.169
[gasp]

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:46.340
Oh, thank you! You can just put
it down right there.

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:51.211
Hm? What's wrong?

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.981
<i>I get the feeling you're here</i>
<i>for something else...</i>

00:06:54.014 --> 00:07:01.321
I heard that only Team 10 was
sent out to go retrieve Boruto
and Sarada. What's up with that?

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:04.491
Finding Mitsuki and bringing him
back is our top priority.

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:07.961
But we don't have the manpower
to add to Team 10.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:10.197
[growl] That isn't what I mean!

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.000
Pitting friends against each
other makes things hard!

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:18.438
Look, you don't have anything to
worry about. He learned a lot in
the Byakuya Gang incident.

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:21.441
He'll do the right thing, even
if they're friends.

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.977
Mm... Well, I suppose that's
okay...

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.012
Besides...

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.983
...I know him. He's probably
thinking the same thing I'm
thinking.

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:34.321
What? Come on! Spare me the
whole proud dad act.

00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:37.157
Well... it's the perfect mission
for him.

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:42.729
I see... They tried to deceive
us with Shadow Clones...

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.464
Just as Shikadai predicted.

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:46.633
You're up next.

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:48.135
Roger that!

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:55.442
The trees will be sparse from
here on out...

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.313
...which means they aren't going
to be able to hide from aerial
tracking.

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:01.481
Yeah, but... even though it's an
order...

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:05.152
I still don't like the
idea of having to battle
Sarada...

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:08.622
Hey, c'mon. I mean, it isn't
like we have to kill them!

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.625
If we can capture them this
time, then it's over.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:15.329
Wait, Shikadai! Are you just
forcing yourself to do this?

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:17.965
Uh...! What's that supposed to
mean?

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:22.002
I knew it! You act like you're
cool with all this, but
really...

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:24.638
you're worried about Boruto and
Mitsuki too, right?

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.440
Shut up! Is that wrong?!

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:30.444
'Course not! I mean, I know that
you're a surprisingly kind
person.

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:32.613
Yeah, well, Mitsuki's my friend
too.

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:36.783
That's why we can't let this
thing get any bigger than it is
now.

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.485
You're right.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:41.321
Mitsuki is why Boruto and Sarada
deserted...

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.291
and that certainly won't improve
his standing in the village.

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:47.261
So Lord Seventh won't be able to
keep protecting him?

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:49.463
Is that what you mean?

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:50.764
Mm.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.936
That's why stopping them here
isn't only for their sake, it's
also for Mitsuki's sake...

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:56.570
as well.

00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:58.605
So unless their reason's
perfectly rational...

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.609
we can't really lend any merit
to whatever they might have to
say.

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.745
Seems like you understand!

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:08.749
For everyone's sake, huh?

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:13.620
What bothers me is that even the
normally level-headed Sarada
went off with Boruto.

00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:16.523
There must be something pushing
them to do this.

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:19.660
But if so, what is it?

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:20.627
(INOJIN) <i>Found 'em!</i>

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:21.195
Huh?!

00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:23.597
What?

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.666
But there are two pairs!

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:29.336
There are two sets of Boruto and
<i>Sarada going in opposite</i>
<i>directions.</i>

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:35.175
Shadow Clones, huh. What do you
think Shikadai?

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:38.612
Seems like a classic strategy to
split up our fighting power.

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:42.616
We'll go after one pair of them.
Moegi Sensei, the other.

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:46.987
I get it. Take down the decoys,
and then regroup.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.990
I see! So, then... whoever finds
them...

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:53.160
Yeah. We'll still have the
advantage.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:02.169
It's gonna be checkmate, Boruto.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.512
Huh?!

00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:12.980
What's wrong?

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:15.649
Moegi Sensei just took out both
of our decoys...

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:17.217
Man, she's good...

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:18.552
[gasp]

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:20.554
[grunts and gasp]

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:27.027
They caught up already?!

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.830
Well, it seems like we've got
the real ones.

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:33.500
I really think that you should
give this whole thing up now.

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:36.303
Do we really have to fight each
other, Cho-Cho?

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:39.006
It's hard for me, too... Aghhh!

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:43.310
Nuh-uh! Sorry, but I'm not gonna
hold back this time around.
Sarada!

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:43.710
[gasp]

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:49.816
Boruto, I won't show any mercy
to you or to Mitsuki, either.
I'll stop you right here!

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.818
[gasp] Oh yeah?

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:55.355
I guess neither of us is
willing to bend for friendship.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:57.191
Hmph!

00:10:57.224 --> 00:11:01.361
Well... it seems there's no
other way. So let's do this!

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.297
First, Shadow Clones to confuse
<i>us...</i>

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.232
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:11.205
Obvious!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.208
Hm?!

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.211
Bleh!

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:21.548
I'm gonna get you with one shot!

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:23.217
[pained grunts]

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:27.621
<i>Then Sarada will take</i>
<i>advantage of the chaos...</i>

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.658
If I take down the command
post...

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:34.494
[pained groans] Eh...!

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:35.229
[grunt]

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:36.663
Whoaaa!

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:37.231
[pained grunt]

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.503
Are you okay, Sarada? [grunt]

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:46.807
I've seen the same strategy over
and over. It may work on other
people...

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.176
but it's not gonna work
on me.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.913
Hmph! Seriously?! You think
you've got this already?

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:55.382
And I know that desperate trick,
as well.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:57.985
Okay, again!

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.489
Sarada, help out!

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:04.224
Like I'd let you!

00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:04.391
[grunt]

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.159
Oh, yeah? Cha!

00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:08.362
Yeah! [straining]

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.530
[grunt]

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:10.564
[worried groan]

00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:13.166
[grunt] Ah!

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:14.201
[pained grunt]

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:21.642
Let's go!

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:22.643
Yeah!

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.711
Now! Boruto Stream!

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:28.482
How bout an aerial attack?! Try
this!

00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:29.216
Ah!

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.451
[gasp]

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:32.553
You're done!

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:35.389
Hmph!

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.227
[straining]

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:45.999
Ha Ha!

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:48.468
Shadow Paralysis...

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:50.304
...now complete.

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:53.207
[straining] Boruto! [pained
struggling]

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:57.444
Everything's going just the way
you said, Shikadai.

00:12:57.477 --> 00:13:03.217
I figured that you'd believe a
plan as simple as this one would
actually work. And I was right.

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:04.551
D-Damn it!

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:08.689
So you switched in the
explosion!

00:13:08.722 --> 00:13:11.358
Moegi Sensei's gonna be here
soon.

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:13.694
Sorry, but that's checkmate,
Boruto.

00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:16.496
Shikadai... I have to find
Mitsuki!

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.364
You idiot!

00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:17.731
[strained grunt]

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.702
You can't just leave Mitsuki
alone, just like I can't leave
you alone!

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:25.339
I can't just stand by and watch
you be reckless!

00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:27.040
Shikadai!

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:34.381
Huh?! Wha-?! Isn't that...?!

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:36.984
(SHIKAMARU) <i>To begin with...</i>

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:40.988
I think there's more to this
incident than merely what meets
<i>the eye.</i>

00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:44.491
And what does that mean?

00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:48.028
Whether Mitsuki was behind the
attack on the gate or not...

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.531
he couldn't have pulled it off
all alone.

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:51.098
You mean...?

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:54.034
...that it's some kind of
conspiracy, then?

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.637
I can't say it is for sure.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:02.009
But... it is also possible that
Boruto and Sarada have managed
to find some kind of clue.

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:06.013
So... let me guess: the reason
you sent Shikadai...

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.815
I'm not able to leave my post
right now.

00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:13.453
So, then... if for some reason,
Shikadai does uncover
something...

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:16.390
...then he'll be able to make
the optimum decision.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.661
(SHIKADAI) <i>I'm gonna get going.</i>

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:21.995
Right.

00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:26.700
Shikadai, you know the
proverb...?

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:31.004
"The knight that jumps far can
fall prey to a pawn."

00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:34.007
Meaning, if a knight tries to
charge in alone...

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.977
he could be taken down when he
isn't expecting it.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.545
Yeah, I know the proverb.

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:41.381
Well. That's good, then.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.653
He won't get ahead of himself. I
made sure.

00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:48.021
[sigh]

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:50.691
Well... hopefully, it doesn't
backfire.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:55.062
(SHIKADAI) <i>Is that the snake</i>
Mitsuki uses to send messages?
<i>Where'd you find it?</i>

00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:57.664
Just outside the Leaf Village.

00:14:57.698 --> 00:15:01.702
Well, then? Tell me what message
he gave to you?

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:06.373
It was just something super
vague! It said, "This is my
will", okay?!

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.348
But still, something big is
going on with him! He left me
this message!

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:16.717
So it has to mean
something!

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.553
And I gotta find out what that
is!

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:21.355
[pained grunts] Boruto!

00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:25.359
All this time, I really believed
I knew him well. But
actually...

00:15:25.392 --> 00:15:29.196
I didn't know anything at all!
<i>That's why I have to go!</i>

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.202
Hey, what's up, Shikadai?

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:38.005
Seems the game board has
changed.

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:40.174
Sorry, dad...

00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:42.209
[gasp]

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:47.214
[gasp] Huh?

00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:51.018
I'm going with Boruto.

00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:54.221
What?!

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:03.197
They're probably fighting the
<i>real pair by now... I gotta</i>
<i>hurry!</i>

00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:05.232
[gasp]

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:09.970
Who's there?

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:16.476
<i>Could he be... one of the</i>
<i>assailants?</i>

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.979
Tell me, what village are you
from?

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:26.320
Oh? Won't answer? Okay... I
guess I'll just have to beat you
into confessing!

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:29.223
[grunt]

00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:30.824
[grunt] Huh?!

00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:33.193
[grunts]

00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:36.530
<i>He's strong! Who is he?!</i>

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:38.999
Water Style: Water Hail!

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:45.005
Hey! What is going on?!

00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:48.675
Wait. Just hold on. First hear
me out, okay?

00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:50.010
Just think about it...

00:16:50.043 --> 00:16:52.479
If Mitsuki truly wanted to leave
the village...

00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:55.849
why would he have to attack the
guards at the gate?

00:16:55.883 --> 00:16:59.086
<i>He would've had plenty of</i>
opportunities to simply sneak
<i>away.</i>

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:02.556
That's true.

00:17:04.758 --> 00:17:07.027
And then there's this snake,
too...

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.900
Mitsuki took the time to leave
Boruto a message.

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:15.669
I don't understand. What about
it?

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:19.840
If he's actually a spy who
betrayed the village, wouldn't
that be kinda weird?

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:23.877
Would he really want to leave
behind such damaging evidence?

00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:27.014
Uh... You know , you might have
a point, but...

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.050
Breaking through security,
leaving the message...

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:33.387
I can't believe that was all
premeditated...

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.858
Mitsuki might be caught up in
the middle of some unthinkable
situation.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.862
So then... you're saying you
believe Mitsuki's innocent?

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:45.199
I didn't say that. Don't jump to
conclusions.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.770
It's just that all these little
suspicions...

00:17:49.803 --> 00:17:55.175
...are starting to add up to one
big suspicion. And that flips
the game board.

00:17:56.944 --> 00:18:02.049
So, in order to try to clear up
this mystery, I'm going with you
Boruto.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.885
Shikadai!

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:08.789
Like I told you, Mitsuki's my
friend as well.

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:11.458
And besides, you're way too
reckless.

00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:13.660
But don't go celebrating just
yet.

00:18:13.694 --> 00:18:16.830
The incident with the
guards still hasn't been
disproven.

00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:21.034
If it turns out that Mitsuki
really is a traitor, then that's
that.

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:25.639
[laughing] You talk a lot, but
as of right now, you're as
guilty as me!

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:30.811
Oh, shut up, I'm not like you!
After all, at least I'm able to
think things through!

00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:35.582
I'm sorry... But please
apologize to Moegi Sensei for
me.

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:37.684
Hey, are you serious?

00:18:37.718 --> 00:18:41.989
Boruto's right! You'll be called
a deserter, too! Come on,
Cho-Cho, say something...

00:18:42.022 --> 00:18:42.623
would ya?!

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.327
Hmmm... Alright! Well then, I'm
going with Sarada too!

00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:47.828
Uh...!

00:18:47.861 --> 00:18:48.729
Seriously! I mean...

00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:54.334
I don't wanna be the one to get
yelled at by Moegi Sensei for
not stopping you guys.

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:56.970
And besides, I also wanna help
you out, Sarada!

00:18:57.004 --> 00:18:58.805
[chuckle] Cho-Cho, you're the
best!

00:18:58.839 --> 00:19:00.841
Ugh, seriously? [sigh]

00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:05.145
Well, I don't wanna get stuck
with the short end of the stick
either...

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:07.314
Wait... Don't tell me that...

00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:08.182
Look...

00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:11.418
...all three of us together make
up Ino-Shika-Cho, don't we?

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:16.990
Well, alright... Since it's come
to this, then I'm just gonna say
that you two forced me into it.

00:19:17.024 --> 00:19:18.225
You guys!

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:19.493
[chuckle]

00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:20.227
[chuckle]

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:24.565
[exasperated sigh] You're kinda
sticking your nose into our
business...

00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:26.500
Yeah, like you're one to talk!

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:29.369
We haven't been together
this long for nothing, right?

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:35.309
Huh?!

00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:39.313
[gasp]

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:45.319
[grunts]

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:50.624
Huh?! [grunts]

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:56.330
He's gone... Why did he retreat?

00:19:56.363 --> 00:20:01.034
He wasn't even trying to kill
<i>me. What was he doing?</i>

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:04.371
[gasp] He was buying time! Oh
no! The kids!

00:20:08.475 --> 00:20:10.544
[grunt and gasp]

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:17.551
(CHO-CHO) <i>We're sorry,</i>
<i>Moegi-Sensei!</i>

00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:23.156
Damn those rotten kids! How dare
they! Aghhh!

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:34.201
Ryuchi Cave, huh?

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:39.907
Yeah. We're heading there so the
White Snake Sage can extract
information from Mitsuki's
snake.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.344
I'm starting to get a really bad
feeling about this whole
thing...

00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:48.148
To deal with the White Snake
Sage, we can't use ordinary
methods.

00:20:48.182 --> 00:20:53.587
We don't know if they're friend
or foe. There's no point in
worrying about it now.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.158
Look at us! We were all
fighting, and now you're coming
all with us!

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:03.363
Come on, don't be so naive. I
just explained that I don't
fully believe you yet.

00:21:03.397 --> 00:21:07.501
All I wanna do is find out the
truth. That's why I'm coming.

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:12.806
Sorry, Dad. The knight ended up
<i>falling prey to a pawn after</i>
<i>all.</i>

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.311
<i>But... there's no way I can</i>
<i>leave them to do this alone.</i>
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:19.213
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>it's beyond them.</i>

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:22.549
Man, this is a real drag...

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:31.658
[sigh] I think this ought to be
far enough, right?

00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:36.597
It sure isn't easy slowing down
a jonin without showing your
cards.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.868
[sigh] That guys's impulses
always cause such a headache for
me...

00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:43.203
Or maybe he's just a proud
dad...

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:57.851
Oh... [shivering] This is super
creepy! [groan]

00:21:57.885 --> 00:22:00.320
Ryuchi Cave should be just up
ahead...

00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:03.223
Yeah... Let's go!

00:23:43.457 --> 00:23:45.659
(INOJIN) <i>So what's Ryuchi Cave</i>
<i>like?</i>

00:23:45.692 --> 00:23:50.497
(SARADA) <i>It's a place of this</i>
world, while at the same time,
<i>not of this world.</i>

00:23:50.531 --> 00:23:53.834
It's a secluded site where Sages
<i>live and undergo severe</i>
<i>training.</i>

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:57.171
(INOJIN) <i>Uhhh... Are we gonna</i>
<i>make it out of there alive?</i>

00:23:57.204 --> 00:24:00.641
(BORUTO) [chuckle] <i>Guess there's</i>
<i>no telling what we might stir</i>
<i>up...</i>

00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:06.013
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "The Trials of</i>
<i>Ryuchi Cave."</i>

00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:10.551
Just you wait!, White Snake
Sage! We're definitely gonna
find you!
