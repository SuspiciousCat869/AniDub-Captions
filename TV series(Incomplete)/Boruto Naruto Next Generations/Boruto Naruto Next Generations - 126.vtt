WEBVTT

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.442
(soft music)

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.545
[Naruto] Are you
feeling any better?

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.746
I am.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.349
Once my chakra's fully
restored, I'll be just fine.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:19.553
This plan to stay a step
ahead of the Otsutsuki

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.821
and to protect Shukaku,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.956
kinda blew up into a giant mess.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.358
'Cause it did,

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.494
it's now clear that his goal
is to accumulate chakra.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:31.098
Which means there's no
doubt he'll strike again.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.966
With everything that's happened,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.202
I'm worried about the
other Tailed Beasts, too.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.337
[Shikamaru] It'll all
depend on the outcome

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.339
of the Five Kage
Summit, of course,

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.341
but every village'll
have to stay alert

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.744
and take measures to
protect their Tailed Beasts.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.548
Yeah, and if anything happens,
then I'll head right out.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.082
It's not foolproof,

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.818
but for now, that's
about all that we can do.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.353
Hey, come on, guys!

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:56.356
Just how long do I have to
stay in here like this, anyway?

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.358
You're under protection here,

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.360
where Naruto can
keep an eye on you.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.497
It's not wise to appear
as your larger form.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.966
I'm sorry about
all this, Shukaku.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.402
But you're gonna be staying
with me for a while.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.536
(grunts)

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.072
I'm only doing this 'cause
you and Gaara asked me to.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:15.943
But I don't like being under
the same roof as that damn Fox!

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.412
(air whooshing)

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:19.613
(scoffs)

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.950
[Kurama] Just getting a whiff
of your scent sickens me,

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.551
you dumb tanuki.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:26.086
What did you just say?

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.621
-You wanna fight?
-(scoffs)

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.824
[Kurama] You couldn't
even beat that Otsutsuki.

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.826
You think you can defeat me?

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.963
I would've never
messed up like that.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.364
Why, you--

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.834
Y'know, I never liked you,
Fox, and I never will!

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:41.935
(groans)

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.937
Hey, what's going on, here?

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:46.406
Kurama, Shukaku,
that's enough now!

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.474
(Kurama scoffs)

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.943
You're always hiding
inside of Naruto!

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.078
Come on out, Fox!

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.946
What's the matter,
you scared of me?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.350
[Kurama] Scared of a
tanuki in a tea kettle?

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:59.953
Don't get worked up or you'll
make the tea boil over!

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:02.823
-(chuckles)
-(kettle whistling)

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.358
How dare you!

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.227
C'mon guys, you're
both Tailed Beasts.

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.830
Why are you so
unfriendly to each other?

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:13.200
I can only imagine
what's gonna happen.

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.304
(Opening Theme Music)

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.321
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.273
(insects chirping)

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.043
I'm home!

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.245
Welcome back, Daddy!

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:06.079
Hey!

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:07.915
-Thank you, Himawari!
-Huh?

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:09.917
Wait, is that who I think it is?

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.653
Hey, Boruto, long time no see!

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:14.054
(yelps)

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.557
So, you're still stuck
inside that thing, Shukaku?

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.491
Yeah.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:20.093
He's going to be staying
right here with us

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:22.829
until we can decide on an
official safe house for him.

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:23.931
Oh, yeah?

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.066
Well then, welcome to our home!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.367
-(scoffs)
-Thanks,

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.770
but I really don't wanna
hang around here too long.

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.371
Uh, what?

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:32.773
It's Shukaa-ku!

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:33.807
Huh?

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.577
It's a talking Shukaa-ku!

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.480
Himawari, he's not a Shukaa-ku
toy, he's the real Shukaku!

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:43.083
The toy was actually
modeled after him.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.484
[Shukaku] Hey, hold on.

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:46.954
Do you think I'm a
toy or something?

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.456
-He's just so cute!
-Come on, already, lemme go!

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:53.227
-Nice to meet you, Shukaa-ku!
-Listen, my name's Shukaku!

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.295
It's really Shukaa-ku!

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:56.263
(groaning)

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.232
[Shukaku] Hey, stop it,
come on, put me down!

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.334
-(giggling)
-I guess not even Shukaku

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.169
can put up a fight
against Himawari.

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.304
Oh, my goodness,
what's going on?

00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:06.340
Look, Mommy, it's Shukaa-ku!

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:10.410
-Oh, I see, you're right!
-No, she's not!

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:12.613
(bright music)

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:16.049
You were really able to take
the whole day off tomorrow?

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:18.452
Yeah, but babysitting him

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.088
kinda feels a lot like
still being at work.

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.090
Babysitting who, exactly?

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:25.659
I'll have you know that
I'm the proud One Tail!

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.928
Not just some toy or a pet!

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.930
So don't treat me like one!

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:31.198
I'm not like Kurama,

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.600
who's practically a
domesticated animal!

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:37.804
Hey, so, there are nine Tailed
Beasts overall, am I right?

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.606
Yeah, from One
Tail to Nine Tails.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.910
They're named according to
the number of tails they have.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:46.547
Wow, there's that
many like Mr. Shukaku?

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.048
That's just so cool!

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.784
I wish I could get to
meet them all one day!

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:52.052
[Naruto] Well, uh,

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.655
they've all got really
strong personalities

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.056
and do things their own way.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.492
So, it's not as easy
as it might sound.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.461
What he means is we don't
like being obligated

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.597
to do what you
humans tell us to do.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.668
Although, that's kinda what
you're doing right now.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.070
-Huh?
-(giggling)

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.706
And you have a Tailed
Beast inside of you, too,

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:15.442
-isn't that right, Dad?
-Yeah, his name's Kurama.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.345
So, you could say the reason
you're as strong as you are

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.514
is 'cause of Kurama's
chakra, right?

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.350
(exploding)

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.786
The Hidden Leaf
Village is my home.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.921
Everyone here's my family!

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:31.158
I won't let you do this to us!

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:35.729
(roaring)

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:54.081
Yeah, I guess you could say
that's true for the most part.

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:57.951
You see, people like me
and Gaara, Old Man Bee

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:00.053
and Kagura's grandpa, too,

00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:01.955
we're what's called Jinchuriki.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:03.624
Jinchuriki?

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:06.927
Yeah, back when villages
were always fighting,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.630
we were all treated
like secret weapons

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:12.466
'cause we were the vessels
for the Tailed Beasts.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.202
To be honest, it's a
pretty sad history.

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:18.138
But things are totally
different now, right?

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:19.640
Huh?

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:20.607
Yeah!

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:23.644
If Mr. Fox is inside
you right now, Daddy,

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:25.078
then I'd like to meet him!

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:27.314
-(giggles)
-Well, he's always sleeping,

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:29.683
and he never wants
to come out anymore!

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:30.817
Oh, really?

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.219
That's too bad.

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:35.956
And besides, that Fox's hatred
of humans is set in stone.

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.591
You should just
forget all about it!

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:41.295
Oh, will you play with me,
instead, Mr. Shukaa-ku?

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:42.329
Huh?

00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:44.331
Tell me, why exactly
would I wanna play

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.334
-with some human kid?
-Aw, you're no fun.

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:51.205
[Naruto] Uh, actually,
Himawari, I'm sorry but he and I

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:53.540
need to have a little
conference right now, anyway.

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:54.341
What?

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:55.542
-A conference?
-That's right!

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:58.245
We get to go and talk
with some old friends!

00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:59.046
Nope.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.048
Don't wanna.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:04.518
(enthusiastic music)

00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:05.619
[Naruto] Hey, guys!

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.422
It's been a while since
we got together like this!

00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:12.693
-Isobu.
-(grunts)

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:14.228
-Son.
-Hey.

00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.463
-Saiken.
-Hi, there.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.233
[Naruto] Gyuki, have you
healed up from the wounds

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:20.934
you got from the Otsutsuki?

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:21.935
(Gyuki chuckles)

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:23.504
[Gyuki] Completely!

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:24.705
(Kurama scoffs)

00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:27.508
[Kurama] This is the Tailed
Beasts' psyche plane,

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:29.176
linked by our minds.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.912
We can meet anytime we want to!

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:34.047
Well, yeah, true, but--

00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:36.316
[Gyuki] It looks like
there are a few guys

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.452
who decided not to come, anyway.

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:41.855
[Naruto] Yeah, Matatabi,
Kokuo, and Chomei

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:45.425
said that they were gonna
pass on coming to the meeting.

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:47.528
(flames crackling)

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:49.930
(hooves knocking)

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:52.566
(air whooshing)

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:53.934
(Son chuckling)

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.903
[Son] Well, we Tailed
Beasts like to live

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:57.070
on our own terms!

00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:58.338
You can't deny that!

00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.940
[Saiken] After all this time,

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:02.075
if humans tell us that
they're gonna protect us,

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:04.678
not many will believe them.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.079
[Isobu] Yes, I agree.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.215
Even if we're told
that it's to protect us

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:10.083
from a threat like
the Otsutsuki.

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:12.085
[Naruto] Oh man, I see.

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.655
[Son] Of course,
it'd be different

00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:17.057
if you insisted on it, Naruto.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.395
All of us owe you a big debt
of gratitude, after all.

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:22.329
(giggles)

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:24.364
Well, thanks, guys,
I appreciate it.

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:26.967
[Gyuki] Hey, by the way,
where's the One Tail?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.937
Isn't he staying with
you for the time being?

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.539
[Naruto] Yeah, he is, but--

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.174
[Kurama] Isn't it obvious?

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:36.844
He's too embarrassed
to show himself.

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:41.281
He knows we're all gonna make
fun of him for what happened!

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:44.785
-(groans)
-You damned Fox!

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:46.353
Don't be so full of yourself!

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:49.923
You just watch me, I'm gonna
make you take back those words!

00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:51.525
Huh?

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:52.793
(sighs)

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:55.596
(birds chirping)

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.771
[Kurama] You've totally settled

00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:07.374
into the role of dad, Naruto.

00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:08.575
Aw, shut up!

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:11.545
I mean, you're kinda acting
like my parent, right?

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:12.646
(Kurama scoffs)

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.249
[Kurama] Yeah, pretty much.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.517
(giggles)

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.518
Hm?

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.519
What?

00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:19.386
(chuckles)

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:21.455
Remember the Hokage's
Inauguration?

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:24.191
Himawari snapped,
released her Byakugan,

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:26.560
and knocked the both of us out?

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:27.794
(punching)

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:30.163
(grunting)

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:35.035
I guess we're both
pretty bad parents.

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:36.904
I mean, don't you agree?

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:38.805
[Kurama] Can't we drop that?

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:40.207
(giggles)

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.644
Plus, back then, you
didn't dodge well enough.

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:46.013
(chuckles)

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.717
(door creaks shut)

00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:58.058
So, the Fox was actually
silenced by this kid?

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.196
Oh, boy, I sure do
like the sound of that!

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:06.667
(cheerful music)

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.270
[Boruto] It's been so long
since we all went out together!

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.472
We're taking
Shukaa-ku too, right?

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:13.574
(chuckles)

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:16.009
Well, we can't leave him
all alone at home, can we?

00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:19.580
Ha, there's no choice,
so let's go have fun!

00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:20.747
Yay!

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:23.617
Oh, wow, so you're
not complaining?

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.420
[Shukaku] This could
be my big chance!

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:30.023
I can find out the details about
how she knocked out Kurama.

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:32.125
That'll give me enough material

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.862
to make fun of him
for a nice long time!

00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:37.598
Do you two have
everything that we need?

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:38.599
Yeah!

00:11:38.632 --> 00:11:41.969
(cheerful music)

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:43.270
(Himawari giggling)

00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:45.205
[Boruto] Hey, wait up, Hima!

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:49.743
Look at them,
they're so excited!

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:52.613
(cheerful music)

00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:37.324
(air whooshing)

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:40.127
(Naruto snoring)

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.864
(sighs)

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:45.599
Come on, dad!

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:49.002
(snoring continues)

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:51.872
He's always falling
asleep like this!

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:54.842
He's exhausted, let's
let him get some sleep!

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.977
I'm sorry about this, you two.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.512
Eh, it's fine!

00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:01.014
Hey, let's look over
there, Himawari.

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:02.482
Okay, Big Brother!

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.987
(birds chirping)

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.122
[Shukaku] I've been watching
her for a while now,

00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:11.425
but there doesn't seem to be
anything different about her.

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.861
She just seems like
an ordinary kid!

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:17.130
Did she really
knock that Fox out?

00:13:17.164 --> 00:13:20.033
Maybe I should just
come out and ask her.

00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:22.302
Hey, I need to talk to you.

00:13:22.336 --> 00:13:23.270
Huh?

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.840
I have a secret mission
that only you can do!

00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:28.876
Mission?

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:31.845
You think that you can
get away from Boruto?

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.347
Sure thing!

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:38.151
Hey, Big Brother, I'm going
to go and use the restroom.

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:41.021
Oh, okay, you all
right by yourself?

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:42.990
I'm not a little kid anymore.

00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:46.727
And Shukaa-ku said he'd
come along with me.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.629
-Let's go!
-Okay.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.633
Wow, the two of them have gotten

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:54.968
really close super quickly!

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.237
[Shukaku] What?

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:58.972
You don't remember it happening?

00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:01.875
No, I remember that
Daddy overslept

00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:04.444
on the day he was gonna
become the Hokage.

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:05.979
But except for that,

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:08.448
I don't really remember
what happened at all.

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:10.384
Aw, seriously?

00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:13.520
You mean I went through all
of this trouble for nothing?

00:14:13.554 --> 00:14:15.722
If I knew that this
was gonna happen,

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:18.258
-I wouldn't've come along!
-Huh?

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:20.894
You're not having
fun, Shukaa-ku?

00:14:20.928 --> 00:14:22.596
-Ah!
-(groans)

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:24.264
No, actually, I'm not!

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:26.400
I'll have you know that
I'm a Tailed Beast!

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.969
So humans and I have
nothing in common!

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:30.370
But Shukaa-ku--

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:32.873
It's not Shukaa-ku,
it's Shukaku!

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:33.974
This is annoying!

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:35.876
Just leave me alone for a while!

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:37.744
I'm gonna take a nap!

00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:42.649
(sighs)

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:48.088
(birds chirping)

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:51.725
Ah--

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:53.493
Oh, you're back.

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:56.396
Hey, where's Shukaku?

00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:59.633
(grunts)

00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:02.970
-(scoffs)
-I knew it all along!

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:06.473
Living with humans just
doesn't suit me at all!

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:08.509
(yawning)

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:12.246
Man, I really am
getting sleepy here.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.583
-(groans)
-(metallic thud)

00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:18.752
(snoring)

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:26.126
-(soft piano music)
-(birds chirping)

00:15:28.862 --> 00:15:31.865
[Man] Who just leaves a big
piece of trash right here?

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:33.534
[Cleaner] It is
perfect timing, though.

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:37.237
We can just put it in with the
load going to the scrap yard.

00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:49.983
I don't see Shukaa-ku.

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:53.387
-But he was napping right here.
-And once he's asleep,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.123
he takes his time
waking back up again.

00:15:58.492 --> 00:15:59.726
Huh?

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.297
-Um, hey, excuse me!
-Hm, yes?

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.400
You happen to see
an old tea kettle

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.769
-lying somewhere nearby?
-Oh, that thing?

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:11.705
Yeah, it got hauled away
with the rest of the trash.

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.106
-The trash?
-What?

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.843
-No way, Shukaa-ku!
-It oughta be on its way

00:16:15.876 --> 00:16:17.744
to the scrap yard
near here by now.

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:19.513
To the scrap yard?

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:24.618
(dramatic music)

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:29.590
(scrap metal clunking)

00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:32.526
(machine whirring)

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:43.203
(metal clunk)

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:45.639
Hey, Shukaku!

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:49.443
You here?

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:51.478
Shukaku!

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:53.447
Big Brother, look!

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.850
(machine whirring)

00:16:56.884 --> 00:16:58.252
[Boruto] At this rate--

00:16:58.285 --> 00:17:01.455
[Himawari] Someone,
please stop that machine!

00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:03.023
Damn it, what do we do?

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:05.859
I guess I have no
choice but to break it!

00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:06.994
(sighs)

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.763
If Mom were here
with her Byakugan--

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:11.265
Poor Shukaku!

00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:14.001
This is all because I didn't
watch him well enough!

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:17.437
(scrap metal clunking)

00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:20.374
(machine whirring)

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:24.478
What now?

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:25.512
What now?

00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:35.656
(enthusiastic music)

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.262
Locked on!

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:49.503
-(air whooshing)
-(grunts)

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:51.605
Huh?

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:53.473
What's going on here?

00:17:55.609 --> 00:17:56.743
No way.

00:17:56.777 --> 00:17:58.712
(air whooshing)

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.081
(grunting)

00:18:03.784 --> 00:18:05.085
Oh, what?

00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:08.622
(screaming)

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.624
(banging)

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:12.726
Ouch!

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:13.727
[Shukaku] Huh?

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.629
What?

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:16.997
Shukaa-ku!

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.599
Oh, thank goodness!

00:18:18.632 --> 00:18:19.600
[Shukaku] Huh?

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:20.601
Uh.

00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:22.269
I'm so sorry, Shukaa-ku.

00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:24.838
I know you told me to
leave you alone, but--

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:28.442
Oh, no, it's okay,
don't worry about it.

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:29.576
Really?

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.845
-(giggling)
-I don't get it,

00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:35.482
but I guess she's really
strong, after all!

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:37.351
(grunting)

00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:38.352
Huh?

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:39.486
Oh!

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.088
You okay, Big Brother?

00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:44.892
[Boruto] Yeah, I mean,
honestly, this is nothing

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:47.628
compared to being
targeted by the Byakugan!

00:18:48.762 --> 00:18:52.032
(insects chirping)

00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:54.001
-(snoring)
-Really?

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:55.736
(chuckles)

00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:58.338
(soft music)

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:06.880
Hey, you!

00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:09.316
Talk to me, I know
you're awake in there.

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:10.317
(Kurama scoffs)

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.320
[Kurama] It's too bad
that your plan failed.

00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:14.454
(groans)

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:16.023
Oh, so you knew, huh?

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:18.725
You're always so
irritating, you know that?

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:20.761
[Kurama] So, what now?

00:19:20.794 --> 00:19:23.730
You gonna pick a
fight like usual?

00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:26.266
Not today, although I could!

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.836
I gotta tell ya, every single
person in this household

00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:31.238
has been driving me
absolutely crazy!

00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:34.541
[Kurama] Ah, for once, we agree!

00:19:34.575 --> 00:19:37.978
After just three days
here, you get it.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.981
But at least they're
never boring!

00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:43.417
(scoffs)

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.454
-Tell me something, Fox--
-What is it?

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:48.655
You know,

00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:51.592
I notice that you never
came out of Naruto anymore,

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:52.893
I figured that it was probably

00:19:52.926 --> 00:19:55.729
just because you
hated humans so much.

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:57.130
But now,

00:19:57.164 --> 00:20:00.000
I'm wondering if maybe that
isn't actually the case.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:03.003
Maybe it's that protecting
this family is--

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.638
[Kurama] Don't be ridiculous.

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:07.808
-(chuckles)
-Okay, I get it!

00:20:07.841 --> 00:20:10.978
It looks to me like I kinda
touched a nerve there, though,

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:12.412
-don't you think?
-(Kurama scoffs)

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:15.282
[Kurama] You're an
annoying tanuki.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:17.851
Aw, thanks, I love you too!

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:20.487
(soft music)

00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:29.263
(birds chirping)

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:44.411
Well, I'm talking off!

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:47.347
-Okay, see you, daddy.
-See you, Dad.

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:57.758
Huh?

00:20:59.793 --> 00:21:00.994
Huh?

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:04.998
(cheerful music)

00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:07.201
(giggling)

00:21:07.234 --> 00:21:08.569
(grunts)

00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:12.239
(cheerful music continues)

00:21:16.743 --> 00:21:18.378
Goodbye, Shukaa-ku!

00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:25.285
[Shikamaru] So then,

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:27.588
Shukaku will be brought
to the safe house

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:29.122
that's been prepared for him?

00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:31.158
Yeah, and all the other villages

00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:33.727
will do the same with
their Tailed Beasts.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.863
They'll be put under protection.

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:39.032
(Shukaku snoring)

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:42.503
Good grief, look at him
snoozing all carefree.

00:21:42.536 --> 00:21:45.572
I just don't get how
these Tailed Beasts think!

00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:47.407
Oh, it's not that hard.

00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.111
These guys are basically
like family, too.

00:21:51.879 --> 00:21:53.881
Like family, huh?

00:21:53.914 --> 00:21:57.017
Yeah, like family, ya' know!

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.720
(chuckles)

00:21:59.753 --> 00:22:02.623
(Shukaku snoring)

00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:13.767
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:29.883 --> 00:22:33.754
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.922 --> 00:23:44.157
(enthusiastic music)

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:45.859
[Boruto] Hey Sarada,

00:23:45.893 --> 00:23:47.761
do you know anything
about Mr. Jiraiya?

00:23:47.794 --> 00:23:49.263
He was my dad's master,

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:50.998
and he seems like
an amazing shinobi!

00:23:51.031 --> 00:23:52.399
[Sarada] I don't, really,

00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:54.868
but I think I saw
his name on a book

00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:56.837
-Mr. Kakashi was reading.
-Really?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.005
What was it called?

00:23:58.038 --> 00:24:00.240
[Sarada] I think the
title of it was--

00:24:00.274 --> 00:24:04.111
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:04.144 --> 00:24:05.279
"Make-Out Tactics."

00:24:05.312 --> 00:24:08.615
I'm definitely gonna
find Mr. Jiraiya's book!

00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:11.451
(upbeat music)

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:15.355
(singing in Japanese)
