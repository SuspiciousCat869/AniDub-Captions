00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.743
<i>(Shizuma) Now! New</i>
<i>Seven Ninja Swordsmen!</i>

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:14.247
Right on this hallowed site,
we light the first fires of
revolution!

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.884
Stop, you bastards!

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.119
Boruto?!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.088
You're here..? I told you not
to come.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:27.027
<i>(Shizuma) It's the Hokage's</i>
<i>son, and he's an even bigger</i>
<i>idiot than I expected.</i>

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.830
Yeah. Cuz I'm an idiot.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.599
Actually I came so I could
fight you.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.602
Fight him? Please, no.

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.037
You heard him correctly.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.371
Mizukage!

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:39.039
What the hell?

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:43.844
Yes, as Boruto just said, this
is a minor scuffle among some
rowdy kids.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.848
And I merely happened to pass
by in time to break it up.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.352
Shizuma, this is our chance
to finally take the Mizukage's
head.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.188
Crimson Mist Barrier.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.323
Get back!

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.492
Look out! [grunts]

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.627
[grunts]

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.929
[gasps]

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.631
[screams]

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.800
[gasps] Sarada?

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.175
[grunts]

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:20.013
Mr. Chojuro! What a sorry
state you're in!

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.715
[laughs]

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.085
Nobody's ever been able to
escape from this before.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.157
The curse of my Long Sword
Nuibari, the Sewing Needle!

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.593
Hmph!

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.096
I'm going to smash your head
in right now!

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.266
Old Man Chojuro?

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:46.172
Hey! Shizuma! You listen
to me!

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.208
Stop playing dirty!

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.284
[scared breathing]

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.988
<i>(Buntan Kurosaki) If anything</i>
<i>I wanted to be the one to</i>
<i>skewer the Hokage's kid.</i>

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:05.258
Just my luck it's you instead.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.198
Thunder Funeral Feast of
Lightning!

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.367
[gasps]

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:30.250
Oh. This might be a little fun
after all.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.820
[heavy breathing]

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:28.168
[grunting]

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.169
Hmph!

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.204
[grunts] Hmph!

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:35.709
<i>(Buntan) The Sharingan. I've</i>
<i>only heard rumors about it.</i>

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:40.847
<i>Who knew I'd get to experience</i>
<i>the real thing? Right here and</i>
<i>now.</i>

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:48.288
There you are! [grunts]

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:50.290
[gasps]

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:54.728
Hmph. [gasps]

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:00.466
<i>(Buntan) You missed!</i>

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.436
<i>(Sarada) [gasps]</i>

00:05:05.606 --> 00:05:07.908
[groans]

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:11.011
Damn, you're lucky!

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:16.182
What kind of stupid idiot
announces to his victim that
he's about to smash his head in?

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:18.719
Oh you're right.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:21.121
[grunts]

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.356
[slurping]

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.093
<i>(Hassaku) Stay outta my</i>
<i>way, Kyoho.</i>

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:32.966
I, Hassaku Onomichi, will be
the one to show you how to
properly wield a sword.

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.569
Make sure you aim well.

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:36.670
Huh?

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.241
Striking a target that can't
move can be extremely
difficult.

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:42.342
[grunt]

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:46.212
Hassaku! Hurry up and split
him in half starting at the
top of his head!

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:48.815
There's nothing I'd like
better!

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:49.983
[grunts]

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.854
What?!

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:57.658
[grunts]

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.625
Hmm?

00:05:58.992 --> 00:05:59.926
[grunts]

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:06.867
Didn't I just tell you, you
should make sure to aim well?

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.705
It's fine if this ends in a
draw.

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:15.108
But in the unlikely event you
fail to hit Chojuro...

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:19.045
it'll be the Explosive Blade,
Shibuki the Spatter's turn.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:24.184
[heavy breathing]

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.386
I'll gouge out both of your
eyes...

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.289
with my Lightning Blade, Kiba
the Fang!

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.693
You want these Sharingan that
badly?

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:34.561
[gasps]

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.498
Uh! [grunts]

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.471
(Buntan) Whew, I've gotta watch
out for that genjutsu from that
<i>nasty Sharingan.</i>

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.579
[gasps]

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.014
[grunts]

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:55.949
[grunting]

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:59.252
My Kiba can also be used like
this!

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:04.057
[grunting]

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.759
[screams]

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:08.294
<i>(Sarada) Water?</i>

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:12.098
[grunting]

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:15.168
[gasps]

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:22.442
Hmm, you're really quite
tough.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:26.513
But this time it's over. Ninja
Art: Snakehead.

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:35.756
[gasps]

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.096
<i>(Buntan) You're really at a</i>
<i>disadvantage now.</i>

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:47.433
I didn't realize that you were
so shy. Why don't you show
yourself?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.269
<i>(Buntan) [laughing]</i>

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.105
<i>Because I'm aware that another</i>
<i>feature of the Sharingan...</i>

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:56.710
is the ability to read the hand
<i>signs an opponent makes, and</i>
<i>then copy them.</i>

00:07:56.743 --> 00:08:01.347
<i>As long as you don't see the</i>
<i>signs I make, I don't need to</i>
<i>be afraid of you.</i>

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:03.717
<i>Let them mourn you when you're</i>
<i>dead!</i>

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:10.190
[gasps]

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.659
<i>(Buntan) Oh, good job!</i>

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:16.663
There!

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:18.665
[grunts]

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:28.675
Kagura! There you are!

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:30.476
<i>(Kagura) Boruto.</i>

00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:32.212
Let's just go home.

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:35.348
We can apologize together.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.351
You never should have shown up
here.

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:40.453
I warned you earlier.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:43.189
<i>(Boruto) Huh? What're you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:45.892
(kagura) It's already too late.

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:49.863
It's not too late. We can still
make it in time for roll call.

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:54.234
I warned you. Why did you
come?

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.971
You gave up your Hiramekarei!
You don't scare me anymore!

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:01.174
Like he could do anything
with that pitiful looking
sword anyway.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:04.010
Besides, he's underestimating
our Mist Blades.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:07.814
A sword is only as good as
the person who is wielding it.

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:11.718
Let me at him! [grunts]

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:13.453
[grunting]

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.621
[gasps]

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.056
[grunts]

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:18.491
[grunting]

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.126
Die now!

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.329
[grunting]

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.233
We'll delight in killing you...

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:31.872
and we'll use your blood spray
as the beacon for the Blood
Mist's revival!

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:41.014
A revival of the Blood Mist
Village? Sounds more like a
childish revolution to me!

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:44.050
<i>(Buntan) Revival, revolution,</i>
<i>call it whatever you want.</i>

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:49.856
I'm happy as long as I can rage
to my heart's content with my
Lightning Blade, Kiba the Fang!

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:54.427
<i>Oh, so you're worried about</i>
<i>the time, are you?</i>

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.397
The only thing I'm thinking
about is taking care of you
guys...

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.534
so we can make it back in time
for roll call by ten o' clock!

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:03.970
And I'm gonna take you down by
nine.

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:07.674
All you Hidden Leaf are the
same, you're way too
optimistic!

00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:14.681
<i>(Buntan) Now, now. Watch where</i>
<i>you step!</i>

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.116
[grunts]

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.985
[screams]

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:23.189
[gasps for breath]

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.290
[gasps]

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.096
[screaming]

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:36.737
Was that a clone?

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.210
I hate to admit that it was
Boruto's jutsu that just saved
me back there.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.918
Anyway, not figuring out her
Lightning Style, puts me at a
grave disadvantage!

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:56.990
Why don't you just give up
now?

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.826
The Snakehead already knows
where you are.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.862
There's nowhere to escape.

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:07.233
You'll die by the Lightning
Blade, Kiba the Fang. [laughing]

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:10.904
But before you die, let me
tell you about Kiba.

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:15.208
<i>(Buntan) The original owner of</i>
<i>this sword was Raiga Kurosuki.</i>

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:19.345
It was Naruto from your
village who fought with him,
and killed him.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:23.984
He was my father, although
sadly, he was never aware of
my existence.

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:29.189
At this rate, it's definitely do
or die!

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.924
I found you!

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.161
Are you crazy?!

00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:39.199
Lightning Style!

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.036
Lightning Ball!

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:48.809
Heh.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:52.312
I've finally found you, Miss
Shy Girl.

00:11:57.684 --> 00:12:00.854
(Both) Lighting Style!
Lightening Ball!

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.493
(Both) Thunder Funeral: Feast of
Lightning!

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.537
Is that all you've got?
Monkey see, monkey do?

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.875
You're one to talk! You're
getting all carried away with
that stolen sword of yours!

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.545
I earned this sword through
skill alone!

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:29.049
Not like your Sharingan you
got from your parents without
doing a single thing!

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:32.452
She's amplifying her chakra?

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:35.889
Kiba the Fang gives me all
the power that I need!

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.091
Ninja Art: Thunder Armor!

00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:45.866
[gasps/grunts]

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:48.301
You Hidden Leaf brat!

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:51.905
If you're gonna hate, then
hate the weak village that
raised you!

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:08.789
<i>(Mitsuki) So you think we can</i>
<i>save Boruto with this?</i>

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:11.391
I don't know. I don't have all
the answers!

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:15.361
All I know is that I want that
bum Shizuma to lose for sure.

00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:16.462
Got it.

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.066
I'll use this intel in the
most effective way possible.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.704
Hurry up and take it to your
dear, sweet, Boruto then.

00:13:23.737 --> 00:13:25.706
Isn't he your sun that shines
so bright?

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:26.973
I'll take it now.

00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:30.110
Thanks so much, Suigetsu.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:35.148
Well damn, you've finally
learned to say thank you.
Alright, what do you know?

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:44.991
[panting]

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:50.263
Oh, Kagura, nicely done. Your
grandfather would be proud.

00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:53.233
Kagura, stop.

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:57.037
You don't have to do this.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.706
We can go home now.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.376
Well, you're still
alive? Alright.

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:05.111
I'll handle this.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.581
Let me do it.

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:10.016
Excellent.

00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:12.519
Kagura! Don't do it!

00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:14.521
It's too bad.

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:16.990
Boruto.

00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:20.426
[yelling]

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:22.495
Kagura!

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.130
[attacking scream]

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.038
[sighs]

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:34.775
[grunts]

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:35.876
[grunts]

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:39.412
You damn copycat!

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:43.984
You're so annoying! Going on
about a parent you don't even
know! It's pathetic!

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.786
Like you'd even understand!

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:49.690
Do you think you're the only
one who's ever suffered
because of a parent?

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:50.524
[grunts]

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:52.893
Hmph!

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:57.197
I'm more than happy to give
you a little taste of my
childhood!

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.398
[grunts]

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:08.408
Hmm?

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.282
<i>(Young Buntan) Mommy!</i>

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.985
I caught the moon! Come and
see!

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:22.355
[giggles]

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:27.694
[gasps]

00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:30.263
Huh?

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:36.570
You're just like that
worthless man. Good for
nothing!

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:49.449
Heh I've got nothing to
lose. End of story.

00:15:50.183 --> 00:15:51.852
Hmph.

00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:54.588
[panting]

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.290
Looks like the fighting's
starting to wear on you, huh?

00:15:57.323 --> 00:16:01.094
There you are! I'm going to
sew up your mouth!

00:16:02.696 --> 00:16:03.864
[screams]

00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:06.032
[panting]

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:08.068
That was a really close call.

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:11.638
Yes it was. Are you that
terrified of getting cut?

00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:15.942
I can't imagine what kind of
stupid idiot would enjoy
getting cut up.

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:18.579
Without a doubt, getting cut
is painful.

00:16:18.612 --> 00:16:23.116
However, unless you're
prepared for your flesh to be
cut...

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.119
you will never sever the
bone.

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:27.320
[grunts]

00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:29.289
Stay away!

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.324
[grunts]

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:34.728
[grunting]

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:37.764
[shriek]

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:43.003
[groans]

00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:45.205
It's futile to continue
fighting now!

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:47.440
Lay down your swords
immediately!

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.776
No way!

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:54.915
This blade, the Executioner's
Blade, is the only thing I have!

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:57.751
And I will never part with
it!

00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:02.388
[grunting]

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:02.856
[grunts]

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:04.157
Ah!

00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:06.326
[gasps]

00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:10.196
[groans]

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.502
Still want to continue?

00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:19.305
I'm sorry.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.441
[sighs]

00:17:22.342 --> 00:17:25.311
You actually put up a decent
fight.

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:29.015
It doesn't matter. There're
countless other ways.

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:32.485
(Ichirota) Besides, this is all
<i>going according to the script.</i>

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:36.289
Your life is mine. Prepare to
die, Lord Sixth.

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:38.491
[grunts]

00:17:40.961 --> 00:17:41.895
Who are you?

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:44.064
All right!

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:47.267
That Boruto, always trying
to hog the spotlight.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.736
There's no way I'll let him
steal my thunder!

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.741
Did you come here with all of
them too? Don't tell me
there's more!

00:17:54.775 --> 00:17:58.444
I don't need them. I can
handle guys like you all by
myself!

00:17:58.478 --> 00:18:01.047
Hah! You're just a
mere simpleton.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.449
There's no need for me to
ruminate on it then.

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:04.217
Hmph!

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:06.520
I shall expel you! Hmph!

00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:09.155
Quit using all those fancy
words, damn it!

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:12.492
Heh.

00:18:15.028 --> 00:18:16.196
[grunts]

00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:18.599
Hmph!

00:18:18.632 --> 00:18:20.366
[groaning]

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.737
Now that's the way to
use a sword, Mr. Big Words!

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:31.211
I won't allow a fool like you to
get in the way of us executing
our impeccable plan!

00:18:31.244 --> 00:18:34.080
[grunts] I leave the rest to
you, Shizuma!

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.215
[gasps]

00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:46.860
What happened?

00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:49.329
Are you all done being a copy
cat?

00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:51.464
Don't think you can fool me.

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:54.735
The Sharingan uses up a
lot of chakra, doesn't it?

00:18:58.539 --> 00:18:59.706
[gasps]

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:03.143
[gasps]

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.648
Huh?

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.285
Bubbles?

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.890
<i>(Buntan) I found you!</i>

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:18.158
Hmph!

00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:22.028
Okay, it's about time to
bring this thing to a close.

00:19:22.062 --> 00:19:24.531
[heavy breathing]

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:28.602
I thought you said you were
going to take me down by nine
o' clock.

00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:31.672
Tick‐tock.

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.574
Tick‐tock...

00:19:33.607 --> 00:19:35.008
Tick...tock.

00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:43.049
<i>(Buntan)</i>
<i>Tick‐tock...Tick‐tock...</i>
<i>Tick‐tock...Tick‐tock...</i>

00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:44.985
Tick‐tock...

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.587
<i>(Buntan) Tick‐tock...</i>

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.320
[gasps]

00:19:47.988 --> 00:19:48.955
<i>(Buntan) Tick‐tock...</i>

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:00.333
[laughing]

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.536
<i>(Buntan) That Sharingan...</i>

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.470
will be mine!

00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:23.389
[groaning]

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:34.367
You Hidden Leaf half‐pints! You
should've stayed at the Academy
and kept your heads down.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.706
Genjutsu? Since when did you?!

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.344
(Sarada) You didn't notice? What
<i>did you think this thick mist</i>
<i>was?</i>

00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:51.818
[gasps]

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.591
Ever since then?

00:20:58.058 --> 00:20:59.459
Where are you?

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:01.695
(Sarada) Did you know that
running an electrical current...

00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:04.998
<i>above a fixed level in</i>
<i>water causes ionization?</i>

00:21:05.031 --> 00:21:06.366
W‐What?

00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:13.574
Yes, the electrolysis of
water produces oxygen...

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.009
and hydrogen.

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:21.414
[gasps]

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.129
[coughing]

00:21:36.162 --> 00:21:41.401
Good parent or bad, there
isn't a single one out there
who doesn't love their child.

00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:44.370
At least that's what I
believe.

00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:52.713
[yelling]

00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:54.815
Kagura.

00:21:54.848 --> 00:21:56.316
[yells]

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.218
Ah!

00:21:58.251 --> 00:21:59.219
[grunts]

00:21:59.252 --> 00:22:02.656
[panting]

00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:03.857
Kagura.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.427
What each of us saw growing up
is completely different.

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:10.831
[panting]

00:23:44.324 --> 00:23:47.360
<i>(Boruto) Why're you doing what</i>
<i>he wants you to do, anyway?</i>

00:23:47.393 --> 00:23:51.064
<i>Didn't you say you're the only</i>
<i>one who can decide how to live</i>
<i>your life, Kagura?</i>

00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:53.299
<i>(Kagura) Yeah, and that's what</i>
<i>I've decided.</i>

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:58.371
<i>No matter how hard I tried</i>
to reject it or resist, I could
<i>never escape from the shadow!</i>

00:23:58.404 --> 00:24:01.074
<i>(Boruto) What happened to that</i>
guy who played Shinobi Bout with
<i>us?</i>

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:03.677
(Kagura) Don't talk to me as if
<i>you know me!</i>

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.982
<i>(Boruto) Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: Boruto
<i>and Kagura!</i>

00:24:09.015 --> 00:24:11.451
<i>(Kagura) You would never</i>
<i>understand!</i>
