WEBVTT

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.681
(footsteps approaching)

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:20.387
I haven't been feeling
that well lately.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.725
Has anything unusual
happened to you?

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.027
Now that you mentioned it,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.530
I've been having a lot
of dreams.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.364
Having dreams?

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.332
(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.467
So these dreams,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.036
tell me when did you
begin having them?

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.939
If I recall correctly,

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.241
they started the day
I met Mr. Ohnoki.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.244
What kind of dream did you have?

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.080
(Mitsuki groans)

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.253
(broody music)

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.958
It was a dream of
when I first saw

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.359
Boruto's picture.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:04.431
(Orochimaru groans in Shock)

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.802
Is it possible for
someone to become sick

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:10.337
from a dream?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.939
I'm not sure.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.341
Mitsuki clearly
experienced quite a lot

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.678
during the hidden stone
incidents some time ago.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.314
All of that may have
affected him emotionally.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:23.317
And the results of it may
only be coming to the surface

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.718
right now.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.520
How emotionally?

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.721
I'm not entirely sure.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.958
And that's the reason why I'm
going to analyze his brain

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.127
to see exactly what has
left an impact on him.

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:42.336
(Opening theme music)

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.002
(monitor beeping)

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.781
Let's begin the analysis,

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:36.450
first as Mitsuki mentioned

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:40.821
we'll go back to his memories
of when he met Mr. Ohnoki.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:44.258
(mouse clicks)

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.327
It seems that this man is
lost somewhere in the village.

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:50.264
They want us to help with
the efforts to look for him.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:52.699
Ohnoki of the land of Earth huh?

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:53.834
Hey, wait a second

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.936
isn't that guy 'The
Third Lord Tsuchikage?'

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:56.970
Whoa!

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:58.772
(Tsuchikage harrumphs)

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.807
This drawing,

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.944
doesn't look at
thing like me at all.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.712
Sir are you Ohnoki?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.949
Seems to me your bedrock,

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.552
your will, might
be a little shaky.

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:13.987
This thing called 'will'

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.756
is complicated.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.626
[Orochimaru] It seems Mitsuki
was unsure of his will

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.496
he had even been questioning
his own memories.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:26.767
And now, because
of these dreams,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.071
those questions regarding
his will have resurfaced.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.607
[Log] A dream where Mitsuki
decides to find the answer

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.975
on his own,

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.844
rather than choose
one of the options

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:38.378
that we presented to him.

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.982
Do you think Mitsuki
is in such bad shape,

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.151
Just because he had that dream?

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:48.155
[Orochimaru] No. This is
akin to a rebellious phase.

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.324
It's similar to puberty.

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:52.960
It looks like his
dreams may indicate

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.929
that he's getting
closer to being human.

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.431
In that sense,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:01.134
one can say that Mitsuki
is maturing like a human.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:05.105
Personally, I believe
that this is a great sign.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:09.943
Didn't I tell you he'd come.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.912
You just can't
suppress curiosity.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.113
Sekiei,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.148
don't let your guard down!

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:16.850
Haven't you considered
the possibility

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:19.253
that his friends might
be hiding nearby?

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.955
Look there, fabrications!

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:24.858
Yes, it's true Ohnoki
had already created

00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:26.660
these synthetic humans,

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.262
which means he must have known

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.265
that such beings would
eventually become interested

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:33.333
in their will and their soul.

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:36.270
And that's exactly why
he used the word 'will'

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.072
in order to lure Mitsuki in.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:40.574
So thats the reason,

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:42.943
why Mitsuki ran off
with the enemy then?

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:45.812
Because he wanted to
learn about his will?

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.147
I have to wander...

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.782
From what we've seen so far,

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.586
it would appear that he's
still trying to figure out

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.156
if they pose a threat
to 'The Leaf' or not.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.626
This is the first time I've
seen Ohnoki's fabrications.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.330
And it looks like they have
certain levels of emotions.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.433
They seem to be quite
intrigued by Mitsuki,

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.403
who's a synthetic
human like they are.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:12.606
I wouldn't be surprised if
Mitsuki felt the same way

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.208
towards them as well.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.078
Lets end this

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.314
(Boruto makes an attacking yell)

00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:26.186
(Boruto groans in disbelief)

00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:29.823
[Boruto] Mitsuki!

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:31.091
[Log] What's this?

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:33.694
Did Mitsuki go there
to help the enemy?

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.962
[Orochimaru] No,

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:36.964
most likely he did
this to gain the trust

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:39.466
-of the enemy.
-It's good to see you!

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.501
Mitsuki?

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:44.171
[Mitsuki] You okay?

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:45.072
Yeah...

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:46.540
well, I'll manage

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:48.775
Hey...

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.010
Mitsuki?

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.447
Sorry Boruto,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.515
I'm going with them.

00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:59.186
Yes,

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:02.489
you see this is my will,

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:04.858
But Mitsuki...

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:06.627
You're kidding, right?

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.961
Let's get going.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:09.930
Come on, we can all
start heading back

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.065
to the hidden leaf
village now, together.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.235
[Orochimaru] But
if that happened,

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.405
it would have put Boruto
and the others in danger.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.142
So there's only one
path that he could take!

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.815
(sharp metal bang sound)

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.851
(Boruto groans in shock)

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:32.853
Lightning style.

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.254
Snake... Lightning!

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:37.491
-(lightning blast)
-(Boruto groans in pain)

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:40.227
No way!

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:42.563
He did that to Boruto.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.465
Just as I thought...

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:47.668
At first glance it
might have appeared

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.403
like he betrayed Boruto,

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:52.773
but it was the best course
of action to keep him safe.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:56.476
It was quite successful in
helping to distract the enemy

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.580
from Boruto and the
rest of his team.

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:03.617
So then, he did this to find
out more about the enemy,

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.985
is that correct?

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:07.955
You think there weren't
adverse effects when

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.057
he hurt the friend
he called his 'sun?'

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:16.263
No. I'm quite sure his soul
was disquieted to no end.

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:19.333
Yeah, as in we were
made into people.

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:20.801
Let's depart.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.303
Time lost cannot be regained.

00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:24.938
Okay, okay.

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:27.774
Hey, do you think
Kirara got back safely?

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:29.676
(Sekiei groans wearily)

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.811
[Orochimaru] That fabrication

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.246
-was so defective,-
-What's wrong Sekiei

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.048
it had already reached
the end of its lifespan.

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.950
-Get hold of yourself! -
-[Log] Yes.

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:38.986
That's why they wanted
to analyze Mitsuki,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.988
a perfect synthetic human,

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.457
so they could improve
the fabrications.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.958
[Orochimaru] It
looks like Mitsuki

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:47.828
was very surprised about this.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.162
[Log] And it also seems

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:51.198
that he was particularly
interested in the one called

00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:52.232
Sekiei.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.301
Just keep quiet.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.807
Boruto you could say
that he was like the sun

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:01.842
in my sky.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.243
-[Log] "Was?"
-I didn't think that

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:05.245
[Orochimaru] Past tense, huh?

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.715
Even though he tried so
hard to stay with Boruto.

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:12.019
[Log] He must have said that
to fool the enemy again.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.988
[Orochimaru] No,
I'm not so sure.

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:16.823
Even if it was to
protect Boruto,

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:20.060
Mitsuki did attack him.

00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:23.130
And even if it was to find
out more about the enemy,

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:25.332
he did abandon the village.

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:30.270
This may have been the moment
when he came to realize

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:33.073
that he might never
see Boruto again.

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:35.943
And that's why,

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:37.477
almost always,

00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:40.013
Boruto is surrounded
by a lot of friends.

00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:44.284
Boruto was, you could say,

00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:45.385
that he was,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.821
like the sun

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:49.056
in my sky.

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:55.195
But maybe these feelings,

00:09:56.663 --> 00:10:00.667
are simply just fabricated.

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:03.303
[Log] Do you think Mitsuki
realizes that we are the ones

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:05.939
that encouraged him
to go see Boruto?

00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:07.641
[Orochimaru] That would be bad.

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:10.978
[Log] But Mitsuki never
asked us about that.

00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.413
I'm correct about
that, aren't I?

00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:16.817
[Orochimaru] Yes. And
that's the problem.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.652
There's still a vague uneasiness

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.954
that swirls inside of Mitsuki.

00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:23.156
And perhaps that feeling grew,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.660
thereby prompting him to
go with the fabrications.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:33.834
I believe it's possible
that Mitsuki may have felt

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.802
that he was truly alone.

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:37.037
[Log] Alone...

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:39.973
That's a feeling I don't
understand very well.

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:43.010
(broody music)

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:48.615
(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:51.818
It appears that Mitsuki's
mind has matured

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:55.255
considerably more
than I had expected.

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:58.125
Now that we know why
he's in bad shape,

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.694
is there any way we
can make him better?

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.797
There is...

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.966
Just one way...

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.000
(Log groans shockingly)

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:10.003
(broody music)

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:14.374
We will have to erase,

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:17.177
his memory.

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:23.317
(monitor beeps)

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:25.485
No way!

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:27.521
You mean like before,

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:29.990
completely wipe out
all his memories.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.560
His brain can't keep up
with its rapid growth.

00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:36.930
So his brain cells
may become necrotic,

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:40.334
in order to stop that
we have no other choice.

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:45.305
Such a shame after he's
grown as much as he has.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.508
Yes, that's why.

00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:51.879
I simply cannot afford to
lose him at this point.

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.013
(monitor beeps)

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.283
Let's keep watching.
We can decide after.

00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:00.454
(broody music)

00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:03.290
Boruto, don't interfere.

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:04.324
Mitsuki!

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.761
Hear Lord Ku.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.733
(Ku chuckles)

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:18.071
At last a complete life
is now within our grasp!

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:21.008
We'll become beings
who surpass humans.

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.342
And when that time comes,

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:25.012
we'll stand atop this village!

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:28.916
No, we'll stand atop
the entire world!

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:32.052
(Ku laughs loudly)

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.721
(lightning blast)

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.425
(Ku groans in discomfort)

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:43.564
What?!

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:45.332
Yes Ku, this is my will.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.038
(glass breaking)

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.006
[Orochimaru] Mitsuki
figured Ku was a threat

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.541
-to the hidden 'Leaf.'
-No it can't be

00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:57.811
[Orochimaru] So he lied and
said the heart was complete.

00:12:57.845 --> 00:13:02.583
But even then, who would have
thought he tried to kill him?

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:04.051
(Ku groans in discomfort)

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:06.386
You were just lying
to me all along!

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.255
I thought that you
were my friend!

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.891
I felt that we were
really compatible!

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:13.093
I truly believed that.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.595
But in your heart,

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:17.397
you were laughing at me
the entire time, right?

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:20.200
[Mitsuki] No, You're
wrong about that.

00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:21.735
I really want to help you.

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:24.705
All of you have a will.

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:27.341
You do, just as I do.

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:29.743
And that's why I
want to save you,

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:30.978
that is my will.

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:35.849
[Sekiei] Hey, but why
didn't you want to fight me?

00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:39.853
I mean, after all,
I am your enemy.

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:41.088
No, you're not.

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:46.627
Boruto and everyone else
treated me very well.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.895
And yet,

00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:48.729
sometimes,

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.767
I felt as though my words just
weren't able to reach them.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.537
If that's what loneliness is,

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.739
then I figured that
you were correct.

00:13:59.773 --> 00:14:01.575
You guys and I are like.

00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:04.845
Really? We are?

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:07.247
I fought because
it was for Boruto.

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:09.650
But not just for that.

00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:11.985
What I said before was

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:13.854
meant for you.

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:15.589
I just wanted you to stop

00:14:20.294 --> 00:14:21.295
Mitsuki...

00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:26.767
Hey...

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:30.437
Mitsuki...

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:34.842
We were friends too,

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:35.909
(inhales shakily)

00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:36.910
Weren't we?

00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:39.580
(broody music)

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.591
(mouse clicks)

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:54.394
He wasn't just lonely,

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:57.531
someone close to him
had died as well.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.434
And that left a wound
deep within his heart.

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:05.138
Something like that can
push you into darkness.

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:09.510
I've seen it happen
to many a shinobi.

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:12.713
Mitsuki must have been in
a state of great shock.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:13.747
(mouse clicks)

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.185
Before he left the
hidden leaf village,

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:21.755
he had ample opportunity
to ask others to help him.

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:22.890
But he didn't.

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:24.558
He came on his own to meet us.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.628
He was happy to find
others like himself.

00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:29.363
He couldn't ignore his curiosity

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:32.432
about getting a chance
to meet real comrades.

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:34.234
Isn't that right?

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:37.871
Go on, Mitsuki,
tell him he's wrong.

00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:39.606
(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.741
Mitsuki!

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:42.910
It seems that you
were also looking

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.645
at a different side of him.

00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:47.347
You didn't notice the
change he was going through.

00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:49.716
You have no right to
say you're his friend.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.785
-Shut up!
-(groans spitefully)

00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:52.753
Boruto!

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.021
(Ku chuckles)

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:56.757
It's beyond easy to
get you all riled up.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:00.627
-Boruto!
-(rocks cracking)

00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:01.862
(Ku groans in shock)

00:16:01.895 --> 00:16:05.032
(rocks blasting)

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:09.536
(Ku groans in discomfort)

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.004
Look just come out already!

00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:13.874
I know something like
that couldn't kill you.

00:16:13.907 --> 00:16:16.643
(rocks blasts)

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:23.050
Magnificent! With your
body and our hands

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.552
we can create any number
of perfect Fabrications

00:16:25.586 --> 00:16:28.856
without any of the defects
currently holding us back.

00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:31.258
You ought to stop
talking nonsense.

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:34.995
Since I am unusually
angry right now.

00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:38.899
(Ku falls thunderously)

00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:39.900
Striking...

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:40.734
Shadow snakes!

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:45.272
(striking thunderously)

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:46.173
(Ku laughs)

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:48.775
It's useless! I can't feel pain.

00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:50.611
(Mitsuki chuckles
in frustration)

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:52.012
Earth style: Earth Golem Jutsu!

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:54.715
(rocks pilling)

00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:04.591
(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:13.133
(water splashing)

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:17.204
All right, I'll lure Ku away.

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:20.574
The two of you need to take
Mr. Ohnoki and get out of here.

00:17:20.607 --> 00:17:21.775
What?! Come on!

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:23.544
There's no way
we're gonna do that.

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:27.848
I want to protect you.
Because that's also my will.

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.417
And besides, there
are still clones of me

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.019
in the research lab.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.620
So don't be concerned.

00:17:33.654 --> 00:17:35.055
We'll meet again just as before.

00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:36.190
You're wrong.

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:37.691
(Mitsuki groans in confusion)

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.627
It doesn't matter at all if
you look the same or not.

00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:42.462
Because what's really important,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.265
is the will inside here.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.234
(Mitsuki groans)

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:49.503
To me, the only real Mitsuki

00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:52.706
is the one who's standing
here in front of me right now.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:53.774
Boruto...!

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:57.511
(Ku's weathering blast effort)

00:17:57.544 --> 00:17:59.880
[Orochimaru] That's
Boruto for you.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.249
He's truly the sun
that shines bright

00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:04.885
on the moon shrouded
in darkness.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.019
[Log] In the end,

00:18:06.053 --> 00:18:08.188
it looks like burritos
words and actions

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:11.692
had the biggest impact
on Mitsuki's heart.

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:14.895
[Orochimaru] Getting too close
to the sun will burn you...

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:15.896
(Orochimaru chuckles)

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.164
Isn't that the truth?

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:23.237
You wanted to save
the 'Leaf' village

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.372
and to learn more
about yourself.

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:28.842
Both of those things
are a part of your will.

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:31.845
So both are my will?

00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:33.413
And there's something else too!

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:36.350
You know, I thought I knew
all about you Mitsuki.

00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:39.253
I was being just as
smug as you were!

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.454
I see!

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:42.189
Then it's okay,

00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:44.558
for us to be the
way that we were.

00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:46.093
No, not the way we were...

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:47.594
(Mitsuki groans in shock)

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:49.196
'Cause we're more connected now,

00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:51.098
with a stronger
will than before!

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:55.035
Thanks for that, Boruto

00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:58.372
(Boruto Chuckles)
Don't be so sappy!

00:18:58.405 --> 00:19:00.908
I look forward to
our future, Mitsuki.

00:19:00.941 --> 00:19:02.142
Yes!

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.311
(mouse clicks)

00:19:08.782 --> 00:19:10.050
(Log groans in consideration)

00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:12.452
But it's not like he was
really burned by the sun.

00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:13.921
Isn't that right?

00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:17.257
(monitor tabulating)

00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:20.694
(Orochimaru groans
in consideration)

00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:24.498
No way! Do we really have to
erase Mitsuki's memory, then?

00:19:26.967 --> 00:19:30.404
(footsteps retreating)

00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:32.606
(Door closing)

00:19:41.215 --> 00:19:45.319
(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:50.657
Are you awake now?

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:55.395
(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)

00:19:55.429 --> 00:19:56.930
You finish the...

00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:57.931
(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)

00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.766
analysis.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.767
[Orochimaru] Yes.

00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:02.603
(groans) Will I...

00:20:03.904 --> 00:20:04.705
get better.

00:20:09.243 --> 00:20:11.845
[Orochimaru] You got
too close to the sun,

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:14.114
and that's why your
heart was burned.

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:15.749
But...

00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:18.986
(liquid pouring)

00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:24.725
Simply drink all this and
your body will revert back.

00:20:25.926 --> 00:20:27.494
But in exchange...

00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:31.732
you lose all your memories.

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:34.735
(Mitsuki groans in shock)

00:20:34.768 --> 00:20:36.870
However, if you
don't drink this,

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:38.872
you'll keep getting
burned by the sun

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.908
and will continue to suffer.

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:42.709
Now the time has arrived

00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:45.012
for you to make your choice,

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:46.180
of your own free will.

00:20:46.213 --> 00:20:48.749
(singing in foreign language)

00:20:48.782 --> 00:20:53.153
(Mitsuki groans
in consideration)

00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:01.995
(cat meowing)

00:21:04.398 --> 00:21:09.570
-(Mitsuki groans in discomfort)
-(cat meowing)

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.172
[Boruto] Yo Mitsuki!

00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:14.208
(Mitsuki groans in shock)

00:21:14.241 --> 00:21:15.609
Come on, opened up already!

00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:19.079
Sarada won't stop talking
about wanting to see Mikazuki!

00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.554
Hang on! Coming, Boruto!

00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:30.090
(cat meowing)

00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:33.660
[Log] So his distress
was only temporary?

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:37.865
Yes, although there may
very well come a day

00:21:37.898 --> 00:21:42.002
when I will actually have to
erase his memory completely.

00:21:42.736 --> 00:21:43.971
But I think...

00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:47.774
Depending on his future growth,

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:49.977
he might be able to overcome it.

00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:52.179
(Orochimaru chuckles)

00:21:52.212 --> 00:21:56.216
Yes, there's still so
much to look forward to.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.687
So are you saying that as a
parent or as a researcher?

00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:03.657
Well, I guess that it doesn't
really matter either way.

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:07.995
(Orochimaru chuckles)

00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:13.467
(Ending heme music)

00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:43.891
(upbeat music)

00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:45.759
[Boruto] You heading
out on a mission Mirai?

00:23:45.792 --> 00:23:47.261
Just between the two of us,

00:23:47.294 --> 00:23:49.563
this mission is so
Important it's classified

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:50.764
as even beyond S-Rank!

00:23:50.797 --> 00:23:52.900
What kind of mission is it?

00:23:52.933 --> 00:23:55.169
Well, you see Boruto
it's an escort mission

00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:57.337
to guard Lord Sixth!

00:23:57.371 --> 00:24:00.207
Next time on 'Boruto
Naruto Next Generation'

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.777
"The Steam Ninja Scrolls:
The S-Rank Mission!"

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.179
In just a couple of days.

00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:08.382
The village will know the
great achievements made by me,

00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:09.616
Mirai Sarutobi!

00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:15.455
(Ending theme music)
