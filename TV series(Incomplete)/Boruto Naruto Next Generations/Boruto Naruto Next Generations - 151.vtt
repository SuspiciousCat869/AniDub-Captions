WEBVTT

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:09.376
(suspenseful music)

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.247
(groans)

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:18.886
Boruto Uzumaki.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.688
Your bodyguard mission
oughta be over by now.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.057
So what are you doing here?!

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.462
I should be asking you that.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.831
What exactly do you
want with my friend?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.400
You unworthy bastard,
you're no ninja!

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.435
(groans)

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:45.179
(opening theme music)

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.546
(energetic rock music)

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.648
(chuckles)

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:31.518
First the Feudal Lord's
son, and now the Hokage's?

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:35.022
Well, it seems that I've been
dealt a pretty nice hand here.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.328
You think you got
us beat already,

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.665
and that everything's
actually gonna go your way?

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:46.033
Pretty much!

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.034
Go get 'em!

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.001
(men grunt)

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:49.036
Tento, get back!

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.504
(Tento mutters nervously)

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.972
You're not gonna get away!

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.640
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:54.641
(cloud explodes)

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.642
[Both] Huh?

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:57.845
(clones grunt)

00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.246
All right, you little brat!

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.047
Ah!

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.782
(both grunt)

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:04.017
(gang member yells)

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.018
(Boruto grunts)

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:08.255
(gang member moans)

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.358
(gasps)

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.396
Always scurrying
around like that.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.800
However, just come
out now, you brats!

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.702
There's no way out
of here for you!

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:22.970
Boruto!

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.238
Stay calm.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.173
It's time for you
to accept the truth:

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.975
your luck's run out.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:31.178
Things won't end up like
they did at Hozuki Castle.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.281
How'd he know about
Hozuki Castle?!

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:37.184
What, you think it's weird
that I know about that?

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.786
Well, the explanation's
simple, really.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.488
I was there, too!

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:42.523
I was Tsukiyo!

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.591
You see, I used the
Corpse Clone Jutsu

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.461
to transform into him,
and then I took his place!

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:48.462
(gasps)

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:50.130
(chuckles)

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.466
A rather persistent group
that's very determined

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.302
to capture the Mujina
Gang had been pursuing me.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.972
So as a last resort, I became
Tsukiyo and hid in the prison.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:01.441
Seeing Kokuri there
was merely a fluke.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.844
It all turned out quite
nicely in the end.

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:07.781
At the perfect moment, I was
able to abandon Tsukiyo's body,

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.383
and then make my escape.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.154
(water bubbling)

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.324
I switched places with the guy

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.493
when we were both underwater.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:22.362
(suspenseful music)

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:23.564
(chuckles)

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:26.033
You had no clue
whatsoever that the Kokuri

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:28.502
who you brought back with
you from Hozuki Castle

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:29.770
was actually me!

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.439
(mutters nervously)

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.007
[Tento] Boruto.

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.245
I really do need to thank
you for all of your help.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.648
Not only did I escape, I
also got rid of that traitor!

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:44.384
(Boruto gasps)

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.858
Damn you, bastard!

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.626
(chuckles)

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.827
Boruto!

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.563
Be careful! If he catches you,
then he'll eat your brain!

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.933
(growls)

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.502
(grunts)

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.303
That was close.

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:05.639
Man, he's faster than
I thought he'd be!

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.042
(Boruto gasps)

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:10.244
(Shojoji grunts)

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:12.646
Yeah, and you're pretty
slow, ya little brat!

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.647
(growls)

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.250
(both grunt)

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:20.454
(Shojoji grunts)

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:21.989
Eat my brain?!

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:23.156
That's what you need to do

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.893
for the Corpse
Clone Jutsu to work.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.661
[Boruto] Are you even human?!

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.797
Humans are fundamentally
creatures that eat anything

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.399
and everything, aren't they?

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:35.169
The two of us were merely
raised differently, that's all.

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:36.570
[Boruto] What the hell?

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:39.306
I'd really like to roast
you whole with some salt,

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.042
but you won't be usable
if your brain dies,

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.510
so I'll just break your limbs

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:45.846
so you won't be able
to move anymore.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.981
Yeah? Just try it!

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:51.018
(dramatic music)

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.789
(gasps)

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:58.091
(growls)

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.727
(lightning zaps)

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:03.030
(Boruto grunts)

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:04.865
Wind Style: Zephyr Shield!

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:06.934
(lightning zaps)

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.236
(gasps)

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:11.572
Take this!

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:16.543
-Rasengan!
-(air whooshing)

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:18.879
(laughs evilly)

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.048
Wind Style: Zephyr Shield.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.051
It can repel any and
every attack it detects!

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.386
It's an invincible wind barrier.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.189
You see, I don't need to
learn a hundred jutsu.

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:32.259
All that I really need to
win is my enemy's own power,

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.194
since they'll just
defeat themselves.

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:37.264
And the foes that I
like, I then devour!

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:39.566
[Boruto Voiceover] Detect and
repel any and every attack?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.869
Which means, I have to
take him by surprise,

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.338
but what do I do?

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.507
(laughs evilly)

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.541
I have to admit,

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.877
devouring you and reliving
my youth as the son

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.180
of the Hokage wouldn't
be all that bad, heh.

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:57.317
Now, let's see, the Feudal
Lord's son or the Hokage's son?

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:59.920
Whose brain should I eat first?

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:02.155
(gasps)

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.393
(cloud explodes)

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.861
(air whooshes)

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:08.996
Wind Style:

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.331
-Gale Palm!
-(lightning zapping)

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:12.366
Rasengan!

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.636
(air rumbling)

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:18.338
Huh?

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:19.139
(lightning zaps)

00:07:19.173 --> 00:07:22.576
(Shojoji grunting)

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.611
(Boruto grunts)

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:27.347
(lightning zaps)

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.148
(gasps)

00:07:28.182 --> 00:07:30.317
Don't take me lightly!

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.885
(lightning zaps)

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.320
Like I told you,

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:36.490
I'm able to deflect any and
every attack that I detect.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.059
I've decided now.

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:41.695
You're the one I'm
gonna devour first!

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:46.233
(mutters nervously)

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.605
[Guard] We got
the money somehow.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.941
We have to hurry and
get to the drop site.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.843
Milord, I really
think that we ought

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:57.344
to contact the Hokage.

00:07:57.377 --> 00:08:00.848
No way. Tento's life
is on the line here!

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:02.816
And if they find out...

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.451
[Sai] What will happen then?

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:06.520
Pardon me.

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:09.223
I heard that you were gathering
a large amount of cash

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:13.160
and wondered what was going
on, so I came to check.

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:13.961
Oh.

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:15.262
By the way, please rest assured

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:18.065
that nothing we discuss
will leave the premises.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.068
So, please tell me.

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:27.441
(chuckles)

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:29.943
(gasps)

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:34.748
-(Boruto grunts)
-(bomb explodes)

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:39.319
A smoke bomb, huh? Simple
but not a bad move, heh.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.691
Boruto.

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:45.726
Don't worry.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.995
We still have options.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.864
Although, for them to work out,

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:53.233
I need you to give
me a hand, Tento.

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:56.436
What? Oh.

00:08:57.337 --> 00:08:58.672
That's mine!

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.407
[Boruto] I picked it up for ya.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.341
Oh.

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.577
But promise never to
do what you did before.

00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:06.079
Oh.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.615
Relax. I know you can do it.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.552
[Tento] Boruto.

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:12.586
Huh?

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:16.990
So what's the matter, you brat?!

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:19.126
Are you all done? Did
you lose your nerve?!

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.327
(footsteps tapping)

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.328
Huh?

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.696
(Shojoji grunts)

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:23.730
One.

00:09:25.332 --> 00:09:26.099
Wind Style.

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.301
(air whooshes)

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.702
Zephyr Shield!

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.404
Two.

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:31.805
(air whooshes)

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:34.408
(Boruto gasps)

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.677
(Boruto grunts)

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.711
Three.

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.315
(Boruto grunts)

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.552
(groans)

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.588
And you're the real one.

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:49.556
(lightning zaps)

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.725
Wind Style: Zephyr Shield!

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.728
(metal clanging)

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:55.762
Four.

00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:58.232
(moans)

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.968
I know you can only
produce four Shadow Clones,

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.470
which means that as long
as I have the real you,

00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:05.806
then you can't
produce any others.

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.175
(gasps)

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:12.713
(Shojoji growls)

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.715
(yells)

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.450
(mutters nervously)
Boruto!

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.489
[Boruto Voiceover] Relax.
I know you can do it.

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:28.462
(gasping)

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:30.864
(air whooshes)

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:33.634
(Shojoji growls)

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:40.474
I can't infuse chakra!

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:43.410
[Shojoji] Seems you've
run out of cards to play.

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.812
How unfortunate.

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:47.981
The cards you have don't matter,

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:51.418
but how you fight
and win in the end.

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.819
(gasps)

00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:56.089
That's what the real
thrill of it all is.

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:58.559
You talk too much.

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.227
Enough!

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.463
Now I'm gonna finish this
by eating your brain!

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.866
(Boruto choking)

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:07.301
Oh! Oops!

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.304
I gotta be more careful that
I don't accidentally kill you.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:13.173
(Shojoji laughs)

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.809
(Shojoji groans)

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:17.110
(Boruto gasps)

00:11:17.144 --> 00:11:19.079
What just happened?!

00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:24.685
Ridiculous! I know that I
got rid of all the clones.

00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:26.119
So how?

00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:27.354
[Tento] Hey! You!

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:31.458
(Shojoji growls)

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:35.462
(dramatic music)

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:39.099
Why you!

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:43.637
Just like I said, don't
you dare underestimate me!

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.407
Listen, don't get too full
of yourself, you stupid brat!

00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:50.344
(air whooshes)

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:55.215
Tento, you really are more
a ninja than this bastard!

00:11:56.617 --> 00:11:57.684
Huh?

00:11:57.718 --> 00:11:58.685
-Rasengan!
-(lightning zaps)

00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:01.822
(Shojoji yells)

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:04.491
(Boruto yells)

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.096
(rocks crumble)

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.981
(gasps)

00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.350
I guess you couldn't
detect that, huh?

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:32.953
Now that's what
we call teamwork!

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:35.455
[Tento] All right!

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:36.723
You did it, Tento!

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:38.625
(chuckles)

00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:41.562
I never thought you'd
charge in like that.

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:42.529
I was really nervous,

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:44.698
but I'm just glad that
it actually worked out.

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:45.966
(rocks rustling)
-Huh?

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.668
(Boruto gasps)

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:50.037
(growling)

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:52.840
Oh no!

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:54.408
Are you kidding me?

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.710
(panting)

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:58.345
You know, for a genin,

00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:01.715
you really have some
unbelievable jutsu.

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.016
(chuckles)

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.819
I'll eat you and make your
powers mine at any cost!

00:13:05.853 --> 00:13:07.955
Stay back, Tento!

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:09.556
With that amount of damage,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.958
(air whooshes)

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:13.961
I bet you can't use that
Wind Barrier anymore!

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:15.195
Brat!

00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:18.332
(Boruto groaning)

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:19.600
Huh?

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:20.634
Oh.

00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:24.438
(groaning)

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:29.443
What's going on?

00:13:32.613 --> 00:13:35.082
[Tento] Are you okay?

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:37.851
I don't have any strength.

00:13:37.885 --> 00:13:39.586
[Tento] Boruto, hang in there!

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:42.489
That mark on your hand!

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:48.495
Don't tell me you're part
of that organization?

00:13:49.897 --> 00:13:51.632
Organization?

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:53.700
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

00:13:53.734 --> 00:13:56.069
but you know what this mark is?!

00:13:57.604 --> 00:13:58.672
(chuckles)

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.073
Given your reaction,

00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:02.342
it appears that you aren't
involved with them, after all.

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:04.945
You really scared me
for a minute there!

00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:07.347
There's nothing
holding me back now.

00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:09.683
Now be good and
don't move, would ya?

00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:12.119
Tento, go! Hurry!

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:14.221
No way! Stand up, Boruto!

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.823
[Both] Huh?

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:19.826
Look, just give up
and prepare to die!

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.095
(grunts)

00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:27.935
You're the one who ought
to just give up now,

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:29.937
Mr. Mujina Boss.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.672
[Shojoji] Who are you guys?!

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:32.706
Oh, yeah!

00:14:33.574 --> 00:14:38.579
-Cha!
-(Shojoji grunts)

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:41.515
(dramatic music)

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:45.419
Seriously! Talk about
the nick of time!

00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:46.753
Sarada! Mitsuki!

00:14:46.787 --> 00:14:50.824
How'd you know where? And what
about that B-rank mission?

00:14:50.858 --> 00:14:51.992
Mitsuki and I met up

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:53.393
and started heading for
the rendezvous point

00:14:53.427 --> 00:14:57.364
to join Konohamaru Sensei,
but we couldn't stop worrying.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.433
[Tento Voiceover]
Boruto's ninja teammates!

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:00.601
They're so cool!

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.736
(screams)

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:06.206
So we followed your scent
here. That's how we found you.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.610
I've had this guy memorize
most of my friends' scents!

00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:12.679
So you dumped that big mission

00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:14.481
just to come and help me out?

00:15:15.983 --> 00:15:18.986
Get me a caramel macchiato,
and we're all good.

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:22.456
I'll have, well, let
me just think about it.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.259
You guys.

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.961
Yeah, all right, sure!
That's easy enough!

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:30.264
Well, if that's all,
then just leave it to me!

00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:32.833
I can even rent out
the entire cafe and--

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:35.035
Hey, Tento! Just chill out!

00:15:37.237 --> 00:15:40.941
The mark went back to
its original shape?

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:43.810
And I'm not in pain
or paralyzed anymore!

00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:47.114
So what was that anyway?

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:50.217
Wait a second, did you always
have that mark on your hand?

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.554
It appeared after you fought
against Momoshiki, right?

00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:55.289
[Boruto] You noticed it?

00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:56.123
Of course.

00:15:56.156 --> 00:15:58.091
What are you guys talking about?

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:01.228
What do you mean, after
Boruto fought Momoshiki?

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.832
I really don't know anything
about it for sure yet.

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:07.134
But still!

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:09.336
Why would you keep something
so sketchy a secret?

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:13.307
Sorry, I promised Mr. Sasuke.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.308
My dad?

00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:16.343
[Boruto] Yeah. So,
please don't tell anyone!

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:19.079
Don't worry, I'll tell ya
what I know when I find out!

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:20.280
(door clatters)

00:16:20.314 --> 00:16:21.315
[All] Huh?

00:16:22.983 --> 00:16:24.184
Tento!

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:25.719
Papa!

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.988
Oh.

00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:29.256
Are you okay, Tento?

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:30.724
-You're not hurt?
-(Tento moans)

00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:33.260
[Tento] No, I'm fine, Papa!

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:36.964
Oh! I was just so
worried, Tento!

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.699
[Tento] Papa, you're
embarrassing me!

00:16:38.732 --> 00:16:40.000
(Tento giggles)

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.502
Quite an accomplishment.

00:16:41.535 --> 00:16:44.538
I mean, you captured the
leader of the Mujina Gang.

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.539
Mr. Sai!

00:16:45.572 --> 00:16:47.374
[Sai] We've uncovered
their spy in the Leaf,

00:16:47.407 --> 00:16:50.444
so capturing the rest of the
underlings will be swift.

00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:52.679
[Tento] You know what, Papa?

00:16:52.713 --> 00:16:53.847
Huh?

00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:55.215
I helped to defeat him

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:58.085
with the Shuriken
Jutsu Boruto taught me.

00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:02.356
I'm gonna keep working
hard every single day

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:05.459
and become an adult who's
worthy of supporting you!

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:06.593
Oh, Tento!

00:17:06.627 --> 00:17:09.363
(gentle music)

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:13.834
First, allow me to
commend the three of you

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.537
for rescuing Young Lord
Tento successfully.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.571
Good work!

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:20.774
However, I can't overlook

00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:24.278
that you abandoned a mission
you'd already accepted.

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:25.479
(all groan)

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:27.948
There's likely room
to plead for leniency

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.350
due to extenuating
circumstances,

00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:33.353
but you should still expect
some level of punishment.

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:35.822
It's my fault; I
did it on my own.

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.358
So I'm the only one
who should be punished.

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:42.496
I'm sorry. A team shares
responsibility for each member.

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:45.365
So if you care about your
team, don't forget that!

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:50.237
And about Kokuri,

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.841
it seems that he did disappear
after leaving Hozuki Castle.

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:54.842
(all gasp)

00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:56.443
So, it really was true!

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:57.477
Kokuri.

00:17:58.712 --> 00:18:00.814
In the kind of work we do,

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:03.350
the sting of
bitterness can linger.

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:06.453
The only way to reduce
it is to get stronger.

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:13.493
(steam hisses)

00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:16.230
Well, I thank you
for everything.

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:20.467
I'm so grateful. Please convey
that to Lord Hokage, as well.

00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:21.535
We're sorry!

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.670
By all rights, the
Hokage should be here

00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:25.672
to see you off, too, but--

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:27.941
Oh, that doesn't matter!

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:29.109
Seems that though he's busy,

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:30.978
he gets along well
with his children.

00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:32.679
I have a lot to learn from him.

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:34.114
(chuckles)

00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:36.717
Hold on, that's not the case,
not with my stupid old man!

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.951
Boruto!

00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:39.853
C'mon, you really have
to watch your mouth!

00:18:39.887 --> 00:18:42.422
(all laugh)

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.557
[Boruto] Tento.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.725
Huh?

00:18:44.758 --> 00:18:47.494
[Boruto] This card you gave
me, you can have it back.

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:49.830
Boruto!

00:18:49.863 --> 00:18:52.733
Do you remember
what I said earlier?

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:54.735
Mm-hmm.

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.207
That you have to get
what you really want

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.341
through your own strengths,

00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:03.443
no matter how hard
doing it may be.

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:04.678
That right?

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:06.713
Yeah, you nailed it, buddy.

00:19:06.747 --> 00:19:08.615
Boruto, thank you.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.955
(chuckles)

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.823
See you later, Tento.

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:20.194
(train whistle blows)

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.834
I just, I may not
be much right now,

00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:29.703
but one day I wanna
be an amazing ninja

00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:31.305
who supports the Hokage.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.176
Boruto, you will, I know it.

00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:41.181
You will become an amazing
ninja who supports the Hokage.

00:19:44.384 --> 00:19:47.354
Now, then, it's
probably pointless,

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:50.490
but let me start by saying
this will go much better

00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:53.627
for you if you speak
honestly, you trash.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.464
You're the Ibiki Morino
and you're Sai Yamanaka.

00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:58.432
Isn't that right?

00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:00.634
I bet that all of the
intel that I've got

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:03.704
is seriously invaluable to
you Leaf guys, isn't it?

00:20:03.737 --> 00:20:04.705
(chuckles)

00:20:04.738 --> 00:20:06.073
So, I won't be talking

00:20:06.106 --> 00:20:08.542
unless I get something
just as valuable in return.

00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:11.378
Don't try me, trash.

00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:15.215
Well, then, you'll soon
regret being this arrogant.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.825
(grunts)

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:26.693
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:28.629
No, don't worry.

00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:31.465
I've wanted to talk to
this guy for a while.

00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:34.801
(suspenseful music)

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:37.070
Those who've survived
in the underbelly

00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:40.407
of society long
enough know who I am.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.610
Sasuke Uchiha!

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:46.113
And they also know the
lengths that I'll go to

00:20:46.146 --> 00:20:48.849
when it comes to trash like you.

00:20:48.882 --> 00:20:51.952
(groans)

00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:55.355
What do you know about
the mark on Boruto's palm?

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:57.824
I don't know anything specific.

00:20:57.858 --> 00:20:59.359
I swear to you that I don't!

00:20:59.393 --> 00:21:02.996
It's just that I overheard
this conversation.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.831
They were these
really sketchy guys

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:06.400
who were wearing black robes.

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:10.103
Just where was this?
And how many were there?

00:21:10.137 --> 00:21:11.338
I don't remember!

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.473
I came across them by
chance in the basement

00:21:13.507 --> 00:21:16.343
of a building I entered
to rob a long time ago.

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:18.345
I don't know how
many there were!

00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:22.716
That's right, they
called themselves

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:26.186
Kara, the Husk!

00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:29.957
Kara?

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.359
Well, that's a new one to me.

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:35.262
All of my instincts were
screaming out, danger.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:38.265
So I just got the hell
outta there, fast!

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.234
Listen, this may
not be relevant,

00:21:40.267 --> 00:21:42.102
but I happen to know quite a lot

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.204
about Orochimaru's Curse Marks.

00:21:44.238 --> 00:21:46.373
And I could tell the
thing that appeared

00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:49.209
on the Hokage's brat was
different than one of them.

00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:51.078
I mean, it's not
as if I really give

00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:53.046
a damn either way, of course.

00:21:53.881 --> 00:21:55.082
Hmm.

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:04.091
(grunts)

00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:15.169
(closing theme music)

00:23:42.556 --> 00:23:45.092
A training course
in Medical Ninjutsu?

00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:46.994
We learned a little
of it in the Academy,

00:23:47.027 --> 00:23:49.363
but this is the first
time for formal training!

00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:51.598
[Sarada] Each team has to
send one representative

00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:52.966
to take it, right?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.268
Who should it be?

00:23:54.301 --> 00:23:56.236
I think you're the perfect
one to take it, Sarada!

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.339
Yes, I agree! I mean, you
are Sakura's daughter!

00:23:59.373 --> 00:24:00.474
[Boruto Voiceover] Next time on

00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:02.709
"Boruto: Naruto
Next Generations:"

00:24:02.743 --> 00:24:04.945
Developing One's
Medical Ninjutsu.

00:24:04.978 --> 00:24:06.346
What am I gonna do?!

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.083
I have zero confidence
in my Medical Ninjutsu!

00:24:11.752 --> 00:24:16.757
(closing theme music)
