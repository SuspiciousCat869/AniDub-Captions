WEBVTT

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.909
(opening theme music)

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:13.413
(singing in Japanese)

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:51.211
(waves crashing)

00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:00.087
(ship groaning)

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.225
(mysterious music)

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.134
(footsteps softly shuffling)

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:24.711
Attention! Fire Style:
Celestial Prison!

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.383
(prisoners groaning)

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.951
(Jailer roaring)

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.085
(prisoner groaning)

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:36.056
(electricity zapping)

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.992
All right, unchain them.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:42.162
(mysterious music)

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:49.436
You've committed serious crimes

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.305
that disgrace the
name of Shinobi,

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:54.308
so you've been sent
here to Hozuki Castle.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:57.044
The Celestial Prison's
been placed on you all.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.445
It binds your chakra,

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.682
so while it's on you,
you cannot use ninjutsu.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.350
Try to escape the castle grounds

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.385
and it'll start a
chain reaction of fire,

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.722
and it will burn you
from the inside out.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:12.960
Any criminal, no matter how
evil, can be rehabilitated,

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.261
so I look forward to the day

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:16.096
when you've been
completely reformed

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.332
and can be released
from this prison.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:22.035
And now, Chief Officer Benga
will explain the rest to you.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.006
Thank you very much, Lord Mujo.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.644
Whatever worked for
you on the outside

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:32.212
doesn't mean crap in here.

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.481
Pound two things
into your heads.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:37.184
One, I make the
rules around here.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:41.054
Even idiots like you ought to
be able to remember that much.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.357
What's the other thing?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.126
Don't interrupt me while I'm
speaking, you understand?

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.062
The second rule is
don't forget the first

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:50.397
even if it kills you.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.566
Now, keep your
arrogant mouth shut!

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.567
Just because you're kids,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.402
don't think that we're
gonna go easy on you!

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.570
Ow, ow, ow!

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.405
Don't move!

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.907
(punch thumping)

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.708
-(prisoner panting)
-Hey! You!

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.814
Fool! You can't
escape this place!

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:09.550
[Prisoner] I'm not
falling for your bluff!

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.953
Ha ha, you see? (grunts)

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.521
(Benga chuckles)

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.591
(prisoner screaming)

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:21.962
We warned you that
you wouldn't be able

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.064
to leave the castle, didn't we?

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.201
Horrible. Hey, do something!

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.903
-(punch thumping)
-(Boruto groaning)

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.505
[Benga] Keep your mouth shut.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.040
You, call the doctor.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.274
[Jailer] Yes sir!

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:38.478
[Naruto] Have you ever
heard of the Mujina Gang?

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:40.781
[Boruto] Mujina?

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:42.182
[Sarada] You don't know them?

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:44.585
They've been creating chaos
all over the Land of Fire!

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:47.154
[Mitsuki] Do you know what
their boss looks like?

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:48.956
[Kotaro] No, we don't.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:51.792
We don't know his face,
name, age, background,

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:53.360
or the jutsu he uses.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.229
It's all shrouded in mystery.

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:57.731
[Sai] The members of the
gang all take an oath,

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:00.968
and if they ever get captured,
none of them ever talk.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.936
Also, if any of
them try to desert,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.172
then they're killed
without hesitation.

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:07.975
No wonder there's no information
out there about the boss.

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:10.444
Although we did
find one exception.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.482
A man named Kokuri sent this.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.719
A year ago, he secretly stole
some money from the gang,

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:21.088
and then he snuck off and hid,

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.457
but he pulled another
robbery and got caught,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.527
so he was thrown
into Hozuki Castle.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.329
[Sai] Hozuki Castle's a prison
that's only for shinobi,

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:31.598
run by the Village
Hidden in the Grass.

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.701
(camera clicking)

00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:35.903
[Kotaro] Based on his letter,

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:37.237
Kokuri's managed
to conceal the fact

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.673
that he's a former member
of the Mujina Gang,

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.609
but a prisoner who
arrived after him

00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:46.046
just happens to be the gang's
second highest ranking member.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.382
He's in a situation
where he could be killed

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:49.349
at any moment.

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:51.485
So he wrote to say if
we can protect him,

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.354
he'll tell us everything
that he knows about the gang.

00:05:54.388 --> 00:05:57.324
If that's true, he could
provide crucial intel.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.259
If what he knows is that vital,

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:02.462
I think the prison would
want to protect Kokuri too.

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:04.731
It's really only larger
nations such as ours

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:08.335
that have suffered because of
the Mujina Gang's misdeeds.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.370
For a small nation
like the Hidden Grass,

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:12.339
this kind of stuff
isn't worth their time.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.241
We sent a request
to the Hidden Grass

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.510
for a temporary protective
order for Kokuri,

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.646
but they hemmed and hawed,
saying it's an internal affair.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.683
They told us it'll take a
month to make arrangements.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.251
If we just wait and do nothing,

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.186
he could be killed at any time,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.955
and so Boruto, Mitsuki,

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:29.923
we've decided that
what we're going to do

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.960
is to send you in
undercover as prisoners,

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.494
so that you can keep Kokuri safe

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.097
until all of the
arrangements are finalized.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.201
[Sai] Luckily, the
Lord of Hozuki Castle

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:42.636
is an old acquaintance,

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:43.904
and we've already taken steps

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.907
to have you sent
there as prisoners.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.343
Ordinarily, this is a
chunin-class mission,

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:52.346
but the team who was
chosen first can't go.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.448
[Mitsuki] So we're stand-ins.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:56.817
Luckily, the warden's
jutsu prevents inmates

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.118
from using chakra,

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.753
and since that's the
case, we've decided

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:02.956
that this is something you
genin will be able to handle.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.659
[Mitsuki] So we can't
use jutsu either?

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:07.327
Don't be too worried about that.

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:09.830
We asked Mujo to
only pretend to use

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.498
his Celestial Prison on you.

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:16.036
(prisoners chuckling)

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:23.343
(door clanking)

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.479
I thought there was
supposed to be three.

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:28.081
[Haie] The other one was
sent to the hospital.

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.017
Now be nice to each other.

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:41.228
Am I the only one being
left out of this mission?

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:44.831
You have a very important
job to do as well, you know?

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:45.966
[Sarada] I'm Sarada.

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.535
I asked to do some
research for my article?

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.037
[Benga] So you're a student,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.673
aspiring to become
a journalist, hm?

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:53.841
Yes.

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:56.076
(scoffs) Academics don't
mean anything in here.

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.579
That's just the kind
of world we live in.

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:03.550
Hey, newbies always start off
sleeping in the bottom bunk.

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:04.818
Huh?

00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:07.554
Just deal with it.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.489
Hello.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.827
Don't bother, Kedama here

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.730
doesn't ever talk to
anybody. (chuckles)

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:20.067
So the both of you guys are
from the Land of Water, huh?

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.902
That's right. I'm Boruto.

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:22.936
I'm Mitsuki.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.539
[Arai] Name's Arai. He's Kamada.

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.407
So give us the rundown.

00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:28.909
What are you in for?

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.344
Eight years for robbery.

00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:33.413
That's pretty bold for your age.

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:37.684
What the? The toothbrush
I left there is gone!

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:40.220
(ominous music)

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:42.122
Hey, you stole it! Give it back!

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:45.192
Leave somethin' lying around,
and it's not yours anymore.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.994
That's the rule in here.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.829
I'll sell it back
to you, though.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.098
Come on. Who made up that rule?

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.233
Better be more
careful next time.

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:58.505
Hey, where'd my
magazine go? Hey, you!

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.607
That's the rule, right?

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:03.544
I would be willing to trade
it for the toothbrush, though.

00:09:03.577 --> 00:09:05.078
(Kamata growls)

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:08.382
(laughs) He got you
there, Kamada! (chuckles)

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:12.486
Okay, newbies. Let's
go, time to eat.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.355
[Benga] That's the castle keep
where Lord Mujo and I stay,

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.925
and there's the watchtower
and the inner garden.

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.527
As you'll notice, we're
surrounded by the sea.

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:22.329
So escape's impossible.

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:26.967
Does a splash of fresh
water really undo

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.669
the Celestial Prison jutsu?

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:30.671
It's a fire style, so somewhat,

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:32.339
but it takes more than a splash,

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:34.341
and it's pointless to
search this facility

00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:36.310
to find large amounts
of fresh water.

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.313
We don't even have any
baths or flush toilets.

00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:41.081
What's that?

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:42.382
[Benga] The medical ward.

00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:45.786
Guys faking sickness
take refuge there.

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:47.921
(ominous music)

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:51.325
(men softly grumbling)

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.063
[Prisoner] Come on, you
gotta be kidding me!

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.297
[Prisoner] The worst.

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:02.069
(electronics beeping)

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.404
Pay attention or
get left behind.

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:08.208
Without this wooden tag,
you can't go anywhere.

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:12.312
You're very lucky that you
didn't get lost, young lady.

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.314
[Sarada] The lord of the
castle traditionally comes

00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:16.216
from the same family, right?

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.919
Yeah, the Celestial
Prison users.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.587
It's all very old-fashioned.

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.524
And you don't like that system?

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:24.491
It's not that.

00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:27.528
It's just that Lord Mujo
tends to be too soft

00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:28.729
on the prisoners.

00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:31.098
It's futile to hope they'll
actually be reformed.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.333
Be strict and
teach 'em a lesson,

00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:36.270
that's the tried and true
method to handle them.

00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:41.441
Oh, Miss Sarada. How's
your research coming along?

00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:43.310
[Sarada] Great,
thanks to you all.

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:44.678
[Prisoner] What's the big idea?

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.947
-Dammit! Wanna fight?
-You bet!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.717
You two! Get away from
each other! (growling)

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:55.055
Tell me, how are Boruto and
Mitsuki managing in here?

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:57.357
[Sarada] They seem
to be okay, for now.

00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:59.459
Honestly, I wish I
could help you more,

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:00.494
but I have my position

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.297
as the lord of the castle
to think of, sorry.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.171
That guy's a supplier.

00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:14.808
As long as you pay, he can get
you almost anything you want.

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:16.310
Even though this is a jail?

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:19.680
Yeah, in here, money's the
only thing that really matters.

00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:20.714
Now let's go.

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:24.484
By the way, I heard that
the second in command

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:26.920
of the Mujina Gang
has been captured.

00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:30.357
[Arai] Yeah. I heard
that too. (munches)

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:33.327
We're thieves just like he is.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.263
I would really like to
meet him, if you know him.

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:39.933
I guess he caused some trouble,
so he's in solitary now.

00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:41.068
Solitary?

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.436
All right, look.

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:45.072
The guy that you're talking
about is named Tsukiyo.

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:47.107
As soon as he came here,
he got into a fight

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.809
with some guy named Kokuri.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.244
(ominous music)

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:53.180
He beat him up pretty bad,
so that's why he got sent

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.482
to solitary confinement
as punishment.

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:57.684
[Boruto] What
happened to Kokuri?

00:11:57.718 --> 00:11:59.086
Oh, he's totally fine.

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:01.088
He's over in the
medical ward right now,

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.923
taking it nice and easy.

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.958
Good move gettin' sent there.

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:07.661
Is the medical ward really
that nice of a place?

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:10.130
[Arai] Well, they've got
air conditioning, at least.

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:12.799
Oh man, then I want to go there.

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:14.768
Forget it. It's impossible.

00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:16.236
The doctor there is sharp.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.072
You can't fool him just
by faking an illness.

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:21.208
The medical ward is also
in a different building,

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.577
and the doctor and Benga
hate each other so much

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.313
that even the guards
aren't welcome over there.

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:29.683
It's kinda like the only
oasis in this entire prison.

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.051
Awesome, after hearing that,

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.086
I want to go there even more!

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.122
[Arai] Well, actually,
there might be a way,

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.224
but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:39.626
Hm?

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:45.499
[Arai] They told you when
you came here, right?

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:48.335
Why they call this
place Hozuki Castle?

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.204
[Mitsuki] Yes, there are hozuki,

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.472
lantern plants, everywhere.

00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:55.342
[Boruto] Oh, that's
what those plants are!

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:57.277
Lantern and fruit are poisonous.

00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:59.179
Red ones aren't that dangerous,

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:02.082
but you have to watch out for
the white fruits that grow

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.350
every once in a while.

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:05.419
One time, a prisoner got curious

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.955
and ate one of them
when it blew in here.

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:09.356
Luckily for him, he didn't die,

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:12.359
but his whole body was
paralyzed and went numb.

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:14.895
I get it, so if
I eat one of them

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:17.497
then I could fool
that clever doctor.

00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:20.033
[Arai] But for us, that
patch of lantern plants

00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:23.003
is nearly impossible to reach.

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:24.805
Well, guess we'll
just have to wait

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.707
till the wind blows one over.

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:31.645
Shall we?

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.881
I don't really like it,
but it's for the mission.

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:35.616
What choice do we have?

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.385
(intense music)

00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:45.225
How do we get there without
touching the ground, though?

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:47.160
Boruto.

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:49.496
[Boruto] I guess we have no
choice but to use that wire,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.733
but can something that thin
actually support my weight?

00:13:57.704 --> 00:13:58.705
I'm on it.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:03.443
(snake slithering)

00:14:06.713 --> 00:14:07.714
Woah.

00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:19.026
(dramatic music)

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:21.428
[Jailer] All right,
rec time's over now!

00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:23.964
Time for you to
return to your cells!

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:27.301
(prisoners grumbling)

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:33.207
You get it?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.445
-(snake slithering)
-(intense music)

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.384
(Boruto gasps)

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:49.089
It has it.

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:51.024
[Jailer] Hey, you
two over there!

00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:54.027
Didn't you hear me say
that rec time's over?

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:55.495
I'll be there in a second.

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:58.131
My clothes just got
snagged on the fence!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.802
Is it back yet?

00:15:01.835 --> 00:15:03.303
All right, you two!

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:08.175
(snake slithering)

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:13.580
Yeah, I got loose!

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:22.723
That was a close one.

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:27.494
Whoa, awesome, Boruto.

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:29.296
How did you get
your hands on that?

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:32.633
I was just lucky. All right.

00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:36.203
Hold on. You're not really
gonna eat it, are you?

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:37.538
I'm not gonna pass up

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:40.340
some of that easy air
conditioned living. (munches)

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:43.644
(gasps) Idiot! Don't
blame me for this one!

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:47.147
-(mysterious music)
-(Boruto groaning)

00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:49.750
(Boruto collapsing)

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.752
(intense music)

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.087
Guard, come quick! Hey, guard!

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:57.558
(Boruto groaning)

00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.426
Hey, hold tight.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.095
(footsteps running)

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:05.365
Seriously? I was on
my break, you know.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:08.402
(door clanking)

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:11.171
I was talking to him
and he just keeled over!

00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.677
(intense music)

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.446
(door clanking)

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:26.620
(Boruto groaning)

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.088
So about this Kokuri,

00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:30.157
he hung out with
bad guys, right?

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.892
Can we trust him, then?

00:16:31.925 --> 00:16:34.094
Often, prisoners have
been known to lie

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:36.230
out of sheer desperation.

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:38.632
[Naruto] Part of the mission
will also be to verify

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.435
whether or not Kokuri's
actually trustworthy.

00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:45.672
(Boruto groaning)

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:48.976
(electronics beeping)

00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:52.679
So what's your name?

00:16:52.713 --> 00:16:55.015
Do you know where you are now?

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:57.718
(gentle music)

00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:12.299
Where am I?

00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:14.368
[Kokuri] Would you
like some water?

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:20.073
(gulping)

00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:23.810
Oh man, my mouth feels
all prickly now!

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:26.747
[Kokuri] You were out for a
whole day, but don't worry,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.215
you're safe here.

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:31.885
This is the only oasis
in this entire prison.

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:34.755
It's the, oh, right.

00:17:34.788 --> 00:17:36.723
To get to the medical ward, I...

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:40.961
Hey, I'm here
looking for someone.

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:42.162
His name's Kokuri.

00:17:42.196 --> 00:17:47.301
-(dramatic music)
-(tray clanking)

00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:56.476
(groans) Oh man,
that hurts. Huh?

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.811
(straps stretching)

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.714
(Boruto groaning)

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:04.351
Hey, don't do that! Please stop!

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:06.486
Did you come here to kill me?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.155
-Huh?
-Did you?!

00:18:08.188 --> 00:18:09.556
No, you're wrong!

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.791
We got your letter.

00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:13.594
I've come here from the Hidden
Leaf Village to protect you!

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:16.763
Are you serious?

00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:18.098
You're Kokuri, right?

00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:20.033
You're from the Mujina Gang.

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:21.301
[Kokuri] The envelope color?

00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:23.504
Like I'd remember
something like that!

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:29.376
Blue! The envelope was blue!

00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:34.481
(tray clanking)

00:18:34.515 --> 00:18:37.451
I thought you were
here to kill me.

00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:44.825
As soon as I first
set eyes on Tsukiyo,

00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:46.760
I really thought
that I was gonna die.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.963
That's why I pretended to be
fighting in front of the guard,

00:18:49.997 --> 00:18:51.698
and then I hit my head.

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:55.469
I gotta say, you don't really
seem like the bad guy type.

00:18:55.502 --> 00:18:56.737
Yeah, I get that a lot.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.072
You don't seem like the
kind of guy with the guts

00:18:59.106 --> 00:19:02.676
to steal and run off with
all the Mujina Gang's money.

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:03.944
(Kokuri chuckling softly)

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.280
So you managed to
desert the gang,

00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:09.550
but then why'd you do
something to get arrested?

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.885
[Kokuri] I'll explain
it all when you take me

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.253
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:15.956
How much time do you still
have left on your sentence?

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.092
Let's see, about
10 years, I think.

00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:21.361
[Boruto] I think? Not
very detail oriented.

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:24.097
Well, technically I should
already be out of here,

00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:25.766
but Benga was
mistreating a prisoner,

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.100
so I punched him and got

00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:29.469
a ridiculous amount
of time added on.

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:33.073
Oh, is that why you ended
up running into Tsukiyo?

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:34.741
That's unlucky.

00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:35.809
[Kokuri] Right.

00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:36.977
Well, we're here now,

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.946
so we'll at least be
able to guarantee you

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:40.614
that you stay safe.

00:19:40.647 --> 00:19:43.884
That would be great, but
still, don't take any chances.

00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:45.185
You understand me?

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.821
Tsukiyo is scary.

00:19:47.855 --> 00:19:50.591
(intense music)

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:54.895
A quarter moon tonight,

00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:57.130
half dark and half light.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:02.369
(chuckles) That's proof
luck is on my side.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.805
(paper rustling)

00:20:04.838 --> 00:20:06.039
Did it go well?

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:17.351
(chuckles) Gonna
use a knife, huh?

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:20.187
Make sure it goes
deep, without fail.

00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:22.556
You're gonna leave?

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:24.191
My fever's gone already,

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.493
and if I stay here too long,
they'll get suspicious.

00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:28.762
[Kokuri] Want me to hit
you a couple of times?

00:20:28.795 --> 00:20:30.831
No! Are you kidding me?

00:20:30.864 --> 00:20:32.633
Listen, everything's
gonna be just fine

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.301
as long as the doctor's around.

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:37.938
You just wait out
here in the hallway.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:40.407
Don't eat things you
find on the ground, okay?

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.441
[Boruto] Got it.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.711
Get moving!

00:20:46.046 --> 00:20:47.948
Hey, treat the
prisoners with respect,

00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.449
like I told you before!

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:52.085
(electronics beeping)

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:55.055
(door creaking)

00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.694
(blade snicking)

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:03.997
(footsteps clicking)

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:10.070
All right, you can
leave now, Doctor.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.405
I think I'll stay.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:14.875
-(Kokuri yelling)
-(Kokuri stumbling)

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:16.643
-(intense music)
-Hey, stop!

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:22.082
-Kokuri!
-(dramatic music)

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:25.252
A man, he just suddenly...

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:28.989
(dramatic music)

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.559
(Kokuri gasps)

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:33.560
What happened?

00:21:33.594 --> 00:21:35.095
Somebody just attacked him.

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:36.463
Go, find them.

00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:39.566
Right!

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.668
[Doctor] Did someone
really attack you?

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.537
Yeah, it's true, I swear!

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.573
The security here in the
medical ward is very tight.

00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:49.076
I didn't think that anyone
could even get in here

00:21:49.109 --> 00:21:51.411
without using a wooden tag!

00:21:51.445 --> 00:21:54.581
But then, how did the
attacker get in here?

00:21:56.116 --> 00:21:59.186
(dramatic music)

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:18.639
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:44.958
(frenetic music)

00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:46.293
[Boruto] Kokuri was attacked.

00:23:46.326 --> 00:23:49.096
I can't believe the
medical ward's unsafe too.

00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:51.098
[Mitsuki] What's
the situation now?

00:23:51.131 --> 00:23:52.566
[Boruto] There's someone
watching over him.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:54.601
[Mitsuki] We have to
make our move soon.

00:23:54.635 --> 00:23:56.537
[Boruto] We've gotta do
something to get Kokuri

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.437
in here with us.

00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:59.339
Then we can protect
him all the time.

00:23:59.373 --> 00:24:02.609
Next time on "Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,"

00:24:02.643 --> 00:24:04.678
"A Test of Willpower."

00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:05.946
There's no other way.

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:08.081
Guess I gotta put
my life on the line!

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:10.184
(dramatic music)

00:24:11.652 --> 00:24:16.657
(closing theme music)
