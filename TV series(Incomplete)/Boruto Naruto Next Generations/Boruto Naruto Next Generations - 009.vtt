00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:17.300
In this situation, I can't tell
if you truly have the power of
the Byakugan or not.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:22.534
Therefore, let's test it.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.600
Come on outside.

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:26.267
Huh!?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.034
I shall personally
be your opponent!

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:32.567
What's going on? What are
you planning to do, Grandpa?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.900
If your Byakugan truly has
awakened, then it will appear
naturally in the midst of
fighting.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:45.867
Even if you aren't able to
manifest it at will yet,
neither Hanabi nor I will miss
its signs.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.334
In any event, it'll all become
clear if you fight in earnest.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:03.400
Oh, c'mon, father, I understand
that you want to show off in
front of your grandson...

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:07.234
...but it'll all be for nothing
if you throw your back out!

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:11.334
And besides, I know that
there's no way you'll go
easy on him.

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:14.367
Which means Boruto'll
end up hating you!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.834
[sigh]

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.634
All right, then I'll
leave it to you.

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.700
Well, Boruto? What'll it be?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.934

out or not?

Tell me the truth: you've been
slacking off in training at

It has almost no blind spots.
You know that, don't you?

There's no evidence that the

The bottom line is... it
didn't happen, ya know.

I'll get proof that my
Byakugan's real, and I'll make

now, so I guess I'll go take a
bath.

just the two of us.

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:24.000
Well, then? Your thoughts?

00:08:24.034 --> 00:08:27.434
After all, the
Byakugan didn't manifest.

00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:30.734
...Are you disappointed
in your son?

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:36.400
No. At the very least I
know he didn't lie to me.

00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:38.234
(Hiashi) Oh?

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:43.700
When Boruto told me that he'd
awakened the Byakugan,
honestly, I didn't believe him
at all.

00:08:43.734 --> 00:08:50.200
I thought he was making it up
just another way for him to try
to get my attention.

00:08:50.234 --> 00:08:55.167
I'd imagine almost every child
goes through a phase like that.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.200
That's true.

00:08:57.234 --> 00:09:01.500
I don't know how to put this,
but, things come too easily
for Boruto.

00:09:01.534 --> 00:09:03.367
...he's inclined to
take short cuts.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.667
Oh, really? Are you criticizing
my grandson, is that it?

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.634
[chuckle] But... it was
different today.

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:19.000
If he were just lying about his
<i>eye, he wouldn't have tried so</i>
<i>hard.</i>

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:21.900
<i>It's been quite a while since</i>
<i>I've seen him like that...</i>

00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:26.967
That's why... I know that he's
been telling the truth.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.167
Yes, I believe he is, too.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.134
But then... what is the power
that Boruto's talking about?

00:09:35.167 --> 00:09:40.867
All we really know now is that
it wasn't the Byakugan.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.067
[sigh] I really don't know.
I'll just have to keep an eye
on him and see what happens.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.600
I can only hope that it doesn't
turn out to be something bad...

00:09:49.634 --> 00:09:53.267
It'll be ok. He's my
grandson, after all.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.867
You're right. And
he's also my son.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.200
Yes, that's the part
that worries me.

00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:02.500
[laughing]

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:08.000
By the way, Naruto. With
regards to the Byakugan, how
has Himawari been doing?

00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:11.600
Well, she hasn't actually
manifested it since that
one time.

00:10:11.634 --> 00:10:13.867
Hm...

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.000
I still can't believe that she
manifested it at her age.

00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:21.834
Although then again, it's
not as if it's completely
unprecedented.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.600
If anything happens,
just bring her here.

00:10:29.634 --> 00:10:32.034
I will. Thank you very
much for that.

00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:36.434
But whether we're talking about
Himawari or about Boruto.

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:39.667
children always seem to find
a way of surprising us.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.000
They do.

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:56.067
Please excuse me. I
still have some work to do.

00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:03.067
I'm actually rather concerned
about you, as well.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.767
Oh, I'm all right. I'm
just following through
with my Ninja Way.

'Course after what happened...
I can't blame him if he doesn't
believe me...

I don't get it! How
can you tell that?!

00:12:19.567 --> 00:12:22.834
Because the Byakugan can see
right through everything.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:26.734
You liar! I know it doesn't
have the power to do something
like that!

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:30.667
Sorry. I was just
kidding. Relax!

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.067
Although, sparring does reveal
things. And that's the truth.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.467
Like letting me see
how serious you were.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.667
Because of that, I'm absolutely
certain that something big
must've happened for you to

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.634
claim you'd awakened
the Byakugan.

00:12:46.667 --> 00:12:48.534
Big Sis...

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:52.634
Now... I don't know what my
father or Lord Seventh
might've thought about this...

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:54.234
Yea that's.

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:56.467
...but you have to take
care of this yourself.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:02.067
And if you run into any
problems on the way then don't
hesitate to come and see me.

myself, huh?

what is it that I'm supposed to
do, Kagemasa?

00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:17.900
And I'm going to report
in to Sensei on the way.

00:14:17.934 --> 00:14:22.534
Hm. I guess honor
students have it tough.

00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:24.767
So are you a fan
of Kagemasa, too?

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.967
Everyone's crazy about him...

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.500
No, I'm not like that...

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:32.167
Really? You seemed pretty
interested in this poster.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.834
It's too bad, huh? The rumor
that's going around is that
they're not going to make the
sequel anymore.

00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:38.834
What?! Are you serious? Why?!

00:14:38.867 --> 00:14:43.334
Well... I'm not entirely
sure about it, but.

00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:47.600
I heard that the actor who
plays Kagemasa's under a
lot of stress and...

00:14:47.634 --> 00:14:50.534
[gasp]

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:53.134
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>I can see it!</i>

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:54.500
What? What's wrong?

00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:57.100
H‐Hey!

00:15:04.767 --> 00:15:05.900
All right...

00:15:05.934 --> 00:15:07.600
What are you doing now?!

00:15:07.634 --> 00:15:10.267
There's a shadow hovering
around that guy!

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.767
I gotta do something!

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.867
A shadow?! What
does that mean?!

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.367
[gasp] Just trust
me! I can see it!

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.200
Boruto, wait!

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.334
<i>(Voice)</i>
<i>Oh, are you one of my fans?</i>

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:33.067
<i>You must be, since you keep</i>
<i>on following me.</i>

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.400
Yes! I can see it! This is.

00:15:37.434 --> 00:15:40.634
(Voice)
<i>The wind carries the cries</i>
<i>of the weak.</i>

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:46.300
Meanwhile, my eye throbs,
imploring me to protect the
powerless.

00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:49.234
No way! You're Kagemasa?!

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:51.634
[chuckle]

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:53.467
You gotta be kidding.
That's impossible.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.834
You too, huh? So you think it's
funny that I'm Kagemasa, do you?

00:15:58.867 --> 00:16:04.334
Damn right I do! The Kagemasa I
know isn't all out of shape
like you are!

00:16:04.367 --> 00:16:07.134
Uh, I mean, he isn't right...?

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:09.700
[angry grunt]

00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:12.934
You're like all the others!

00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:16.167
[grunts]

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.234
All right, I'm gonna turn you
into barbequed chicken now!

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:25.300
Yeah. Actually... Maybe I'll
have that for dinner...

00:16:25.334 --> 00:16:27.800
Because chicken is lean
and low in calories!

00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:30.867
Okay, seriously, what
happened to you, anyway?!

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.034
Kagemasa would never do
something like this!

00:16:33.067 --> 00:16:36.500
And uh... you could
stand to work out...

00:16:36.534 --> 00:16:41.334
It'll be fine! I'm in complete
control! You'll see! I'll show
them!

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:44.634
I'll do what I want today and
just get back on track tomorrow!

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:47.367
[gasp] What!?

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.767
Uh, what you're saying and what
you're doing are completely
different!

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.167
You keep on saying the same
things that all of the others
said to me...

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.200
Just because I might have gotten
a little outta shape, they
cancelled the next "Kagemasa"
movie...

00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:04.634
I told them I'd be in shape by
the time filming began.

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.600
So why won't any of
them believe me?!

00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:09.467
Please believe me!

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.600
I can control myself!

00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:14.367
I'm a professional!

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.100
[grunt]

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:16.934
Come on!

00:17:16.967 --> 00:17:22.000
[grunts] No, I'm stuck!

00:17:22.034 --> 00:17:24.567
Now my barbequed
chicken's ready!

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.967
[gasp]

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.200
Stupid Boruto! Get
ahold of yourself!

00:17:29.234 --> 00:17:30.500
Sarada!

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:34.600
Another one of my fans
showed up, huh?

00:17:34.634 --> 00:17:36.434
Who is this guy?

00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:40.334
Look closley! He may seem
different, but that's
Kagemasa, ya know!

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:41.800
He's who!?

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:44.700
I'm Evil Jammer Kagemasa.

00:17:44.734 --> 00:17:47.467
Uh, you don't seem like him‐‐‐

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.200
I said I'll get back on track!

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:51.934
[attack yell]

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:52.500
Sarada!

00:17:52.534 --> 00:17:53.400
[grunt]

00:17:53.434 --> 00:17:54.900
[grunt]

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.734
They ran away, huh.

00:18:02.434 --> 00:18:03.834
So uncool.

00:18:03.867 --> 00:18:06.334
Really? That's how you
thank me for saving you?

00:18:06.367 --> 00:18:08.400
Anyway, what's going on?!
How did this even happen?

00:18:08.434 --> 00:18:13.067
Like I told you. He's
possessed by this weird shadow.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.634
And that's the thing that's been
making him act all crazy.

00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:18.434
You mean you were being
serious about all that?

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:20.334
[groan]

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:23.367
Don't you think it's better if
we just let the grown‐ups deal
with stuff like this?

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.800
Is it really something
you have to handle?

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:28.334
I'm the only one who
can see the shadow.

00:18:28.367 --> 00:18:31.867
And that's why it has to
be me who stops this guy!

00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:35.934
I have to!

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:40.200
Well, whatever you're planning
just make sure you don't fail.

00:18:40.234 --> 00:18:42.734
[gasp] You mean that you believe
me about the shadow?

00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:45.934
Look, I don't know anything
about any shadow,

00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:48.567
but I do know that
you aren't a liar.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.134
Thanks, Sarada!

00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:52.300
But I still think that
you're an idiot.

00:18:52.334 --> 00:18:53.100
[gasp]

00:18:53.134 --> 00:18:55.234
Anyway, don't let
your guard down!

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.300
From what I've seen,
this guy seems super strong.

00:18:58.334 --> 00:19:00.500
I'll do my best, ya know!

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:05.634
Damn it, where did those
brats run off to?

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:09.000
So you're not gonna get
fit, after all, huh?!

00:19:09.034 --> 00:19:13.367
That was my last bag!
I will get fit!

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.767
Here he comes!

00:19:17.334 --> 00:19:20.300
That's nothing! I can
handle that easily!

00:19:21.167 --> 00:19:23.034
How weak!

00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:26.534
Yes! I gotcha!

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:28.067
[chuckle]

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.000
Huh? What are you
laughing about?!

00:19:31.034 --> 00:19:33.634
I gotta thank you, Kagemasa.

00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:37.900
It was because of watching you
that I figured out what I'm
supposed to do.

00:19:37.934 --> 00:19:39.500
Huh?

00:19:39.534 --> 00:19:44.400
You said it yourself. If you
want someone to trust in
what you're trying to do,

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:48.700
Yes! Believe me, I can do
it! I can get fit and‐!

00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:51.034
[grunt]

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.067
[gasp]

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.767
Just kidding!

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.000
Don't underestimate Kagemasa!

00:19:59.034 --> 00:20:02.400
<i>(Boruto)</i>
<i>Kagemasa would say this...</i>

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:03.734
What?

00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:06.467
Prove your words with
your actions!

00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:10.800
[grunts]

00:20:10.834 --> 00:20:14.534
Saying those words while eating
junk food isn't very convincing,
ya know!

00:20:14.567 --> 00:20:19.400
If you want people to believe
you, then stop walking around
carrying chocolates!

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:42.367
You know, maybe I can
be Kagemasa the Second!

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.567
Yeah, no.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.767
Sarada...

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.167
So, um. About that shadow
I mentioned earlier&amp;

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.634
Listen, I still have to go and
report to Sensei tonight.

00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:56.334
See ya, Dummy‐Masa the Second.

00:21:01.734 --> 00:21:04.134
(Newscaster)
Next up, Kagemasa!

00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:08.334
Despite rumors that the popular
movie series was being cancelled
due to the lead actor's
struggles with his weight,

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:10.734
the film has recently
resumed production.

00:21:10.767 --> 00:21:13.034
Okay, I'm taking off!

00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:15.567
Big Brother! Wait,
you forgot this!

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.400
Oh, thanks...

00:21:17.434 --> 00:21:19.834
But I don't think
that I'm gonna need that
old thing anymore.

00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:22.567
You can have it, Himawari!

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.400
You don't want it?

00:21:24.434 --> 00:21:25.934
Nah.

00:21:26.734 --> 00:21:28.734
Ooo...

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.767
So in the end, you still didn't
find out anything about that
eye of yours?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.400
No, nothing.

00:21:38.434 --> 00:21:40.267
But then why aren't you upset?

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.367
I thought for sure that you'd be
angry you weren't able to show
up your dad.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.700
And aren't you disappointed
that it's not the Byakugan?

00:21:46.734 --> 00:21:51.400
To be completely honest, I don't
really care if it's the Byakugan
or not.

00:21:51.434 --> 00:21:54.434
I've just gotta prove that
it's special , ya know?!

00:21:54.467 --> 00:21:56.400
To you guys and to
my dad, too...

00:21:56.434 --> 00:22:03.334
I mean, I won't just say it, I'm
gonna prove my words with my
actions, ya know!

00:22:03.367 --> 00:22:06.567
Oh? Well, I guess that'll
make all this easier.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.700
All right! I'll show you guys!

00:22:07.734 --> 00:22:10.767
So how about we start
after class today.
