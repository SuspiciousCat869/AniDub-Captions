WEBVTT

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.175
Alright!

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:08.775
(CHO-CHO) <i>Sarada!</i>

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.210
Uh...

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:13.614
Starting today, I'm passing on
the role of heroine to you!

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.115
[chuckle] Great! Thanks!

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:18.185
And I'm sorry for getting into
the finals before you.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:21.255
That's okay. I'll be right there
with you real soon.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.057
Don't get careless and let him
slip you up.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.627
Make sure you're extra careful
around that Araya guy!

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.764
Yes, even if an explosion goes
off right beside him, he doesn't
blink.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.733
Which means he's trained
extensively.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:34.968
He's not normal.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.404
Who do you guys think you're
talking to?

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:41.542
I'm going to become Hokage,
remember? I won't let it all end
here.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:44.464
[cheering]

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.265
Hey...

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.099
Oh!

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:49.136
Good job, guys! You all got
really close, too!

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.407
Well, no use getting depressed
about it. You guys went through
the same thing.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.809
Let's just support them and
cheer them on.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:56.743
Yeah!

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:57.611
It's starting!

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.581
Semifinal match two!

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:04.518
From the Leaf, Sarada Uchiha!
Versus the Sand's Araya!

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:05.986
Begin!

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:10.591
[grunts]

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.261
[grunt]

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:18.432
<i>Go!</i>

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.101
[surprised grunt]

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:26.073
[grunt]

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.811
I see... So you're keeping calm
and just observing, are you?

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.446
Then I'll do that too!

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:42.656
[grunt]

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.423
[gasp]

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:49.429
[frustrated grunt]

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.266
I can't keep up, even with my
<i>Sharingan!</i>

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.504
[grunt]

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:58.739
Sarada is just amazing!

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:02.476
She's using her Sharingan to
anticipate her opponents moves!

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.746
Yeah, but it doesn't matter
anyway, he counters everything
she's got!

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:08.182
[grunt]

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.753
As expected, the Uchiha's
Sharingan is really something...

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:16.423
[gasp]

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:19.326
[grunt]

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.429
[straining]

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:26.166
So... You actually can talk,
after all! You've been so
quiet...

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.468
I thought maybe you weren't able
to!

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:29.136
Whatever.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.138
[pained squeal]

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.107
Watch out!

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:37.578
Tch! I'm not done yet.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.419
[gasp and pained groan]

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.353
No! Sarada!

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.654
[cheering]

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:49.790
[grunt and pained groan]

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:52.893
[pained breaths and groans]

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:54.428
[cheering]

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:59.166
Did Sarada try to use genjutsu
to stop her enemy's movements
just now?

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.768
Yeah... But it looks like it
didn't work.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.070
Impossible!

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.875
Surprise attacks don't even faze
him, genjutsu doesn't work...
What's going on here?! I mean...

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:10.577
is that guys even human at all?!

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:12.746
Why won't genjutsu work on him?

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.353
<i>My timing was perfect! And</i>
<i>yet...</i>

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:27.761
<i>As one would expect from a</i>
<i>Sand Shinobi... Is he just</i>
<i>stronger than me?!</i>

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:30.764
<i>No, it can't be!</i>

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:33.000
<i>At the least...</i>

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:37.304
someone not affected when facing
a Sharingan-based genjutsu for
<i>the first time would...</i>

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:39.072
[gasp]

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:42.242
Wait, doesn't the Hidden Sand
<i>use--? Yeah, they do!</i>

00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:48.982
[gasp and grunt]

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.086
[grunts and straining]

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.656
If this continues, it's going to
be very bad...

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.624
Sarada! Move away from him!

00:05:57.658 --> 00:06:00.494
Seems you can still move, even
with that wound.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.563
[grunts]

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:07.234
But it's useless. I've done my
research on the shinobi of the
Hidden Leaf.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:11.405
[gasp]

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.909
I know you're really smart too.
It'll be troublesome if this
gets drawn out...

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.478
so why don't we wrap this up
quickly?

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:19.179
[grunt]

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.481
[pained grunt]

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.885
[pained groans]

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:29.022
[heavy breathing]

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:32.159
Did you use up your strength?
Well, then...

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:33.293
[heavy breathing]

00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:35.095
Lightning Style: Lightning Ball!

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:43.604
[gasps]

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:45.739
[grunt] Leaf Hurricane! [grunts]

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:48.675
[ohh's and ahh's]

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.477
What was she even aiming at?!

00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.545
No wait...

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.479
Look there.

00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:53.680
What do you mean?!

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.116
Thank you, Metal!

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.118
Do not worry That was nothing!

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.754
Eh?! You all... I just, uh...

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.656
Wait, what?! What is going on?

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:03.490
Eh...!

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:06.326
[shouting]

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.829
Alright. You can't run away
anymore.

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:15.802
[cheering]

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.271
Whoa, there's someone up there!

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:18.105
Wha-?

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:19.773
Huh?! Is that his twin?!

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.176
[gasp] No way!

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:27.481
You're the real one, aren't you?
You Puppet User!

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:28.815
[cheering]

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:29.449
Huh?

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:29.516
[cheering]

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:32.319
Did she say puppet?

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:33.086
Hmmm...

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.657
B-b-but... W-when did you
f-figure it out?!

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.227
I sensed that something wasn't
right from the beginning.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.696
No matter how disciplined one
<i>may be...</i>

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.600
when something suddenly happens
<i>before their eyes... humans</i>
<i>react unconsciously.</i>

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.637
But you didn't react at all...

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.639
Also, you had almost inhuman...

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:55.475
machine-like movements that my
Sharingan couldn't keep up
with...

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.646
...and you were unaffected by
genjutsu when I tried to use it
on you.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.281
And that's when I remembered.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.786
The Village Hidden in the Sand
possesses outstanding technique
with puppets.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.487
I-is t-that all...?

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.490
(SARADA) <i>Well, all that and just</i>
<i>one more thing.</i>

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:14.761
When I was at a disadvantage,
you were in a rush to finish the
<i>fight.</i>

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.163
Don't you get it?

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:18.498
If you'd truly done your
research on me...

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:21.335
then you should've known all
about the Sharingan's
weakness...

00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:24.304
The Sharingan consumes an
enormous amount of chakra.

00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.640
So that means that Sarada's
weakness is...

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:27.641
-Stamina, huh?
Yes! Stamina.-

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.243
If you intended to win...

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.780
the wisest move would've been to
prolong the battle so I'd run
out of chakra.

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:37.751
Instead, you tried to end it as
soon as you saw an opening.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:38.619
[quivering]

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:40.420
(SARADA) <i>And that's what</i>
<i>convinced me...</i>

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:45.392
You were afraid of having a
long, drawn-out battle with me.
Aren't I right about that?

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:49.062
'Cause if I observed you
closely, you couldn't keep your
secret hidden.

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:54.301
Then I'd see the Chakra Threads
used to control your puppet!

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:59.506
Hey, wait! If a challenger
leaves the battle arena, doesn't
that mean disqualification?

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.409
Yeah, that's right... Leave in
the middle and you're
disqualified.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:06.580
It should be the same as if you
weren't there at the start.

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:07.881
Don't you think, Lord Kazekage?

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:10.284
You want to make a complaint,
then?

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:13.787
(NARUTO) <i>Heh. We need to amend</i>
<i>the rules , you know.</i>

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.423
[nervous breaths]

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:20.427
He's just standing there... Is
he... about to try something
else?

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.596
No, look...

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:24.498
He's trembling!

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:27.234
[nervous breaths] W-What am I
s-supposed to d-do?

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.137
I-I don't like b-being the
c-center of attention!

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.842
Is he nervous because everyone's
staring at him right now? He's
just like Metal!

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:37.010
N-no way! A-Am I r-really like
that?

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:39.580
It's no wonder he uses a puppet
to fight!

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.216
That's his weakness...

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.818
[nervous breaths] Ahh...

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:45.586
(SHINKI) <i>Araya!</i>

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:48.488
[panicked breaths and groans]

00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:53.460
[shouting]

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:54.328
Shinki...?

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.964
[shouting]

00:09:56.997 --> 00:10:00.434
No... I-It's too late! You can't
turn the tide of battle, not in
the condition you're in!

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:04.738
[grunting]

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.340
We'll see about that...

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.741
[cheering]

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.611
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:15.048
Uh...!

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:29.830
It is over! The winner is Sarada
Uchiha!

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:31.365
[chuckles]

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:32.799
[cheering]

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.469
[grunts and groans]

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:39.640
Should-a researched more! We're
growing stronger every single
day!

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:41.775
Don't you dare underestimate us
Leaf Shinobi!

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:42.709
[chuckles]

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.511
You did it, Sarada!

00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:45.679
Yeah, well...

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.114
What an amazing jutsu!

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.749
I haven't mastered it yet...

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:54.321
so I can really only use it
against somebody who's coming
directly at me... [chuckle]

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:58.392
But forget me, Mitsuki. Your
match is up next. You win
this...

00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:01.728
And the finalists will be from
<i>Team 7!</i>

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:05.766
Mitsuki, in the next match, show
'em just how serious you can be!

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:16.343
(ROCK LEE) <i>And now... we move on</i>
<i>to match three of the</i>
<i>semifinals!</i>

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.745
From the Leaf... Mitsuki...
versus, from the Sand, Shinki!

00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:28.522
[cheering]

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:29.456
Amazing...

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:32.392
Wind Style: Breakthrough.
[blowing]

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:44.371
I've got you.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.307
Hm?

00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:55.449
Interesting magic trick. What
will you pull out next? A
rabbit?

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:58.285
No, I can only produce snakes.

00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:05.425
You use unusual jutsu as well.
Just how do you manipulate Iron
Sand like that?

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:08.929
It's probably the same type of
technique that Uncle Gaara
uses...

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:12.866
That's right... He's the adopted
son of the Kazekage, isn't he?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.539
Aghhh... Well, he may have the
Kazekage, but we have the guts!
Mitsuki!

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:24.044
This jutsu was personally taught
to me by my father. You couldn't
possibly understand.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.614
Oh. Well... I don't really care
either way.

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:29.616
Wind Style: Wind Scythe.

00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:31.285
Pointless.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.988
Mitsuki, dodge it!

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:54.842
[cheering]

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.476
Snakes again...

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.811
Just a clone...?

00:12:57.845 --> 00:12:59.580
Striking Shadow Snake Assault.

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:07.454
[hissing]

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.160
That wall is impenetrable... But
how about this?

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:15.929
Huh?

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:17.130
Striking Shadow Snake Burial!

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:26.206
[cheering]

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:31.445
Hey, c'mon... I mean, I know a
battle's a battle, but he could
still die, ya know.

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:38.018
[cheering]

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:40.988
Yeah, you're right. I felt no
resistance.

00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:44.825
[gasps]

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:46.426
An Iron Sand Clone?!

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.662
[grunt] I thought that Mitsuki
had him!

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.698
Even that surprise attack had no
effect at all!

00:13:51.732 --> 00:13:57.538
I've taught Shinki everything
that I know. His true skills
are even greater than this.

00:13:57.571 --> 00:14:02.676
You didn't even take a step
before this, and yet you still
resorted to a clone?

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:05.012
So, did I surprise you a little?

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.581
Yeah.

00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:11.485
But my Father taught me to keep
my guard up, especially at times
like this.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:16.190
He taught me that his former
rivals from the past were like
that too.

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:19.193
But what about you, Mitsuki?

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:22.930
I want to see more. Show me your
strength.

00:14:22.963 --> 00:14:26.266
[grunt] Go on, Mitsuki! Go for
it!

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.036
Cheap tricks won't be affective
<i>against him anymore.</i>

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:32.539
<i>What would Boruto do in a</i>
<i>situation like this?</i>

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:39.479
Lightning Style:

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:40.981
Snake Lightning!

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:46.620
[grunt]

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.996
[pained grunts]

00:14:56.597 --> 00:14:58.398
[pained grunts]

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.836
Damn it, he got him!

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.173
He deliberately let Mitsuki
destroy his Iron Sand wall.

00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:09.743
And that made Mitsuki believe he
had an opening to attack.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:14.248
Yeah... Anyone would've thought
so in that situation.

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:18.352
He's using a lot of jutsu. He
only has a little chakra left.

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.187
What are you gonna do, Mitsuki?!

00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:27.127
So is that it, then? I know you
have more up your sleeve...

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:29.229
[chuckle]

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:34.535
I know just where that
complacency of yours comes from.

00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:36.036
I'll make you show me.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:42.342
In that attack earlier, I placed
an Iron Sand Marking on you.

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:44.444
You know the Iron Sand's
properties, right?

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:46.446
Magnetism...

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:51.051
That's right. My inescapable
spear will pierce right through
you.

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:56.857
It seems I have no choice left
<i>in this situation...</i>

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.294
To defeat him, I'll have to
undergo Sage Transformation...

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:01.461
[gasp]

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:06.967
Hm?

00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:10.871
[chuckle]

00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:13.040
Now, show me! Show me your
power!

00:16:18.378 --> 00:16:19.446
I quit.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:19.847
[gasp]

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.147
[grunt]

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:27.988
Did I just hear you correctly?

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.625
Yes, you did. I just said, "I
quit."

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:33.293
[disappointed sigh]

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:35.996
Did I hear correctly?

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:37.764
I submit.

00:16:37.798 --> 00:16:39.733
Uh... But...!

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.568
It'll be fine this way.

00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:43.270
[sigh] I understand...

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.443
<i>The winner is Shinki of the</i>
<i>Sand!</i>

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:53.881
Hold on...! What just happened
to Mitsuki? Did he get hurt or
something?!

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:56.517
Don't ask me, I don't have a
clue!

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.954
[cheering]

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:01.989
(SHINKI) <i>Wait!</i>

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.392
Damn you... But why?

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:07.694
[cheering]

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:11.965
If we were to continue any
further than we did, it might
inconvenience my parent.

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:14.768
[cheering]

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:17.504
What I want is to stay here...

00:17:17.538 --> 00:17:21.842
So I don't really care about the
outcome of this match compared
to that.

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:26.313
[cheering]

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:28.682
It seems that I was wrong about
you...

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.851
[cheering]

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:36.056
<i>Well, I still don't know if</i>
<i>I would've won even if I got</i>
<i>serious.</i>

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:37.925
[grunt] What are you doing,
Mitsuki?!

00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.660
Did you get hurt somewhere?

00:17:39.693 --> 00:17:42.529
[cheering]

00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:44.298
Huh? What's up?

00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:46.633
Sorry!

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.668
Huh?!

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:50.838
No, wait... Not quite.

00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:53.841
More like, I look forward to
working with you further? Yup.
That's it.

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.709
Ehhh...?

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.344
What just happened to him?!

00:17:57.377 --> 00:17:59.646
Mm?! Eh?

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.949
[cheering]

00:18:01.982 --> 00:18:04.852
Tomorrow... the finals will be
held!

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:10.524
<i>Competing are Shinki of the</i>
Sand, Sarada Uchiha of the Leaf,
<i>and also from the Leaf...</i>

00:18:10.557 --> 00:18:12.025
<i>Boruto Uzumaki!</i>

00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:15.462
<i>Finalists, please bring your</i>
<i>very best to the matches!</i>

00:18:15.796 --> 00:18:16.463
Right!

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:23.604
[chattering]

00:18:23.637 --> 00:18:27.674
What's going on? I took you here
'cause you were craving
barbecue...

00:18:27.708 --> 00:18:30.844
I mean... sure, it's too bad
that you lost, but...

00:18:30.878 --> 00:18:35.716
...you guys really gave it your
<i>all out there, and I'm sure</i>
<i>everyone saw that.</i>

00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:37.851
The meat is... flimsy.

00:18:37.885 --> 00:18:41.855
[grunt] It can't be helped!
Payday hasn't rolled around yet,
okay?!

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:42.856
(SHIKADAI) <i>Moegi Sensei...</i>

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.358
Huh?

00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:47.561
Is it... something that we're
lacking?

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:52.799
Listen... that isn't a question
you need to have an answer
for yet.

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:57.337
Just now, you were thinking of
how to beat Boruto in a rematch,
<i>weren't you?</i>

00:18:57.371 --> 00:18:58.438
[gasp]

00:18:59.873 --> 00:19:04.478
Okay, then... your training for
the next Chunin Exams has
already begun.

00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:06.613
Tomorrow, we'll resume our
special training!

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:08.782
Alright!

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:09.616
[chuckle]

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:11.552
(BBQ WAITER) <i>Thanks for</i>
<i>waiting!</i>

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:12.452
Yay! Finally...!

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.356
Here's our special combo
platter! Twenty whole servings!

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.957
Huh?!

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.027
W-What?!

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.630
Well, what's the meaning of all
this? I think you have the wrong
table!

00:19:23.664 --> 00:19:28.502
You guys were all deep in
conversation so I just went
ahead and ordered for us.

00:19:28.535 --> 00:19:33.373
[sigh] Well, if we ordered it,
we gotta eat it. So let's just
dig in!

00:19:33.407 --> 00:19:35.742
[chewing]

00:19:35.776 --> 00:19:37.177
Uh... But, you guys...!

00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:38.912
(SHIKADAI) <i>Hey Cho-Cho, you want</i>
<i>this?</i>

00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:40.514
And here's the check!

00:19:40.547 --> 00:19:41.782
(INOJIN) <i>Oh, hey, me too!</i>

00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:43.317
Ahhh!

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.320
Okay! [chewing] If you don't
want it, I'll have it!

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:49.756
(SAKURA) <i>Are you okay, honey?</i>

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.192
Yeah. It doesn't hurt.

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:54.161
You were pretty reckless out
there...

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:57.464
[chuckle] Well, I mean, I am
your daughter, after all, right?

00:19:57.497 --> 00:20:02.202
That's for sure! So, when did
you learn how to do the Fireball
Jutsu?

00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:08.509
I just asked Dad to teach me.
I'm not really able to do it
that well yet, though. [chuckle]

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:11.612
Oh, hey... Is Dad not coming
home tonight either?

00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:16.517
I think he should be able to
just relax at home since he's
back for a change.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.919
Well, doing things this way
works for him.

00:20:18.952 --> 00:20:23.790
And besides, he comes home to
sleep sometimes. It's just
usually late.

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:26.860
So you're never aware he was
even here.

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:30.264
<i>Your father's been busy</i>
helping Lord Seventh all this
<i>time...</i>

00:20:30.297 --> 00:20:32.633
<i>and the work he does is very</i>
<i>difficult.</i>

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:36.270
<i>But everything he's doing is</i>
<i>for the good of this entire</i>
<i>world.</i>

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.638
[chuckle]

00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:40.507
Wow, how brave of you, Mom.

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:42.676
Hey, come on! Don't tease your
mother!

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:44.311
[chuckling] Yeah, okay...

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:46.113
(SASUKE) <i>Chidori!</i>

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:49.449
Amazing!

00:20:50.384 --> 00:20:52.286
So that's Old Man Kakashi's
jutsu, huh?!

00:20:53.654 --> 00:20:55.455
Hey! You gotta teach me that!

00:20:55.722 --> 00:20:56.690
I can't.

00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:57.624
Aw, meanie!

00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:03.197
This jutsu can only be used when
you have the visual insight of
the Sharingan.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.500
Then why'd you even bother
showing it to me?!

00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:10.037
Your chakra has a strong
Lightning Nature to it.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.740
Improve your precision on
Lightning Style signs.

00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:19.246
In time, you'll be able to use
powerful jutsu. But you have to
start with the basics.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:23.283
Yes, sir. So you're telling me
that if I work hard at it...

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:26.587
I'll be able to use techniques
similar to the Chidori, right?

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.521
Okay, I get it...

00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:29.690
(SASUKE) <i>Long ago, there was</i>
<i>someone...</i>

00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:31.859
Huh?

00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:35.429
...who refused to listen to
anyone... who sought great power
by any means...

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:39.066
...and who tried to change the
world all by himself.

00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.002
Oh, yeah? So what happened to
this guy, then?

00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:44.338
He paid a steep price.

00:21:44.371 --> 00:21:47.941
However, in the end, a friend
saved him.

00:21:47.975 --> 00:21:51.278
So, you're saying friends are
important, right?

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.947
I'm all good when it comes to
that stuff.

00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:58.285
[chuckle] I mean, I already have
a lot of great people all around
me!

00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:00.454
Hm... I see.

00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:04.324
[cheering]

00:22:04.358 --> 00:22:08.128
(ROCK LEE) The time has come!
The finals are about to begin!

00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:45.893
(SHINKI) <i>My jutsu's good against</i>
<i>multiple opponents at once.</i>

00:23:45.926 --> 00:23:50.063
<i>It's easy for me to take you</i>
<i>both on at the same time!</i>

00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:54.301
(SARADA) <i>You wanna join forces?</i>
It'd be disgraceful for two Leaf
<i>Shinobi to lose here.</i>

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:57.070
We can't let the Five Kage see
<i>that!</i>

00:23:57.104 --> 00:24:00.174
(BORUTO) <i>I can't lose, either!</i>
<i>Alright, it's official! We're</i>
<i>teaming up!</i>

00:24:00.207 --> 00:24:05.112
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "The Iron Sand</i>
<i>User: Shinki."</i>

00:24:05.145 --> 00:24:09.082
(SHINKI) <i>I'll show you that you</i>
can't destroy my impenetrable
<i>Iron Wall!</i>
