WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.176
(intense music)

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.817
You're going awfully fast.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.219
(labored breathing)

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.221
Once we reach the Land of Fire,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.756
then the end of your mission

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.292
is finally gonna be in sight.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.494
[Shinki] We can't let
our guard down yet.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.497
Yeah, well, there's no
need to be so uptight.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.534
Anyway, I wonder how
Boruto's doing right now.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:43.443
(water whooshing)

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.415
(chuckles)

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.218
[Urashiki] First it's tag,
now it's hide-and-seek.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.619
It's pointless to struggle,

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:56.190
so why don't you just hand
the One Tail over to me now?

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.626
[Boruto Voiceover] I've
gotta buy some time

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.995
until Shinki reaches
the Leaf with Shukaku.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.465
(cracking)

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.938
Come on, you must know

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.507
that it's useless to hide,

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.977
Boruto Uzumaki.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.983
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.400
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:06.720
(groans)

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.722
(blades hissing)

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.424
Halt.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.492
(groans)

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:16.763
(blade hisses)

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:22.503
You're in the Land of Fire.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.838
Entering our territory
without authorization

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.473
from the Leaf is prohibited.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.222
Hey, wait, you're
Lord Kazekage's-

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.726
I do not wish to fight you.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.594
Lord Kazekage sent
me on a mission

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:49.429
to see Lord Hokage.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:50.864
Mission?

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.799
What are the details?

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.835
I can only tell Lord Hokage.

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.170
Not gonna happen.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:57.538
Now, start talking.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.909
Sorry, I can't discuss
this with anyone

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:03.710
ranked lower than a Jonin.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.084
[Sai] Well, maybe
you can tell me.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:17.591
[Mirai] Mr. Sai, I thought
that you were on vacation.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.626
I was, and it was fun.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.696
But once I returned,
Lord Seventh asked me

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.531
to head to the Land of Wind.

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.500
There's been no
contact from Sasuke,

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:28.669
so I was on my way
to investigate.

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:33.774
I know you from
the Chunin Exams.

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:37.678
Yes, but tell me, why do you
need to see Lord Seventh?

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.916
I see.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.184
[Shinki] The
Otsutsuki's currently

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:46.386
being distracted by a decoy.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.323
Go and make contact
with border security.

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:51.558
Tell them to be on high alert.

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:52.960
[Underlings] Yes, sir.

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.095
[Sai] I'll bring
Shukaku to Lord Seventh.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.431
Mirai and Shinki,
please stand by here.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.467
Right.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.307
(sighs)

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:15.449
Hmm.

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:20.087
(whooshing)

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:24.157
(whirring)

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:37.204
-(explosions blasting)
-(yelling)

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:41.708
(groaning)

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:42.743
Oh, no!

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.514
It's a clone?

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.750
(whirring)

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:58.025
(groaning)

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.794
I can't move.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.229
[Urashiki] It can't be.

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.935
(Boruto gasps)

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.704
(Boruto groans)

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:17.578
(shattering)

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.280
You tricked me.

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:23.283
So, the other boy
has the real one.

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:25.185
Is that it?

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.120
(chuckles) Shukaku's
probably hanging out

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.089
with my dad right about now.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.592
-Too bad for you, huh?
-(punching)

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.694
(groans)

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.096
Well, it seems
from your reaction

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.398
that you're not a clone.

00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:39.733
[Boruto] Why, you.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.335
[Urashiki] Since
it's come to this,

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:42.703
-(punching)
-(Boruto groans)

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.838
it seems that I have no choice

00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:47.274
but to use you as a hostage.

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.377
Yeah, right.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.114
No way will I let
myself be your hostage.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:57.351
Unfortunately, that's
not for you to decide.

00:06:57.384 --> 00:07:01.088
I'm completely certain
that Naruto Uzumaki

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.990
will agree to trade
me what I want

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.125
in exchange for your life.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.094
(chuckles) Doubt it.

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:11.164
You see, shinobi aren't
swayed by stuff like that.

00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:12.132
Oh?

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.268
Then let's test
that out, shall we?

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.737
We'll just see whether
he's swayed or not

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.940
when he looks upon your
battered and broken body.

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:22.709
(Boruto groans)

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:32.319
Hmm. (chuckles)

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.260
I'll extract just enough chakra

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:42.362
to keep you barely alive.

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:44.998
(Boruto winces)

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:47.568
All right, this fight is over.

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:53.740
-(Boruto chuckles)
-(whooshing)

00:07:55.576 --> 00:08:00.180
-(yelling)
-(whooshing)

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.991
(laughs) It's impressive of you

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:13.994
to put your real
body in harm's way,

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.596
but it's such a shame.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.098
(winces)

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:21.101
This time it's really
over, for good!

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:26.306
-(whooshing)
-(Boruto groans)

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:38.952
-What?
-(whirring)

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:41.722
(Boruto groans)

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:45.459
Huh?

00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:50.597
(rock music)

00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.632
Shinki!

00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:55.802
Hold on, why are you here?

00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:58.572
(Shinki grunts)

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.709
(groaning)

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.682
I don't get it.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.950
Why'd you come back?

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.853
I've ensured that
Master Shukaku is safe.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.855
So, I completed my mission.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.357
(crumbling)

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:22.629
Which means now I'm free
to do whatever I please.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.235
(Boruto chuckles)

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:31.638
Well, all right, let's
leave it at that.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:34.074
(cracking)

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:38.712
Damn it.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.480
Hey, uh, you can promise me

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:44.718
that you're gonna handle
this fight rationally, right?

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:45.719
[Shinki] No.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.688
-I can't.
-Huh?

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:49.790
Wow, that's not like you.

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.960
Yeah, I wonder
whose fault that is.

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:53.961
[Boruto] Huh?

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:55.829
I accomplished my mission,

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:58.866
but still I don't
feel satisfied.

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.100
That's all.

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.704
(crumbling)

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:17.451
(chuckles)

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:20.187
I don't know if we can
really bring him down,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.691
but still, together I bet we
can get some good hits in.

00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:26.193
[Boruto] Yeah!

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:34.501
(water whooshing)

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:46.246
I'd say that just one
hostage will be sufficient,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.383
so let's get rid of the
unnecessary one now.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.852
(crackling)

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:54.321
(whirring)

00:10:55.322 --> 00:11:00.527
-(rock music)
-(Urashiki groans)

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.434
(Boruto grunts)

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:12.506
Black Iron Wings!

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:22.449
He's gone!

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:28.322
Huh? (groans)

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.296
He traveled through a
different dimension.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.065
Well, that's inconvenient.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.034
(groans)

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:58.452
(groaning loudly)

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.655
(yelling)

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.397
(wincing)

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:16.670
(high-pitched whooshing)

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:19.206
(slow music)

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:25.279
[Boruto] I've felt
this sensation before.

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:27.681
(both groan)

00:12:27.714 --> 00:12:28.882
That looks like...

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.751
So, you have the Jougan.

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:33.420
That's a very troublesome eye.

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:34.454
Is that true?

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:38.392
(whirring)

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.130
(groaning)

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.641
Huh?

00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:01.348
(Boruto groans)

00:13:04.518 --> 00:13:06.353
(Urashiki yells)

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:08.121
Does this mean that you can tell

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:09.756
where he's going to appear?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.158
Guess so.

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:13.861
If we can just get him to go
into the other dimension again-

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:16.363
Even if you do know
where I'm going to be,

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:19.333
you still have no
chance of defeating me.

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:22.469
(exciting music)

00:13:22.503 --> 00:13:24.605
(groans)

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:31.345
(both yelling)

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:47.227
[Boruto] There!

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:54.601
This is nothing to me!

00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:59.173
(groans)

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:05.612
I bet you can't tell which
one of us is the real one.

00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:11.985
It doesn't matter which one
if I destroy all of you.

00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:24.965
You're too late!

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:28.168
Black Iron Fist! (groans)

00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:31.305
(yells)

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:38.478
Rasengan!

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.454
Did we get him?

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:50.457
(labored breathing)

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:56.897
(groans) That hurt.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.968
I didn't expect quite
so much out of you.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.503
You're dead.

00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:04.638
If you hadn't come
back to help me out,

00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:07.741
you wouldn't have had to go
through all of this, you know?

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.878
I came back to beat him.

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:14.081
I didn't come back
for your sake.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:15.949
(chuckles) I should've known.

00:15:15.983 --> 00:15:17.885
Man, you make me mad.

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:20.954
(chuckles)

00:15:20.988 --> 00:15:25.058
-And now say goodbye!
-(whirring)

00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:28.462
(zapping)

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:35.369
[Boruto] Sasuke!

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:40.674
Just how did you get here?

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:42.543
Well, somebody kept opening up

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:44.478
and closing Time-Space,

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:47.581
so I was able to
pinpoint this location.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:52.319
-(growling)
-(whooshing)

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:55.255
Chidori!

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.426
What?

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.460
He disappeared?

00:16:03.597 --> 00:16:05.532
But not into Time-Space.

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.002
(groans)

00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:10.504
I'm out of chakra.

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:14.174
Guess I can't pursue him.

00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:16.977
Nice one, Sasuke.

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:22.583
-Glad you're okay.
-(tumbling)

00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:27.487
(slow music)

00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:29.756
(chuckles)

00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:44.304
(groans)

00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:46.073
Where am I now?

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.608
Lord Kazekage.

00:16:47.641 --> 00:16:50.244
(sobbing) Oh, thank goodness.

00:16:57.584 --> 00:17:00.287
(creaking)

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.257
Man, that did not feel good.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.893
Although, it looks
like I made it.

00:17:05.926 --> 00:17:08.729
Guess using my secret
weapon wasn't too smart.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:16.537
Hey!

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.571
Look, there!

00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:23.343
Lady Temari.

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:24.611
Lord Shikadai.

00:17:24.645 --> 00:17:26.446
(groaning)

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.347
They're both safe.

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.283
Hurry now, let's
tend to their wounds.

00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:30.083
No, wait.

00:17:30.117 --> 00:17:31.885
First, what about Kankuro?

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:33.620
Don't worry, he's
completely safe.

00:17:33.654 --> 00:17:36.456
Another platoon found him
just a little while ago.

00:17:37.758 --> 00:17:38.759
Oh, good.

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:44.097
So, your son acted as the decoy,

00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:47.034
and that's the main
reason I made it here!

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.203
You gotta do something, quick!

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:52.673
Who would've imagined that
all this stuff was going on.

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:56.009
Shikamaru, I'm going to
go to the scene right now.

00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:57.811
-Take care of things here.
-(door opens)

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.214
-There's no need.
-Huh?

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:01.248
Sasuke.

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.155
It's been three days,

00:18:08.188 --> 00:18:10.591
but there's still no
sign of the Otsutsuki.

00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:14.561
We don't know when or
where he'll appear,

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:17.097
and then there's the
whole Tailed Beast issue.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.900
We must discuss this
with the other Kage.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.101
You're right.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:23.504
We should call for
a Five Kage Summit.

00:18:25.906 --> 00:18:28.208
I am indebted to Boruto.

00:18:28.242 --> 00:18:30.677
So, please, will you
thank him for me?

00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:31.879
Sure thing.

00:18:31.912 --> 00:18:35.015
Although, we also caused
you a lot of trouble.

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:37.084
Boruto is just like you,

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.986
and yet, different, too.

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:41.822
He's smarter than
you were at that age.

00:18:41.855 --> 00:18:42.956
What?

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.526
(groans) Come on, that's
not true, you know?

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:48.662
(sighs)

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:53.300
[Boruto] But in the end,
Urashiki got away from us.

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:56.103
Still, Shukaku made it
to Lord Seventh safely,

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.604
and everyone's still alive.

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:00.674
Honestly, I'd say that's
a really good outcome.

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:02.209
But even more importantly,

00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:03.544
do you think that you're ready

00:19:03.577 --> 00:19:06.246
for the scolding you're
gonna get from your mom?

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.015
You lied about leaving, right?

00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:09.016
(Boruto gasps)

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:10.884
Oh, don't come crying to me.

00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:12.953
You even lied to
Himawari this time,

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.421
and that's not cool.

00:19:14.454 --> 00:19:18.058
Uh, anyway, I guess I'll
go and pay Shinki a visit.

00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:19.760
[Shikadai] Shinki?

00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:22.229
He already left the hospital.

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:23.230
What?

00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:24.765
It happened while
you were resting.

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:28.468
Shinki was discharged and
Uncle Gaara came by to get him.

00:19:29.903 --> 00:19:31.405
(groans) Come on!

00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:33.740
He didn't even
say goodbye to me?

00:19:33.774 --> 00:19:36.276
[Shikadai] They're taking
the afternoon Thunder Train.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.612
(groans) Dammit, that
train is supposed

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:43.050
to leave really soon.
(breathing heavily)

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.121
Be careful, okay?

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:52.693
I hope you'll come back soon.

00:19:52.726 --> 00:19:55.662
You can come and visit
Boruto any time you want.

00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.032
Okay.

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:00.033
All right.

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:01.935
Well, I gotta get going.

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:05.005
I'm sorry, I can't
stay to see you off.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:08.041
-No worries.
-(whooshing)

00:20:10.244 --> 00:20:13.647
Good job delivering Shukaku
here safely, Shinki.

00:20:15.182 --> 00:20:17.684
Yes, the mission was successful.

00:20:17.718 --> 00:20:18.719
But still...

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.624
I don't get what it is you
were trying to tell me, Father.

00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:27.327
Boruto has something that
you don't possess just yet.

00:20:28.262 --> 00:20:30.597
I'm sure you'll come
to learn what it is.

00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:33.901
I didn't learn anything
from him at all.

00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:36.570
Emotions are practically
everything to him.

00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:39.573
(chuckling)

00:20:39.606 --> 00:20:41.375
He's simply naive.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.944
Without the power he
needs to back him up,

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:47.314
he'll lose both his
friends and his missions.

00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:51.218
That's why I'm going
to prove it to him.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:56.390
The path I walk ensures no
loss of friends and no regrets.

00:20:58.125 --> 00:20:59.726
[Boruto] Shinki!

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.333
(breathing heavily)

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:10.404
Just what do you want?

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:13.574
Hey, man, if you're
gonna leave then tell me!

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:16.977
And why should I do that?

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.745
When you leave you
should at least

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:20.180
say goodbye to a friend!

00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:25.686
Take care, okay?

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:28.655
Next time you come to the
Leaf I'll show you around.

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:33.160
[Shinki] You take care, too.

00:21:33.193 --> 00:21:34.995
Do your best not to die.

00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:36.730
Huh?

00:21:38.532 --> 00:21:40.667
(chuckles)

00:21:43.604 --> 00:21:46.440
(train whistling)

00:22:02.122 --> 00:22:07.127
See you again soon, Shinki.

00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:14.201
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.720
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:43.223
(exciting music)

00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:45.759
How long are you gonna stay
in that tea kettle, Shukaku?

00:23:45.792 --> 00:23:47.127
[Shukaku] That's
what I wanna know.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.096
That damn fox just
made fun of me!

00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:50.097
[Naruto] I'm sorry.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.431
It's just to keep you safe.

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:53.567
You're gonna be staying
with me for a while.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.869
[Shukaku] I don't like
being under the same roof

00:23:55.903 --> 00:23:57.404
as that damn fox!

00:23:57.437 --> 00:24:00.607
[Himawari] It's a
talking Shukaku!

00:24:00.641 --> 00:24:03.477
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto
Naruto Next Generations",

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.745
"Shukaku's Trick".

00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:05.946
[Shukaku] Not bad.

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:08.315
I could use this to
figure out his weakness.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:15.455
(singing in Japanese)
