WEBVTT

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:10.444
(UOU) <i>Who's there?!</i>

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:14.248
[grunt]

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.784
[grunts]

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:18.252
[grunt]

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.022
Let's go!

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:22.756
[heavy breathing]

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.391
Ahhh! [grunt]

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.127
[grunts]

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.098
Water Style: Syrup Trap!
[spitting]

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:40.707
The hell is that--?!

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.345
[pained grunts]

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.346
Wind Scythe!

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.714
Come on!

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.450
Huh? Whoa!

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:51.785
[pained grunt]

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.388
[exhale] Damn you!

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.996
[gasp and pained groans]

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.909
(MAN B) <i>I'll leave it to you,</i>
<i>then...</i>

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.010
(MAN C) <i>Okay.</i>

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:05.485
Sir!

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.420
Ah!

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:08.755
The status?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.594
It appears two chunin guards
were attacked, and they're both
in a coma now.

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:16.797
(SAI) <i>Hm. And the assailant?</i>

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.668
We're still in the middle of
our investigation, but we
haven't found anything yet.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.271
I see... Well, thank you.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.581
[gasp]

00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:45.425
(SARADA) <i>I wonder why Mitsuki's</i>
<i>not here yet...</i>

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.061
He's probably still crashed
out over at his house.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:50.397
Oh? And how would you know that?

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.766
We're both totally in synch
with each other!

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.136
I know everything there is to
know about Mitsuki, ya know?

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.571
Is that so?

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.608
[yawn]

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:02.743
But still...

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.779
I wish Big Brother Konohamaru
would have told us yesterday...

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.781
that our mission today was
cancelled.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:10.050
He said something really urgent
came up.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:15.589
Well, if there isn't a mission
for us to go on, let's go and
tell Mitsuki in person!

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.158
Uh....

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.626
What?

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:23.497
Yeah... so, uh, where's his
house again?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.901
[exasperated sigh] Really,
Boruto? So how are you two
"totally in synch?"

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.037
'Cause Mitsuki and I are so
close...

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.942
we don't even need to know stuff
like where the other one lives,
ya know?

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:38.011
[exasperated sigh] Wait. Um... I
think it's...

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.284
Hey, Mitsuki! You in there?

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:48.689
Maybe he went out...

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.759
You think someone might have
told him already and he just
took off?

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:56.630
And not come to our meeting spot
first? Boy, I really doubt it.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.367
Uh...

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.269
It's open!

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.572
Hey... Hey!

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.048
Hmmm...

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:17.651
It doesn't seem like he's here.

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:21.588
I hate to say this... but his
place is kinda depressing...

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.161
Hmmm...

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:33.433
So this is where Mitsuki lives,
huh?

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.470
Did you know Boruto?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.740
No... I mean, I heard he
lived alone, but...

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:43.410
[chattering]

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:47.881
Come to think of it, we never
heard him talk very much about
his parents...

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:52.085
...or about what his life was
like in his home village, did
we?

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:55.289
Yeah. Even though we were
together all the time.

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:05.165
Hmmm...

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:19.980
[chattering]

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:22.616
No, actually we haven't seen him
in a while.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.750
Oh man.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.689
Yeah we've all been really busy
helping with the Five Kage
Summit.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:33.660
Do either of you know any places
where Mitsuki might, I don't
know, hang out?

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:34.595
Hmmm...

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:37.297
Wait, why don't you know that,
Boruto?

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:38.298
What?

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.736
You two guys are always
together. Isn't that something
you'd know better than us?

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:43.604
Hey!

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:49.476
Well, I guess you can be close
and still be mostly in the dark
about that sort of stuff.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.545
(SARADA) <i>We didn't find him</i>
<i>either!</i>

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.114
I'm also picking up a super
nervous vibe.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:57.885
I think that it'd be best if all
of us went home soon.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.221
Oh? Just what do you mean?

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.757
They told all the jonin they're
supposed to assemble in the
Hokage's Office.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.125
If that's the case...

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:08.729
then it's no wonder that all the
team missions were suddenly
cancelled...

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:12.065
I guess it's nice for us to get
a little break...

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.736
but the jonin wouldn't have been
called up without a reason,
right?

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:21.074
I tried asking Moegi Sensei what
was going on, but all that she
did was brush me off.

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:23.410
I don't like the sound of this.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.479
Dad and the others... They're
hiding something.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.649
Oh... I just remembered...

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:29.583
Hey!

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:32.386
Hold on! [groan]

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.289
This whole thing's turning into
a real drag...

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:41.395
Mitsuki's gone missing?!

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:42.596
What's going on?

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:48.769
Did something happen? We heard
about how all of the jonin were
ordered to assemble.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.606
No, it's just a meeting to go
over the Five Kage Summit.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.611
Back to Mitsuki... You haven't
heard anything? We can't find
him anywhere, ya know!

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.380
Well, you know how Mitsuki is.
It's probably nothing,

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:03.050
So what, you aren't worried at
all, Big Brother?

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:05.786
I'm sorry, but I've got to go
right now.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.055
Try to stay out of trouble,
okay?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.428
You catch that?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.599
Sure did. It seems Big
Brother Konohamaru is hiding
something, too.

00:08:23.604 --> 00:08:24.738
Huh? Who's there?!

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.276
Hm? Huh...

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:33.680
[chattering]

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:35.649
Just a little bit farther...

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:36.416
Shhh!

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.953
Most of the troops are already
on the move.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.189
So if it turns out to have been
an attack,

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:44.758
the Police Force won't be able
to handle it alone.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:48.829
They said, "an attack." What are
they talking about?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.764
I'm still just as confused.

00:08:57.804 --> 00:09:02.242
It appears that the medical
condition of the other chunin
has been stabilized.

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:05.812
I see... Well, I'm glad there's
at least some good news...

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:09.950
However... this is still a
direct provocation against the
Village.

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:11.885
It's been a while since that
happened.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:15.589
Is it possible that we could be
dealing with the Otsutsuki?

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:20.093
If that were the case, then I'm
sure Sasuke would've already
contacted us about it.

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:23.063
These days... the Five Kage are
all cooperating.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:27.134
But we haven't heard about any
unusual occurrences in the other
villages.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:28.569
Hm...

00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:31.405
Could this have been terrorists
or rebels?

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:35.843
We're continuing to investigate,
but without interrogating the
attackers...

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.644
it's difficult to
draw any conclusions.

00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:40.480
Since they only attacked the
guards at the gate...

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:43.183
there's no real way to ascertain
their true motives.

00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:47.821
[gasp]

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:48.822
<i>Who's there?!</i>

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:49.289
[gasps]

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:54.761
I return from a long trip, and
this is what I come back to,
Naruto?

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:56.763
(NARUTO) <i>Granny Tsunade!</i>

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:00.067
Lady Tsunade, the Fifth Hokage!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.369
Eh..! Ehhhh....

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:03.403
What's wrong?

00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:07.641
She always used to scold me when
I was a kid! Eh...!

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:10.911
And she's seriously scary when
she snaps! Ehhhh....!

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:14.248
Oh, man, what did you do back
then?!

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.484
Lady Tsunade! When did you get
back into the Village?

00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:21.655
Never mind all that. I heard
that a couple Leaf Shinobi were
attacked.

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:26.627
Yeah. Before dawn today. Someone
took down the chunin guards at
the gate.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.163
Naturally, I assume you're
investigating the situation?

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.598
[exhale and groan]

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:34.067
What's going on, here?!

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.569
Well, you see...

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.838
This was found at the site.

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:39.806
Hmmm... Is it one of the
chunin's?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.811
No. I wanted to confirm
something... that's why I
asked Konohamaru to be here.

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:48.048
Hm... This is... This is
Mitsuki's.

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:49.383
Mitsuki's?!

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.019
He's connected to the attack
somehow?!

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:56.757
As I thought... And no one's
seen him since this morning.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.059
Boruto said the same thing...

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:01.061
Were the attackers after
Mitsuki, then?

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:03.830
Seems like there was a good
chance of that.

00:11:03.864 --> 00:11:07.768
Considering who he is, it
wouldn't be strange for him to
be targeted.

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:11.705
Mitsuki? Who might that be?

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:18.378
That's right... I forgot; I
haven't told you about that yet,
Granny Tsunade... Hm?

00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:20.380
We're ready to start the
procedure.

00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:23.851
We'll have to explain
everything to her later, if
that's alright.

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:25.586
Let's get to the
medical department.

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.759
Ino's going to use her jutsu
now.

00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:36.496
She'll check the memories
of one of the chunin who was
attacked.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.635
It's because of the seriousness
of this situation, that we asked
you two advisors to sit in.

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:44.872
We'd like your input in order to
<i>decide how to proceed.</i>

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.708
To think you'd call the two of
us in...

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.643
What's going on?

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.812
Okay Ino... We leave it to you.

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:52.579
Right!

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:57.050
So this is really gonna help
uncover who took Mitsuki...?

00:11:57.084 --> 00:12:01.088
Considering the extent of their
injuries, it'd be dangerous to
dig too deep.

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:06.627
There's a hard limit. We can
only take a look at right before
he lost consciousness.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.764
Right. Well, that's fine. We
should still be able to discover
what happened.

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:12.165
Uh-huh.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:26.146
I've found it... I see images of
the incident.

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:31.151
[pained grunts and groans]

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.055
(MITSUKI) <i>Let's get out of here</i>
<i>now.</i>

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:41.695
[pained groans]

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:45.599
Mit...suki... [pained groans]

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:50.404
It can't be! No way...!

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:59.079
And then he ran toward the
setting moon. That's the
point when the memory cuts off.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.582
And you're sure? Absolutely
sure?

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:04.852
Yes.. I'm quite certain that he
wasn't taken.

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:06.520
He left on his own...

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:10.724
Is it a possibility that someone
was using a Transformation
Jutsu?

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:13.427
I suppose so, but for what
purpose?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.897
It seems as long as we
don't know where he is...

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.533
we have to assume that it was
indeed Mitsuki.

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:22.970
This entire thing's turning into
a serious drag.

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:25.706
What's up with all that?!

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:28.742
It's gotta be a mistake, ya
know?!

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:32.746
It's clear that if this
"Mitsuki" person is connected to
the assailants...

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:34.848
then we can't
just let him go.

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:37.084
Yeah... I know that.

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:39.086
Now, just hold on a minute...

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:43.924
Isn't it a little premature to
assume the only conclusion
is that Mitsuki's a traitor?

00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:48.061
I mean... he's not someone who'd
do something like this for no
reason.

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:56.670
I say that first we contact his
guardian. I believe that he's
from the Hidden Sound Village.

00:13:56.703 --> 00:13:58.639
From the Hidden Sound?!

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:03.076
We can contact him immediately.
We just have to tell his
"observer."

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:08.448
You mean that they've been under
observation even before this
incident, then?

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:13.353
Naruto! What exactly are you
hiding?

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:15.622
What's the meaning of this, Lord
Seventh?

00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:18.325
Konohamaru...

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:20.627
Mitsuki...

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.430
<i>...is Orochimaru's son.</i>

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:24.998
[gasps]

00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:30.170
Just what do you think you're up
to, Naruto?!

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:36.577
In the past, Orochimaru caused
the Hidden Leaf irreparable
harm!

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.580
You witnessed that with your
very own eyes!

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:43.584
I know... there's no way I'd
ever forget that...

00:14:43.617 --> 00:14:47.588
However, I accepted Mitsuki as a
fellow shinobi.

00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:48.589
But-

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:49.289
(NARUTO) <i>Besides--!</i>

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:53.293
Orochimaru doesn't have any
reason to make a move against us
right now.

00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:57.297
That may be so, but his moves
aren't always so rational.

00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:59.633
That's true...

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.503
but the data from Orochimaru's
research will be critical to the
whole Ninja World...

00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:06.073
...especially when it's time to
fight the Otsutsuki.

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:08.408
That's the reasoning for all of
this.

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:12.412
Alright, then what about
Mitsuki? Do you intend to just
let him go?

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:17.417
In any event, it should be quite
clear by now...

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:23.524
...Orochimaru's son is a danger
to the Leaf, perhaps just as
great a danger as his father.

00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:28.529
He's the son of the shinobi who
killed the Third Hokage, after
all.

00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:33.000
Isn't it common sense to think
he's dangerous to the Leaf, too?

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:40.607
(BORUTO) <i>Mitsuki isn't like</i>
<i>that!</i>

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:47.848
If we can't count on Dad and the
others, we'll just have to do
something ourselves!

00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:50.184
I really don't understand it...

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:51.985
Understand what?

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.423
All those memories Ino saw! They
couldn't have been lies or
illusions.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.525
You heard Big Brother
Konohamaru!

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:01.995
Mitsuki's not someone who'd do
something like this without a
reason.

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:06.667
Yeah, but we really didn't know
all that much about Mitsuki at
all, did we?

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.469
That's not true!

00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:12.606
I mean, we... didn't even know
anything about Mitsuki's parent,
ya know...?

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.076
You mean that Orochimaru guy?

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:21.081
I actually met him this one
time, but... He was doing all
this really weird research...

00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:23.584
He felt like someone to stay
away from...

00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:27.421
What's that got to do with all
this? Mitsuki's still Mitsuki!

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:30.924
Yeah but, when he heard that
Mitsuki's father was Orochimaru,

00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.094
Konohamaru Sensei was
really shocked.

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:36.463
<i>The others said he was</i>
<i>dangerous, too.</i>

00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:41.768
You must know deep down in your
heart, right? Don't you?

00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:45.439
That there's still a whole lot
that we don't know about
Mitsuki.

00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:48.976
But... Mitsuki's still our
friend, isn't he?

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.713
So if we don't have faith in him
now...

00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:55.015
...then who else will?!

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:57.451
I want to trust Mitsuki, too,
Boruto...

00:16:57.484 --> 00:16:57.985
Well then--!

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.888
But still!

00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:03.323
You and I are both shinobi,
right?

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:07.694
We have to set aside our
emotions...

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:11.098
and analyze every single
possibility there could be.

00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:13.634
Even if it's a friend who-

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:15.302
Who betrayed us? Is that it?

00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:22.843
Do what you want.

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.511
[gasp] Hey, wait!

00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:27.481
You can't just leave! We're not
done talking!

00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:31.185
Hey, Sarada...

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:32.619
What?

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.490
The Hokage you say you
wanna become...

00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:40.093
...is it just a shinobi with
amazing skills?

00:17:40.127 --> 00:17:43.163
I thought that you out of
everybody...

00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:45.766
would give Mitsuki the benefit
<i>of the doubt until the end.</i>

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.733
[gasp]

00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:48.168
Later.

00:17:51.972 --> 00:18:02.082
[chattering]

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:03.851
(SHIKADAI) <i>I heard about</i>
<i>Mitsuki.</i>

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:04.585
Hm..?

00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:07.654
Shikadai!

00:18:07.688 --> 00:18:11.925
The Village was just put on
maximum security emergency
alert. It's temporary, but...

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:15.696
...anyone leaving without
authorization will be treated as
a deserter.

00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:16.730
So Mitsuki's...?

00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:20.968
An official tracking team is
going to be formed to go after
him.

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:24.271
In the worst case as a criminal.

00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:24.605
[gasp]

00:18:25.472 --> 00:18:28.308
Why does everyone distrust
him?!

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:34.715
Hey!

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:37.284
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:41.321
I'll behave; I'm just tired. A
lot's happened today, ya know?

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.036
Mitsuki, where'd you go man?

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:02.442
[gasp]

00:19:03.677 --> 00:19:05.679
<i>Hey, that's Mitsuki's-!</i>

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:07.214
What's going on?!

00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:11.785
[gasp]

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.087
No way! I won't let you have it!

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:24.198
[heavy breathing and grunts]

00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:29.069
What was that?

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:30.404
(MITSUKI) <i>Boruto!</i>

00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:31.738
Huh?!

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:33.974
(MITSUKI) <i>Boruto... This is...</i>

00:19:34.842 --> 00:19:35.976
Hmmm...

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:38.045
(MITSUKI) <i>This is...</i>

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:40.447
<i>...my...</i>

00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:42.616
<i>...will.</i>

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.485
It's what? "My will?!"

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:50.624
What the hell is going on?!

00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:11.311
Mm! Sarada.

00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:22.689
Hey, is that...?

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:23.624
Huh?

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.629
I got a message from Mitsuki.

00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:30.097
[gasp] Yeah? And?

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.466
It said, "This is my will."

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.301
That's all.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.572
So, wait... does that mean he
left the village of his own free
will?

00:20:38.605 --> 00:20:43.410
Maybe. But there's no way to
know that for sure by just
staying here.

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:46.346
The way things are now, there's
no way...

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.482
...I just don't understand why
he left.

00:20:50.117 --> 00:20:55.522
Even though we were always
together, I didn't really
understand him at all.

00:20:55.556 --> 00:20:58.192
I didn't get that till he was
gone...

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.428
Yeah, you're right.

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:04.498
That's why I wanna see him
again. So that I...

00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:07.968
...can confirm what Mitsuki's
will is.

00:21:08.502 --> 00:21:09.469
[gasp]

00:21:09.503 --> 00:21:12.272
If you leave the village, then
this time...

00:21:12.306 --> 00:21:15.576
you're going to be the one
who's hunted by your friends.

00:21:15.609 --> 00:21:16.710
You get that?

00:21:16.743 --> 00:21:19.613
Yeah... but I've decided.

00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:23.317
I trust Mitsuki. Right now,
that's what my will is.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.422
[sigh]

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:31.291
<i>Let's take that snake to</i>
<i>Orochimaru's lab.</i>

00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:32.326
Uh..!

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:36.630
We can probably find out more
information there.

00:21:36.663 --> 00:21:40.801
[chuckle] Until we find out just
what Mitsuki's thinking, I'm
gonna keep you company.

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:45.272
What, really? You okay with
that? You're gonna be pursued,
too!

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.540
Eh...!

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:49.176
You and Mitsuki aren't the only
members of Team 7, remember?!

00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:53.714
I wanna know what Mitsuki's will
is, too!

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:55.415
Sarada...

00:21:55.449 --> 00:21:56.483
Besides...

00:21:58.285 --> 00:22:01.321
...if I just leave everything
up to you, who knows what kind
of trouble you'll end up in?

00:22:01.355 --> 00:22:02.322
Oh, shut up!

00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:46.860
(BORUTO) <i>Hey, about Mitsuki's</i>
<i>snake...</i>

00:23:46.894 --> 00:23:50.097
<i>Will we really find out more</i>
just by asking this Orochimaru
<i>guy?</i>

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.965
(SARADA) <i>Probably.</i>

00:23:51.999 --> 00:23:55.435
I have a feeling that asking him
<i>about the snake will be the</i>
<i>quickest route.</i>

00:23:55.469 --> 00:24:00.107
(BORUTO) Alright! Then as soon
as we learn something, we're
gonna go and look for Mitsuki!

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.843
(SARADA) <i>But Orochimaru conducts</i>
<i>some really questionable</i>
<i>research...</i>

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:07.848
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: "The
<i>Other Side of the Moon."</i>

00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:09.449
<i>Wait for us, Mitsuki!</i>
