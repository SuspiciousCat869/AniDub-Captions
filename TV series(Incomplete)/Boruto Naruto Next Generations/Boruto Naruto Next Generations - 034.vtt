WEBVTT

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.610
(BORUTO) <i>Damn it!</i>

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:16.517
Why do all of Shino Sensei's
lectures always have to end up
being so unbelievably long?!

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.287
I'm sorry I'm late! But no more
need to wait! Let's go to
Thunder Burger!

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:27.393
Quiet down! You don't always
have to be so loud, you know,
Boruto.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.697
Are you the only one here,
Sarada? Where is everyone?

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:33.967
I don't know. Maybe they all
went home or something.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.302
The Graduation exam's almost
here, so...

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:37.103
Huh?!

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.275
Man, I hate this kinda stuff!
When did everyone stop caring
about their friends, huh?

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:47.848
All of a sudden, everyone's so
serious about training. No one
wants to just hang out anymore!

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.818
I just don't get what the big
deal about graduation is, you
know?!

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:52.553
You listening?!

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.321
[sigh]

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.124
It must be nice, not having to
worry...

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.760
What do you mean by that?

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.395
(SARADA) <i>I'm not saying this</i>
<i>just to pick on you, but...</i>

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:07.400
Everybody else has a lot to deal
with right now. You probably
shouldn't bother them.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.107
But friendship is supposed to be
eternal, right?

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:16.743
Uh...

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.581
I think you might be the only
one who believes that...

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:24.585
Uh... huh? [sigh]

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:22.135
(CHO‐CHO) I <i>'m so</i>
<i>tired...!</i>

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:22.703
Huh?

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.307
Hey, guys! Over
here! Come sit!

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:29.142
Oh. Boruto.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.177
Huh? What? You're really all
alone?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.181
[chuckle] You guys just went
home after school without me,
huh?

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.483
Some friends all of
you turned out to be!

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.986
It wasn't like we
went home to relax.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.691
All of our moms have been
pushing us really hard lately.
We're exhausted.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.227
Oh, well, thanks for your hard
work!

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.898
Yeah, Inojin's right! I'm so
tired I can't even work up an
appetite!

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:53.967
[chewing] Mmmmm.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.138
Hey, so... wanna continue the
quest where we left off last
time?

00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.773
About our teamwork earlier...

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:02.609
Oh, yeah! I thought that it
went really well.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.878
Of course, It was all thanks to
me, right?

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.547
<i>You really should be more</i>
<i>grateful to me!</i>

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.581
(SHIKADAI) <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah...</i>

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.449
(INOJIN) <i>I was the one who lined</i>
<i>everything up!</i>

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.153
I think you might be the only
one who believes that...

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.156
[chattering and eating]

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.758
What's wrong, Boruto?

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.525
Ahhh!

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.727
Uhhh, when did you get here,
Mitsuki?!

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.530
(MITSUKI) [chuckle] When I found
you here, of course!

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:29.235
So, what's going on? I must say,
it's not like you to be in such
a preoccupied daze.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.538
Oh... It's nothing; nothing at
all!

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.539
Huh?

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:33.774
What's up?

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.210
Oh... It's that. Everyone likes
him, right?

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:37.944
Huh?

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:42.616
(KAGEMASA) <i>My eye binds</i>
everything and destroys the evil
<i>it sees.</i>

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:49.089
Hello, there! I'm Gongoro
Kamakura, but you might know me
as... Evil Jammer Kagemasa!

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.926
Today, I'm here to dine on the
elusive Eternal Carp!

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.227
That's Kagemasa?!

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.462
I remember that he'd
gotten really big,

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.999
but the news said
he'd successfully lost
all that weight.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:02.969
So he's successful because he
lost weight? Are you trying to
insult me?

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:05.572
(KAGEMASA) <i>...I'm going to go</i>
<i>ahead and dig right in!</i>

00:05:05.606 --> 00:05:08.642
[chewing] This is delicious!

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:13.246
I've never eaten anything like
it before! My chopsticks! I
can't stop my chopsticks!

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.681
Seriously?!

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:17.050
Wow, that fish really does look
yummy.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.520
That doesn't make sense‐ it's
just an oversized carp.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:22.088
Why would an enormous
fish taste so good?

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:27.293
I have heard of it before. It's
said that once you have it,
you'll remember it, eternally.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.996
That's why it's called the
"Eternal" Carp.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.467
Hmph! You guys aren't gonna fool
me with your words, you know!
Mmmm.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.469
Eternal... That sounds perfect!

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:41.642
I think we gotta go catch n' eat
this Eternal Carp! Let's make it
a thing and do it together!

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.310
We'll invite everyone in class
to come!

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.581
Aw, man what a drag... But
alright, what the heck.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:48.414
Mhm!

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.285
If it's as tasty as they say it
is, we should definitely check
it out!

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:52.919
Right?!

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:53.787
You, Mitsuki?

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.690
I'll certainly go. If you do,
Boruto.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.824
Alright!

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:58.859
Well, Cho‐Cho?

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.864
Wherever there's good food, I'll
always be there. Haven't you
figured that out by now?

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:07.701
[chuckle] I guess it was silly
of me to ask...

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.338
The Eternal Carp? Totally!

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:16.009
We stock 'em at the new
campsite that the Kaminarimon
Company opened.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.745
So if we go there, we'll be able
to eat that fish?

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.114
Yeah, except that you'll have to
catch it yourself.

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:21.582
[Excited gasp]

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:26.086
(DENKI) <i>They're being bred in a</i>
<i>hatchery on a trial basis and</i>
<i>released into the river.</i>

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.789
<i>But I have to warn you</i>
<i>they're hard to catch.</i>

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:32.125
I really don't think we'll have
any trouble catching a giant
fish!

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:35.028
So, let's go camping on our next
break from the Academy!

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:40.200
Leave it to me! That way, our
company can use you as market
research subjects!

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.803
There it is. Things rich kids
say...

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:44.337
No, I... [chuckle]

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.006
[laughing]

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.475
Alright, great! And I'm gonna
invite everyone else along, too!

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.445
The Eternal Carp, huh?

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.515
Hm... A camping trip?

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:58.251
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Come on, let's go, Sarada.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:02.455
Huh? Well... If you say so, I
guess...

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:06.459
Awesome! We'll go on our next
break, k? [chuckling]

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.129
<i>I'm gonna catch an Eternal</i>
<i>Carp for sure!</i>

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.768
(SHOP CLERK) <i>Thanks for coming</i>
<i>in!</i>

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.505
Okay, I think that ought to do
it.

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.374
The girls are in charge of
getting all the ingredients for
the curry,

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.544
so that's everything, then!

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:27.213
You sure are excited about this
trip. You up to something?

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:28.281
Huh?

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:30.150
Look, don't play dumb.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:34.755
You're not the type of guy to
take charge over tedious stuff
like all these details.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:35.956
Whatever...

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:42.495
Look... after we graduate, we're
all going our separate ways,
right? This is just...

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.631
...something for us to remember.

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:46.933
This whole thing is so unlike
you...

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:52.673
Would you stop with that
already? Anyway, next, I guess
we should go to...

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.440
Really? A camping trip?

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.243
That sounds so nice! Go and have
some fun!

00:07:57.277 --> 00:08:00.213
Okay, what's the deal here? How
come you're in such a good mood?

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:03.684
Well, I guess because this is
kinda like your very first
sleepover with friends.

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:08.555
Look, it's not as if I'm going
on this trip because I actually
want to. Mm?

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:14.160
C'mon, now... for someone about
to go off and have fun, you sure
don't look too excited.

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:15.629
Did something happen?

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.865
No, it's just that stupid
Boruto is so stupid.

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.568
[chuckle] Oh, Boruto again, huh?

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.003
What's that...?

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:27.541
Nothing. It's just that I always
used to say that kind of thing
about Naruto.

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.643
(SARADA) <i>What?! About Lord</i>
<i>Hokage?!</i>

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:33.213
(SAKURA) <i>To me, he's just plain</i>
<i>old Naruto.</i>

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:36.650
So... were you guys really good
friends back in the day?

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.619
[sigh] Yeah, kinda...

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:41.555
Maybe not all that much while we
were at the Academy.

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:45.291
But when we became a team, we
became more than family.

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:50.263
Huh? You mean that you can
actually become closer friends
after graduation?

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.798
Yeah, of course you can!

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.601
So is friendship really eternal?

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:56.436
Eternal?

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:59.372
Hmmm... I'm not sure about
that...

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:03.376
But the friends I made then are
still my closest friends now.

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:04.611
Huh...

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:11.317
You know... Boruto is Boruto.
But if you mistreated him you
still owe him a proper apology.

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:15.622
What?! That came out of nowhere!
I didn't do anything to him!

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:27.500
Ohhh wow! How great! It is huge!
It is the perfect place to do a
little training!

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:29.503
Uh, Metal, we came to relax...

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:33.273
I was worried that it was gonna
be wet from all the rain
yesterday.

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:35.676
Thank goodness it's not!

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:38.512
So all that we've got are
faucets and hook‐ups, huh?

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:40.313
That's what you get at a
campsite.

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:44.250
Ha! C'mon, let's get this
camping trip started for real!

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:04.170
Okay, that oughta do it.

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:06.540
Okay, so, okay, so‐ Yeah?!

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:08.408
Mhm. I'll take you there now.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.144
I can't wait to get started.
This is it.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.785
Woohoo! Let's go fishing!

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.888
It's a drag, but what the heck,
right?

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.891
To be honest, I actually like
doing this stuff.

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:28.895
[grunt] You better watch out,
Eternal Carp

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.903
I'm so hungry! [chewing]

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:40.707
There's nothing. Is this normal?

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:42.475
[groan]

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:44.978
(CAMPSITE MANAGER) <i>Oh! Denki!</i>

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:45.311
Huh?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.915
So what are all of you kids
doing over here at the
campground?

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:51.552
Hi, Mr. Caretaker! We're just
fishing.

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:53.286
I'm afraid there's no point
fishing here.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.989
It rained yesterday and the
waters have risen up...

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:59.593
so the Eternal Carp have
all taken refuge in the rocks.

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:00.160
Huh?!

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:03.429
It's hard enough to catch an
Eternal Carp.

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:06.600
And with this current, it's
practically impossible.

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:09.469
Isn't there something we can do
about it?!

00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:12.205
Well, if I was you, I'd just
give up!

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:18.244
Hm... So what now?

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:19.746
[grunt]

00:11:21.582 --> 00:11:22.482
Huh?!

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:23.249
A bite!

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:23.617
No way!

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.518
Ah!

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:28.088
[straining]

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:32.225
You idiot! Don't reel it in so
fast or the line's gonna break!

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:33.794
But I've almost got it!

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:39.332
[straining]

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.033
[gasp]

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:40.734
Ah!

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:42.202
[grunting]

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.405
What did I just say?

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:49.643
Did you see that thing,
Shikadai?! [grunt] I gotta try
again!

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:54.781
Listen, just forget it. Once
your line breaks, you've got no
chance. It's all over.

00:11:54.815 --> 00:12:01.622
But the fish was right there!
There's no way this is over yet!
Oh, just you wait, Eternal Carp!

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:06.359
(SHIKADAI) Yeah, yeah... But we
can't all just sit around being
hungry like this forever.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:10.396
(CHO‐CHO) Shikadai is right. I
mean, I'm practically withering
away to nothing, here!

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.166
(IWABE) Oh well... I guess we'd
better start a fire soon,

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:16.436
or we're gonna miss
out on having curry, too.

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:19.773
Huh?! Hey, just hold on for a
minute, you guys!

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:22.442
(DENKI) ThAT fish sure did put
up a tough fight, huh?

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:25.579
(SUMIRE KAKEI) Yeah, I'll bet
that it's the boss of the whole
river.

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:27.413
[sigh and groan]

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:32.519
(SUMIRE KAKEI) <i>Well, even so,</i>
<i>I'm still having fun!</i>

00:12:32.553 --> 00:12:34.621
(CHO‐CHO) Can we get the food
started already, guys?!

00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:36.256
(INOJIN) <i>Figures you'd say</i>
<i>that...</i>

00:12:39.693 --> 00:12:40.794
[chewing]

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:43.964
(CHO‐CHO) Mmm... Oh, wow! It's
so tasty!

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:48.669
[chewing] Iwabe, you're really
good at cooking! Mmm...

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:51.271
Every ninja needs to know how to
cook.

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:53.306
I see! Mmm...

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.842
Eat or talk. Please, just
choose one.

00:12:55.876 --> 00:13:00.914
You know, I was sure camping was
gonna be a drag, but it really
isn't bad at all!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.384
Once you took charge, Shikadai,
everything went smoothly.

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:08.088
(MITSUKI) I didn't think we'd
be having so much fun together,
either.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.657
(DENKI) <i>It's so awesome being</i>
<i>here with you guys!</i>

00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:14.561
(INOJIN) <i>You know, everyone's</i>
changed a lot just since classes
<i>started.</i>

00:13:14.595 --> 00:13:18.532
Do you actually think so? I
think I've always been the exact
same me!

00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:22.603
But, Cho‐Cho, you and I became
friends only after I transferred
into the Academy,

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:23.637
isn't that right?

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.305
Oh, yeah. I mean...

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.510
Hmmm... I guess I'm the kind of
trendsetter who changes everyone
around me!

00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:34.080
I don't know if I'd go quite
that far... What do you think,
Boruto?

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:36.482
Hm?

00:13:45.526 --> 00:13:47.093
What's wrong, Boruto?

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.897
I've gotta go, guys!

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.899
I'll be right back!

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:56.469
What's he up to this time?

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:59.873
I guess that he really must've
wanted to try the Eternal
Carp...

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:02.275
(INOJIN) <i>He must've caught your</i>
<i>gluttony, Cho‐Cho.</i>

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:05.979
(CHO‐CHO) <i>I knew it! See, I</i>
really am a trendsetter, after
<i>all!</i>

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.914
(INOJIN) <i>I was being</i>
<i>sarcastic...</i>

00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:10.116
[sigh]

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:22.295
Alright... This time it just has
to work.

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.364
(SUMIRE KAKEI) <i>There he is!</i>
<i>Boruto!</i>

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:29.135
Hey there. What are you two
doing here?

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.676
So what's up?

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:36.910
It's nothing really.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:46.152
(SARADA) Since when do you love
fishing so much anyway?

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:48.722
What? You have a problem with
fishing?

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:52.659
(SARADA) Listen... is what I
said before still bothering you?

00:14:52.693 --> 00:14:56.196
I think you might be the only
one who believes that...

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.297
[grunt]

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.034
I bet you think that something
as simple as all of us eating
Eternal Carp together

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.203
will create eternal friendships.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.871
No, I'm not thinking that at
all!.

00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:09.042
What's wrong with wanting
to eat something super tasty
with everyone?!

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:13.980
But I guess what you said
did bother me; I won't lie.

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:21.855
Look, I'm sorry... I went too
far, and said too much.

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:25.692
Well now this isn't like you!
What's gotten into you all of a
sudden?

00:15:25.726 --> 00:15:29.395
Oh be quiet! Do you always have
to have the last word?!

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:33.466
Well... you know, you actually
might be right about what you
said to me.

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:36.870
Trying to get what
you want to stay eternal just
isn't gonna be easy.

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:40.473
Hold on...! Are you only saying
all this because I backed down?

00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:43.677
Huh?! Isn't that what I'm
supposed to be saying here?

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.680
[chuckle] This is actually kinda
fun!

00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:48.982
You think this is fun?! Really?!

00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:51.451
I've never experienced anything
like this.

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:54.020
Oh...

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:58.959
I don't know about this eternal
stuff...

00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:04.030
But still... Thanks to you,
Boruto, I was able to change
myself.

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:09.035
And so... from now on... all of
you‐

00:16:10.203 --> 00:16:15.175
Ahhh... So anyway, I've decided
that I, uh...

00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:17.711
Ahhh... [grunt]

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:18.411
Boruto?!

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:25.051
That's him!! I'm absolutely sure
of it!

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:27.921
(BORUTO) [chuckling]

00:16:27.954 --> 00:16:29.122
Huh?

00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:31.257
That this is...

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:33.059
...the Eternal Carp?

00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:35.328

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.262

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:41.502
I can't hold him!

00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:45.506
[straining]

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:47.273
Don't give up now!

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:49.409
Don't worry, I got this!

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:52.513

I have made a decision!

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:58.351
I'm gonna become a shinobi with
all of you!

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:02.689

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:13.900
Huh?! It's what?!

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:15.736
Please, Nue!

(SUMIRE KAKEI) <i>Now that line is</i>
<i>unbreakable!</i>

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:31.552
A long time ago... my father
created this power in order to
curse the world...

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:34.921
It's a power that was made to
hurt people...

00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:37.524
But... Boruto, then you came and
taught me...

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:41.828
that I don't have to use it that
way and that I can be friends
with everyone!

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:46.733
You're damn right about that! We
wouldn't have a class if you
weren't in it, Class Rep!

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:50.604
Huh. I see... Who knew you had
something like this up your
sleeve!

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:53.907
Oh! I'm sorry that I kept it a
secret!

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.577
Well, then, I've gotta step it
up, too.

00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:01.014
Boruto, sync your movements with
mine, okay?

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:01.982
You got it!

00:18:02.015 --> 00:18:05.118
Ahhh!

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.655
Just a little more!

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:09.322

do whatever you want!

didn't tell us you were having
so much fun.

reason why...

I'll make sure to
catch it!

Alright, Cha! Damnit!

Ahhh!

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.035
This is your chance, Boruto.

00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:30.036
I'm on it!

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.563
Well, "eternally" might be
exaggerating a little bit. But
it's totally delicious.

Seriously thanks
for all this Boruto!

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:00.901
(IWABE) It was definitely worth
the effort to cook!

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.336
Hm.

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.706
What's wrong? Not hungry?

00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:08.575
Huh?!

00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:10.911
All of us caught this together.

00:20:10.944 --> 00:20:15.949
And I think that the teamwork we
showed tonight was nothing short
of amazing, don't you agree?

00:20:15.982 --> 00:20:19.553
Yes! Your Summoning Jutsu was
awesome, Class Rep!

(DENKI) Your Earth Style was
cool, too, Iwabe!

You know what my
mom said earlier?

She told me the friends
from her childhood are
still her best friends.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.143
I don't know if that's really
"eternal" or not, but...

We gotta come back here! It's so
awesome!

Well, I guess it wouldn't be
that bad once in a while.

00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:32.859

an even bigger fish!
