WEBVTT

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:10.210
(suspenseful music)

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.212
[Boruto] Did we make it?

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.815
Yeah, and when morning arrives,

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.717
the food supply
ship should be here.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.454
We just have to wait a little.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.457
This means we're going to
get out of Hozuki Castle.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.327
I owe you guys big time for
all your help, thanks Boruto.

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.830
(chuckles) Don't worry about it.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.066
-(lightning crashes)
-(explosion booms)

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.704
Shall we test your
luck one last time?

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.310
(Kokuri gasps)

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.181
No way, you're Tsukiyo!

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.084
There's a full moon out tonight.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:53.420
It's such a nice view to die by.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:04.298
-(opening theme music)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:32.452
-(opening theme music)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.031
So, that's Tsukiyo?

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:47.434
Yeah, he's the Mujina
Gang's second-in-command.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.069
Ah, the young lady.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.871
So, it seems that
you weren't actually

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.739
just a student reporter then,

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:56.543
and now finally we meet, Kokuri!

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:59.213
(Kokuri gasps)

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:01.215
You should've known
your luck runs out

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.617
when you desert the Mujina Gang.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.520
All that's left, is your death.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.023
-(shadow whirring)
-(Mitsuki grunts)

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:12.092
Shadow, how?

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.861
[Sarada] There's another
clan besides the Nara

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:16.096
that can control shadows?

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.765
(shadow swooshes)

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.168
Yes, this is my
moon shadow jutsu.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.738
Under a full moon, it can
manifest its utmost power.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.973
What?

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.610
Huh, you surprise me a bit.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:33.347
You really wanna take on the
four of us all by yourself?

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.316
Oh, no, we're quite
evenly matched.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:42.656
Now let me show you the essence
of the moon shadow jutsu.

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:46.760
(shadow whooshing)

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.463
(Boruto gasps)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.335
(Sarada gasps)

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.005
(Mitsuki gasps)

00:03:58.038 --> 00:04:01.241
(suspenseful music)

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.650
(Boruto grunting)

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.686
Boruto!

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.254
I had no idea there's a jutsu

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:16.557
that can clone somebody else.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.724
(Tsukiyo chuckles)

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.127
Come on! (yells)

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:25.098
(powers swooshing)

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.633
They're as strong as us.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.103
(grunts) Okay, then.

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:31.972
Fire style, fireball jutsu!

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:33.740
(fire whooshes)

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.542
Lightning style,
snake lightning!

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:37.544
(lightning crackles)

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:38.712
(explosions boom)

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.081
Even jutsu? No way!

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.883
I told you, right?

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.518
The light of the
full moon elevates

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.721
my moon shadow jutsu
to its utmost power.

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.628
You know, you guys
really are unlucky.

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.731
Boruto, that means-

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.533
I know, let's go.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.238
-(Sarada yelps)
-(Boruto grunts)

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.974
I already know what
you're gonna do, boy.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:10.210
-(shadow whooshes)
-(Kokuri grunts)

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:11.245
Kokuri!

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:13.280
-No!
-(shadow swooshes)

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.750
-I got it.
-(Mitsuki's arm whooshes)

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.653
(Kokuri coughing)

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.055
Aw, so close!

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.691
But I wonder for just how long

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:26.827
you'll be able to protect him?

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.997
(Sarada grunting)

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.765
(explosions booming)

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.300
We're done.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.104
Our luck escaping
has run out. (sobs)

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:43.243
(footsteps pattering)

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.213
(gasps) What's going on?

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:48.215
What's happening
at Hozuki Castle?

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.117
Well, whatever's going on here,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.719
we can't let a single
prisoner escape.

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:54.521
We'll mobilize and handle it.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.758
(shadow whooshes)

00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:58.959
(Boruto grunts)

00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:00.327
(Kokuri gasps)

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.628
(Kokuri wails)

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.163
Go, Kokuri, get out of here!

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:05.032
-(shadow whooshes)
-(Sarada grunts)

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:06.166
What now?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.335
At this rate, we'll be...

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.738
Hold on, the chakra for
the jutsu the shadows use,

00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:13.473
where's it come from?

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:17.444
If they use Tsukiyo's chakra,
then it can't be unlimited.

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:18.879
Let's find out!

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:20.614
-Rasengan!
-(powers whirring)

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.485
(powers crashing)

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:28.322
(Boruto yelling)

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:30.958
(powers whirring)

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:31.959
(Boruto grunts)

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.126
Boruto!

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.628
(groans) What's up?

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:36.363
My chakra's running out.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.298
And faster than normal, what?

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:42.135
Then maybe they're
actually using our chakra!

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.037
A wise observation!

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:47.641
(chakra whooshing)

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:51.144
That means the more we fight,

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:53.714
the faster that we'll
become exhausted?

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.416
Use all of the jutsu you want.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.518
(Boruto grunts)

00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.486
Fight your clones with all
the strength you've got.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.155
If you're lucky, I
might take you down

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.559
before you run out of
it and your chakra!

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.461
(Boruto grunts)

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:09.563
(Kokuri yelps)

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.499
(Kokuri panting)

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:13.734
(Boruto grunting)

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.135
(Kokuri screams)

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.705
(Kokuri and Boruto thud)

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.876
(shadow swooshes)

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.879
(grunts) Ow. You okay?

00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:29.283
(gasps) Boruto,
he's way too strong.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.386
Yeah, if there were
just some way...

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:38.425
-Here.
-Huh?

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.361
These are my notes about
the Mujina Gang's crimes

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:43.397
and secrets about the boss, too.

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:48.068
Hang onto it for me, just
in case he kills me, okay?

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:50.804
Hey, stop thinking that way.

00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:53.073
Don't give up after
coming this far.

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:55.108
When I learned I was
part of the Mujina Gang,

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.477
I got so scared
that I just ran away

00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:59.246
and I never took
any responsibility

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.548
for the crimes I had a part in.

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:04.751
All of that's probably
catching up to me now.

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:06.353
Look, if you have any regrets,

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:08.222
that's a good reason to survive

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:10.157
and testify about their crimes.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.993
But that's, (gasps)

00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:15.429
Go on, run!

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:18.031
Don't give up til
your very last breath!

00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:21.034
(Kokuri gasps)

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:22.636
I won't let you get him!

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:24.705
(Boruto grunts)

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:28.575
(Kokuri gasping)

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.950
(Boruto grunts)

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:38.352
(rocks clattering)

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:41.054
Fighting against yourself
is quite difficult.

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:47.194
-(alarm blaring)
-(metal clanking)

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.637
Oh! That's not good! (yelps)

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.608
Man, what a big
pain in the neck.

00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:04.444
Well, I guess I'll have
to wrap this up quickly.

00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:07.347
(Boruto grunting)

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:09.583
-(Boruto thuds)
-(Boruto gasping)

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.351
Boruto!

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:16.590
-(alarm blaring)
-(metal clanking)

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.461
Boruto!

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:23.597
(Tsukiyo groans)

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:25.732
Huh?

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:29.970
-(light airy music)
-(alarm blaring)

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:30.971
(Boruto grunting)

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:33.440
What happened there?

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:36.710
They're avoiding
the search lights.

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:39.079
Huh!

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:42.482
(electricity sizzling)

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:44.952
-[Guard] Huh? What is that?
-(shadow crackling)

00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:46.453
-(powers sizzling)
-(man yells)

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:48.522
Oh, maybe that jutsu...

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:53.393
I have to let Boruto
know, but that means...

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:57.431
(Boruto grunts)

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.334
(Kokuri whimpers)

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.705
(alarm blaring)

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:06.940
-(powers sizzling)
-(guard groans)

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:09.710
(alarm blaring)

00:10:12.246 --> 00:10:15.215
Hmm, that oughta do it.

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:18.552
Which means that your
luck's about to run out.

00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:19.520
(energy whirring)

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:21.421
-(Boruto grunts)
-(rocks clattering)

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:22.456
Uh, this is bad.

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:25.092
(fire whooshes)

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.228
They don't get
exhausted, but we do!

00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:30.731
They're doing all
this to protect me.

00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:32.199
But if this keeps up...

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:36.403
(Boruto grunting)

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.238
(gasps) It's true!

00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:40.307
I've just been a
burden all along.

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.710
(Boruto grunts)

00:10:43.744 --> 00:10:46.346
(Kokuri gasps)

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:50.083
(Boruto gasping)

00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:52.553
(shadow whooshing)

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:53.554
(Boruto grunts)

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:54.588
(Boruto thuds)

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:56.089
Kokuri!

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:58.425
Came out all on your
own to die, huh?

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.427
How commendable.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.461
(gasps) Oh no.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:03.564
(Sarada grunts)

00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:04.998
(Sarada yells)

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:08.068
(explosion booms)

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:15.809
[Boruto] Why'd you come back?

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:18.045
Listen very carefully.

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.681
[Tsukiyo] What are
they planning now?

00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:22.816
(footsteps pattering)

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.418
Found him, over there!

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.853
You're interrupting!

00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:28.121
-(shadow swooshing)
-(guard grunts)

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:31.992
-(guards grunting)
-(guards thud)

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.994
I understand.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.596
If it's true, then-

00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:36.730
Yeah, on it!

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:39.333
Thanks for this, Kokuri.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:41.969
I still don't know
if it'll work,

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:44.204
but I don't wanna just
sit here doing nothing

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.940
and end up dying
full of regrets.

00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:51.044
It's okay, because
luck's on our side.

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:54.448
(rock music)

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.557
What a nice moon for your last
night, wouldn't you say so?

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.359
No way, not at all.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.728
Lightning style,
snake lightning!

00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:09.997
(lightning swooshes)

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.699
You little brats just
don't learn, do you?

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:15.502
(lightning sizzles)

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:19.540
-(explosion booms)
-(energy swooshing)

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:20.841
A smokescreen?

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:23.977
(energy sizzling)

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.579
(Boruto thuds)

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:26.680
What the...

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.549
(shadow thuds)

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.717
(Boruto grunts)

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.486
(chuckles) This fight's over.

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:35.055
Why don't you just
give up already?

00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:37.758
Huh, where'd he go?

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:40.093
Ah, Kokuri.

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:42.462
(Boruto chuckles)

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:44.698
[Sarada] Over here.

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.733
What are you doing?

00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:48.402
(Sarada chuckles)

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.671
(Kokuri grunts)

00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:52.806
-Get him!
-(shadows whoosh)

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.541
Oh, no you don't!

00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:56.710
(shadow thuds)

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:59.446
(Kokuri grunting)

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:00.814
(rock music)

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:02.182
No way!

00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:06.954
(Kokuri screams)

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:11.391
-No!
-(shadows sizzling)

00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:12.726
Yes, we did it!

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:15.762
Shadows that are
created by moonlight-

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:19.099
Aren't able to exist in a
different kind of light.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:21.535
Your hunch was right, Kokuri.

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:22.769
(Tsukiyo growls)

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:23.837
(Boruto grunts)

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.973
You're not gonna
get another chance.

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:31.211
-(Tsukiyo grunts)
-(shadow sword swooshes)

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.347
-(Tsukiyo grunts)
-(sword crashes)

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.116
Moon shadow jutsu
isn't all I have.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.685
That sword isn't disappearing.

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:41.088
(Tsukiyo chuckles)

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:42.422
(earth crashes)

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:44.258
He's strong.

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.093
(Tsukiyo grunts)
(sword swooshes)

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:48.495
Don't take the
Mujina Gang lightly.

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:52.065
Getting rid of brats like you
is less than nothing to me.

00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:55.235
(Boruto panting)

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:59.072
I imagine you don't have very
much strength left by now.

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:01.608
Hmm, do you want to
test that theory out?

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:04.578
(Tsukiyo grunts)

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:05.812
Yeah.

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.514
But not just with me.

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:09.716
What I'm talking about
is the combined strength

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.718
of the three of us together.

00:14:11.752 --> 00:14:13.420
Go, Mitsuki!

00:14:13.453 --> 00:14:14.955
Got it.

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:16.089
-Sarada!
-(energy whooshing)

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:18.425
[Sarada] I see
what you're doing.

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:19.993
(energy whooshing)

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.562
(Sarada, Boruto,
and Mitsuki yelling)

00:14:21.595 --> 00:14:23.096
Now take this!

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.965
-(energy whooshes)
-(Tsukiyo grunts)

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.433
What the hell?

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:27.568
(Boruto yells)

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.937
(energy whooshing)

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.539
(Tsukiyo grunts)

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:35.075
(rock music)

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.947
Yeah, we did it.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.181
Nice.

00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:44.318
Boruto!

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:45.752
Ha!

00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:49.523
[Kokuri] Did you beat him?

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:53.493
[Boruto] Yeah, with
our combined strength.

00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:56.997
(chuckles) I hope that I was
a little bit useful at least.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.833
Of course, you were a big help.

00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:01.969
Even though I was desperate.

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.203
If you think you're done for

00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:05.239
and just try
everything that you can

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:07.808
then things actually
do work out.

00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:10.210
Come on, quit exaggerating.

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:16.450
(grunts)

00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:19.987
-Oh!
-Whoa!

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.221
(Kokuri yells)

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:28.462
(chuckles) I guess that luck
is still on my side here.

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:30.831
-(rocks cracking)
-(Mitsuki groans)

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:32.699
-(Kokuri yelling)
-(Mitsuki yelling)

00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:35.202
(water splashes)

00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:40.440
-Kokuri!
-(waves sloshing)

00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:45.212
-(Boruto gasps)
-No don't, you can't.

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.214
The current's far
too strong, Boruto.

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:49.550
There's no use jumping
in to find him.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:50.584
But, Kokuri!

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:54.988
(water sloshing)

00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:56.857
(Kokuri gasps)

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.091
Kokuri!

00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:01.395
(Kokuri panting)

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:04.198
I told you I was good
at swimming, didn't I?

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.534
And Tsukiyo?

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:10.204
It's okay, he sank.

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:12.339
I think he just ran
out of strength.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.509
I guess it's just like you said,

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.978
it seems luck really
was on our side.

00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:20.948
(Boruto chuckles)

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:22.583
Oh, there you are.

00:16:25.018 --> 00:16:26.553
Please, just wait.

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:27.821
Hear me out!

00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:29.056
They're here!

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.694
(Shinobi swooshing)

00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:35.596
Hidden Leaf Shinobi?

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:36.697
[Sai] Thank you.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.731
[Guard] Yes, sir.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.235
Mr. Sai!

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:43.070
Wait, what's going on here?

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:45.105
When we lost contact
with Lord Mujo,

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.473
Naruto became concerned.

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.475
He spoke to the Hidden
Grass's Feudal Lord

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:50.811
and got permission
to dispatch us.

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.347
[Sarada] And how's Lord Mujo?

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:55.315
Not to worry.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.187
Where am I?

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:05.225
Hold on, did I
lose consciousness?

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:07.561
Thank goodness.

00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:09.596
Wow, that's awesome, go Dad!

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.467
(rock music)

00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:19.106
But still, what a bold
prison break attempt.

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:21.842
Though, it was unnecessary.

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:24.611
Huh? Wait, what does that mean?

00:17:24.645 --> 00:17:28.081
[Sai] His prison sentence
had been extended unjustly.

00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:30.717
It actually ended long ago.

00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:32.119
[All] What?

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:34.955
Are you saying that I can
simply walk out of here

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:36.557
as a free man?

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.691
Wow, that's great.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.593
Although, it's
sort of a letdown.

00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:41.628
I feel kinda bad, sorry.

00:17:42.596 --> 00:17:44.198
Oh, wait, that's right.

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:46.567
Here are all the notes that
Kokuri managed to compile

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.601
about the Mujina Gang.

00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:50.470
But I guess it's probably faster

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:53.073
if you just tell him
yourself, Kokuri.

00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:55.475
Oh, yes, you're right.

00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:59.546
Receipt confirmed.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.581
[All] Right.

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:04.751
(upbeat music)

00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:14.094
I never want to go back
to that place again.

00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:17.698
Oh, I actually really
enjoyed living here.

00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:18.932
Quite a lot.

00:18:18.966 --> 00:18:21.568
Wait, are you being
serious with us right now?

00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:22.469
(stomach gurgles)

00:18:22.503 --> 00:18:23.837
Now that everything's
calmed down,

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:25.939
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:28.342
Once we're home, the
first thing I'm gonna do

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:30.210
is fill up on thunder burgers.

00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:32.212
You never change,
do you, Boruto?

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:34.948
[Sarada] Anyway, this means-

00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:37.484
[Boruto] Yeah, mission
accomplished, you know.

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:41.722
(rock music)

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.500
(rock music continues)

00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:05.946
Shojoji, huh?

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.183
So, that's the name of
the Mujina Gang's boss.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.752
According to this notebook,

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:15.122
he uses something known
as the Corpse Clone jutsu.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:17.591
A jutsu where he copies
the appearance and memories

00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:18.992
of someone he kills.

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:21.261
You're sure about this?

00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:24.731
Yes, everything's right
there in the notebook.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.039
(bright music)

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.608
Oh man, I ate it so much.

00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:38.078
There's just nothing quite
like the food on the outside.

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:41.348
What? Guess Hozuki Castle
really changed you.

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:44.251
Hey, congrats on
your mission, Boruto.

00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:47.554
(chuckles) I got
more street cred now.

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:48.956
Come on, give me a break.

00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:51.091
You were only there one week.

00:19:51.124 --> 00:19:52.960
Although, I gotta
say even a week

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:54.828
would've been way
too long for me.

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:56.063
I just don't know what I'd do

00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:58.265
if I couldn't eat whatever
I want when I want.

00:19:58.298 --> 00:20:02.369
I bet right now, Kokuri is
enjoying his newfound freedom.

00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:05.072
The rumor is that he
went on a long journey

00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:08.375
so that he could evade any
pursuers from the Mujina Gang.

00:20:08.408 --> 00:20:10.344
Apparently he's going
to change his name

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.312
and go start a whole new life.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.381
I see.

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:16.984
Well, I wish I could've
said goodbye before he left.

00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:18.218
Oh, well.

00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:25.759
-(train whistle toots)
-(train engine humming)

00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:34.301
(footsteps tapping)

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:41.742
-Huh?
-(footsteps tapping)

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:51.218
-Ah, it's you, Kokuri.
-(knife clangs)

00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:56.089
You've got some nerve
coming back here.

00:20:56.123 --> 00:20:59.459
You fool, it's me, damn it.

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:05.098
Huh? No way, you're the boss?

00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:06.500
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:09.703
Your one and only boss,
Shojoji, is back now.

00:21:10.971 --> 00:21:13.073
But, when you were captured,

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.576
didn't you transform
into Mr. Tsukiyo

00:21:15.609 --> 00:21:16.944
to hide your identity?

00:21:16.977 --> 00:21:20.480
There was a little accident
and I had no choice,

00:21:20.514 --> 00:21:23.050
but to switch to
this guy in a hurry.

00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:27.187
(suspenseful music)

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.493
(water gurgling)

00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:37.364
Although, at least I managed
to get rid of the traitor.

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.499
The Hidden Leaf did end up

00:21:39.533 --> 00:21:42.469
learning about the Mujina
Gang and my jutsu, as well.

00:21:42.503 --> 00:21:46.440
But that can't be
helped. (slurps)

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.574
Whatever.

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:52.179
(Tsukiyo squelching)

00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:03.724
Ah, I'm certain luck will
smile upon me again soon.

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:18.338
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.123
(rock music)

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:44.958
[Sarada] We're letting
the thieves we're after

00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:47.828
escape and rejoin the rest
of their gang, got it?

00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:49.363
Hey, are you listening, Boruto?

00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:50.964
[Boruto] Oh, right, I'm sorry.

00:23:50.998 --> 00:23:52.566
We just have to
catch them, right?

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.500
This'll be easy!

00:23:53.534 --> 00:23:55.202
[Sarada] We're
letting them escape!

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:56.670
We're in the middle
of a mission.

00:23:56.703 --> 00:23:58.071
Could you please focus?

00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:01.074
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:03.076
a new mission.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.945
I don't care what this
mark on my palm is.

00:24:04.978 --> 00:24:06.847
I just gotta complete my mission

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.749
and become an amazing shinobi!

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:16.590
(closing theme music)
