WEBVTT

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.878
Good luck! Do your best, Big
Brother!

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:13.647
Just stay calm when you're
taking the test.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.352
As long as you haven't forgotten
everything you've learned up to
now, I know you'll pass!

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:19.553
Yeah! I know!

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:21.655
Uhh...

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.130
It's only for... just in case...

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.537
Okay, I'm out of here, you guys!

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.971
Good luck! You'll do great!

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.740
Heh!

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:26.313
Oh! There they are!

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:28.148
Hey, guys!

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.450
[chuckle]

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:33.887
Huh, you sure look like you're
ready to go!

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:34.988
Yeah, what happened?

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.393
Not long ago, you sounded like
Shikadai, saying this was gonna
be a drag...

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:43.564
Yeah! Right? I have no idea
what caused him to change his
mind!

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:47.868
Heh! Like I told you! I'm gonna
show everyone the results of my
training!

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.737
It looks like everyone else is
here now, too.

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:51.772
What's up!

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:53.040
Let's do our best!

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:55.442
[nervous groans] Oh, I am so
nervous!

00:02:56.076 --> 00:03:00.647
[chewing and blowing]

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.951
None of them seem like they're
very eager to do this...

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:07.120
You can't really tell just by
looking at 'em.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:09.723
(NAMIDA) <i>Oh! Those three guys</i>
<i>all look identical!</i>

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:13.961
Yeah. Those guys are from the
Hidden Mist Village. Their names
are...

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:18.265
Takanami, Sazanami and Makinami
<i>Senka...</i>

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:21.935
They're triplets, huh? I wonder
what kind of jutsu they use...

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.939
Tell me, Iwabe... which of the
teams do you think is the
strongest?

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:27.274
Well, let's see...

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:29.443
Mm?!

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.284
[quivered grunt]

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.753
If I had to pick one...

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.991
those guys look like they might
have some real strength hidden
up their sleeves.

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:47.127
They might end up being our
biggest rivals.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.830
They're from the Hidden Stone.
The Genbu Shinobi Trio!

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:53.133
Their background and the jutsu
they use are a total mystery...

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.802
Huhhh?! Those guys look
super strong to me!

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.572
Do we even have a chance, at
all...?!

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.240
[chuckle] Hey, calm down!

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:00.741
Hmmm?

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.913
Just look at 'em! Compared to
the enemies we've had to go
up against before now...

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:08.015
those guys are nothing to worry
about!

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:10.751
Ugh, look at him... He gets so
carried away!

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:13.754
So that's Boruto Uzumaki.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:19.626
The son of Seventh Hokage Naruto
Uzumaki, who defeated Father in
<i>the past...</i>

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.929
Hey, what's the matter, Shinki?

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:26.033
It's nothing. Come on, the
opening ceremony's about to
begin.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.904
[chattering]

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:34.308
Quiet down! Looks like everyone
is here.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:39.279
Alright, then... We'll now begin
the first Chunin Exams of the
Five Allied Villages.

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:43.984
As all of you are aware...

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:49.056
this is the first Chunin Exams
in history sponsored jointly by
all five villages.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:54.094
<i>The Hidden Leaf. The Hidden</i>
<i>Cloud. The Hidden Mist. The</i>
<i>Hidden Stone.</i>

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.629
<i>And the Hidden Sand.</i>

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.631
Right here and now...

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:02.569
you're all being given the rare
opportunity to battle against
ninja from other villages.

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:06.874
It's your chance to use the
jutsu you're most proud of to
their fullest extent!

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:08.876
[chewing]

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:09.610
[annoyed grunt]

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.714
<i>Good grief. An event this</i>
important, and none of them seem
<i>motivated!</i>

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:15.315
<i>Are they even gonna</i>
<i>try?</i>

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:20.554
Everyone! Remember to freely
demonstrate the fruits of your
training!

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:21.321
[cheers]

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:22.089
Alright!

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.295
The first round is gonna begin
promptly at noon over at Exam
Venue A.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:33.667
So until then, the time is all
yours. You can use it as you see
fit.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.736
I suggest you rest or train!

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:36.970
Dismissed!

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:38.405
[chattering]

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:42.376
Okay, two Chunin Exam Cheer
burger combos, right?

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.879
[exasperated sigh] Really?
Burgers again? On a day like
this?

00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:47.781
[chewing and swallowing]

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:51.285
Well, they say you can't wage a
war when you're hungry!

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:54.922
Well, there's still time until
the first exam, I guess...

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.391
This can just be our strategy
meeting.

00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:59.893
Um, yeah, okay, sure. But
Mitsuki's late...

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:01.595
I wonder what he's doing...

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.997
Mm?!

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.266
It's those guys from the opening
<i>ceremony...</i>

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.401
Huh? Hmph!

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:11.071
Uh..? [aggrivated grunt]

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.874
Hey, sorry but couldya move
somewhere else?

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:14.274
Huh?!

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.046
Well, there are only two of you
sittin' here. But there are
three in our group.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:24.384
The bigger party should get to
sit in the booth. I mean, it
just makes sense, doesn't it?

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:28.055
We have three people in our
group, too. One of us just isn't
here yet.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.957
Too bad. That isn't our problem.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.759
Yeah, it's his own fault for
being too slow.

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:37.264
Alright, there you have it! So
now that you understand, get up
and get lost.

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:40.801
There's just no way you can be a
ninja if you're as slow as that!

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:41.568
What?!

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.572
No, don't Boruto! Don't make
trouble before the exams.

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:46.607
Boruto?

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:51.445
Oh, I see! So you're the son of
the Seventh Hokage, huh?

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:57.251
I was wondering how good a ninja
you were. But who woulda thought
<i>you'd be such a weakling?</i>

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:58.051
Why you--!

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:02.356
[chuckle] Huh...? Ehhhh!

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:05.826
That seat is mine, I'm afraid.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.661
Oh, yeah? And who are you?!

00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:22.376
Hey! Why you staring at me,
huh...? [snarl]

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.246
Boruto, why are these three
guys-? Uh... huh?

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.147
Huh?!

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:29.550
I can't move!

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:30.817
Hey- what the...!

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.152
What's going on?!

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:33.620
Ahhh!

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:37.591
That's enough.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.626
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.028
What's with the cape?

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.765
What's the point of you two
fighting in here?

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:45.766
[uncomfortable grunt]

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:46.967
[grunt]

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:53.707
Well, anyway, our third member's
here now. I'm sure you can find
other seats.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.976
Hm. Yeah, whatever.

00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:57.678
[chattering]

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:00.747
But this isn't over. We'll see
you in the Exams.

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:03.483
Hmph!

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:07.054
Um... thanks! You were a big
help.

00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:11.792
Yeah, sure. Don't worry about
it. Thta's just the kind of
person that Shinki is.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:12.759
Let's go.

00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:13.627
Right!

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.868
Shinki, huh? Who is that guy
anyway?

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:24.371
[stuttered grunt] Oh, uh... Ah!
Here...

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:29.042
Let me see... Shinki, from the
Hidden Sand Village. [gasp]

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:31.712
<i>He's the adopted son of the</i>
<i>Fifth Kazekage!</i>

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:32.479
[gasp]

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:37.918
One of the Five Kage's sons...
That means he's just like you,
Boruto.

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:41.288
Kazekage, huh...? So that's
him...

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:46.760
[chattering]

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:47.794
Boruto!

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.063
Mm? Oh!

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:52.065
(SARADA) <i>Lord Mizukage!</i>

00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:55.969
It's been a while! Thank you
again for the last time!

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:57.938
I wanted to bring Kagura
along...

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:02.376
...but I left him in charge of
the Hidden Mist Village while
I'm away.

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:03.076
Oh, I see.

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:06.813
But I have brought a message
from him with me.

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:11.752
He told me to tell you that he's
looking forward to seeing you
again as a fellow chunin.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.420
That's what he wanted to say.

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:14.454
He said that?!

00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:19.293
(CHOJURO) <i>He's been training</i>
hard every single day so that he
<i>can become my successor.</i>

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.400
Oh, yeah? So, he's doing his
best, too!

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:31.471
Yes, and you'll have to do the
same! The guys from my village
are all pretty strong, too...

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:31.972
you know!

00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:36.777
Those are the Senka Triplets
from the Hidden Mist...

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.013
I suppose defeating all of them
isn't going to be easy...

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:50.457
That's just fine by me. Whoever
I go up against, no way am I
gonna lose!

00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:56.263
(DARUI) <i>Hey, Tsuchikage!</i>

00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:56.997
Hm?

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:01.935
It appears that you're awfully
eager to watch the first round
of the Chunin Exams!

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:04.104
[chuckle] I could say the same
to you.

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:07.541
Well... it is the Five Villages'
first joint exam ever!

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:10.377
[chuckle] I wonder...

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.046
...just how many genin will be
worth watching this time, do you
think?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.384
It really is nice that we're at
peace these days, but because of
that...

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:19.720
the number of chunin has
gone way down.

00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:23.924
We need the new blood that we
hope is gonna emerge from these
Exams.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.626
By the way, where's Gaara?

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:29.863
Isn't the Kazekage going to
come? The Exams are just about
to begin!

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:32.666
He should be on his way right
about now.

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:34.434
Oh, we're all here, I see.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.070
It's just about to get going.

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:42.709
Okay... Everyone seems to be
here...

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:46.446
So now I'll explain what the
first round of these Exams
entails.

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:49.316
Round One will be...

00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:52.753
[chewing]

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.294
...a true or false quiz.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.134
Huh?!

00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:10.137
Huh?!

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:15.409
[confused chattering]

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:16.643
It's... a quiz?!

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:22.850
(SAI) <i>The question will be</i>
revealed at Exam Venue B, twenty
<i>kilometers from here.</i>

00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:28.755
Any genin who aren't there after
one hour has elapsed on this
stopwatch will be disqualified.

00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:29.156
[chattering]

00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:33.093
And furthermore, various traps
have been laid along the way.

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:36.830
If you get caught up and can't
<i>go further, you'll also be</i>
<i>disqulaified.</i>

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:37.664
Boruto! Look there!

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:42.402
Only participants who arrive at
Venue B within the time allotted
will be allowed to take the...

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.304
Wait, the stopwatch is already
moving!

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:44.972
Let's go!

00:11:46.607 --> 00:11:49.076
<i>true or false quiz, so please</i>
make sure you pay attention to
<i>the time.</i>

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:52.312
Any team that's late, even by
<i>a second, will be-</i>

00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:54.348
[shouting]

00:11:57.618 --> 00:12:00.954
Oh... But I wasn't done
explaining yet...

00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:06.026
Of course, the explanation
itself was trap. If they'd
listened till the end of it...

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.961
they wouldn't have gotten
there in time.

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:10.664
At least they figured that much
out.

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:13.700
As expected. This year's
entrants are an elite group.

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.335
Yes, I should hope so.

00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:21.475
Oh, man... This is the first
joint exams in all of history...

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:25.812
And Sai... sure isn't gonna make
it easy on them...

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:28.949
[heavy breathing and shouting]

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.617
[grunt]

00:12:30.651 --> 00:12:33.820
This is an exam, but it's also a
serious battle.

00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:36.156
I won't be going easy on you!

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.324
Whoah!

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:38.825
[gasp] Ahhh!

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:39.560
[pained grunt]

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.397
These must be the traps they
laid! Be careful moving forward!

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:44.631
Ahhh!

00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:45.499
Wahhh!

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:47.968
[pained grunt]

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:50.737
Ahhh!

00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:51.471
Ahhh!

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.443
Seems the time's come to show
them what we're made of.

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:58.445
The Genbu Trio's ultimate
technique!

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:02.182
Ninja Art! Genbu Winter Wind
Emperor Formation!

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:05.152
<i>Number One Hundred Eight!</i>
<i>Release!</i>

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:08.755
Respond to my name and manifest,
jet black-!

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.157
Whahhhh!

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.193
[pained grunts and groans]

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.495
[gasps]

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:25.572
[pained grunts and groans]

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:25.973
[gasp]

00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:29.109
Too bad. We never got to see...
their ultimate technique.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.412
What was it that he was saying
at the end, there?

00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:32.646
[gasps]

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:37.184
[gasp] L-Let's go! Nothing much
to say to losers like that...

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:39.286
[embarrassed sigh]

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.787
So uncool...

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:41.989
Why, those three little...!

00:13:43.757 --> 00:13:46.026
When they get home, they're
gonna start training again from
scratch! I'll see to that...

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:46.460
personally!

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:57.604
[chuckle] These traps are
nothing! They sure aren't worth
wasting this...

00:13:58.105 --> 00:14:00.607
Hm! Not bad at all!

00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:01.642
Alright, how about this?

00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:11.952
Try not to use your jutsu here.

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:15.622
There's no need for us to reveal
our skills to the enemy just
yet.

00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:15.989
Right!

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:16.557
You got it...

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:18.659
[grunt]

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:20.327
[grunt]

00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:28.368
[spitting]

00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:32.606
[spitting]

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.112
Heh! That was too easy!

00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:41.682
And I still have more tricks up
<i>my sleeve!</i>

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:49.556
Sazanami, Makinami,. Let's go!

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.591
Yes, Elder Brother.

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:51.658
I'm always ready!

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:53.360
[grunt]

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:56.063
[grunts]

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:11.778
[grunts and heavy breathing]

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:14.781
[chattering and heavy breathing]

00:15:14.815 --> 00:15:16.950
We took too long to get over
here...

00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:19.686
We made it with about five
minutes to spare.

00:15:22.823 --> 00:15:26.126
Damn it... Look at them, acting
like it's no big deal...

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:30.297
Huh... There are more than I
expected.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.901
Still, it's in the range of what
we anticipated. Well...
anyway...

00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:36.436
the real exam is about to get
started now.

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:46.914
Each team of three will go stand
together on the side which they
believe holds the banner with

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:48.582
the coreect answer on it.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.618
Oh! So, there actually is a true
or false quiz!

00:15:51.652 --> 00:15:54.888
Boy, they sure prepared some
elaborate steps for this Exam...

00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:56.823
Answer wrong, and pay the price,
namely...

00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:59.793
...those who turn black will
fail.

00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:01.028
Turn black?

00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:03.030
The question is...!

00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:08.502
In Volume 5 of the "Shinobi
Strategist Detective Story", the
following passwords appear:...

00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:13.574
Moon is day. Mountain is river.
Flower is nectar. True or false?

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:14.675
[confused chattering]

00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.410
How am I supposed to know that?!

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.312
Ahhh! Wait, what were they
again?!

00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:20.914
The three passwords? Boy, I
really don't remember them...

00:16:20.948 --> 00:16:21.915
Uhhh...?

00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:22.482
Mmmmm....

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.785
[confused chattering]

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.287
Hey, Sarada, do you know that
book?

00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:28.021
Sort of...

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.460
Except the thing is, that series
has several volumes, and I've
only read up to the fourth one.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.730
I didn't even know that there
was a fifth one.

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:37.731
What about you, Mitsuki?

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:40.200
[disappointed sigh]

00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:44.338
I guess we're just gonna have to
go by instinct, then...

00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:46.707
<i>This won't be much use on a</i>
<i>quiz...</i>

00:16:49.543 --> 00:16:50.511
Hm.

00:16:50.544 --> 00:16:51.311
Hm!

00:16:53.247 --> 00:16:57.284
Damn it! We have to hurry up and
decide or we're gonna fail!

00:16:57.317 --> 00:17:00.754
Boruto, which answer do you
think my dad would choose?

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:02.623
Why'd you ask that?

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:04.958
Just tell me what you think.

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:08.629
Mmmm... I feel like he'd answer
false.

00:17:08.662 --> 00:17:11.832
[chuckle] I just don't think
he's the obedient type!

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.434
I agree... I think he'd say that
too.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:21.275
I'll become Hokage by choosing a
different path than my dad!

00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:21.909
Uh...

00:17:21.942 --> 00:17:23.744
Then, we pick true?

00:17:23.777 --> 00:17:28.015
Mhm! Are you guys willing to go
along with the answer I've
chosen?

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:32.619
Yeah, this is fun! Thinking
about it too much won't get us
anywhere.

00:17:32.653 --> 00:17:34.321
So let's take a gamble,
Sarada!

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:35.322
Mm!

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:46.667
Your time's up!

00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:49.169
The answer is...

00:17:54.608 --> 00:17:55.475
[gasps]

00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:58.779
Ahhh!

00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:01.081
(ARAYA) <i>Ink! It's a pool of ink!</i>

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:03.183
Did...did we just fail?

00:18:04.818 --> 00:18:06.486
<i>Damn it... already?!</i>

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:09.022
Is this really it...?!

00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:12.392
[gasp]

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:18.999
They failed over there too?! So
<i>the right answer is--?!</i>

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:21.468
...those who turn black will
fail.

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.170
[gasp] Mitsuki!

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:24.037
Right!

00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:27.307
Boruto!

00:18:27.341 --> 00:18:30.077
Huh? [grunt] Hm?

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.179
Mm? Oh, so that's it!

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:33.981
Whoah!

00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:35.315
[gasps for air]

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.486
[relieved sigh] We barely made
it.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.057
[chewing]

00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:50.664
Oh, I get it...

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:54.301
It probably didn't matter if we
chose "true" or "false"...

00:18:56.136 --> 00:19:00.207
The question was a sham right
from the start! There was never
really a fifth volume at all!

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.710
Now it makes sense. "...those
who turn black wil fail".

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:05.078
Those were his exact words...

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:08.615
So if you don't touch the ink,
you'll be okay.

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:13.954
Heh! You pass if you didn't fall
into the pool of ink! So that's
what he meant, huh?

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:17.591
So like dad... an awkward and
oblivious test...

00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:18.025
[chattering]

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:18.659
[exasperated sigh]

00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:20.327
Precisely right!

00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:27.634
You see... if you realized your
mistake above the pool of ink
<i>and then just gave up...</i>

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:32.172
...and let the ink stain you,
<i>you don't deserve to be a</i>
<i>chunin.</i>

00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:33.974
[sigh]

00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:40.981
(SAI) The real purpose was to
see the answer you were forced
to find after being put into a

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:41.648
<i>difficult situation.</i>

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.051
...whether you'd give up or not.

00:19:45.686 --> 00:19:49.089
Those who avoided the ink
answered correctly.

00:19:49.122 --> 00:19:52.659
The Chunin Exams' Round One has
now ended!

00:19:58.165 --> 00:20:01.468
Round Two is in three days. Let
us do our best!

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:04.738
Of course we will! We'll pass
the next one, no doubt!

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:05.472
<i>Right, Boruto?</i>

00:20:05.772 --> 00:20:06.640
Uh...!

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:09.943
Oh! Yeah! You'd better we
believe we will!

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:12.012
(YURUI) [chuckle] <i>You sure do</i>
<i>talk big.</i>

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.017
Without both your teammates, you
woulda been completely helpless!

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.185
What's that?!

00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:22.589
Hey, Shinki! Something wrong?

00:20:22.623 --> 00:20:23.657
No, it's nothing.

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:29.796
Yeah... it seems that he didn't
have a chance to use it this
time.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.534
Yes, I believe that you're
right. If he's going to use
it...

00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:36.970
then it should be on a bigger
stage than this one...

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:45.779
Well, it seems that Boruto's
team has made it through Round
One.

00:20:45.812 --> 00:20:46.647
I see.

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:50.984
Maybe you should give him a pep
talk or something!

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:55.322
Yeah.

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:07.234
Hey, Big Brother! Dinner's all
ready!

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:10.671
I bet he's exhausted. Let's just
let him get some sleep.

00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:11.638
Mhm.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:17.644
Mm?

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:24.117
[gasp]

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:30.691
(NARUTO) <i>Congratulations on</i>
passing the first round. Good
<i>luck on the next one. Dad.</i>

00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:33.427
He sent an email...?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.496
He didn't even send a Shadow
Clone? Stupid old man...

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.171
Hm.

00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:53.647
[grunted sigh]

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.021
You just watch...

00:22:02.256 --> 00:22:04.791
I'll definitely show you what I
can do in the second round!

00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:07.995
No matter what, I'm gonna make
sure you acknowledge me!

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:46.226
(SARADA) <i>If we're going to show</i>
<i>Lord Seventh how strong we</i>

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.795
we have to make it through this

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:53.734
