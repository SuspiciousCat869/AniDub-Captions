00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.978
[Sakura And Sarada]
Thank you for the food!

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.112
(dishes clattering)

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.447
(water splashing)

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.481
[Sakura] Oh, thanks!

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.950
Today's the day of
our new holiday!

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.785
It's Family Day!

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:20.354
So, everyone, get
out there together

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.089
and have a great time, you know!

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.291
[Sakura] I'm sorry, Sarada.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.425
[Sarada] Hm?

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:28.328
Well, the thing is, I
have to go work today,

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.497
but I'm thinking I
can be home by dinner.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.633
(chuckling) Oh, Mom,
we don't need to worry

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.967
about that sorta thing.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:34.968
Dad's gone, too!

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.337
(Sakura sighing)

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.174
Also, I promised Boruto
that I'd help him

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.009
with shuriken training today.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:43.944
[Sakura] Hm?

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:47.080
(gentle peaceful music)

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.922
I wonder where he is
now, and what he's doing.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:58.992
(people chattering excitedly)

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.095
[Girl] Over here, Daddy!

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.301
C'mon, let's go! (giggling)

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:08.836
Mr. Sasuke!

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.070
(Sasuke grunting)

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:14.575
(Boruto chuckling)

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.344
Boruto, do you know
what's going on here?

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.314
Everybody seems to be
out with their families.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:21.315
Huh?

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.717
But isn't that the
reason why you came home?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.919
I mean, today's Family Day.

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:27.154
[Sasuke] What's that?

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.791
It's a new holiday they
say will deepen the bonds

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.826
between parents and kids.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.429
So why aren't you
with Naruto then?

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.631
Oh, uh, right about
now, Dad should be

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:40.968
taking Himawari around
and having fun with her.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.269
Oh, right!

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.005
Sarada should be at the
training grounds around now

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.140
I see.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.643
There's a whole lotta
stuff going on here today,

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:53.780
like festival booths and events
like an eating contest, too!

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:57.351
Why don't you take Sarada around
and have some fun together?

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:58.151
[Sasuke] Yeah.

00:01:58.185 --> 00:01:59.753
(chuckling) See ya!

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.158

would be like Itachi?

Dad?

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:11.411
(chuckling) So,
you're back home?

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:12.613
Since when?

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.581
[Sasuke] Just a bit ago.

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:16.950
But what are you doing here?

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:20.420
Boruto told me that
you'd be out here.

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:21.455
Boruto did?

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.924
(Sarada chuckling)

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.225
So are you training?

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:29.463
Uh, well, um, actually...

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:33.500
Wanna check out the festival?

-(bright upbeat music)

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:48.148
You know, I really
wasn't expecting you

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.250
to come home today, Dad!

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:51.051
No?

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.920
(Sarada chuckling)

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:53.954
Today is-

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:55.422
I just happened
to have some work

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.292
that brought me near the
village, so I stopped by.

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.761
Uh, oh, I see.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.567
(Sasuke grunting)

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.936
[Girl] Daddy, please
can you get me one?

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.237
They look so tasty!

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.038
Please?

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:12.739
(chuckling) Do I have a choice?

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:13.740
(girl chuckling)

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:14.741
One please.

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:15.943
Sure thing!

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:16.944
Yay, thanks!

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:18.745
You're the best, Daddy!

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.147
How nice!

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.415
[Sasuke] Want one?

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:22.850
Huh?

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:25.152
Do you want one too?

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:27.821
[Sarada] It's okay,
not right now.

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:29.756
Don't be so shy.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.425
The candy is red.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:32.426
Huh?

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:33.961
So what if it's red?

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:36.930
It's just like your
glasses and outfit.

00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:38.498
You like red, don't you?

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:40.934
Well, I mean, I
don't hate it, but-

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:43.070
Then how about some tomatoes?

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:44.771
There was a booth selling them-

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:46.473
Uh, no, I'm fine, thanks!

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.542
Okay.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:53.614

(Sarada grunting)

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.822
[Naruto] I can't
believe how hard

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.891
it is to find a Kuraa-ma!

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:06.193
Hey, Daddy, how
about this store?

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:07.227
Hm?

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:10.063
I could've sworn
this place was...

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.065
(people chattering excitedly)

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.302

(both chuckling)

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:22.276
I get it.

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.613
Huh? What's up?

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:29.750
[Sasuke] A piggy-back ride.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.986
Hm?

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.221
Just stop!

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.722
Ugh, you're so embarrassing!

00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:40.761
-(footsteps tapping)
-(people chattering excitedly)

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:42.963
(Sasuke grunting)

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.599
[Kakashi] Something
bothering you, Sasuke?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.067
What do you want?

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:48.836
[Kakashi] Who, me?

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:52.105
Oh, nothing, I just
happened to see

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.208
a sad father trying
to give his daughter

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:57.411
a piggy-back ride and
getting shot down.

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:59.046
(Sasuke grunting)

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.048
Hey, hold on a minute.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.382
You know what I think?

00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:04.718
It's probably from
traveling alone so much,

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:08.121
but your social skills seem
to need some polishing.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:11.325
I think your Visual Prowess
still has a ways to go.

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:13.560
What are you trying to say?

00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:15.829
[Kakashi] You may possess
the Mangekyo Sharingan,

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:17.764
but it seems you can't even peer

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.766
into your own
daughter's feelings.

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:23.604
Uh, and what's this?

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:26.073
[Kakashi] This book is
called "Make-Out Tactics"!

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.543
For me, these days, it's
like a guidebook to life!

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.045
How about it?

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:34.915
Don't you wanna learn
some tactics to help you

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:36.650
get along with your daughter?

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:40.053
(Sasuke gulping)

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.288
(water sloshing)

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.557
[Announcer] The final
round is here at last!

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.326
The last battle features
Ankorodo's Sweet Azuki

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.327
So much fun!

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.429
-So much fun!
-Aw, there there, little one!

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:50.564
(Shino yelping)

00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:52.599

bowls within the time limit

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:53.934
-wins!
-Hm?

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.836
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.571
Shino Aburame.

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:59.773
(food sizzling)

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:02.476
(both grunting)

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:05.779
By the way,

00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:06.780
(Shino grunting)

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:08.282
I'd like to thank
you for taking

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:09.983
care of my daughter
at the Academy.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.920
[Shino] Oh, um, right!

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:15.956
So how'd she do?

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:18.959
Um. (clearing throat)

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:20.961
Exceptionally.

00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:23.964
But the road that she's
planning on taking

00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:25.499
will not be an easy one.

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:28.902
I'm sure she's going
to face many hardships,

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:32.673
but I hope that you'll
support her as a father.

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:34.608
Support her as a father, huh?

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:39.446
Did she run into
any undesirable...

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:40.447
Huh?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.982
What's that?

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:44.384
You know, any bad insects?

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:46.220
-(Shino grunting)
-(bell dinging)

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:48.822
Did you say bad insects?

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.958
(Shino growling)

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.092
(Sasuke grunting)

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.260
(Shino growling)

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:57.664
There is no such
thing as a bad insect!

00:09:57.698 --> 00:09:58.866
(crowd exclaiming)

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.601
-Mommy, there's a weird man!
-Uh oh.

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:01.935
(pensive music)

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:02.970
[Sasuke] Hey!

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.671
Dad!

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.108
About earlier-

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:10.611
Sorry, I overreacted.

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:13.580
(Sasuke grunting)

00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:15.482
[Kakashi] To bridge the
distance between you,

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:18.051
the way you address her
is really important.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:21.088
Use a soft, loving tone.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.990
When you talk to
Naruto, you call him

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:23.991
(magical whooshing)

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:26.660
loser, isn't that right?

00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.230
It has a nice warmth
and familiarity to it.

00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:33.934
So what you should do is
try calling your daughter-

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.402
(magical whooshing)

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:36.470
[Sasuke] Uh, Peanut!

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.540
Huh?

00:10:39.573 --> 00:10:43.610
You're, uh, you're my
cute little peanut!

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:46.046
You know I'm not a nut, right?

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.047
(Sasuke groaning)

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.549
(Sarada growling)

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:52.052
Look, Dad, not one time today
have you called me by name.

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:53.787
Could it be that
you've forgotten

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.923
the name of your
very own daughter?

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:57.658
What are you talking about?

00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:59.059
It's Sarada!

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:02.496
Oh, so you actually
do remember, huh?

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.299
(Sasuke grunting)

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:06.700
[Kakashi] There's also
a tactic in this book

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:10.370
that'll make a girl
swoon, and I'll teach you!

00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:13.240
No matter how moody the girl,
it'll melt her like butter

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:16.643
-and turn her into a kitten!
-(magical whooshing)

00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:18.812
I mean, metaphorically.

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:19.813
(magical whooshing)

00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:21.715
And that tactic is...

00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:26.887
(cloak rustling)

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.589
Uh, what's this?

00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:30.791
I'm not feeling cold right now.

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:31.925
(Sasuke grunting)

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:35.095
(cloak rustling)

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:39.867
Dad, you're so annoying!

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.970
-(footsteps tapping)
-(people chattering)

00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:45.706
(Sasuke sighing)

00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:50.878
(birds chirping)

00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:53.780
(kunai thudding)

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.349
(Sarada sighing)

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:56.783
How come you aren't hanging out

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:58.619
with your dad today, Sarada?

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.256
Hey, Boruto.

00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:06.793
It's just that, (sighing)
I don't think my dad

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.662
really knows who I am at all.

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:09.596
[Boruto] Huh?

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.032
[Sarada] Also,
everything he does to try

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.667
to connect with me doesn't work!

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.236
[Boruto] Well, let me ask
you, do you really think

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.539
you understand Sasuke at all?

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:19.773
[Sarada] Huh?

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:21.942
It is Family Day,
after all, right?

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:24.344
So just be upfront and tell him

00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:26.914
if there's something that
you wanna do with him.

00:12:26.947 --> 00:12:27.948
(kunai thudding)

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:30.083
(Sarada gasping)

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:32.019
Listen, I'm sure that
what Sasuke wants

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:35.022
is just to spend some
quality time with you today!

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:40.427
[Sarada] You really think so?

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:45.199
(light pensive music)

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:47.367
[Kakashi] Annoying, huh?

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:49.102
Well, no matter
how you look at it,

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:52.406
it's clear that you two are
definitely father and child.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.008
[Sasuke] Do you still
have that book of yours?

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:56.443
[Kakashi] Oh?

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:58.178
Don't tell me that you've
actually recognized

00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:00.581
the benefits of
"Make-Out Tactics"?

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:03.217
Give it to me so I can
toss it in the river.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.552
Actually, if anything's
going in the river,

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.554
Kakashi, it should be you!

00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:08.555
[Kakashi] Uh...

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:09.556
You're right.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.292
Oh, well, an uncle can't
possibly understand

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:14.928
a daughter's feelings no
matter how hard he tries.

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:16.363
(Kakashi chuckling)

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:19.733
Wait, someone much more
qualified is heading this way.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:20.767
Huh?

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:24.705
(Sakura stammering)

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:26.006
Sasuke?

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.841
[Sasuke] Sakura!

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:29.843
Sarada sent me a message saying

00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:32.112
that you were back
home in the Village.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.548
It's been a while since
we've all been together,

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:38.719
so I thought that maybe we
could all have a takoyaki party!

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:44.892
I think her yearning and
adoration for her father

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:47.294
is much stronger
than other kids'.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.730
Since you're away so
much, it can't be helped.

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:54.134
To her, you're cooler and
stronger than any other dad.

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:58.038
And, well, you are,
that's just a fact.

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.774
Which means if she sees
an imperfection in you,

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:03.076
she gets disillusioned.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.012
Sarada hasn't really experienced

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:06.713
what your everyday self is like.

00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:10.884
(chuckling) So stop acting
tough and aloof all the time

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:13.353
and just treat her
like a normal person!

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:15.889
And just how exactly
do I do that?

00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:18.759
Well, to be honest,
I'm not really sure.

00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:19.993
Let me see.

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:24.198
I guess that it's what you
wanted from your father

00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:26.266
and big brother
when you were a boy.

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:29.937
Oh, right!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.171
Did you know?

00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:33.740
Sarada's dream is to
become Hokage one day!

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:36.043
Hokage.

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:39.446
(gentle peaceful music)

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:43.050
(footsteps tapping)

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:44.918
(air whooshing)

00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:48.055
(birds chirping)

00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:54.461
(magical whooshing)

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:56.663
(air whooshing)

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:58.498
(kunai clanking)

00:14:58.532 --> 00:15:00.501
(kunai thudding)

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:03.370
(magical whooshing)

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.571
Wow, big brother!

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:08.108
You nailed every target,
even behind the rock!

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:10.010
All right, it's my turn!

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.346
[Itachi] No, Sasuke,
it's time to go.

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:14.047
What happened to the
new shuriken jutsu

00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:15.949
you promised to teach me, huh?

00:15:15.983 --> 00:15:18.185
Tomorrow, I have an
important mission,

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:19.453
and I must prepare for it.

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:22.923
Hmph, you're such
a big fat liar!

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:25.726
(Itachi sighing)

00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:28.729
(Sasuke chuckling)

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:32.466
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:33.834
-(blow tapping)
-Ow!

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.702
I'm sorry, Sasuke.

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:36.737
Some other time.

00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:41.675
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:48.115
-(water rushing)
-(rope creaking)

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:49.883
-(Sarada grunting)
-(air whooshing)

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:52.386
(water splashing)

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:53.587
Aw, come on!

00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:56.924
(Sarada breathing deeply)

00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:58.825
Focus, focus!

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:00.561
-(Sarada grunting)
-(air whooshing)

00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:02.029
Yes, get there!

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:03.597
(shuriken clanking)

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.831
(Sarada gasping)

00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:06.066
Dad?

00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:09.336
Please don't bother me.

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:16.743
(Sarada sighing)

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:18.612
-(Sarada grunting)
-(air whooshing)

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.746
(metal clanking)

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.981
Hey, come on!

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:23.183
(air whooshing)

00:16:23.217 --> 00:16:24.551
(shuriken clanging)

00:16:24.585 --> 00:16:25.586
Yes!

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:27.387
Huh?

00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:28.388
(Sarada grunting)

00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:29.957
(Sasuke chuckling)

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.826
I heard that you
wanna become Hokage.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.361
[Sarada] What, you
gonna laugh at me

00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:36.930
and say it's a ridiculous dream?

00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.031
No.

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:40.767
At one time, I tried
to become Hokage.

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:41.735
(Sarada gasping)

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:43.637
I, I never knew that you-

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.439
I only told a few people.

00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:50.978
But I had a warped vision
of what the Hokage was.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:56.149
Luckily, I had a friend who
was able to straighten me out.

00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:59.786
He pointed me towards
hope and a better path,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.722
the right path.

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:03.824
Are you bragging about a friend?

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:04.958
What's going on?

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:07.661
He's not really a friend
you can brag about.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.597
He's basically a loser
who just forges ahead

00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:13.901
in whatever direction he
thinks is right at the time.

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:15.903
Ah, I just don't get it.

00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:17.571
But then, if he's...

00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:20.507
(air whooshing)

00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:22.976
If Naruto's the one
who you're following,

00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:26.980
you won't make the same
mistakes that I did.

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:32.419
I think that you'll
make a great Hokage.

00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:34.955
(Sarada gasping)

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:36.723
I'm all for it.

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:37.758
Don't give up.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.894
(Sarada gasping)

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:41.929
(Sarada grunting)

00:17:41.962 --> 00:17:43.764
-(Sarada grunting)
-(air whooshing)

00:17:43.797 --> 00:17:46.466
(water splashing)

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.434
(Sarada grunting)

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:48.702
Are you gonna give up?

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.704
No way, don't be ridiculous!

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.705
(air whooshing)

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.775
(water rushing)

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:57.477
(air whooshing)

00:17:58.912 --> 00:17:59.880
(air whooshing)

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:00.914
(Sarada grunting)

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:02.716
(air whooshing)

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:03.784
(shuriken clanking)

00:18:03.817 --> 00:18:06.086
(air whooshing)

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:07.855
(shuriken thudding)

00:18:07.888 --> 00:18:09.790
(water splashing)

00:18:09.823 --> 00:18:13.994
(gentle inspirational music)

00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:18.031
You're so awesome, Dad.

00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:20.601
Your shuriken's the one
that hit the target.

00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:28.008
(footsteps tapping)

00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:37.050
[Fugaku] Now then,
that's my boy.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.319
You've done well.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.190
(Sasuke chuckling)

00:18:43.223 --> 00:18:45.125
Now there, that's my...

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.729
Nah, I'll save that for later.

00:18:48.762 --> 00:18:49.930
Save what?

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.131
It's nothing.

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:53.033
(chuckling) This is just
what I've always wanted

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:54.701
to do with you, Dad!

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:57.004
So can we do it a bit longer?

00:18:57.037 --> 00:18:58.939
[Sasuke] Another time,
your mother's waiting.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.241
Uh, oh, yeah.

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:05.812
(Sasuke grunting)

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:08.615
(metal tapping)

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:09.716
Next time, okay?

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:13.654
Aww!

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:17.624
(gentle peaceful music)

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:20.794

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:22.930
Boruto!

00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:24.765
Hey!

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:27.568
I guess I shouldn't have
worried, you look just fine.

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:31.271
Yeah, it seems that I owe
you, just this one time.

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:33.373
Yeah, so be grateful then!

00:19:33.407 --> 00:19:34.408
(Sarada chuckling)

00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:37.211
But, you know, the day
isn't over just yet!

00:19:37.244 --> 00:19:38.045
Huh?

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:39.680
It's Family Day!

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:42.182
If there's something you wanna
do with Lord Seventh today,

00:19:42.216 --> 00:19:43.951
just be upfront and tell him!

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:46.720
(Boruto grunting)

00:19:46.753 --> 00:19:48.188
Isn't that what
you told me to do?

00:19:48.222 --> 00:19:49.923
Be upfront and say it?

00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:51.124
(Boruto grunting)

00:19:51.158 --> 00:19:54.895
Uh, yeah, I guess I
did say that, didn't I?

00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:57.931
What am I worried about,
after I lectured you?

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:00.033
(chuckling) Hey,
thank you, Sarada!

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:03.136
(Sarada chuckling)

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:06.406
-(crickets chirping)
-(door thudding)

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.441
I'm home!

00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:09.710
[Naruto] Welcome back!

00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:12.579
(Boruto grunting)

00:20:14.348 --> 00:20:15.349
Hey.

00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:19.920
Listen, I'm really
sorry about today.

00:20:19.953 --> 00:20:23.223
(sighing) I spent the
entire day with Himawari

00:20:23.257 --> 00:20:25.826
and I didn't make any
time at all for you.

00:20:25.859 --> 00:20:27.327
(sighing) It's okay.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.534
[Naruto] You'd
probably prefer a game

00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:36.703
or something like
that, but, honestly,

00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:38.872
I didn't know what you'd like.

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.574
Uh, what is this?

00:20:40.607 --> 00:20:41.608
[Naruto] Open it.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.881
[Boruto] This is...

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.883
Just a little present from me.

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:51.852
(chair scraping)

00:20:51.885 --> 00:20:55.088
(footsteps tapping)

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.325
[Boruto] Hey, Dad?

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:00.761
[Naruto] Hm?

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:06.600
It's still Family Day, right?

00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:08.702
(Naruto gasping)

00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:10.671
(chuckling) That's right.

00:21:12.372 --> 00:21:16.443
The sun's gone down now,
but would you train with me?

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:18.879
I mean, even just
for a little while?

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:21.648
(upbeat energetic music)

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:23.650
Of course I will, you know!

00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:33.160

[Boruto] Family Day.

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:49.510
I'm really glad
I got to enjoy it

00:21:49.543 --> 00:21:52.145
until the very last
minute, you know!
