WEBVTT

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:16.926
Hm?

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.865
[sighs]

00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:34.511
[grunts]

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:39.148
[grunts]

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.453
Huh.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:58.868
[gasps]

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.405
Who are you?

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:04.473
<i>(Sasuke) Tell me.</i>

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:30.634
I need to know. Are you actually
married to my father?

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:34.571
You've been acting kind of weird
all day!

00:01:34.604 --> 00:01:38.074
What's weird is the relationship
you have with my Dad!

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:41.645
So anyway, I kind of have a
favor to ask of my best friend.

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:43.412
Are you willing to hear me out?

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:44.447
What do you need?

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.851
Well, you see, I'm thinking of
going on a journey.

00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:50.520
I'm going to find out who my
real mom and dad are...

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:52.956
and naturally, you'll be coming
along, right?

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.458
That's it! That's the answer!

00:01:55.491 --> 00:02:01.264
We'll leave just as soon as we
get packed! Okay? Did you
get that?!

00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:05.268
(Sarada) I'll ask Lord Seventh.
<i>He ought to know where my Dad</i>
<i>is.</i>

00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.972
Hmm.

00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:06.556
Shikamaru, how many headbands
were we gonna order? I can't
remember.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.125
Why don't you let me take care
of ordering those?

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:11.494
You must have other work, right?

00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:13.129
Huh?

00:04:13.162 --> 00:04:15.264
<i>(Naruto) It's Sasuke's hawk.</i>

00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:21.738
That guy, he's so analog
when it comes to this stuff.

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:23.106
Well, it's not his fault.

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.510
There's no place to charge a
device on 80% of his missions.

00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:28.277
Give him a break, huh?

00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:31.014
[gasps] This is...?

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:37.020
<i>(Kakashi) What is it, Naruto?</i>

00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:40.624
Didn't I already tell you that I
was planning to go on a long
leave?

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:51.434
I see. Well, if this guy really
does have the Sharingan, which
is highly unlikely...

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:55.304
He's either an Uchiha survivor,
or maybe...

00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:57.841
<i>(Kakashi) He's someone related</i>
<i>to him.</i>

00:04:57.874 --> 00:04:58.708
Huh?

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.884
So you've seen him, then?

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:08.918
Mhm.

00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:11.621
And? How was Sasuke Uchiha?

00:05:11.655 --> 00:05:16.660
He was really strong. I could
not overpower.

00:05:16.693 --> 00:05:20.496
And yet what you experienced is
nothing like his true power.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.634
<i>(Shin) The power of Sasuke</i>
<i>Uchiha's Sharingan, that is.</i>

00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:26.736
Sharingan?

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.775
So he...he killed Itachi?
Unforgivable, must kill.

00:05:31.808 --> 00:05:37.413
That's right. Sasuke, the
disgrace of the proud
Uchiha Clan.

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:42.385
He doesn't deserve to have that
kind of power, not the
Sharingan.

00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:49.425
[panting]

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:51.695
(Naruto) I'll contact you again
<i>if I learn anything new.</i>

00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:56.666
It looks like I'll need to get
the details from Sasuke myself.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.303
So in that case, I'm gonna take
off and go meet up with him.

00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:01.137
[gasps]

00:06:03.272 --> 00:06:08.745
I'm leaving a Shadow Clone here
in the village, and then I'll go
there to meet Sasuke personally.

00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:13.517
What started as a small ember is
now a big fire. You'd better
hurry.

00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:14.818
Yeah.

00:06:56.359 --> 00:06:57.727
Yes.

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.635
I'll be back soon. Take care of
the village.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:06.770
Alright.

00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:17.747
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Sorry to keep you</i>
<i>waiting, Sarada!</i>

00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:20.684
What's going on? You seem a lot
more excited than me.

00:07:20.717 --> 00:07:24.087
[chuckles] Cho‐Cho! You sure
brought a lot of stuff.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.258
Mhm, well, you never know, it
could turn out to be a long
journey so...

00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:33.062
Check it out! I'm prepared for
anything!

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:36.032
Oh wow, look at you, that's
amazing!

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:40.537
I swear I'm going to find my
real dad if it's the last thing
I do. [chuckles]

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.508
[panting]

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:50.179
[panting]

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:52.949
Get better soon, all right?

00:07:52.982 --> 00:07:58.622
<i>(Cho‐Cho) He was the most</i>
handsome manly man ever, and he
<i>saved my life!</i>

00:07:58.655 --> 00:08:03.026
I just know he's my real dad,
and I'm gonna find him somewhere
out there!

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:04.894
[uncomfortable laugh]

00:08:06.262 --> 00:08:08.064
<i>(Naruto) Okay, I better get</i>
<i>going.</i>

00:08:08.097 --> 00:08:09.232
[gasps]

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:16.540
Tell Boruto, I'm really sorry.

00:08:16.573 --> 00:08:17.607
Mhm.

00:08:19.643 --> 00:08:21.611
[gasps]
Hey, that's Lord Seventh.

00:08:21.645 --> 00:08:24.147
Wait, is he going on a trip too?

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.650
Hey, what are you doing?!
[grunts]

00:08:26.983 --> 00:08:28.718
[groans]

00:08:28.752 --> 00:08:30.186
That hurt.

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.489
[yelling] I'm sorry, are you all
right?

00:08:33.523 --> 00:08:36.392
How come you're being so bossy
all of a sudden?

00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:38.528
And why are you acting so mad?

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:40.864
Huh?

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:43.900
[grunts] I'm afraid you just
missed him.

00:08:45.502 --> 00:08:50.106
Oh, now I get it, you guys
brought his lunch. He said
sorry.

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:51.508
[scoffs]

00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:54.511
Let's go back home, Mitsuki.

00:08:54.544 --> 00:08:56.846
If we hurry up, maybe we
could still catch him.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.614
<i>(Sarada) Boruto!</i>

00:08:57.647 --> 00:08:58.648
Hmm?

00:08:59.949 --> 00:09:02.418
Hold on a minute! You want me to
deliver that lunch box for you?

00:09:02.451 --> 00:09:03.152
Huh?

00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:04.287
Uh.

00:09:04.788 --> 00:09:05.755
Sarada?

00:09:07.123 --> 00:09:08.992
We were just getting ready to
leave on a little trip right
now.

00:09:09.025 --> 00:09:11.995
If you like, we can take that to
Lord Seventh. Okay, great.

00:09:12.028 --> 00:09:14.063
Right? You don't mind, Cho‐Cho?

00:09:14.097 --> 00:09:17.200
Fine with me but, is there
enough in there for me too?

00:09:17.233 --> 00:09:17.967
[chuckles]

00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.570
No. Sorry.

00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:23.773
I'm taking it back to Mom and
giving her a piece of my mind.

00:09:23.807 --> 00:09:26.976
She just keeps on making lunch
boxes for him. She should know
better.

00:09:32.148 --> 00:09:33.650
What is it now?

00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:35.519
I'm saying I'll deliver it to
him.

00:09:35.552 --> 00:09:38.021
And I'm saying no thank you.

00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:43.593
If you don't want it, then I'd
be happy to eat it for you.

00:09:43.627 --> 00:09:47.030
Hey, Cho‐Cho, why don't you come
over here with me for a second.

00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:49.766
Are you gonna ask me out?

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:53.069
Your heroine syndrome
is quite advanced.

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:58.474
You need to learn how to mind
your own business!

00:09:58.508 --> 00:10:02.546
You actually know the person
who's going to deliver it, so
what's the big deal?

00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:05.949
Besides, I'm qualified to make
the delivery.

00:10:06.215 --> 00:10:07.551
Hmm?

00:10:09.553 --> 00:10:11.521
I swear I'll get it to him!

00:10:11.555 --> 00:10:15.959
I won't let the lunch your mom
made for the Seventh Hokage go
to waste!

00:10:15.992 --> 00:10:18.027
Please, trust me on this one!

00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:20.496
Why is this so important to you?

00:10:20.797 --> 00:10:21.865
[sighs]

00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:26.102
Because a lunch box isn't just
about the food that's in it.

00:10:26.135 --> 00:10:29.506
<i>(Sarada) It's really about how</i>
<i>special the person is who made</i>
<i>it for you.</i>

00:10:33.342 --> 00:10:35.745
What the heck's going on with
you?

00:10:36.012 --> 00:10:39.182
[sighs]

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:42.986
Naruto is heading toward the
Shikoro Pass. Boruto, you
should let her take it.

00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:46.322
Fine.

00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:47.957
Here ya go.

00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:48.925
[chuckles]

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.996
I promise I'll give it right to
him.

00:10:53.296 --> 00:10:54.631
Yeah.

00:10:55.932 --> 00:10:57.901
Cho‐Cho! Let's go!

00:10:57.934 --> 00:10:59.435
Uh, okay.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.273
I'm pretty sure he's
totally into me.

00:11:04.307 --> 00:11:06.009
<i>(Cho‐Cho) But seriously, no</i>
<i>thanks!</i>

00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:08.144
[chuckles]

00:11:08.177 --> 00:11:11.715
I finally get to meet you...Dad.

00:11:15.752 --> 00:11:18.187
[scoffs] She is so weird.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.202
They're on the move now.

00:11:34.337 --> 00:11:36.673
I saw it as well.

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:41.945
Let's focus on our next job,
Shin. Bring me his daughter.

00:11:41.978 --> 00:11:42.979
Hmm.

00:11:44.648 --> 00:11:48.284
The one with the glasses. She's
wearing the crest of the Uchiha
Clan, just like you.

00:11:48.317 --> 00:11:53.222
We'll be able to use that girl
to our advantage in many ways.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.328
[panting]

00:11:59.362 --> 00:12:05.034
The food in that lunch box is
going to get all messed up if we
keep running like this!

00:12:05.068 --> 00:12:08.872
But I guess that's what happens
when you eat, anyway! [groans]

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:11.040
We have to hurry, or we won't
catch up!

00:12:11.074 --> 00:12:14.511
Besides, what's the point of all
this if he doesn't get to eat
it?!

00:12:14.544 --> 00:12:20.049
<i>(Cho‐Cho) [panting]</i>

00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:23.620
I've had it! I can't run
anymore! [panting]

00:12:23.653 --> 00:12:26.289
If you can't run, I'll
roll you if I have to!

00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:27.423
Great idea!

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:28.758
Huh?

00:12:34.063 --> 00:12:35.231
[gasps]

00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:42.205
Those red eyes...
Who are you? Tell us.

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:44.173
I'm Shin, Uchiha.

00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:45.108
[gasps]

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.113
How can you be an Uchiha? My dad
and I are the only Uchiha
survivors left.

00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:54.217
Come with me.

00:12:56.119 --> 00:12:58.321
And? What if I refuse?

00:12:58.354 --> 00:13:02.025
Father said I must
bring you to him.

00:13:02.058 --> 00:13:03.860
His word...obey!

00:13:04.127 --> 00:13:05.294
[grunts]

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:12.168
I'm taking you away!

00:13:12.201 --> 00:13:16.105
[gasps] What are you going to do
with me after you kidnap me?

00:13:22.445 --> 00:13:23.279
[grunts]

00:13:23.312 --> 00:13:24.013
Cho‐Cho!

00:13:25.682 --> 00:13:27.784
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:33.156
[grunts]

00:13:33.623 --> 00:13:35.458
You aren't needed.

00:13:35.491 --> 00:13:36.292
[gasps]

00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:37.627
[gasping]

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.567
(Naruto) Don't you think this is
<i>a little much...</i>

00:13:44.133 --> 00:13:45.635
<i>for a kid's fight?</i>

00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:47.003
Lord Seventh!

00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:52.208
If there's one thing I know it's
that the kids in my village are
generally well‐behaved!

00:13:55.645 --> 00:13:57.380
<i>(Naruto) Sharingan.</i>

00:13:57.413 --> 00:13:59.916
I see. So you're the one.

00:13:59.949 --> 00:14:02.852
Lord Seventh saved me
just like that!

00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:05.922
Sorry kid, but it looks like
I'll have to bring you in.

00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:08.825
<i>(Naruto) I have some questions</i>
<i>for you as well.</i>

00:14:08.858 --> 00:14:09.826
[grunts]

00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:13.462
<i>(Naruto) Look at that.</i>

00:14:13.496 --> 00:14:15.899
The Mangekyo Sharingan, too.

00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:21.237
All right. I can't go easy on
you then.

00:14:27.677 --> 00:14:31.648
Remotely controlled weapons,
huh? I get it.

00:14:31.681 --> 00:14:33.917
So that's your power.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.386
Naruto, are we gonna let loose
for once?

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.723
Yeah just a little bit.

00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:51.801
Uh, Sarada, is this what they
say is inside of Lord Seventh's
body?

00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:56.172
Yeah. That's it. It's the
Nine‐Tailed Beast.

00:14:56.205 --> 00:14:57.774
Go easy, okay?

00:14:57.807 --> 00:15:00.644
[scoffs] Not sure about that.

00:15:06.783 --> 00:15:09.285
Look at all that enormous
chakra he has!

00:15:09.318 --> 00:15:13.089
(Sarada) And he's controlling it
<i>so accurately!</i>

00:15:15.491 --> 00:15:20.063
Good job. Nicely done, kid. It
appears you're well trained.

00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:22.398
Hmm.

00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:26.636
Oh, wow! I knew Lord Seventh was
a super strong shinobi but...

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.373
(Cho‐Cho) He's even more amazing
<i>when you see him in actual</i>
<i>combat!</i>

00:15:30.406 --> 00:15:34.477
His presence is downright
dazzling! Could he be?

00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:35.278
Huh?

00:15:37.146 --> 00:15:41.250
Take note: that's the power of
the Nine Tails of the Seventh
Hokage.

00:15:41.284 --> 00:15:44.187
He's widely known as the
greatest shinobi of his time.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.092
To be able to see it through
these eyes is an unexpected
bonus.

00:15:49.358 --> 00:15:50.259
Hmm.

00:15:51.695 --> 00:15:56.099
Retreat for now, Shin. This is
not an adversary you can take on
yourself.

00:15:56.132 --> 00:15:57.033
Hmm.

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:05.509
[gasps] He's gone!

00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:07.476
Transportation Ninjutsu?

00:16:13.449 --> 00:16:16.252
[sighs] I guess it's over.

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:17.120
<i>(Cho‐Cho) Umm.</i>

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:17.721
Hmm?

00:16:19.022 --> 00:16:21.791
Excuse me but, is it possible
you're my real dad, Lord
Seventh?

00:16:21.825 --> 00:16:24.160
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:16:24.193 --> 00:16:30.399
Hmm...um...it's not really the
same feeling.

00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:34.270
Uh, wait a sec, what exactly is
going on here?

00:16:34.303 --> 00:16:37.406
Anyway, who was that kid? he
showed up out of nowhere.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.277
This whole journey was supposed
to be all about me finding my
real dad.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.014
Am I like a fair maiden who
everyone's fighting over?

00:16:45.048 --> 00:16:48.718
Nah. I don't think you're the
one they're targeting, Cho‐Cho.

00:16:48.752 --> 00:16:51.154
It's probably Sarada that
they're after.

00:16:51.187 --> 00:16:55.559
Huh? After me? Do you
know who they are?

00:16:55.592 --> 00:16:58.161
He said he was from
the Uchiha Clan.

00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:03.432
Huh?

00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:09.138
Listen you don't have to worry
about a thing, okay? It's all
right, I'll always protect you.

00:17:09.172 --> 00:17:10.540
[gasps]

00:17:10.574 --> 00:17:12.175
[chuckles]

00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:14.911
[chuckles]

00:17:14.944 --> 00:17:19.148
All right. I can't very well
send the two of you back to the
village alone.

00:17:19.182 --> 00:17:21.585
I think both of you should come
with me.

00:17:21.618 --> 00:17:23.620
That will be the safest option.

00:17:23.653 --> 00:17:25.755
Oh are you sure? All right!

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:30.159
It's no problem. Actually, I was
just on my way to meet with
Sasuke.

00:17:30.193 --> 00:17:35.198
[chuckles] Haven't seen him in a
while. I'm sure he'll be happy
to see you too, Sarada!

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.567
[sighs]

00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:41.538
Oh yeah! I came to deliver this
to you.

00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:43.139
Oh?

00:17:51.447 --> 00:17:54.984
[chuckles] Thanks a lot! Sorry
to trouble you.

00:17:59.122 --> 00:18:01.558
<i>(Naruto) That hit the spot!</i>

00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:05.028
Thank you, again. It was really
thoughtful of you.

00:18:05.061 --> 00:18:08.364
Oh, no, you can thank Boruto,
it's all because of him.

00:18:08.397 --> 00:18:09.866
[chuckles] Sure.

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:12.401
So, we're gonna see Sarada's
dad?

00:18:12.435 --> 00:18:16.139
You know originally this was
supposed to be a trip for me to
find my dad.

00:18:16.172 --> 00:18:19.108
Hmm? What happened to Choji? Did
he go somewhere?

00:18:19.142 --> 00:18:21.310
Sarada, tell me about
what your dad is like.

00:18:21.344 --> 00:18:24.213
You know I've never met the
guy? Not even once.

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:27.684
I don't remember him.

00:18:27.717 --> 00:18:32.522
Yeah, that's right. Your dad's
been traveling this whole time.

00:18:32.889 --> 00:18:34.524
[sighs]

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:39.395
Let's see here, how would I
describe your dad?

00:18:39.428 --> 00:18:40.564
[gulps]

00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:45.569
He was super popular with the
kunoichi at the Academy, just
like I was.

00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:49.973
And he was also quite a handsome
young man, just like I was.

00:18:50.006 --> 00:18:56.245
Plus, he was always the one to
get the top grades in ninjutsu,
just like I did.

00:18:56.279 --> 00:19:00.517
I thought only one person could
get the top grade? Sounds fishy.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.618
[chuckles]

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:06.523
But also, he was antisocial,
grouchy, arrogant and rude!

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:08.324
Totally not like me at all!

00:19:08.357 --> 00:19:10.527
[groans]

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.198
In other words, he's what you'd
call my rival.

00:19:15.231 --> 00:19:17.634
That's still true even today.

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:19.368
<i>(Naruto) Sarada.</i>

00:19:19.402 --> 00:19:21.437
Earlier when I was watching
you...

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.374
you reminded me a lot of Sasuke
and Sakura from back in the day.

00:19:25.408 --> 00:19:26.242
Huh?

00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:32.415
<i>(Naruto) I mean, Sasuke never</i>
<i>wore glasses, but I swear you</i>
<i>two have the exact same eyes.</i>

00:19:32.448 --> 00:19:37.086
Also, you just have a way about
you that's so similar to Sakura.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.689
Like you're probably really
scary when you snap!

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.659
But don't you worry.

00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:45.962
No matter how far apart, or how
long it's been since you've seen
him...

00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:50.800
(Naruto) It's never gonna change
<i>the fact that you're Sasuke's</i>
<i>daughter.</i>

00:19:50.834 --> 00:19:52.401
[chuckles]

00:19:52.435 --> 00:19:55.572
And Cho‐Cho, your face is a
mirror of Karui's!

00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:58.608
And your physique is just like
Choji's when he was a kid!

00:19:58.642 --> 00:19:59.442
Huh?

00:20:00.777 --> 00:20:03.079
<i>(Naruto) I wish I had another</i>
<i>one of those meat buns.</i>

00:20:03.112 --> 00:20:05.515
(Sarada) I wonder why, when I'm
<i>with Lord Seventh...</i>

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:07.450
...yeah this is nothing!

00:20:08.618 --> 00:20:11.054
<i>(Sarada) ...I feel so relaxed.</i>

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:24.467
[panting]

00:20:28.004 --> 00:20:29.973
(Naruto) It's coming into view!

00:20:30.006 --> 00:20:33.543
That's the tower! That's where
I'm supposed to meet with
Sasuke!

00:20:33.877 --> 00:20:36.513
[panting]

00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:39.916
[groans] I can't run anymore!
Let's take a break! [panting]

00:20:39.949 --> 00:20:43.486
I guess there's no getting
around it, but only for a
little bit.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.490
Oh, come on! The tower is right
there in front of us!

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:51.628
It's okay. Let's just
sit for a sec.

00:20:51.661 --> 00:20:55.064
[panting] All right.

00:20:55.098 --> 00:21:00.369
[sighs] Um, I need to
use the bathroom.

00:21:02.038 --> 00:21:05.108
Alright then, don't stray too
far.

00:21:05.542 --> 00:21:07.443
Uh, right.

00:21:11.214 --> 00:21:15.552
<i>In just a little while, I</i>
<i>finally get to meet him!</i>

00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:19.656
Dad...[crying]

00:21:26.062 --> 00:21:30.534
[panting]

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:51.888
[heavy breathing]

00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:53.489
Huh?

00:22:02.899 --> 00:22:03.967
Dad!

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.570
I'm very impressed that you
found me.

00:22:09.038 --> 00:22:11.074
Are you one of them?

00:22:11.508 --> 00:22:13.142
[gasps]

00:23:49.606 --> 00:23:53.476
(Sasuke) Naruto, what exactly is
<i>going on?</i>

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.746
Why did you bring children with
<i>you?</i>

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.415
(Sarada) I came here to see you,
Dad! Why won't you ever stay and
<i>live with Mom?</i>

00:23:59.448 --> 00:24:03.386
<i>Do you even care that you've</i>
forgotten what your own daughter
<i>looks like?!</i>

00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:06.089
<i>What exactly is it that you've</i>
<i>been doing this whole time?!</i>

00:24:06.122 --> 00:24:11.761
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "Sasuke and</i>
<i>Sarada."</i>

00:24:11.795 --> 00:24:15.331
<i>(Sasuke) What I do has nothing</i>
<i>to do with you.</i>
