It's bad enough everyone's
gossiping about you.

My name's Boruto Uzumaki,

It's nice to meet all of you!

Hey, Denki. Which one's my desk?

But that wasn't just
some silly prank.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.593
If that train car had
landed in town, it would

You know him right?. Don't you
guys go way back, Sarada?

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.771
Not really. Our parents
are friends, that's all.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.173
So, you're saying you're
childhood friends.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:36.843
No, I'd hardly say
that's what we are.

that's a bit harsh.

Oh, sorry! If I offended,
I take it back.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:24.124
Although, you know that I'm only
saying what everybody else here

isn't really what happened.

I guess so.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.977
Anyway, Boruto, how
long's it been?

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.846
Dunno. So, how ya doin'?

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.313

I don't understand
you, Inojin...

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:55.956
I know you've been like this for
a long time, but why do you
always shoot your mouth off?

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:59.059
I'm really not trying to
cause trouble or anything.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:02.696
If he's telling the truth that
makes him look even worse!

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.264

are doesn't matter.

Okay, Boruto. That's good.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:53.914
We're all done. We've now
measured everyone's basic skill
level.

Wow, Boruto! That
was really terrific!

You had the second best
time in the whole class.

Wait, what?! You mean
that I'm not on top?!

Oh... I don't think he's
actually here today.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:20.974

it not being worth his time to
hang around with amateurs like
us.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.379
Who's he?

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:01.114
Iwabe Yuino.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:05.418
"Iwabe the Repeater". They say
that he failed the graduation
exams twice.

If you have a problem
with me, bring it on!

I wouldn't do it if I were you.

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:51.464
I heard the instructors talking
about how impressed they all
were with Iwabe's taijutsu
skills.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.167
Oh yeah, then why does
he keep flunking?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.538

don't think you should test him.

Listen to me! Strength is the
only thing that matters for a
ninja!

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:06.279
What's the use of doing nothing
but simply studying obediently
like all of you?

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:10.517
The current Hokage was the
strongest in all of history.

00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:14.354
As long as you're strong, a
ninja can get away with
anything!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.922
Aw, man, there he goes again.

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:19.292
I know. At this point he
really should just drop
out of the Academy.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:25.532
But Iwabe, even Lord Seventh
made it his goal to use ninjutsu
in peaceful ways.

00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.400
That's why I also‐

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:30.671
Just shut up! Weaklings
don't get to talk.

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:34.407
Just ten years ago, our people
in were fighting in a war!

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:40.213
When Lord Hokage was a ninja on
the front lines, it wasn't like
<i>this at all.</i>

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:44.417
But then, this place went soft
and turned into a school for
wimps!

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.152
That's not gonna
fly with me!

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.789
[gasp]

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:54.928
A weakling who got accepted here
only by riding on his old man's
<i>coattails... is nothing more</i>
<i>than an embarrassment!</i>

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:55.929
[gasp]

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:00.433

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:01.668
Huh?

00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:04.337
You're wrong! Boruto's
not like that at all!

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.608
It was 'cause of watching Boruto
that I wanted to join the
Academy.

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:09.843
You don't know anything!

Some brave words you got
there...

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:18.484
But still... you only get to
speak to me like that after
you defeat me!

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.721
Cut it out!

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:23.657
[grunt]

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.695
I see... So your idea of
strength is just to bully people
into doing what you want, is
that it?

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:30.731
What did you say?!

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.567
Boruto...!

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.069
It's okay, Shikadai!

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:40.073
Before I came here, I made a
decision that I wouldn't fight.

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:43.176
But if I have to...
I'll take you on!

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:46.880
Heh. Interesting.

00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:50.050

Oh! Hello there, Shino Sensei!

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.497
So, today's the day that Boruto
starts, isn't it?

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.099
That's right.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:10.303
To be suspended on the first day
of school! He's quite a
character.

I never expected that I'd be
assigned to be his homeroom
teacher....

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.076
Well, better make
the most of it!

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:19.680
Oh, yes, don't worry, I'm going
to be very strict with him.

00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:22.448
That's my job and my
responsibility now.

And what about class?!

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:49.209
Eh, so what? We can just blame
the guys who are fighting.

getting scared, are you?

00:11:56.382 --> 00:12:01.555
Ha! No way! This exercise hall
is like a fighting ring!

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:03.590
This is gonna be fun!

00:12:03.624 --> 00:12:07.360
Watch closely, you guys!

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:11.264
This is a ninjutsu match,
and we'll be following
Academy rules!

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:14.735
So don't worry. I won't
be using my weapon.

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:18.138
Because if I did use it,
then you'd be dead.

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.773
Hm!

00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:22.776
This whole thing is my fault!

<i>No, it isn't.</i>

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:28.715
He brought it all upon himself
by taking up this challenge.

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:30.851
He's gonna get suspended again.

00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:34.154
You think that's all he'll get?

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:35.989
I say expelled.

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:37.123
Huh!?

00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:39.526
But I suppose at least
he's not a coward.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.394
He's just stupid.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.164

interested in this?

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:41.788
[gasp] I'm not!

00:13:41.822 --> 00:13:44.825
It sure doesn't look like
you're not interested.

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:47.193
You're delusional.

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:51.998
Anyway, I think he's
in real trouble. He's no
match for that guy.

00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:56.436
[clanging]

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:00.206

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.168

Substitution with a Disguise
Jutsu, huh? That's pretty good!

00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:54.895
Yeah, you too. Shadow Clones.

00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:58.732
And they even stay manifested.
That's some chakra.

00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:02.168
What's Chakra?

00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:08.575
"The energy that's produced by
the immeasurable quantity of
cells that are contained within
the human body"

00:15:08.609 --> 00:15:13.514
Yeah. Learning how to manipulate
chakra is the first step toward
mastering ninjutsu.

00:15:16.517 --> 00:15:19.786
Interesting! But I can take on
any number of clones!

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.054
We'll see!

00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:24.658

You know, you really shouldn't
waste your clones, or you'll
run out of energy too fast.

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:43.276
Just shut up!

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:44.210
Heh.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.750
It's clear that guy's
used to combat.

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:54.621
The data says he was
the top student in
ninjutsu last year, too.

00:15:54.655 --> 00:15:59.092
Although it seems his grades in
the other courses were dismal.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.695
Man, this guy is a serious drag.

00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:04.497
The Academy should've just let
him graduate already!

Boruto! No!

00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:36.697
He's so determined. But just why
is he that determined? Huh...

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.602
It doesn't seem [like] he's
riding on anyone's coattails.
Not to me.

[grunts]

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:48.642

00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:56.883
Shut up! I won't give in to
someone who thinks strength
is everything.

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.919
But that's just what you'll do.

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:03.690
It's the exact same thing the
Hokage and all the other adults
have always been doing.

00:17:03.724 --> 00:17:06.893
They all rose up through the
ranks because of their power.

00:17:06.927 --> 00:17:09.530
Now they just decide
times have changed?

00:17:09.563 --> 00:17:13.667
<i>If things were the same, I'd</i>
<i>have graduated and become a</i>
<i>ninja long ago!</i>

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:21.608
But the way things are now,
unless I pass courses that have
absolutely nothing to do with
ninjutsu, then I'm stuck here!

00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:26.146
You think... maybe you might
just be really bad at studying?

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:29.215
[grunt] And so what
if I am, huh?!

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:32.052
It means you're taking things
out on the wrong person.

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:34.220
What did you say!?

00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:39.660
If you really wanna become a
ninja, then you have to keep at
it, no matter how many times you
fail.

00:17:39.693 --> 00:17:41.762
Instead, you blame the times
you're living in...

00:17:41.795 --> 00:17:47.333
<i>you skip classes and you act</i>
<i>like the world's against you!</i>

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:52.539

uncool things I've ever heard!

I'm ever gonna lose to you!

Although Anko Sensei gave
him a real earful...

I'm sure that he's just going to
get into trouble again, you know
what I mean?

away with it, too.
