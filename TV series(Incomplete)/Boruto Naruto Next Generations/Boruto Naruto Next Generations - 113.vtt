WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.008
(birds chirping)

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.076
(laughs softly)

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.445
Wow, I'm finally a chunnin now.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.347
(door creaking)

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.116
(comical noise)

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.187
(Moegi chuckles)

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.222
Really?

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:24.024
My first mission as a captain!

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.125
That's right.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.227
Though I hate sending
you out so soon.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.363
But this is so sudden, isn't it?

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.765
Hold on, did something
really bad happen?

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.866
Oh no.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.635
The mission isn't
actually that difficult.

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:37.070
It's essentially just
a routine assignment,

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:38.939
although it is deep
in the mountains.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.007
Easy enough.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.009
It'll be a piece
of cake for you.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.610
-(chuckles softly)
-Really?

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.078
Are you sure about that?

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.480
What does that mean?

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.550
If this mission is as
simple as you're suggesting

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.818
why did you have to come
all the way to my house

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.086
to tell me about it?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.621
(Meogi sighs)

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.622
There's gotta be something

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.091
that's gonna make this
mission a real drag.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.359
Okay, you're right.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.761
You got me.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:04.031
So today is Team 10's day off.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.801
Both Cho-Cho and Inojin
are doing their own thing.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:09.203
which means...

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.471
Which means that
this mission came

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.541
up suddenly and I couldn't
find anyone available.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:18.011
And so I rounded up
any genin I could find

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.947
who were free.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.282
An improvised team
just thrown together?

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.418
I'm sorry, but I
have a mission too,

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.487
and I don't have time
for anything more.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:28.488
Except...

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.158
Here's a bit of advice
for my dear student.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.359
Huh?

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:35.295
You have proven yourself to
be an exceptional Shinobi.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.231
But you must always
remember this,

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:41.435
a team isn't just comprised
of four other versions of you.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.004
Well, you're plenty smart
enough to figure this out

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.472
without me telling you.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.707
But still...

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.075
If it comes down to it,

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.577
I could probably just
manage it myself,

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:53.247
but it'll be a drag.

00:01:54.982 --> 00:02:00.187
(Opening Theme Music)

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:14.701
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:29.643
(Opening Theme Music)

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:38.986
(birds chirping)

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.053
[Shikadai Voiceover] Wow.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:42.656
I sure see what
Moegi Sensei meant.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.690
She really wasn't kidding

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.926
about the whole "put
together in a rush" thing.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.261
(suspenseful music)

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.396
We're still missing one
person, but I'm gonna start

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.065
I'll be your team
captain for this mission.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.968
I know it's sudden, so
I'm counting on you.

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:55.969
Wow Shikadai.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:56.970
How impressive.

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.839
So you're actually a chunin now?

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:01.375
I was just the one who
got picked, that's all.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.644
Well, your grades
always were excellent

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.212
back when we were in the Academy

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.514
And just because of that,
you get to be captain?

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:10.651
Guess I gotta hand it
to you genius types.

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:11.585
Oh, what's this?

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.654
Are you seriously saying
that you're jealous,

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:16.590
just because someone younger
has surpassed you Iwabe?

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:17.591
(comical noise)

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:18.725
That's ridiculous.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.061
You're just sucking up to
the captain, aren't you?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.197
All right, what's that
supposed to mean, huh?

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.998
Hey, come on you
guys, calm down.

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.600
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.969
Damn it. This whole
thing is a real drag.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:30.170
Hey, I'm here.

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:30.971
Sorry.

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.372
I'm later than I thought.

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:33.574
My bad, you know.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:37.578
Look Boruto, being on time
is basic Shinobi stuff.

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.079
I got to say,

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.848
I kind of feel sorry for you.

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.015
It's your first mission

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:44.718
and you're stuck being
in charge of these guys.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:45.919
-(Boruto laughs)
-(hand pats)

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.655
You're one of these
guys too, you know.

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.457
(birds chirping)

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.193
We're supposed to bring back
a flower called the Gekkouran

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:55.329
that grows up at the
top of this mountain.

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.731
That's the mission that
we've all been assigned.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:58.866
-That's it?
-(Iwabe sighs)

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:00.868
I was wondering what
our mission was gonna be

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.237
since we were assigned
it so suddenly.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.438
-(birds chirping)
-Seriously?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.040
We were called up just
to take care of this.

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:08.976
Listen, this Gekkouran plant

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.578
will only flower once
every four years.

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.981
And just on the night
of the full moon.

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:16.583
But still, come on,
sending Shinobi out

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.185
just to pick some flowers?

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:20.687
How special can this
plant be anyway?

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:24.591
Apparently the Gekkouran
has medicinal properties.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:26.527
So it fetches a high price.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.662
The locals have been taking
care of this mountain

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.532
so it doesn't get ravaged
by people after this plant.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:33.534
[Boruto] Oh, well at
least picking flowers

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.502
will be an easy task.

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.204
Don't relax yet.

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:38.572
We could be attacked by bandits

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:41.441
who are also after
the Gekkouran flower.

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:44.044
Yeah. Well there's nothing
I'd like better than that.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.045
Wait a sec.

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.246
Do you even actually know

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.848
where this Gekkouran
flower grows?

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:49.783
I mean, if we don't have a map,

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.585
then how are we gonna find it?

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:53.320
Don't worry about that.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.123
That's why we're bringing
along a guide with us.

00:05:56.156 --> 00:06:00.861
-Hold on a guide?
-(squeaking noise)

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.262
-(dramatic noise)
-[Boruto] A pig?

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:05.065
[Wasabi] What's
a pig doing here?

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:07.000
-This is our guide, Tonsuke.
-(Tonsuke grunts)

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.202
The guide's a pig?

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:10.103
(lively rock music)

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:11.705
Apparently he has an
unbelievably

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.440
strong sense of smell.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.709
They've tried other
pigs but for now,

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.110
Tonsuke here is the only one

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:19.213
who can reliably
find the Gekkouran.

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:22.850
(loud oinking)

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:23.851
Oh man.

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:25.452
what's the matter with that pig?

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:28.222
Looks like it's time
for me to feed him now.

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:29.790
Since there aren't
any other pigs

00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:31.191
that can do what Tonsuke does,

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:33.527
he's been spoiled rotten.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.262
Unless he's fed on
a regular schedule--

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:36.263
-(Tonsuke sniffing)
-(Tonsuke oinks)

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:37.664
he won't do what you say.

00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:40.400
And you even have to give
him his special food.

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.102
-(bells chiming)
-(Tonsuke oinks)

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:44.204
I guess he's got
a refined palate.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.641
(Tonsuke sighs)

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:51.178
I've never seen such a
stuck up pig in all my life.

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:52.513
We're gonna run out of time.

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:55.449
So let's just put a leash
on him and get going.

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:56.650
Hold on.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.286
You need to know that bandits
might come after Tonsuke.

00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:02.456
Recently, there was
another pig that was going

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:05.225
through training, and
some bandit stole it.

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:08.996
It's safer if one of us
carries him on their back.

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:12.132
-(Iwabe and Wasabi sighing)
-Fine, I'll do it.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.002
We don't have the time
to stand around here.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.438
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:19.439
(Wasabi laughs)

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.308
-Looks good on you, Iwabe.
-(Wasabi laughing)

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:24.344
C'mon, just get
this pig off of me.

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:26.647
Wolves can show up
around here at night.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.750
So make sure that you're
being careful and stay alert.

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.185
Seriously?

00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:33.120
Bringing a pig into
an area where wolves

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:35.589
live is pretty much like
packing them a lunch.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:36.990
Don't you think?

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:39.927
Ah man, it must be nice
to take a little nap.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.128
(wolf howling)

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:44.331
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.134
All right. One of you go
on ahead and investigate,

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:50.604
the rest we'll keep watch here
and we'll defend the rear.

00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:53.841
Leave it to me.

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:55.509
I've been waiting.

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:56.910
Hey wait.

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.245
I said one of you.

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:00.848
Why are both of you going?

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:02.249
Just back off, would you?

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:05.452
Listen in Team Five, I'm the
one who always gets to go first.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.387
Well, that's just
too bad for you then

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:10.123
because I always go
first on my team too.

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:14.228
(wolves growling)

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.999
Handling a pack of wolves
like this is nothing to me.

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.702
-(Wasabi roaring)
-(Wolves squealing)

00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:24.938
-(feet thudding)
-(Tonsuke oinking)

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.206
Hey, come back pig.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.076
Oh no, we have to go get
him, and quickly too.

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:31.378
This whole thing is
all your fault Wasabi.

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.914
What are you talking
about you have no clue.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.849
There's no time
for this nonsense.

00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:39.086
(upbeat rock music)

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:42.789
Where could the pig
have runoff too?

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:43.957
No way.

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.592
You don't think that
the wolves could've--

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:49.329
-(Tonsuke oinking)

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:51.098
That's cool.

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.866
I didn't know pigs
could climb trees.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.968
This isn't the time
for any snide comments.

00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:56.703
I've got to get him down quick.

00:08:56.737 --> 00:08:58.906
(Tonsuke oinks)

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:00.974
Hey, quit squirming around.

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:03.710
-(Tonsuke oinks)
-(Shikadai chuckles)

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:04.711
Look at that.

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.079
A nose-shaped birthmark.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.916
I guess it's no wonder you
have a keen sense of smell.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:10.050
(Tonsuke oinks)

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.952
Hey, listen up Wasabi.

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.654
This is all because
of you, you know.

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:16.423
You scared that pig with
that weird jutsu of yours.

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:17.357
What do you mean?

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:18.992
It's your fault for
putting Tonsuke down

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:20.394
when you should've
been carrying him.

00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:22.729
Cut it out, you two.
We're on a mission here.

00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:25.465
Can't you guys just set all
this aside and get along.

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:27.968
Yeah, tell that to her.
Yeah, tell that to him.

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.703
You heard 'em captain.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.305
(Shikadai sighs)

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:36.543
-(feet stomping)
-(Iwabe and Wasabi grunt)

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:38.512
Ah, c'mon.

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:41.048
Iwabe and Wasabi are
both so darn stubborn.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.516
It's just who they are.

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:44.718
You'll never get
them to stop arguing.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.387
I'm telling you, we should
just go ahead and cross.

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.790
Yeah, and I'm telling you
that we shouldn't you dummy.

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.259
C'mon, what is it now?

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:53.594
-(wind whooshing)
-I'm just saying,

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:56.063
it'll be faster if we cross
the suspension bridge,

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.731
but she won't listen to me.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.132
-(Tonsuke oinking)
-Check it out.

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:02.236
Tonsuke is scared because of
all this, if we try to cross

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:05.572
what if we end up dropping in
halfway across or something?

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:08.775
That's why it makes more
sense to detour around.

00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:10.043
No way, we're crossing.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.044
No, we aren't.

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:12.446
It's a bad idea.

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.581
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:15.616
Enough.

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.922
I've decided, we're
crossing the bridge.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.223
(Iwabe laughing)
(Wasabi sighing)

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:26.727
However, I'll carry
Tonsuke to the other side.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.262
If I decide it's too risky,

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:30.998
we turn back and
go the other way.

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:33.233
Well, if you say so Shikadai.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:35.569
Oh, man.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:38.105
What a half-baked decision.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:42.776
-(wind whooshing)
-(soft piano music)

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:43.777
Okay, good.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.345
No issues with Tonsuke so far.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:46.914
-(Iwabe and Wasabi grunt)
-(footbridge creaking)

00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:48.715
Quit being so stubborn.

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:50.250
I'm totally right,
and you know it.

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:52.252
Look who's being stubborn now.

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:53.253
-(rope creaking)
-(Tonsuke oinking)

00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:54.655
Hey, not here you idiots.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:55.789
Can you stop fighting?

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.592
(loud smack)

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:03.630
-Whoa.
-(Tonsuke oinking)

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:09.469
Oh man, that's sure was closer
than I would have liked.

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:13.473
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:15.876
Okay.

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:18.111
For now, you take
the lead Wasabi.

00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:20.848
And Iwabe, you bring up the
rear and guard our back.

00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:22.649
What? But how come?

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:24.051
For the rest of this mission,

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:26.253
You too are forbidden from
talking to each other.

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:27.521
I'm sorry for doing this,

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:29.990
but I'm giving you an
order as your captain.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.225
What was that?

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.760
Yes sir, I understand.

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.504
We should be
getting pretty close

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:45.973
to the area where the
Gekkouran grows, but...

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:48.775
(Tonsuke snores)

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:49.977
Someone's coming.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.778
-(bandits laughing)
-(dramatic music)

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:53.780
I guess that we've
been found out.

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.782
Gotta hand it to
your leaf Shinobi.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.852
But now you're going to hand
that little pig over to us.

00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:01.388
They're the bandits
you were talking about.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:04.391
Perfect. You saved us the
trouble of looking for you.

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:07.327
Now we can get all
of you at once.

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:09.329
Hey, stay in formation guys.

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:12.232
We have to stay together
or they'll go for Tonsuke.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.001
Hey, just a thought,

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:15.502
but maybe they can't
communicate well

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:18.305
'cause you ordered them
not to talk to each other.

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:19.206
Damn it.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:20.974
You have to adapt
to every situation.

00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:22.476
I have no choice.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.978
Hey Shikadai, above you.

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:30.217
-(loud boom)
-(Tonsuke oinking)

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.120
Are you all right, Shikadai?

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:35.255
I'm fine. Go after Tonsuke.

00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:36.290
Okay.

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:42.462
Well that was easy.

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:45.165
We chased off all
of the bandits.

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:47.201
Where's Tonsuke?

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:52.439
You can stop worrying guys.

00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:53.574
I found him.

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:55.976
(pig oinks)

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:58.579
Oh boy, I guess that
we messed up yet again.

00:12:58.612 --> 00:12:59.780
Listen, I'll tell you what,

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:02.749
to make up for it, we'll carry
Tonsuke from here on out.

00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:05.252
No way.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.087
I'm going to carry Tonsuke.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.156
Shikadai?

00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:12.759
I just can't leave them
in your hands anymore.

00:13:13.694 --> 00:13:15.128
What does that mean?

00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:17.264
This mission supposed
to be simple,

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.066
but everything's messing up.

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:20.300
Yeah, but...

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.503
Look, it's going
to be way easier

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:24.638
if I just finished this
mission all by myself

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.708
Hold up. You don't have to
say it like that, do you?

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:29.176
Hey, are you trying to tell us

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:31.645
that you think we'd only
get in the way or something?

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:32.713
Calm down you guys,

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:35.315
I'm sure that Shikadai
didn't mean it like that.

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:37.651
You can take it any
way that you'd like to,

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:40.587
but I'm going to make sure
that this mission is a success.

00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:43.123
You keep on saying mission
this, mission that.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.925
But back there we
couldn't communicate

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.193
because of your orders.

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:48.862
Yeah, but that's just
because the two of you

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:50.464
kept arguing all the time.

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.399
But by trying to
keep us from arguing,

00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:55.769
all that you did was end
up causing more problems.

00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:56.937
Oh, shut up.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.505
This is exactly
why I'm saying that

00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:00.774
I'm just gonna finish
this mission alone.

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:02.109
You said it, not me.

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.044
From here on out,
you're on your own.

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:05.512
You got that?

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:07.181
Fine, sounds great.

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.316
Hey wait, don't go
off by yourself.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:14.188
-(footsteps thudding)
-(dramatic music)

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:15.222
Damn it.

00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:18.659
Are you sure about this?

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.594
Should we really leave them?

00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:23.297
Whatever, the mission
is almost completed.

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:25.399
Tonsuke should start reacting

00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:27.734
to the flower scent
anytime now, but--

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:31.305
Yeah, you know, he's been
awfully quiet lately.

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:32.539
(pig oinking)

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:33.507
Oh, wow. Is this it?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.510
Did you finally find
the Gekkouran, Tonsuke.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:38.111
(pig sighing)

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:39.580
C'mon, seriously?

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:40.614
You're just hungry.

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:43.517
It can't be helped.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.551
I'll feed you.

00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:52.926
I guess we didn't realize
just how hungry you were.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.127
[Shikadai Voiceover]
That's weird.

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:56.463
I thought Tonsuke only
ate that special food.

00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:59.099
(pig whining)

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:04.137
-No birthmark?
-(dramatic music)

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.574
Where are you going?

00:15:07.608 --> 00:15:09.309
That pig isn't Tonsuke.

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:12.045
I'm guessing that during that
fight against the bandits,

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.580
he got switched.

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:14.982
What, really?

00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:16.750
We've got to find
them, and fast.

00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:23.023
-(footsteps thudding)
-(bandits granting)

00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:24.525
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:15:24.558 --> 00:15:26.927
I knew you guys were
behind all this.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.130
(laughs) And we're also
gonna keep Tonsuke.

00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:31.665
We were starting
to get desperate,

00:15:31.698 --> 00:15:34.701
'cause the pig that we stole
before was totally useless.

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.504
-Later.
-(bandits laughing)

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:39.306
It looks like the
ravine isn't that deep.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:41.375
And I think we can
make that jump.

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:43.443
Well, let's go.

00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:44.444
(Shikadai groans)

00:15:44.478 --> 00:15:46.146
Shikadai, what's going
on with your leg.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.249
(Shikadai groans)

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.557
You think it was okay for
us to let them go on alone.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.026
(scoffs) The captain said
he'd do it by himself,

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:00.227
didn't he?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.896
He told us that we
just get in the way.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.665
Well, yeah, that's true, but...

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:08.669
(dramatic noise)

00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:10.470
You think it's Shikadai's?

00:16:10.504 --> 00:16:13.707
So does this mean he hid that
he got injured earlier then?

00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:16.577
That little idiot.

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:23.317
-(Boruto grunts)
-(Boruto's Clone shrieks)

00:16:23.784 --> 00:16:26.153
(magical noise)

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:27.888
(sighs) That's no good.

00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:29.823
I thought we might
be able to grab

00:16:29.857 --> 00:16:31.825
onto the other side, but--

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:33.427
If we don't cross
the ravine soon

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.829
then we aren't going
to make it in time

00:16:35.863 --> 00:16:38.232
for the Gekkouran bloom
when the moon rises.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:40.634
There's no choice.
I have to jump it.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.536
You're seriously gonna try that?

00:16:42.569 --> 00:16:45.272
You know, sometimes I wish
I could use Shadow Clones

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:46.340
like you do.

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:47.140
Wait, what?

00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:48.742
Where did that come from?

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:49.943
It's nothing.

00:16:49.977 --> 00:16:51.879
I'm just wishing that
at times like these,

00:16:51.912 --> 00:16:54.214
there were a few
more of me around

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:55.015
Right?

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:56.283
Well listen.

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:57.684
There's no doubt that
you're awesome, Shikadai..

00:16:57.718 --> 00:17:00.687
but you can't do everything,
even if there was a whole bunch

00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:02.189
of you around, you know.

00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:06.159
-(slow emotional music)
-Take this situation.

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:07.394
If Iwabe were here,

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.730
he could have made a
bridge to the other side.

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:15.102
I guess that I still have
a whole lot to learn.

00:17:16.503 --> 00:17:19.106
I've been acting
too full of myself.

00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:21.074
But Shikadai?

00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:25.145
We barely have any time
left until Moonrise.

00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:27.881
The two of us are going
to jump over the ravine.

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:30.350
But how, I mean your leg?

00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:31.351
Yeah, I know.

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:34.721
But still I got
myself into this mess,

00:17:35.656 --> 00:17:38.425
and I'm going to get
myself out of it too.

00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.194
Yeah, but that's--

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:49.436
-(loud rumbling)
-(upbeat folk music)

00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:54.141
We found out that
a certain someone

00:17:54.174 --> 00:17:56.510
was hiding an injury
from all of us.

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:00.180
Come on, we gotta hurry.

00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:02.482
Listen, you guys, earlier...

00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:05.085
I thought we didn't
have much time.

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.955
So we shouldn't waste more
with some lame chit-chat.

00:18:07.988 --> 00:18:08.956
(Iwabe chuckles)

00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:10.357
Yeah, but Iwabe--

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.093
We're sorry about what
happened to you Shikadai.

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:15.095
But how do you
plan on finding the

00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:17.231
bandits out here on
this big mountain?

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:19.566
It's too rocky to track them.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.801
Don't worry.

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:24.404
I'm pretty sure that Tonsuke
will send us his signal soon.

00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:25.939
A signal?

00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:29.176
(lively rock music)

00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:37.084
-(Tonsuke oinking)
-What the hell, what's wrong?

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.419
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:41.555
It's been a long time
spent a long time

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:44.157
since I last gave Tonsuke
any of a special food.

00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:45.692
He's bound to be getting hungry

00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:47.628
and fussy right around now.

00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:49.696
I'm counting on you Wasabi.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.265
(chuckles) Leave it to me.

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.735
(distant oinks)

00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:55.936
I can hear him.

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.804
They're a little ways
off to the Northwest.

00:18:57.838 --> 00:18:59.740
We can catch up to
them if we hurry.

00:18:59.773 --> 00:19:03.076
Wasabi jutsu enables her
to emulate a cat's ability

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.946
to hear sounds we
normally can't hear.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.681
Which means with her assistance.

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:09.283
We can find Tonsuke.

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:11.885
I really gotta hand
it to you Shikadai.

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.420
They just changed direction.

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:15.155
Up here, turn right.

00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:16.823
But what are we gonna do?

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:18.292
I mean if they've got Tonsuke,

00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:20.961
and it'll be dangerous to
just rush in recklessly.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.696
You don't have to
worry about that,

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:24.498
I've got a plan in mind.

00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:26.233
We'll have to pay
them back properly

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:28.035
for what they did after all.

00:19:29.903 --> 00:19:31.939
-(blades whizzing)
-(soft thuds)

00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:33.807
You won't get away, you know.

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:36.710
(bandits sighing)

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:40.747
Come on.

00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:42.482
Why can't you find
the Gekkouran yet?

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:44.017
You useless pig.

00:19:44.051 --> 00:19:47.120
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:51.358
Oh, did you actually find some?

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:54.695
So the get Gekkouran
in there, huh?

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:55.929
Yes, I did it.

00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:58.098
Once I can sell this
stuff on the black market,

00:19:58.131 --> 00:19:59.967
I'm going to be super rich.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.469
(Bandit Boss chuckling)

00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:04.238
This is pig feed?

00:20:04.972 --> 00:20:06.940
(soft rumbling)

00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:07.941
No damn it!

00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:09.009
Come back.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.878
(comical noise)

00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:12.079
You're finished.

00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:14.882
You can't get to
Tonsuke anymore.

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:16.283
-Why, you little...
-(upbeat folk music)

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:19.286
I knew the Tonsuke was
starting to get hungry.

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:22.556
So I placed some of his special
food further down your path.

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:24.691
He was bound to
notice and go for it.

00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:27.027
That was a solid idea, captain.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.763
There's no way I'm going
to let you guys catch me.

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:34.968
-(magical noise)
-(Bandit grunts)

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:37.204
Look, just give it up.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.673
I've already got
you all figured out.

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:42.576
(Tonsuke oinking)

00:20:45.512 --> 00:20:47.814
All right, that's
the gekkouran, huh!

00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:49.883
Wow, that's one
beautiful flower.

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:53.353
Yeah. I actually feel kind of
sorry that we have to pick it.

00:20:53.387 --> 00:20:57.090
Well, if we didn't, it just
wither up in time anyway.

00:20:57.124 --> 00:20:59.026
Besides, this flower
is going to be able

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:00.727
to help a lot of people.

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:04.731
Our mission is finally complete.

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:10.604
What? A test?

00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:14.408
Yes, it was to determine if
you're truly ready and capable

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:15.809
of being a captain.

00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:17.945
That's why we assigned
you people other

00:21:17.978 --> 00:21:19.746
than your usual teammates.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.350
Dammit, Was kinda mean
Mogei Sensei, you know that?

00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:26.687
Regardless, the mission
itself was still a real one.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.021
So tell me all about it.

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:30.557
You guys, how did it
go for you out there?

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:31.825
(lively rock music)

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.627
I mean, we succeeded at it.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.628
Didn't we?

00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:36.296
-Yeah
-That's right.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.297
Okay, great.

00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:38.899
That's what I like to hear.

00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:41.034
I guess that means I can
assign Team 10

00:21:41.068 --> 00:21:42.803
to you from time to
time, Shikadai.

00:21:42.836 --> 00:21:44.071
What's up with that?

00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:46.006
Planning to slack
off Moegi Sensei?

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:49.943
Listen, I'll have you know
that jonin are very busy.

00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:51.879
So, Shikadai, how do you feel

00:21:51.912 --> 00:21:54.248
your first mission
as team captain went?

00:21:55.582 --> 00:21:59.319
Honestly, I realized I have
a long way to go as a captain

00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:02.589
and that managing people...

00:22:04.858 --> 00:22:07.060
is a real drag.

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:13.967
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:15.702 --> 00:22:19.039
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.121 --> 00:23:43.223
(dramatic music)

00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:45.225
They finally got
more X Cards in!

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:47.227
(Boruto squeals) I'm so excited!

00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:48.962
Open them up quick, Boruto!

00:23:48.996 --> 00:23:49.963
What's that?

00:23:49.997 --> 00:23:51.164
Just cards?

00:23:51.198 --> 00:23:52.633
These aren't just
regular old cards.

00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:55.602
They're extreme Ninja
cards, ex cards, for short.

00:23:55.636 --> 00:23:58.472
It is a trading card game
featuring famous Shinobi

00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:00.207
from throughout history.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.544
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:05.546
X cards, proxy war.

00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:08.715
Please let me open up a
super special, rare card.

00:24:11.251 --> 00:24:16.456
