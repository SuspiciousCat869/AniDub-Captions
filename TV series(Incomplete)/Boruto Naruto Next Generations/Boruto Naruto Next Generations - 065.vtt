of that...

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.739

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.240
I never really gave

And I figured it just
depends on how you're

00:12:23.277 --> 00:12:24.545
I see.

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:29.249
You may very well be
right about that. It
is old-fashioned.

ever learn to do
that?!

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:58.238
I told him I'd only
make him my student
if he mastered the

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:01.241
Rasengan. To my
surprise...

00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:05.479

just that in only a
few days' time.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:09.082
He used his forte,
Lightning Style, and
unconsciously changed

00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:11.451
its Chakra Nature,
creating a new jutsu.

00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:14.021
I call it a Vanishing
Rasengan.

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:15.822
[gasping]

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:19.793
No way! A Vanishing
Rasengan? What a
jutsu!

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.596
I did that?! Really,
Sasuke?!

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:23.463
[chuckling]

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:25.432
[chuckling]

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:26.767
[chuckling]

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.703
Why, you cheeky
little kid!

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:33.874
I don't really even
know how I do it. I
just make this kind!

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:36.243
Well, anyway, the
results were great.

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.078
Nice, Boruto.
You did good.

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:40.581
[grunting]
What was that?!

00:14:40.614 --> 00:14:42.249
It still won't save
you!

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:44.284
[grunting]

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:49.256
Momoshiki Otsutsuki...
At first glance, you
appear invincible...

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:52.593
... but even you
can't absorb chakra
you can't see.

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:57.798
[panting] Don't
misunderstand, you
piece of garbage!

00:14:57.831 --> 00:15:00.434
Who cares, even if I
can't see it?!

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:03.570
As long as I have
these, I'll triumph!

00:15:03.604 --> 00:15:06.373
[gobbling]

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.208
[yelling]

00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:11.111
He had even more of
those pills hidden
away!

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:14.147
That little... he's
preparing his final
strike.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.919
Boruto, Do it again.

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:22.723
Uh. But, Dad... I'm
not strong enough
to...

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.658
It's okay. You
got this.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.661
Mm.

00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:31.098
[growling]

00:15:37.304 --> 00:15:38.105
Mm.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:14.441
<i>It's so heavy! So,</i>
<i>this is Dad's... All</i>
<i>this weight.</i>

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:18.245
<i>What he went</i>
<i>through... to get</i>
<i>to this point...</i>

00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:22.549
Hm!

00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:24.918
I'm not losing today!

00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:28.622
Hmph! I see it!
You won't hit me
again!

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.591
You probably know,
but...

00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:32.559
We've only got one
chance.

00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:33.493
Let's go!

00:16:33.527 --> 00:16:34.294
All right!

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:37.431
[roaring]

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.104
Huh!

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:48.208
Such transparent
moves!

00:16:48.642 --> 00:16:49.710
Huh!

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.615
Heh!

00:16:58.352 --> 00:17:00.554
[grunting]

00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:02.289
Why you--!

00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:05.325
[yelling]

00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:09.630
The rest is up to you
now...

00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:10.631
...Boruto!

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.367
[grunting]

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.635
Uh!

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:18.038
Such impudence! Well,
it's too bad for you
now!

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:20.140
Guess we'll just see
about that!

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:22.743
[grunting]

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:23.744
[snarling]

00:17:23.777 --> 00:17:25.412
[yelling]

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.713
You the real one?

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:36.557
Ah!

00:17:38.292 --> 00:17:38.725
[snarling]

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:39.560
<i>Hey!</i>

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:41.428
I'm right here!

00:17:45.432 --> 00:17:47.367
Go... Boruto.

00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.069
Rasengan!

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:55.909
Heh. That was
actually pretty
close. But I'm not

00:17:55.943 --> 00:17:57.744
going to let you land
a hit on me again!

00:17:57.778 --> 00:17:59.613
I'm not done!

00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:02.749
[yelling]

00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:04.384
[bracing]

00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:06.320
[cowering]

00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:11.592
This is nothing to
me! You fool! I'm
Momoshiki Otsutsuki!

00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:16.396
[yelling]

00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:20.167
[yelling]

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:26.306
No! I can't be
defeated like this!

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.976
[yelling]

00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:39.253
<i>Can you sense my</i>
<i>presence... human</i>
<i>child?</i>

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:41.622
What the-?

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:47.961
Now I see... It appears
that you have strongly
inherited

00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:50.330
the powers of the
Otsutsuki...

00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:52.466
But you're still
inexperienced.

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:56.670
You aren't able to
use it to see ahead
into your own destiny.

00:18:56.703 --> 00:18:58.305
What's your
deal?! [gasping]

00:19:00.007 --> 00:19:03.777
But I... can see your
destiny quite well...

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.612
[lightly gasping]

00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:09.416
Heed this warning...
Beware, for those
blue eyes shall

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:10.951
eventually...

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.687
<i>... take everything</i>
<i>from you!</i>

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.490
And know this
as well...

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:18.759
That those who defeat
the gods...

00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:22.429
...cannot remain
ordinary individuals
any longer.

00:19:22.462 --> 00:19:24.798
Just what the hell
are you talking
about?!

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.300
And reflect well...

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:29.970
...upon thy fate as
you walk it...

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.472
...human child.

00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:45.152
[grunting]
So did Boruto--?

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.301
All right! He
actually did it!

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:03.437
[chuckling]

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.005
Magnificent.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.478
[gasping]

00:20:11.512 --> 00:20:15.616
[panicking]
What?!

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.451
Did I do all of this?

00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:20.487
Well, actually, it
was Boruto and the
enemy guy who called

00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:22.523
himself Momoshiki.

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:27.494
Ah, yes, of course. I
see. But, uh, why did
I do all that stuff?

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:34.568
[grunting]
Ow! Huh?

00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:37.004
Hey, wait...
Did I do it?!

00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:43.043
Mm.

00:20:44.178 --> 00:20:47.281
It ended up just like
I told you before.

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:48.248
Uh?

00:20:48.282 --> 00:20:50.517
The soul of a shinobi
never changes.

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:53.153
Even if the times do.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.155
You're right.

00:20:56.023 --> 00:20:59.092
He really is just
like you.

00:20:59.126 --> 00:21:01.128
[chuckling] Yeah,
ya think?!

00:21:01.161 --> 00:21:04.498
[chuckling] Well, I told
you, right? Ya loser.

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:06.600
Uh--[laughing]

00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.636
You're a total
mess.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.138
Look who's talking.

00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:12.906
Don't lump me in
with you.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.475
At least I'm still able
to stand up, right?

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:16.743
[chuckling]

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.483
I'd say that I won
this contest.

00:21:23.517 --> 00:21:25.452
Heh. Seems so...

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:29.323
Well... adding up all
of our matches so
far, I'd say that

00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:31.425
we're just about even
right now.

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:54.615
Human child, huh?

00:21:59.453 --> 00:22:01.321
Yeah, that's right.

00:22:01.355 --> 00:22:04.491
I'm the son of
Naruto Uzumaki...

00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:07.094
...Boruto Uzumaki!

00:23:44.892 --> 00:23:47.194
<i>You really are pretty</i>
<i>amazing.</i>

00:23:47.227 --> 00:23:50.430
You are the Seventh
Hokage's son and the
Fourth's grandson...

00:23:50.464 --> 00:23:51.798
<i>Hey, Boruto...</i>

00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:53.634
<i>You wanna be</i>
<i>Hokage...</i>

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:54.468
<i>... don't you?</i>

00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:57.304
To me, being Hokage
is only one path.

00:23:57.337 --> 00:23:59.907
Just 'cause my
grandpa and dad were
Hokage, that doesn't

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.142
mean I have to walk
the same one.

00:24:02.176 --> 00:24:05.479
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:05.512 --> 00:24:07.147
"My Story!"

00:24:07.181 --> 00:24:09.483
I've got my own
Ninja Way!
