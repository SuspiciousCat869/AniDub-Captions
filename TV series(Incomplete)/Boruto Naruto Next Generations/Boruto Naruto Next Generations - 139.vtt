WEBVTT

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:11.311
(light hearted music)

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.091
I think I found our target!

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.492
There's no mistake.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:26.527
That's the lost pet.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:30.364
Let's hurry up and catch it,

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.499
that way we can get
him back home quickly!

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.667
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.708
(cowering whimper)

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.412
(frightened fleeing)

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:46.446
[All] Aww!

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.016
I guess it got away, huh?

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.217
That's just great.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.085
It's all 'cause
Doushu scared him.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.188
Hey, it wasn't only my fault!

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
The way that rabbit was acting.

00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:58.458
He sure was afraid.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.029
Enko, what's the matter?

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.198
(chuckle) Oh, uh, it's nothing!

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.432
Really?

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.900
Are you sure?

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.069
Well, anyway, seems
we don't have worry

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.105
about Enko's powers going
out of control this time.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.640
[Both] Hm?

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.978
Because of these hands...

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.681
Even you guys are...

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.450
(shocked gasps)

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.160
Now? What bad timing!

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.595
A rampage, right now?

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.331
Don't worry about me, just...

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.665
Get away!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.069
No way! We can't just leave you!

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.238
Yeah! Doushu is right!

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.645
(losing control yell)

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:54.948
(shocked gasps)

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:57.985
(growling)

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:04.124
(angry roar)

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.596
(opening theme music)

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.186
(opening theme music)

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:51.732
-"The Terror! Enko Onikuma"
-(growling)

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:58.038
(suspenseful music)

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.778
We've gotta put some
space between us!

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.013
Right!

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.918
Not good.

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:12.085
We got to stop her.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.620
Yeah. All right!

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:14.821
Let's do this!

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:18.992
(growling)

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:20.694
(gasp)

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.769
Now, Doushu! Get her!

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:30.003
I'm on it!

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:42.416
It's no good!

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.951
Just use that thing!

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:45.185
Uh, right!

00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:04.438
If we keep having to use
the tranquilizer on Enko,

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.774
her body won't be able
to handle the stress.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.010
Yeah, but it's the only way.

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.484
[Mitsuki] If I recall correctly,

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:20.954
you're harboring a Possession
Type Summoning, aren't you?

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.290
It's the Secret Jutsu
of the Onikuma Clan.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.058
But it never went out of control

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:27.361
while we were still in
the Academy, did it?

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:29.329
And your ability has
actually helped us out

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:31.198
quite a bit on our missions.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.436
For some reason, lately
I can't control it.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.273
And your rampages even
got your jonin leader

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:42.075
sent to the hospital,
or so I heard.

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.311
I've heard people say
that our new leader

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.547
is supposed to be
assigned to us today.

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:56.557
You're Tsuru Itoi,
Doushu Goetsu,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.594
and Enko Onikuma from Team
40, isn't that correct?

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.466
[All] Uh, yes, sir!

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:10.504
I'm Captain of the Torture
and Interrogation Corps

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.472
Ibiki Morino.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:15.609
And I've been sent to
replace your injured leader.

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:18.445
Hold on, are you the Mr. Ibiki?

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.747
The torture and
interrogation pro.

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.218
I've heard it said he's the
Hidden Leaf's number one sadist.

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.353
C'mon, an interrogation pro?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.156
I mean, he just looks
intimidating, right?

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:30.924
Ah, I see.

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.694
You must be Lord Seventh's son.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.395
Nice to meet you.

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:36.730
Oh, uh, yeah!

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:42.636
Now then, tell me all about
your most recent mischief.

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:43.570
What?

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:46.540
I, uh haven't done
anything of the kind!

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:50.611
What're you doing?

00:06:50.644 --> 00:06:53.814
What you're feeling is just
a tenth of my full strength.

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:54.948
It would be quite interesting

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:56.917
to see how much
more you can handle.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.219
Okay! I secretly ate
a bunch of snacks

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:02.756
and hid all the
evidence from my mom!

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.291
You barely lasted a second.

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:06.093
So uncool.

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:09.229
But why are you the one
who's being sent to our team?

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:10.197
Hm.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.299
(frightened flinching)

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:13.333
Hm.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.068
What's wrong?

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:16.503
You scared of me?

00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:17.905
Uh, 'course not!

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.640
No! That isn't it!

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:30.817
It's sudden, but I'm
disbanding Team 40 immediately.

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:33.020
I'll team up with
Enko moving forward.

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:34.588
(shocked gasps)

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:38.325
W-what do you mean by that?

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:42.696
You two are too afraid to
stop Enko, isn't that correct?

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:44.865
Well, that's...

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:49.069
Seems Enko's skills will be
useful during interrogations.

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:51.605
It won't be a problem if
we have tranquilizers.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.908
But that stuff really
isn't good for Enko!

00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:56.343
Somehow, for her sake,

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:58.579
we'll both try to
get over our fears!

00:07:59.513 --> 00:08:02.216
I've tortured many
people over the years.

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:04.685
No one can overcome their fears.

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.624
But once you get to my level,

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.527
you no longer feel fear at all.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.064
(comically frightened)

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.699
(frightened, creeped-out)

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:25.038
Enko, I'll be able to
put you to good use.

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:26.240
Come along.

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.041
Uh, okay.

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:29.943
If I can be of help, then.

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:31.512
Wait, Enko?

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.080
You're kidding, right?

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:34.915
It's all settled, then.

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:37.084
The two of you will
be notified later on

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:39.586
of the new teams that
you're being assigned to.

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.157
All right, let's go.

00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:01.208
[Tsuru] You don't think
she agreed to go with him

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:03.777
cause she didn't want
to be with us, do you?

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.146
No way! Of course not!

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.282
It's just, if they
handle her like that,

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:09.950
they're gonna wear her out.

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:13.020
Yeah, I know, but what
else can we do now?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.856
We just need to find a
way to overcome our fear.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:19.159
But Mr. Ibiki said that no
one can overcome their fears.

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:20.561
He probably just lied to us

00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:23.197
because he wants to
use Enko's powers!

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:26.967
Yeah, maybe you're right.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.802
Are you two doing okay?

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:30.070
Hey guys!

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:31.305
After seeing what
happened earlier,

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:32.806
we didn't want to just leave you

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.741
to deal with this
all on your own.

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:35.843
Boruto.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.778
If there's anything
we can do to help,

00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:39.313
please just let us know!

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:42.482
[Both] Actually...

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:44.218
[Sarada] If you wanna
overcome your fears,

00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.386
you need to study psychology!

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:48.689
Oh, I get it!

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:49.823
That's good thinking, Sarada!

00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:52.192
Well, I just hope
we'll be able to find

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:54.294
some useful tips in this book.

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:56.163
Let's see...

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:59.600
"If one's curiosity is
able to surpass one's fear,

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.769
"then it becomes possible to
change fear into enjoyment

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.171
"Generally speaking,

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:06.173
"visiting haunted houses
and watching horror movies

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:07.808
"are examples of this growth."

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:09.476
So then what's that mean?

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.612
I wonder if maybe that
book could be saying

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:14.915
that you need to start
thinking that fear is fun?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:15.983
All right!

00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:17.818
Let's watch a scary
movie tomorrow!

00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:20.954
Tsuru, Doushu, let
your training begin!

00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:22.389
"Movie Theater"

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:25.792
(mild stunned gasps)

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:28.695
(terrified gasps)

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:36.870
That was really scary, huh?

00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:39.273
Well actually...

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.041
It didn't bother me at all.

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:45.012
You're really the only one
who was scared by that.

00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:49.583
How's this for the
next one that we try?

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:52.319
"One possible method that
can be used to conquer fear

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:54.555
"is to become so accustomed
to the discomfort

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:55.589
"of the feeling of anxiety

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:57.891
"that your body learns
that it's actually safe

00:10:57.925 --> 00:10:59.826
"to experience it."

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.229
So does that mean?

00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:05.032
To get used to Enko when
she's out of control?

00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:08.202
Yeah, if only it was
as easy as saying that!

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:10.270
Although, maybe we can test it

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.039
with something that's similar?

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:13.707
Oh, I see.

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:17.244
With something
that's similar, huh?

00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:22.683
(upbeat music)

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:27.688
There's a ferocious
beast caged up in here.

00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:28.689
Ferocious?

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.123
What kind do you mean?

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.393
(frightened gasps)

00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:35.562
(growling)

00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:40.033
You're saying we have
to get used to this?

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:42.035
We have permission to be here.

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:43.170
Don't you guys think

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.572
that this is a good
substitute for Enko?

00:11:45.606 --> 00:11:48.509
We might get killed before
we can get used to it!

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.810
It does seem dangerous.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:51.411
Should we call it quits?

00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:53.013
No way!

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.348
Let's go!

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:57.184
We've gotta get Enko
back on our team!

00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:02.489
(frightened squeal)

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:04.992
(growling)

00:12:07.461 --> 00:12:12.466
(birds chirping)

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.373
It's better things turned
out this way, isn't it?

00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:28.182
I just, I don't want
them to hate me anymore.

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:29.550
[Ibiki] There you are.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.419
Oh, Mr. Ibiki!

00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:43.197
(groans)

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.701
Did that even accomplish
anything at all?

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:49.736
I think you're just
supposed to get through it

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.971
little by little.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:54.875
I guess you're right.

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:57.244
We have to do it till
we get used to it.

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:01.081
Huh? What's the matter?

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.217
It's just, what Mr.
Ibiki said about

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.053
no one overcoming their
fears has been bugging me.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.823
Maybe I'm just over thinking it.

00:13:09.857 --> 00:13:10.824
(meow)

00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:12.259
Oh, a cat!

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.328
It's so cute!

00:13:17.998 --> 00:13:19.366
Don't worry, it's okay!

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.701
-We're not scary.
-Come on.

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.035
Come here, little guy.

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:26.006
(leaping away scared)

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.341
What's the deal?

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:29.710
We didn't even do anything,
and it got scared!

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:34.314
What could possibly
be so scary about us?

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:37.951
Your team's former
leader reported

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.353
that your thoughts and feelings

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:43.023
have been triggering your
summoning to go out of control.

00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:45.325
You've noticed it
yourself, haven't you?

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:52.165
Soon after this Secret
Jutsu was passed down to me,

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:54.434
a friend accidentally saw me.

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:01.041
And they became so afraid.

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:02.843
After that happened,

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:05.879
I put on these gloves so
no one else would see.

00:14:05.913 --> 00:14:08.081
And everything seemed okay.

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:11.151
[Ibiki] Tsuru and Doushu saw
your powers during a mission

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:13.120
and became afraid of you, right?

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:15.956
Yes.

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.891
I keep remembering the
looks on their faces

00:14:17.925 --> 00:14:19.126
when that happened.

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:24.498
Being feared by others leads
to feelings of loneliness.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.667
And that's how
your heart weakens.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.671
So I removed you.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.573
I did it all for your sake.

00:14:34.508 --> 00:14:36.610
Don't worry about
your teammates.

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:40.047
I'll make sure they're
assigned to a new team shortly.

00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.182
Not again!

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:48.055
No!

00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:50.624
Please get away!

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.759
I can't suppress it.

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:53.994
Just go!

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.369
(angry growl)

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:08.876
I just can't stay
here any longer!

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.110
Goodbye!

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:15.582
I didn't think she'd go
on a rampage so soon!

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.822
[Tsuru] That's Mr. Ibiki!

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:23.290
Gather the unit.

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:26.960
I'll try using a sealing first,
but if that doesn't work,

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:29.530
we're just going to have
to cut off her arms.

00:15:30.998 --> 00:15:32.599
Did something happen to Enko?

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.469
Oh, it's you.

00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:38.505
She's lost control and is
trying to leave the village.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.141
Just wait here.

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:43.010
You can't handle this.

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:45.712
You said you might have
to cut off her arms!

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:49.716
This is really bad!

00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:57.124
(dramatic music)

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:03.197
(growls)

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:10.871
She's totally out of control!

00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:12.072
Enko.

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:15.509
(aggressive growling)

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:23.884
If you're scared, stay back!

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:25.886
Mr. Ibiki, please
give us a chance!

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:28.021
I'm not sure if we
can do it, but...

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.623
No, wait!
We have to!

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.657
There's no choice!

00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:35.229
Splitting you three up

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:37.598
might've been a
really bad decision.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.537
Listen, Enko's rage is
triggered by her loneliness.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.538
It is?

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:46.673
So, what does that mean?

00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:48.442
You two are the cause of it.

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:57.618
Are the two of you okay?

00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.652
Yes!

00:16:59.052 --> 00:17:00.721
(growling)

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.658
(roar)

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.568
[Both] Mr. Ibiki!

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:18.238
Enko!

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.542
(growling)

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:24.511
[Doushu] We selfishly
distanced ourselves from you.

00:17:27.114 --> 00:17:29.249
Oh it's so cute.

00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:31.151
Don't worry, it's okay!

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:32.219
-We're not scary.
-Come on.

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:33.587
Come here, little guy.

00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:35.122
(meow)

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:36.390
(gasp)

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.091
What's the deal?

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:40.561
We didn't even do anything,
and it got scared!

00:17:40.594 --> 00:17:43.697
You know, back when that cat
got scared of you and me,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.332
it made me really sad.

00:17:48.569 --> 00:17:49.570
Hm?

00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:53.240
Because of these hands

00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:56.243
even you guys are...

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.280
You must've felt so
incredibly lonely

00:18:00.314 --> 00:18:02.649
when you saw that we
were scared of you.

00:18:03.584 --> 00:18:05.485
But honestly, we weren't
even thinking about

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:06.587
how you felt then.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.193
[Tsuru] Now I know that's
what loneliness truly is.

00:18:14.728 --> 00:18:16.029
You went with Mr. Ibiki

00:18:16.063 --> 00:18:18.365
because he wouldn't be
afraid of you, didn't you?

00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:21.034
[Doushu] We didn't
even realize that.

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.072
[Both] Well, we're not gonna

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:28.275
let you feel lonely ever again.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.309
Enko!

00:18:34.047 --> 00:18:35.883
You two! Get away now!

00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:36.884
[Both] Enko!

00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:38.318
Please come back!

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:44.358
We're never gonna let you--

00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:47.628
Feel alone again,
we promise you that!

00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:50.464
(attacking yell)

00:18:56.837 --> 00:19:02.042
(inspiring music)

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:15.656
(sobbing)

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:18.458
Sorry for everything.

00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:21.061
For being afraid of you.

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:25.065
(sobbing)

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:32.372
Tsuru and Doushu...

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.441
I'm sorry as well!

00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:40.347
(laughter)

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.381
Oh!

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:44.351
Here!

00:19:44.384 --> 00:19:45.352
This is yours.

00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:48.288
You wouldn't completely
be you without it, Enko.

00:19:48.322 --> 00:19:50.457
(chuckles)

00:19:53.994 --> 00:19:55.495
Thank you.

00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:57.731
(laughter)

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:04.438
When people are feared,
they feel lonely.

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:06.673
Mr. Ibiki.

00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:10.344
Enko's heart was weakened
because of loneliness.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:13.447
That is the reason she
couldn't control herself.

00:20:15.582 --> 00:20:18.552
But, you know, thanks
to you two guys,

00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:21.688
I was able to get things
under control again.

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:23.423
Thank you so much for that!

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:24.825
[Unison] Aww, Enko!

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:27.961
So, being lonely
because people fear you.

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:30.130
Was that the case
with you, Mr. Ibiki?

00:20:35.569 --> 00:20:36.570
Who can say?

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:47.581
(scared whimper)

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:52.319
(growling)

00:20:55.122 --> 00:20:56.290
Look, it's trapped!

00:20:56.323 --> 00:20:57.090
Let's help!

00:20:57.124 --> 00:20:58.825
(attacking roar)

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:02.062
(frightened squeal)

00:21:03.997 --> 00:21:05.199
All right!

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:13.040
Enko!

00:21:20.647 --> 00:21:22.983
(chuckle)

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:25.452
(laughing)

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.521
(proud chuckle)

00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:31.692
You see?

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:32.726
Don't be scared!

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:38.732
You're so cute!

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:43.937
The mission's complete,
but don't breathe easy,

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:46.340
since Team 40's
under my leadership.

00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:47.140
Got it?

00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:48.375
[Unison] Yes, sir!

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:54.615
Guess it's not scared
of Ibiki Sensei either.

00:21:54.648 --> 00:21:56.650
Hey, do something here, will ya!

00:21:57.918 --> 00:22:00.053
You look so sweet
holding it, Ibiki Sensei!

00:22:00.921 --> 00:22:05.058
(chuckles/laughter)

00:22:13.133 --> 00:22:18.305
(closing theme music)

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.825
Hey, Inojin, is something wrong?

00:23:44.858 --> 00:23:46.627
Huh? Why?

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.364
Well, I mean, you didn't
even call me "Chubs" earlier!

00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:53.433
Something is bothering you
deep down inside, isn't there?

00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:55.402
I was just thinking
about something

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:57.571
that I need to
grow as a shinobi.

00:23:58.572 --> 00:24:02.142
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:02.176 --> 00:24:05.612
"The Mind Transfer Jutsu
that Lost to Potato Chips"

00:24:05.646 --> 00:24:06.547
I've decided!

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.316
I'm going to master the
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:24:11.251 --> 00:24:16.456
