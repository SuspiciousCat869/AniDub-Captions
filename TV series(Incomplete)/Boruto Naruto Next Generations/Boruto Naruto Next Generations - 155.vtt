00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:09.243
(rain pounding)

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:14.081
(feet stomping)

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:21.955
(Mikazuki meowing)

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.992
Mikazuki, Hello.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.627
What are you doing here?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.363
(rain pounding)

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.703
(feet stomping)

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.577
(Mitsuki sighing)

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.078
(Mikazuki meowing)

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:48.982
Hey, so does this little
guy belong to you?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.685
Who are you?

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.721
(Samidare grunting)

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.733
(serene music)

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.472
(Samidare grunting)

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.807
[Mitsuki] Are you awake?

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:17.044
(Samidare groaning)

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.647
What's going on?

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.483
What are you some kind of
medical ninja or something?

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:24.284
No, I'm not.

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.620
I just know some first aid.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.122
Well, it certainly appears
that I owe you one.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:32.559
Actually thank Mikazuki,
that's who found you?

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:33.594
Mikazuki?

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.464
(Mikazuki meowing)

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.632
Oh, I see.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.968
So this guy's name is Mikazuki.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.970
Well, thank you very
much little guy.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.972
And my name is Samidare.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:46.373
My name is Mitsuki.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.376
I'll bring you a little
something to help you warm up.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.679
Ah, aren't you gonna ask?

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:56.116
I mean, why I was lying on
the ground back there wounded?

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.519
To be honest, I don't
really care either way.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.588
Or is it that you
wanted me to ask you?

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.290
(serene music)

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.225
(laughing) You're
kind of a weird guy,

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.828
you know that? (laughing)

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.997
(mikazuki meowing)

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.998
(opening theme music)

00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.035
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.734
(door scrapping)

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.335
(feet stomping)

00:03:55.369 --> 00:04:00.073
I'm back, your
wounds all better?

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.710
Yeah, well kinda, but I feel
bad inconveniencing you.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.049
But I don't really
mind having you here.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.617
Do you have a place to go?

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.786
Actually, I came here
to the Leaf Village

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.954
to see my little sister.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:14.955
Sister?

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.190
That's right.

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.526
She's employed by
a big company here.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.062
I hate sounding like the
proud big brother cliche

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.830
but she's really got
her stuff together.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.232
I see.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.068
Hey, now what's up with that
bored look on your face.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.570
No, that's not it.

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.371
It's just that I have
a very close friend

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.941
who has a soft spot for
his little sister too.

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:35.309
I don't have one myself,

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:36.844
but it seems like little sisters

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:38.679
are dear to their big brothers.

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:41.048
(laughing) Yeah, of course.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.819
Although I'm a horrible
heartless big brother,

00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:47.187
ever since my sister moved here

00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:49.489
I never even bothered to
come visit her until now.

00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:52.593
I always made excuses, like
being too busy with work.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:56.129
(sighing) Even so, at
least you're here now.

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:59.399
I suppose so, although
I'm a little too late.

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.367
Hmm.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.803
Oh yeah, you saved
me from appearing

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.071
to be even more heartless.

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:05.539
So I'd really like
to do something

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:06.507
to show you my gratitude.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.675
That's okay, please
don't worry about it.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.412
No, not you, I ment Mikazuki.

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.316
[Female Employee]
Thanks for coming by.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.052
(bell chiming)

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.922
Well, there you go done.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:23.390
(Mikazuki meowing)

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:24.258
A bell?

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.093
Yeah and it looks good on you.

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:28.262
Now it'll be easier
to know where you are.

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.798
Although it isn't as if
Mikazuki is actually my cat.

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.467
What are you talking about?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.203
Mikazuki's super attached
to you, just look.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.640
-(Mikazuki meowing)
-(bell chiming)

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.275
And to you as well apparently.

00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.579
Thanking me for the collar, huh?

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.448
You seem to have quite a
strong sense of duty for a cat.

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:49.850
(Samidare laughing)

00:05:49.883 --> 00:05:51.485
There, there. (laughing)

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.987
I must say you do
have a way with cats.

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.389
Do you have one?

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:56.323
Oh no.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.225
But my little sister
used to have one

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:00.194
and that's the reason
why I was so shocked

00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:02.029
when I heard the name earlier.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.798
My little sister
has the same name,

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.700
she's called Mikazuki as well.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.102
Wow, that's quite a coincidence.

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:10.904
Just imagine the
look on her face

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.773
when she finds out about this.

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:15.075
(Mikazuki meowing)

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.810
Yeah, I think you're right.

00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:19.680
I bet that it would
have made her smile.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.316
[Boruto] Hey Mitsuki.

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:31.024
Anyway, you guys take
care, Mitsuki and Mikazuki.

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:32.826
Hey, who was that?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.494
Someone I just
met the other day.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.230
He's a friend of
mine and Mikazuki's

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:38.332
and Mikazuki's older brother.

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.501
-Mikazuki's?
-Older brother?

00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:43.804
Look nevermind that,
we've been summoned.

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.038
Right.

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.708
[Boruto] A security mission.

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:49.409
That's right.

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:52.646
Mr. Kaneki the president
of the Kaneki Corporation

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.248
needs bodyguards.

00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:55.582
[Sarada] That's that
chemical company

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:58.185
that's as big as the
Kaminarimon Company, right?

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.854
After the investigation
we conducted

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:02.956
we believe the
likelihood is very high,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.525
that he's gonna
be the next target

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:05.926
of The Rainy Day Killer.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.327
The Rainy Day Killer.

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:09.730
The guy who's always
on the news lately.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.131
Hmm.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.367
Yes, that's the serial
killer we're after.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.501
Our reputation's at stake here,

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:17.037
so we have to find
him and bring him in.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.272
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:20.340
Their crimes are always
committed on rainy days,

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:22.209
that's why they
got the nickname.

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:23.243
[Kotaro] All of his victims

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:24.811
were determined to
have been stabbed

00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:27.080
with something thin and sharp.

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:29.917
But the specific murder weapon
is still a mystery to us.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.051
There's a high probability

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:33.086
that the perpetrator
is a Shinobi.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.454
But the ages and occupations

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:36.924
of the three victims
are all different

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.193
so there doesn't seem
to be a connection.

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:40.827
Actually during
our investigation

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:43.330
we uncovered an
unusual commonality.

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:47.634
You see the Kaneki
Corporation chemical plant

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:49.069
exploded two years ago.

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:51.438
It caused some serious damage.

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.308
You mean all the murder victims

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.577
were somehow connected
to that instance.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.644
That's right.

00:07:57.678 --> 00:07:59.613
All of them were involved
with the same project

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.115
or with the investigation
into the accident.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:03.917
But why have they
all been targeted

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:06.086
by the Rainy Day
Killer recently then?

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.321
We don't know that.

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:08.922
however, the only
remaining survivor

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:11.458
connected to the incident
is President Kaneki.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.392
Of course.

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:14.194
So that's why the
chances are high

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:16.196
that he's the next target, huh.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.367
All right, we're on it.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.737
We'll catch The Rainy Day
Killer, no problem, you know.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.340
I'm gonna head over to
Kaneki's residents right now.

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:28.475
I want you three
to come with me.

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:30.410
[All] Yes, sir.

00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:34.414
(birds chirping)

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:40.354
Hold on. What do you mean you
don't need a security detail?

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:43.056
Huh, because why would
I even be targeted

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.325
by The Rainy Day Killer
in the first place?

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.528
I don't know
anything about that.

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:48.829
Leave immediately.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.964
I don't have any
need of your guards.

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:52.199
If anything were to happen,

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:54.401
my own bodyguards would suffice.

00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:58.739
Please, excuse me.

00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:06.180
(all sighing)

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:12.119
Mr. Kotaro really
knows what he's doing.

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:13.820
Leaving us here to
secretly keep an eye

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:15.389
on President Kaneki like this.

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:17.591
Come on, would you
please take the situation

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:18.926
more seriously?

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:21.595
President Kaneki's
attitude is very suspicious

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:22.596
but right now protecting him

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:25.065
from whoever's after
him is our top priority.

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:26.867
Mr. Kotaro said so himself.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.302
Yeah, I know that.

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:30.938
Since we've been given
the responsibility

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:33.273
I'm gonna make sure
nobody else gets hurt.

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:37.411
(sighing) Rain.

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:40.180
(rain pounding)

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:52.159
(thunder clapping)

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:02.302
(brooding music)

00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:04.805
Do you think the perp's
actually gonna show up.

00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:07.174
I don't know, but if
he still gives it a try

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:10.043
despite all of the security
that's present here today.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:13.213
Yeah, then that would
mean that the perp

00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:16.450
is determined to get his target,
no matter what the cost is.

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:19.486
There.

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:21.788
[Guards] Who's there.

00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:22.956
[Guard] Halt

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.191
-(feet stomping)
-(brooding music)

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:25.526
-[Guard] What.
-(guards groaning)

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:29.696
(Killer's coat whooshing)

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.732
(guards thudding)

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:32.733
(door banging)

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:35.435
(feet stomping)

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:38.071
(guards groaning)

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:39.640
What's going on?

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:44.611
Oh (screaming)

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:50.417
(thunder clapping)

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:57.991
-(brooding music)
-(feet stomping)

00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.293
Ah, ah, ah.

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:04.031
Just who, who are you?

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.901
Can't be, impossible, are you-

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:08.902
(fist thudding)

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:09.903
(Kaneki retching)

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:12.606
(brooding music)

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:21.415
(kunai swooshing)

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:24.218
(killer gasping)

00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:26.687
That's as far as you go.

00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:31.692
(hands swooshing)

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:36.930
Hey come back.

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:37.998
On it.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:38.999
[Sarada] Be careful.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.467
(feet stomping)

00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:43.203
(brooding music)

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:46.807
Multiple striking shadow sticks.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.344
(shadow sticks whooshing)

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.451
(water whooshing)

00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:00.220
(rain pounding)

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:05.125
What jutsu did he just use?

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.627
I didn't even see anything.

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.800
Sorry, he got away.

00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:16.036
He was actually
able to evade you.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:17.171
Who is this guy?

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:18.672
Well, at least we
were able to make sure

00:12:18.705 --> 00:12:20.040
the president stayed safe.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.342
Still despite his talk
about not knowing anything

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:24.912
Kaneki ended up being
the target after all.

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:27.681
(rain pounding)

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.121
(people chattering)

00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:37.024
[Mitsuki] Were you able
to see your little sister?

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.761
Yeah, kinda, but then
she yelled at me.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:43.564
It's been so long.

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:45.933
She asked me what the
hell I thought I was doing

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:47.734
showing up here
after all this time?

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:52.105
Tell me you're a ninja, right?

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:54.007
And a formidable one at that.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.611
Well I was, but I quit.

00:12:58.312 --> 00:13:00.047
For years I worked like a dog,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.349
obediently following
the orders I was given.

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:05.619
But these days I'm living
carefree, just like a cat does.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.389
Next up on the news.

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:12.059
We have an update on
the serial murders case.

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:13.327
Yesterday, the President Kaneki

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.963
of the Kaneki
Corporation was attacked.

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:17.164
Luckily-

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:18.799
[Samidare] What troubling
times we live in.

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:20.067
Agreed.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.969
By the way, what was
your specialty Jutsu

00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:23.971
back when you were a ninja?

00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:26.440
And why exactly do
you wanna know that?

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.374
Just curious.

00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:31.044
-(serene music)
-(feet stomping)

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:33.247
(Mikazuki meowing)

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.915
Mikazuki, hey
there, little buddy.

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:35.916
What's the matter?

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:36.984
You okay?

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:38.819
Are you hungry or something?

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:41.555
Huh, so why did you
quit being a ninja?

00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:45.092
Hey, what's up?

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:47.928
I thought that you weren't
interested in personal stuff.

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.763
Oh yes you're right.

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.235
At the time when my
family needed me the most,

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:57.037
I couldn't be there for them.

00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:00.340
That's the reason
why I came here now

00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:03.443
even though it's really
too little too late.

00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:08.982
(birds chirping)

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:10.384
All right now.

00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:13.353
President Kaneki has finally
agreed to let us guard him.

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:15.322
Well, I mean, after
being attacked like that

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.990
it's really the obvious choice.

00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:18.725
But there's something
I don't understand,

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:22.095
why did he try to take
President Kaneki with him?

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.864
Up until now all of the victims

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.832
were just killed on
the spot, weren't they

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:27.835
That's definitely a mystery.

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.937
And speaking of mystery, Mitsuki

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.738
you saw the perps Jutsu, right?

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:35.642
Yes, but I'm afraid that I
wasn't able to identify it.

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:38.111
(flashback whooshing)

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:42.583
Unexplained actions along
with an unidentifiable Jutsu,

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:44.284
man, I'm just totally lost here.

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:46.820
But still, we do know
that all of this started

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:48.722
with the factory
explosion two years ago.

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:51.058
That fact's
irrefutable, isn't it?

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:52.259
It seems almost certain

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.628
that president Kaneki
is hiding something.

00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:58.265
By the way, what was the cause
of the accident back then.

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:00.234
A lack of oversight by
the project developer

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:02.536
who passed away in the accident.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:04.671
Do you have the records
on those involved?

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.173
Yes, here you go.

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:10.544
This is-

00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:14.381
There's trouble, Mr.
Kaneki's missing.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.382
What?

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.583
(feet stomping)

00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:19.920
(brooding music)

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:21.255
The perp disguised himself

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:23.991
as a member of the
police force and escaped,

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:26.360
right after he knocked
out two guards.

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.495
Ah, he tricked us into thinking

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:31.198
his M. O. was only attacking
when it's raining.

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:33.000
Split up and search for them.

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.201
[Officers] Sir.

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:36.503
We oughta go too.

00:15:36.537 --> 00:15:37.504
Yeah.

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:39.406
(feet stomping)

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.708
Hmm, Could it be?

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:44.545
(brooding music)

00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:58.358
(Kaneki groaning)

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:03.797
Oh, so you're awake now, huh?

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.199
I've made it my mind.

00:16:05.232 --> 00:16:08.135
I'm going to kill you right
here in front of this gravestone

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:15.075
Mikazuki Amaashi, were
you connected to her?

00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:16.543
You started panicking

00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:18.045
that arrival company
would surpass you.

00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:19.246
You ignored all the risks

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:22.182
and pushed ahead with
that dangerous project.

00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:24.585
That tragedy was the
result of your haste.

00:16:24.618 --> 00:16:26.854
(explosion thundering)

00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:28.789
(Kaneki sobbing)

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.591
The dead tell no tales.

00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:32.226
She lies here in a cold grave,

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:34.194
all because of what
you did back then.

00:16:34.228 --> 00:16:35.662
She was blamed for everything,

00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:39.333
her reputation ruined while you
gained more wealth and fame.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:41.368
Does that sound
like justice to you?

00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:42.336
Forgive me.

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:44.972
Don't bother asking
me for forgiveness

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:46.707
ask Mikazuki.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.543
(hands whooshing)

00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:53.680
(brooding music)

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.720
(Kaneki sobbing)

00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:08.228
Your younger sister
is buried here, right?

00:17:08.262 --> 00:17:12.232
Yeah, I'm impressed
you managed to find me.

00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:15.068
It's because I found the
name, Mikazuki in the records.

00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:18.372
And I looked up the
location of her grave.

00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:20.974
It was quite a long time
after everything had happened,

00:17:21.008 --> 00:17:23.577
that I finally learned
she had died.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.847
All I thought about before
that, was my missions.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.549
I'm a terrible big brother.

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:33.053
And that's why I wanted
to relieve any regrets

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:34.454
she might've had.

00:17:34.488 --> 00:17:36.390
And by that you mean
killing off anyone

00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:38.392
who ruined your
sister's reputation?

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:40.594
You probably won't believe
me when I say this,

00:17:40.627 --> 00:17:43.530
but at first I didn't intend
on killing them at all.

00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:45.532
(dramatic music)

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:48.101
All I wanted to do was
find out the truth.

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:51.104
I knew that Mikazuki
wasn't the kind of person

00:17:51.138 --> 00:17:53.073
who'd ever move forward
with an experiment

00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:54.541
if it was too risky.

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:00.848
Once I'd managed to
uncover the truth

00:18:00.881 --> 00:18:03.317
not one of those
responsible felt any guilt

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.053
about what had happened
to my little sister.

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.956
They just made excuses,
begged for their lives

00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:11.491
and made reckless remarks
slandering the dead.

00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:13.060
[Mitsuki] That's
why you killed them?

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.394
Yeah I killed them.

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:17.698
And when I kill him,
it'll finally all be over.

00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:19.466
Please listen to be Mitsuki,

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:22.436
you're not a target so I
don't want you involved.

00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:25.506
I just wish you
wouldn't interfere.

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:28.075
I'm a Hidden Leaf Shinobi,
I owe this village.

00:18:29.877 --> 00:18:32.246
Which means I can't
let you do it.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.647
I see.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.917
You know it appears to me that
you're caught in a dilemma.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.151
What did you say?

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.123
You must have known that
I was a Leaf Shinobi,

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:45.058
almost immediately

00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:48.695
but didn't keep your
sister's name hidden from me.

00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:49.930
If you were truly determined

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.032
to go through with
seeking revenge

00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.637
a mistake like that
would be unthinkable.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.374
If the injury from when we met
was from your third victim,

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:03.043
then perhaps your
hesitance had increased

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:05.846
and you allowed your
foe to counter attack.

00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.848
Also the fact that I'm here now-

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:09.283
You're making too
much of nothing.

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:11.818
I'm totally confident that
I could kill you right now

00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:14.354
if I had to, that's
just the truth.

00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:18.625
(rain pounding)

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:25.098
You won't be able to
see through my jutsu.

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:37.444
(palms whooshing)

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:39.780
Water style needles
of falling rain.

00:19:39.813 --> 00:19:43.016
(needles whooshing)

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:47.688
Lightning Style,
snake Lightning.

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:50.591
(sparks clicking)

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:10.444
You saw right through it,

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.480
you know what my jutsu's about.

00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:16.250
You infuse chakra needles

00:20:16.283 --> 00:20:18.051
into the rain as it falls.

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.388
I surmised that since
you attack in the rain,

00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:24.625
you'd use a Jutsu that
would take advantage of it.

00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:27.928
I was able to ward it off
because I could sense the doubts

00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.330
that you've secretly
been harboring.

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:32.332
(somber music)

00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:34.635
My wound was merely hurting me.

00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:36.236
I really was trying to kill you,

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.739
because I do anything
for my sister's sake.

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:45.078
(palms whooshing)

00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:48.682
(needles whooshing)

00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:51.718
(Samidare groaning)

00:20:52.886 --> 00:20:58.091
Sorry, please give
Mikazuki my best.

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.864
(bell chiming)

00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:06.600
(somber music)

00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:12.973
I won't let you die.

00:21:13.006 --> 00:21:15.676
(somber music)

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.521
Really, Mitsuki isn't here yet?

00:21:27.554 --> 00:21:30.490
No, he's probably just
making a stop there first.

00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:32.826
I see you were able
to save his life

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.994
but they still don't know

00:21:34.027 --> 00:21:35.662
if he'll wake up
from the coma or not.

00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:37.364
[Announcer] They're
reopening the investigation

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:39.333
to look into the
cause of an explosion

00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:41.401
at a chemical plant
two years ago.

00:21:41.435 --> 00:21:44.071
(somber music)

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:49.009
I'll visit again.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:54.281
(door scrapping)

00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:06.760
(bell chiming)

00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:16.069
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.390
(playful music)

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:46.193
[Chocho] In my Super Cho-Cho
butterfly mode slim form,

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:49.062
am I not the total
epitome of charm?

00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:51.532
But I'm powered down
whenever I use it.

00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:55.102
The most important thing is
that I can't stay like this.

00:23:55.135 --> 00:23:57.905
I need to master my super
Chocho butterfly mode,

00:23:57.938 --> 00:24:00.174
more, more, more.

00:24:00.207 --> 00:24:03.710
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:05.712
I Can't Stay in My Slim Form.

00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:06.914
If I stay like this

00:24:06.947 --> 00:24:09.283
then I'll just be
stuck as a cute maiden.

00:24:11.818 --> 00:24:17.024
(closing theme music)
