WEBVTT

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:09.209
(worrisome music)

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.751
Urashiki!

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.954
[Urashiki] Just as I figured,
you got here before me.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:21.955
How vexing!

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.757
You're always getting in my way!

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.127
Uh, just who is this guy?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.963
(chuckles) I've
wanted to meet you

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:33.166
for a long time, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.101
Huh?

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.069
Hold on, you know who I am?

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.204
Why, of course!

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.106
You're very famous, after all!

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.041
-(weapon swooshing)
-(Naruto gasping)

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.078
(sword swishing)

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.814
(anxious music)

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.082
Let's get out of here!

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:50.717
[Urashiki] You're too late.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.720
(Naruto gasping)

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.490
Naruto!

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.226
No way!

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.096
Your chakra's mine now!

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.834
(opening theme music)

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.704
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:38.058
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.203
(Naruto gasping)

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.672
(weapon whooshing)

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.707
(Urashiki laughing)

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.445
[Urashiki] What's going on?

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.715
What did he just try to do?

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.619
Why can't I extract his chakra?

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:08.755
[Sasuke] Is it because
of the Sealing Jutsu?

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.123
I don't get what just happened.

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:11.959
Why didn't his attack work?

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:13.727
I don't really
know what you did,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.629
but I won't go easy on anyone

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:18.465
who springs a surprise
attack on me, you know!

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:21.969
You hear me?

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:23.837
No, stop!

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.572
You leave me no choice.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:26.573
(Naruto yelling)

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:27.574
Oh, no!

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:28.575
-(weapon whooshing)
-What?

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.177
Damn it, what is this?

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.680
Hey, let me go!

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:34.915
(Naruto groaning)

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.985
Now then, let's try
something else, shall we?

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:40.654
(Sasuke swooshing)

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:45.092
Seems your strength hasn't
fully returned just yet.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:47.728
All your movements
are still very slow.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.963
[Sasuke] Damn it!

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.298
Oh, man!

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.001
My research took way longer
than I thought it would!

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:55.469
Hold on, what's this?

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.940
Wait, Naruto!

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.408
[Boruto] Take this!

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.442
Huh?

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.447
(Boruto yelling)

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.216
[Jiraiya] Hold on.

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:13.587
This is bad!

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.455
What the hell's going on?

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.857
Who is that guy?

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.959
It looks like intruders
will keep showing up

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.427
if I stay here.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.428
(Naruto groaning)

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.729
Hey, let me go!

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:26.366
[Urashiki] Now that I've
secured Naruto Uzumaki,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.169
I have no more business
with the rest of you.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.539
(boulders thumping)

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:34.842
(Boruto groaning)

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.545
(ground rumbling)

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.448
(Naruto groaning)

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.449
Naruto!

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.817
Damn you!

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:46.620
(ground rumbling)

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.601
Come on!

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.672
All right, then, farewell!

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.442
(rock rumbling)

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.947
Let me out of his
stupid thread, you jerk!

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.950
Your stupidity was
really quite helpful.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.253
I had thought you were
smart even as a child,

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.455
but it seems that's not true.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:22.456
(Naruto groaning)

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.257
Shut up!

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.491
I'm not stupid, you know!

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.560
Anyway, there's
no need to panic.

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:28.529
I'm certain that soon
enough I'll figure out

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:31.198
why your chakra
can't be extracted.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.671
(Boruto groaning)

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:38.805
[Boruto] Come on!

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:39.907
It won't break!

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.808
Don't you think you
oughta fill me in

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.411
on what's going on here?

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.213
His name's Urashiki.

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:48.715
He's after the
Nine Tails Chakra.

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:49.883
Huh?

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:51.251
You know, I had a feeling

00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:52.819
you guys weren't just
traveling performers,

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:54.388
but I never thought
that I'd hear

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:57.124
the name Nine Tails
coming out of you.

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.259
(Boruto groaning)

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:01.628
We're actually shinobi
from another land

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:04.998
and our mission is to
eliminate that guy.

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:07.134
We came here when we
learned that his target

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:10.270
was Naruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:11.605
Huh, okay.

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.608
But why does he want the
Nine Tails Chakra, then?

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:16.977
I'm afraid that right
now, we don't really know

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.979
what his end game is.

00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:21.682
But we know he's trying
to amass enormous amounts

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.351
of power and threaten peace.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.953
You know about the organization

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:28.956
that's targeting Tailed
Beast Chakra, right?

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.090
Huh-uh.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.892
We're already completely
aware of the fact

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:35.495
that Naruto's been targeted by
those criminals in the past.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.965
And that guy's someone
who has a connection

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:41.101
to that organization
or so my land thinks.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.737
(upbeat music)

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:52.980
Well, I can't believe that
you already know all of that.

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:54.214
That's why we've come here

00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:57.351
to protect Urashiki's
target, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.123
Ah, yes, I see.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:06.260
Well, anyway I'll get
the details later on.

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:08.729
Now we need to focus
on rescuing Naruto.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.597
But how do we do that?

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:17.571
Well, you know, it'll take
a feat of strength, but...

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:23.977
(Boruto gasping)

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.579
(ground rumbling)

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.613
All right, then!

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:29.082
We need to hurry and
find this Urashiki guy

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.684
before it's too late!

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:32.819
(chuckles) Awesome!

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:38.058
-(ground rumbling)
-(boulders booming)

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:47.100
-(body thudding)
-(Urashiki groaning)

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.369
I think this oughta
be far enough.

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:52.172
[Naruto] Hey, what are
you gonna do to me?

00:07:56.276 --> 00:08:00.080
Now I'm going to take the
Fox that's inside of you.

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.982
(Naruto groaning)

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:05.085
(worrisome music)

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.123
We gotta find them fast or else.

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:12.826
But without any clues about
where we should be looking,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.728
this is gonna take some time.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:16.363
Yeah, but Naruto's chakra

00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:18.832
could be totally
extracted by then!

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.234
All right, listen.

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:23.103
What exactly do you mean when
you say extracting chakra?

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:25.372
When Urashiki's
weird fishhook thing

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:27.341
pierces someone's
body, he's able

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:29.610
to pull their chakra right out.

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:33.347
Although, for some reason,
he couldn't take Naruto's.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.083
Yeah well, Naruto
has a Sealing Jutsu

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:38.519
that was placed
upon him long ago.

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:41.822
Do you mean the Jutsu that's
sealing the Nine Tails in?

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.091
That Sealing Jutsu
could be the very reason

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.527
his chakra wasn't
able to be extracted.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.829
So you mean he's
gonna be okay, then?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.797
No, that's not necessarily so.

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:54.134
For example, if Urashiki tries
to break the seal forcibly

00:08:54.168 --> 00:08:57.304
or something like that,
things could get really bad.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.207
That'd release Nine Tails power,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.243
and the Fox Spirit would
escape into the world.

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:06.079
In that case, not only
would everyone be in danger,

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.949
but Naruto will also die.

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.250
(Boruto gasping)

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:12.853
Then we need to find
them, and really soon!

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.821
There are several
spots in the area

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:16.623
where they could be
hiding right now.

00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:19.993
It looks like we'll have to
check them out one by one.

00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:21.628
All right, we need to hurry.

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:25.332
Dad!

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:31.872
(Naruto groaning)

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.440
Let go, you jerk!

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:36.343
You're so loud, you know that?

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:39.613
I can't remove your chakra
as easily as I'd like,

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:43.550
so I'm left with no choice
but to go directly inside.

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:44.551
Go inside?

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:46.019
What are you talking about?

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:50.757
(seal whizzing)

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:52.693
A Sealing Jutsu, huh?

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:54.595
Hey, what?

00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:01.101
(Naruto groaning)

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:03.136
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.240
(Naruto groaning)

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.043
Why, you jerk!

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:17.317
(Urashiki laughing)

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.024
(water dripping)

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:27.160
(mysterious music)

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:34.635
(Nine Tails growling)

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:37.037
Ah, just a bit up ahead.

00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:43.043
(Nine Tails growling)

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:45.312
I feel such immense chakra.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.016
(air whooshing)

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:53.654
(Nine Tails growling)

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:00.661
Seems I've found it.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.169
So, this is what was
getting in the way.

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:13.974
(Nine Tails roaring)

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:22.416
[Nine Tails] To have
made it this far.

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:23.450
Who are you?

00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:27.654
I'm here to take your
chakra, Nine Tails.

00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:29.790
Actually, that's not quite true.

00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:31.592
I'm here to take it back!

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.095
(fire blazing)

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:38.265
(Urashiki gasping)

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:41.401
What's this?

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:46.306
(chakra bubbling)

00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:50.644
The Nine Tails Chakra
is starting to leak out.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.051
I know this feeling.

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:02.356
It's the Nine Tails.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.390
You found them?

00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:05.926
I'm sure of it.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.995
(cape whooshing)

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.599
(worrisome music)

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.704
Looks like I won't be able
to extract it all at once.

00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:20.674
But if the seal were to weaken,

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:22.676
then I would be able to take it.

00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:27.281
To get it all, it
seems the quickest way

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:29.650
is to remove the seal entirely.

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:35.289
(Urashiki gulping)

00:12:36.823 --> 00:12:40.027
(Urashiki groaning)

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.261
Incredible!

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:45.966
Well, in any event,
let's see what's going on

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.634
with this seal, now.

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:53.507
-(seal booming)
-(Urashiki gasping)

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:54.942
(Naruto groaning)

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:58.045
(Naruto grunting)

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:01.148
(weapon snapping)

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:08.255
(cord snapping)

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:12.693
(cord snapping)

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:20.033
If I remover the seal,
then he'll go on a rampage.

00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:22.436
What a troublesome
problem this is.

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:27.374
My, my, so, you've
arrived already!

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:32.546
Let him go, Urashiki!

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:33.814
Oh, just calm down.

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.482
Don't be so impatient!

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:39.119
I've finally figured out
how to extract his chakra.

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:42.689
What is that red stuff?

00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:45.659
So, the Nine Tails Chakra, huh?

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:47.528
I'll handle Urashiki.

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:48.695
You guard Naruto.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:55.602
-(weapon whooshing)
-(sword clashing)

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:56.803
(Urashiki groaning)

00:13:56.837 --> 00:14:00.374
(weapon whooshing)

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:03.277
(Sasuke groaning)

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:07.247
(Urashiki grunting)

00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:17.291
(seal whizzing)

00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:19.660
I knew it.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.162
Sealing Jutsu provides a
good defense against him.

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:24.131
Are you all right?

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.538
Hey!

00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:32.906
[Jiraiya] Hold it!

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.041
What's wrong?

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:36.543
The Nine Tails Chakra
is leaking out.

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:37.878
Be careful!

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.913
But we gotta do
something, and quickly!

00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:41.181
No, wait!

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:43.116
Get it together!

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:51.425
Oh, good!

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:52.459
Are you awake now?

00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:59.166
(dramatic music)

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:01.235
Uh, what's the matter?

00:15:03.437 --> 00:15:06.874
(Naruto growling)

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:09.710
(Naruto roaring)

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:19.319
(Boruto gasping)

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.657
(Naruto growling)

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.263
What's happening to him?

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:33.700
(Naruto growling)

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:34.701
Not good!

00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:38.539
(Naruto growling)

00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:43.477
Whoa, that was a close one.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.212
(anxious music)

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:48.949
Right now, Naruto's under the
control of the Nine Tails.

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:50.684
He's not himself anymore.

00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:54.755
In this state, he can't be
controlled or reasoned with.

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.323
No, no way.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:16:00.127
I bet if I can just talk
to him it'll be okay!

00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:03.330
No, stay away from him!

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:05.532
That's not true, right?

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:07.768
Hey, can you hear me?

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.370
Come on, just wake up, okay?

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:13.273
(Naruto growling)

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:16.076
(air whooshing)

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:18.478
-(weapons swooshing)
-(sword clanging)

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:20.948
(Urashiki chuckling)

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:24.051
(Naruto growling)

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:27.688
(Jiraiya gasping)

00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:29.289
You see, I knew it!

00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:35.729
It's all gonna be
okay, you know!

00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:38.398
Come on.

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:43.237
Let's just get the
hell out of here!

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.271
Okay?

00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:47.975
(Naruto groaning)

00:16:49.977 --> 00:16:51.245
His voice?

00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:52.212
No.

00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:55.048
Could he be responding
to Boruto's chakra?

00:16:55.983 --> 00:16:57.885
(Naruto groaning)

00:16:57.918 --> 00:16:59.119
What am I?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.725
(chakra bubbling)

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.595
That's right, you're doing it.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:16.803
(Naruto growling)

00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:18.038
This is bad!

00:17:18.972 --> 00:17:22.042
(Naruto growling)

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.513
(mystical music)

00:17:32.853 --> 00:17:35.722
(Naruto groaning)

00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:41.328
(body thudding)

00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:45.666
(Boruto gasping)

00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:52.673
-(sword clanging)
-(Urashiki groaning)

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:54.474
(air whooshing)

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:57.878
(jutsu whizzing)

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:01.081
(Sasuke grunting)

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:02.883
(chuckles) Guess
I need to regroup

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.651
and reformulate my strategy.

00:18:18.966 --> 00:18:22.002
(sorrowful music)

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.947
(Naruto snoring)

00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:36.650
There, that oughta do it.

00:18:39.653 --> 00:18:40.954
It's not too deep.

00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:42.256
It'll heal quickly.

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:47.027
(Naruto snoring)

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.629
So what was that?

00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:49.730
What happened?

00:18:50.664 --> 00:18:54.101
It was almost like he was...

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:57.171
(Naruto growling)

00:18:58.939 --> 00:19:01.708
(Naruto roaring)

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:09.116
Like he was some
kind of monster.

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:20.894
The power of the
Nine Tails inside him

00:19:20.928 --> 00:19:23.363
is unbelievably immense.

00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:26.300
That's the reason why he
lived his entire life hated

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:29.670
and ostracized by the
people of the Leaf Village.

00:19:29.703 --> 00:19:30.704
What?

00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:34.675
[Jiraiya] Long ago,
the Nine Tails attacked

00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:36.076
the Hidden Leaf.

00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:40.047
The Fourth Hokage sealed the
Nine Tails inside Naruto,

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.349
who was just a newborn.

00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:45.686
Naruto became the vessel for
the Nine Tailed Fox Spirit

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:47.721
in order to save the village.

00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:50.691
But the adults
in the Leaf

00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:54.161
simply don't see
Naruto that way.

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:56.196
That's wrong.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.166
Even so, Naruto always
looks ahead trying

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:02.202
to get everyone to accept him.

00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:06.507
He may be a fool, but he's
actually making progress.

00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:13.013
After going through something
terrible like an attack

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:16.350
by the Nine Tails, anyone
would be afraid of him.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.952
But, if you call him a monster,

00:20:18.986 --> 00:20:21.688
then that's exactly
what he'll become.

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:22.689
But I...

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:24.458
I didn't mean it that way!

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.595
(chuckles) I know you didn't.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.404
Hold on.

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:40.107
The guy with the
fishing pole had me.

00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:44.011
(Naruto gasping)

00:20:44.044 --> 00:20:46.146
Oh no, did you get hurt?

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.815
(Boruto groaning)

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:51.585
Wait, did I do that to you?

00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:55.589
I'm really sorry about that.

00:20:56.523 --> 00:20:59.826
Oh, no, it's only
a little scratch.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.828
Don't worry about it at all.

00:21:01.862 --> 00:21:03.163
Damn it.

00:21:03.197 --> 00:21:06.767
I can't bring a friend
back home the way I am now.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.303
I gotta get a
whole lot stronger.

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:15.542
[Boruto] Can I really do this?

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:18.412
Will I actually be
able to protect dad?

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.048
-Hey?
-Huh?

00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:25.586
Why don't you come along and
do some training with me too?

00:21:26.687 --> 00:21:27.688
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.827
That Urashiki guy is gonna be
coming back again, isn't he?

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:36.230
[Sasuke] Yeah, I'm sure of it.

00:21:36.263 --> 00:21:38.632
Well then, we need
to be ready for him.

00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.367
So, what do the two of you think

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.603
about training together, huh?

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:45.439
(Boruto groaning)

00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:52.179
But first, it's time to
continue my research.

00:21:52.212 --> 00:21:54.448
Anyway, just think
about it, okay?

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.126
(both groaning)

00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:13.534
(ending theme music)

00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:26.647
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:43.657
(upbeat music)

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:44.825
[Jiraiya] Hey, you two.

00:23:44.858 --> 00:23:47.027
Shall we get started
on our training?

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.595
Yeah, we're ready, you know.

00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:51.598
[Naruto] But why do I
have to train with Boruto?

00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:53.901
[Jiraiya] For some reason,
your chakra natures

00:23:53.934 --> 00:23:55.202
are extremely similar.

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:57.804
We just might get a
collaboration Jutsu out of this

00:23:57.838 --> 00:24:00.140
that'll catch
Urashiki off-guard.

00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:03.810
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:05.012
Jiraiya's assignment.

00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:06.880
[Naruto] A collaboration Jutsu?

00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:08.982
Is it more awesome
than the Rasengan?

00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:16.657
-(ending theme music)
-(singing in Japanese)
