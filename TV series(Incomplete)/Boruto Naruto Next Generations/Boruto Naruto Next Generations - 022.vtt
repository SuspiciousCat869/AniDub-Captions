WEBVTT

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.377
It's no use.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.082
They either went really far away
or somehow they escaped inside
of a barrier.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.185
I'm not able to sense
Sakura's chakra at all.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.655
Sarada.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.357
[sighs] She's gone.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.864
Whatever you do, don't
take your eyes off of
her.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.233
Yes, Father.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.101
Hmph!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:36.770
You'd better behave
yourself.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.607
You're not of Uchiha blood but
we can still use you.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:44.878
At this point, that's the only
good reason I have for letting
you live.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.613
[groans]

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:50.183
You certainly weren't afraid of
holding back, were you?

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.286
It's because you tried
to kill my husband and
my child!

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.189
Not to mention my
close lifelong friend!

00:00:56.222 --> 00:01:01.762
<i>(Sakura) Listen, that child</i>
<i>needs immediate medical</i>
<i>attention, or he could die.</i>

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:06.800
<i>(Sakura) I can help him. I'm</i>
sure you don't want to lose your
<i>child, do you?</i>

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.301
My child?

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.504
<i>(Shin) Don't misunderstand.</i>

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:14.808
<i>These children are clones,</i>
created from culturing my teeth
<i>and nerves.</i>

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.209
Huh?

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.381
Clones? Really? That's
just like <i>him.</i>

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.482
[laughing]

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.719
Oh yes.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.221
My mentor was...

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.892
<i>(Shin) Orochimaru!</i>

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.159
[grunts]

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.132
Hey! What's happening?!

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.304
<i>(Sakura) [gasps] Stop it!</i>

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.776
Huh? [sighs]

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.090
Orochimaru?

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:46.392
Yeah. Kakashi Sensei
said the same thing.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.861
He told me that he had a
feeling...

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.797
that the enemy could be
connected to Orochimaru this
time.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.999
Who is that?

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.001
I've heard his name
before.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:59.272
He's a notorious criminal who
tried to destroy the Hidden Leaf
Village once.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:02.743
That's right. He's an extremely
dangerous individual.

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:06.547
That guy who called
himself Shin Uchiha.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.247
Huh?

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.852
I happened to see that his left
arm was implanted with multiple
Sharingan.

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:15.922
Not just anyone's capable of
that. It had to have been
Orochimaru.

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:21.227
So then, you think that Sarada's
mom was taken to this Orochimaru
guy's place?

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.296
<i>(Naruto) No, that's not</i>
<i>possible.</i>

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:28.301
It can't be true because, we've
had Leaf Shinobi keeping strict
surveillance on him.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:32.172
I don't think he'd be directly
involved in this. It doesn't
make sense.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.841
But in order to track Shin's
whereabouts...

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.579
it would be helpful to find out
all that we can from Orochimaru.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.047
Let's head over to
his research lab.

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.348
Wait, Dad!

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.618
[gulps] Sarada!

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.487
What is it?

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:49.756
How can...How can you
be so calm right now?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.325
Aren't you worried at all about
how Mom's doing?

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.994
Hey, Sarada, Sasuke
is...

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.665
Personal feelings don't matter.
Emotions will only get in the
way of a mission.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.234
You should remember that if you
want to be a shinobi.

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:02.969
[grunting]

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:08.408
Here. It's all I have left but
take these lightly salted chips.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.545
<i>This totally heavy mood really</i>
<i>sucks.</i>

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:15.949
<i>Honestly, the only thing heavy</i>
<i>here should be my weight!</i>

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.652
Hang in there, my delicate heart
<i>of glass!</i>

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.153
Cho‐Cho..

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.855
All right! Let's go.

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.891
How about you two come
with us? What do you say?

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:25.692
Huh?

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.160
Naruto, come on.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:27.794
Hmm.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.130
Remember they came
after Sarada as well.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.734
So I think it'll be safer if we
all stay together, you know?

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:37.270
Hmph. Do what you
want then.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:42.876
Besides, at Orochimaru's place,
we might run into the people
who were in the photo.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:43.744
Uh.

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:44.444
Hmm.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.513
Okay, it's decided then.

00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:49.382
Tomorrow, all of us will
set out at daybreak.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:56.523
How horrible!

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:59.359
Even if they are clones, didn't
you raise them as if they were
your own sons?

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.763
They only exist to provide me
with replacement organs.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:05.566
There's nothing more
to the relationship than that.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.801
<i>(Shin) There's no need to</i>
<i>mourn.</i>

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:11.471
<i>Living things don't</i>
<i>truly die anyway.</i>

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:13.139
What're you talking
about?

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:18.178
(Shin) Without a doubt, the body
<i>of every living creature</i>
<i>decomposes in time.</i>

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.680
But despite that fact...

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:24.484
genes survive forever without
change through reproductive
cells in progeny.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.654
<i>(Shin) That is the system,</i>
<i>which we call life.</i>

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.956
What is that we call
death?

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.995
It's merely the expiration of
the corporeal vessel that is
completely disposable.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.429
You're wrong!

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:41.835
You're sorely mistaken if you
think that the body only serves
as a disposable vessel!

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:45.005
The body is where one's feelings
and one's will reside!

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:50.443
What exists between a parent
and a child is more than genes.
Much more!

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.481
[grunts]

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:59.620
Genes are the all‐powerful
essence of life.

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:01.888
Weak genes will
eventually perish...

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:06.960
and strong genes will always
hybridize to generate even
stronger beings.

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.695
That is evolution.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:14.601
That's nonsense. It's like you
don't understand at all what
should be important as a parent!

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:22.743
<i>(Shin) For evolution, conflict</i>
<i>is essential in the further</i>
<i>selection of superior genes.</i>

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:28.381
Through countless battles, new
ninjutsu and other arts were
developed rapidly...

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:31.752
<i>(Shin)...and strong shinobi</i>
<i>were selected!</i>

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:38.091
It was the organization known as
the Akatsuki who stirred up such
a conflict in the past.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:38.959
[gasps]

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:43.429
<i>(Shin) For the sake of human</i>
<i>evolution, I will revive the</i>
<i>Akatsuki...</i>

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:47.200
and carry out the wishes of
Itachi Uchiha!

00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:53.874
Well, long time no see, huh
Captain Yamato.

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:58.745
Please stop. I don't want to be
called "Captain" by the Hokage.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.816
Sorry, I can't help it. You'll
always be Captain Yamato to me.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:07.387
<i>He's definitely not my</i>
<i>dad.</i>

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.824
<i>(Sarada) It looks like they</i>
<i>might be Orochimaru's</i>
<i>partners.</i>

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:14.327
<i>But I wonder, why is my Dad in</i>
<i>the photo with them?</i>

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.263
[yawns]

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:24.971
<i>I guess I really don't know</i>
<i>anything about my Dad's life.</i>

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.874
Lord Sixth filled me
in for the most part.

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:32.478
But I'm sorry, this is the
mission I was assigned and I
can't leave my post.

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:34.748
I understand.

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:37.383
Don't worry. Sasuke
will take the lead from here.

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:38.885
Follow me.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:45.992
This way.

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:50.196
Hey, Sasuke!

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.099
It's not like we're going to one
of your favorite restaurants
here.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:54.935
You might want to be a little
more on your guard, you know?

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:55.602
[grunts]

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:57.638
Damn it! Told you.

00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:00.841
Long time no see,
Sasuke.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.042
[gasps]

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:06.312
<i>The guys in the photo!</i>

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:09.415
For your information, this isn't
exactly the kind of place you
bring kids for a field trip.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.251
Hmm? The Hokage?

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:14.955
Good timing. You two
can take us to straight to him
now.

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:18.592
Huh? Hold on. Are you ordering
us around?

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:20.627
I can take you if
you'd like.

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:27.968
Sasuke, I think you should
wait a second, It looks like it
might not be necessary.

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:33.139
[gasps]

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.579
Oh my goodness. We have a most
unusual visitor.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.147
Orochimaru.

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.895
[gasps] Orochimaru, It's really
him.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:58.431
Wow, you look a lot
younger than you did
back in the day.

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:00.701
You should know me
better than that by
now.

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:04.938
So why don't you stop beating
around the bush and tell me the
reason you're here.

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.874
H‐He's a lot different
from what I imagined.

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:13.914
I know, me too, and if there's
any possibility of this person
being a parent of mine...

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:18.118
would he be my mom or my dad?
Which one would he be, Sarada?

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.287
I don't know!

00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:26.326
Evidently, one of your
underlings placed my child in
danger and kidnapped my wife.

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:30.797
If you've been up to something
lately, you'd better spit it out
right about now.

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:35.536
Why are you talking to
me like that? I haven't done
anything suspicious.

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:37.804
What's the watcher outside for,
then?

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:42.375
Just tell us everything you know
about the man who calls himself
Shin Uchiha.

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:43.810
[gasps]

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:47.648
Let's go to the other
room. Come with me.

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.753
Shin, I haven't heard that name
in a while.

00:10:52.786 --> 00:10:59.125
He's gone off on his own
already, but he was one of my
old experimental subjects.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.462
(Orochimaru) Danzo Shimura, the
<i>man you all fought...</i>

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.831
<i>his right arm came</i>
<i>from Shin.</i>

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.735
That child possessed a peculiar
<i>trait...</i>

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:12.472
<i>where his body wouldn't</i>
<i>reject any kind of tissue</i>
<i>transplant.</i>

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:16.543
<i>He was the optimum</i>
<i>subject for cloning</i>
<i>experiments.</i>

00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:18.011
Cloning?

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:21.281
Perhaps I should put it in
simpler terms for you.

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:25.051
He was like a Shadow
Clone that never disappears.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.153
What do you mean,
never disappears?

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.756
So what happens when you're all
done with them then?

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.527
If you want them gone, the only
option is to kill them.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.065
[grunts] It's not that simple!
Human beings aren't your
playthings!

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:43.069
Actually, humans are much more
simple than you think they are.

00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:46.707
Practically every one of
us is enslaved by our genes.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.910
<i>(Orochimaru) For example, take</i>
<i>you, Sasuke.</i>

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:50.711
[gasps]

00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:53.079
(Orochimaru) The reason why your
<i>daughter looks like you is</i>
<i>because...</i>

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.081
<i>your genes were passed</i>
<i>on to her.</i>

00:11:56.717 --> 00:12:00.086
<i>Everything about her is simply</i>
data that was recorded into her
<i>genes.</i>

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.022
Genes!

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.825
Hey, that's not a very
nice way to put it!

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:07.360
But why does he call
himself an Uchiha?

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:10.631
Oh yes, that's the
name he claimed for
himself.

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:14.935
Granted, he's just a
reproduction, but as someone who
possesses the Sharingan...

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:17.470
he was obsessed with the
Uchiha family name.

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:21.642
<i>(Orochimaru) In particular, he</i>
<i>was enraptured by your late</i>
<i>brother.</i>

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:24.477
Itachi Uchiha, so...

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:26.680
I see.

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:29.349
I understand Shin's
background now.

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:32.018
When are you going to
tell us where he is?

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:35.121
My word, such
one‐sided questioning!

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:38.258
It's surprising to see how
shameless you've become.

00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:42.395
Well, anyway...

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:47.467
It would be of great benefit to
me too if the Leaf were to
capture that troublesome Shin.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.902
Besides...

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:52.939
<i>(Orochimaru) I sort of owe you</i>
<i>one, right Naruto?</i>

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:56.209
How is the child
doing? Well, I hope?

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.044
Yeah.

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:00.547
The kid seems to be
doing very well.

00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:03.216
Really? How wonderful!

00:13:04.518 --> 00:13:08.488
<i>(Orochimaru) I'd be happy to</i>
<i>explain more. Come along.</i>

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:15.495
Excuse me, but all of you guys
are my dad's former partners,
isn't that right?

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:17.497
Huh? I guess.

00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:18.532
Then...

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:22.002
<i>(Sarada) Can you tell me where</i>
<i>this woman is?</i>

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:25.005
<i>(Suigetsu) Oh, that's Karin.</i>

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:27.908
She's not here. She's at a
different hideout.

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:30.944
Oh I see.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:35.481
Well, could I ask you to do me
one other favor?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.483
Huh?

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.988
Huh?!

00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:46.326
No way! I had no idea Sasuke was
that much of a scummy bastard!

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.532
Ah, could Karin actually be?

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:54.601
Well right now, it's still only
a possibility until I can prove
it!

00:13:54.635 --> 00:14:00.106
But a genetic test would show
it, right? Then it would be
clear whose child I really am.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.812
That's funny. I could've sworn
it was around here somewhere.

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:08.148
[grunts] Found it!

00:14:13.587 --> 00:14:15.922
All right then.

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.457
We'll compare the genes that we
harvested from you...

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.126
with the genes from Karin's
umbilical cord.

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:21.928
Hmm.

00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:23.530
Okay, here we go.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:48.154
It looks like you're a perfect
match. Karin is definitely your
mom.

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:58.632
Your dad and I, our feelings
connect us to each other, so
don't worry.

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:01.968
Well, your glasses are
similar.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.541
Uh, anyway, I'd better go!

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:12.579
[crying]

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:14.280
Uh.

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:18.018
Damn it. I kinda feel like I did
something that I shouldn't have
done.

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:23.790
It's too late now. Ever since
the old day you guys have always
had a way of messing things up!

00:15:23.824 --> 00:15:25.158
You are an idiot!

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:29.295
It's all Sasuke's fault! I mean,
didn't you know about this?

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:31.798
Of course I didn't
know about it!

00:15:31.832 --> 00:15:34.134
How could Sasuke be
such a bastard?

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:36.837
Well, you can take
it from here.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.140
[grunts] Hey, Suigetsu! Wait!

00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:47.581
Um hey there, Sarada.

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:49.516
[crying]

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.353
We need to go now and
rescue your mom, alright?

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:55.689
Liar.

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:56.957
Huh?

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.025
You lied to me, Lord Seventh!

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:03.564
Why should I have to go and
rescue someone who I just found
out isn't even my real mom?

00:16:03.597 --> 00:16:09.435
I'm done with all of you
deceiving me my entire life. Go
to hell!

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:10.737
Huh?

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:15.441
[light breathing]

00:16:17.678 --> 00:16:19.279
Huh?

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:21.715
[inhales]

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.752
At this point, I'd rather not
look like that person in any way
shape or form.

00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:29.590
So what are you gonna do?

00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:32.993
I'm not sure yet but this has
nothing to do with you, Lord
Seventh.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:39.032
[grunts] What do you want?

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:43.236
You think it has nothing to do
with me, huh?

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.506
Well I'm sorry but that's not
how it works.

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:50.010
I've told Boruto the same thing
as well, time and again.

00:16:50.043 --> 00:16:53.714
To a Hokage, every person in the
village is family.

00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:55.081
Huh?

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.352
So what's your point?

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:02.188
That's just a convenient thing
to say to people.

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:07.561
My dad's away from the village
so much, he forgot what his own
daughter's face looked like!

00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:13.333
And mom, she's been lying to me
the entire time. How could she?

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:17.504
Plus now, we're not
even blood related.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.078
I guess I finally need to face
the fact that none of this is
what I thought it was.

00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:26.747
I don't even have a real
family.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.183
And you're not me, so don't
tell me that you understand.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:37.390
You can't understand what it
is I'm feeling in my heart! You
and I, we are not family!

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:38.792
[grunts]

00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:40.426
[sighs]

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:07.420
So that's it, huh? That's
how you'd describe your bond
with your mother and father?

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:09.523
Uh.

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:12.125
(Naruto) A bond isn't just about
<i>history or blood.</i>

00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:14.360
<i>It's something much</i>
<i>stronger!</i>

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:16.763
Tell me, what is it
then? Go ahead!

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.600
It's love, Sarada.

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:22.102
<i>(Naruto) That's all you really</i>
<i>need.</i>

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:24.771
Nothing more.

00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:29.510
So check again, do you have any
feelings of love for them?

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.151
[breathing]

00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:51.097
Mommy...

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.967
Do you know when
Daddy's coming back
home?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.037
He's out doing very difficult
work, so he's not able to come
home just yet.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.675
Yeah but, how come Daddy doesn't
seem to care about you or me?

00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:04.244
What? Don't ever think Daddy
doesn't care.

00:19:04.277 --> 00:19:07.848
Then, why doesn't he
ever come home?

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:12.686
Sarada, Daddy loves us and
treasures us both deeply.

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:15.789
That's exactly the reason he
can't come home.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.725
<i>(Sakura) You might not be able</i>
<i>to understand right now.</i>

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:22.996
<i>But I know one day,</i>
<i>you will understand!</i>

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:26.199
[holding back tears]

00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:28.234
Mommy, you're squishing me!

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:33.473
Oh! I'm sorry! Sorry. [giggling]
I can't help it you're just
so precious!

00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:37.477
[giggles] Have you ever given
Daddy a kiss before?

00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:38.111
Huh?

00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:41.715
Hmm. [giggles]

00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:43.483
Mommy? What's the matter?

00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:47.287
Nothing. I was just remembering
something even better.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.922
Ew, that's icky.

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:50.657
No, no, not that!

00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:54.761
[laughs] So, then, tell me
what's even better than a kiss,
huh?

00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:55.461
[gasps]

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.765
I'll tell you about it,
next time we talk.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.903
[laughs] You'll understand when
you see your dad.

00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:06.272
[crying] Oh, Mom!

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.144
[crying]

00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:14.815
I guess, I do wanna
rescue my Mom!

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:17.183
Oh yeah?

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:22.155
[crying] Except, it won't be
like it was before.

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:24.991
What am I supposed to
do?

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.829
[gasps]

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:32.699
It doesn't matter whether she's
your real mom, or even, your
fake mom.

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:36.469
As long as, you feel the desire
to save her.

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:39.239
<i>(Naruto) That's all. That's</i>
<i>what's real!</i>

00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:41.808
Come on. Let's go rescue
her.

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:44.444
Yeah!

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.982
Hey, there you are!

00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:50.283
Sarada!

00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:52.686
What have you two been
doing? Where've you been?

00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:54.888
Hmph!

00:20:55.622 --> 00:20:57.591
Sasuke!

00:20:57.624 --> 00:21:01.261
Listen, there's something we
need to discuss later.

00:21:01.962 --> 00:21:03.096
What is it?

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:04.531
I said later!

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:07.367
Right now, we need
to rescue Sakura!

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.370
It's possible that she
might be dead already.

00:21:10.771 --> 00:21:12.405
[gasps]

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.207
Don't underestimate her.
My wife's not weak.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.441
[sighs]

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:21.381
But, I do want to thank you for
telling me where Shin is. I can
sense him now.

00:21:21.414 --> 00:21:24.117
I'll take everyone there right
away.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.320
It seems my Visual Prowess
just came back.

00:21:30.156 --> 00:21:31.291
[gasps]

00:21:32.526 --> 00:21:34.360
Seriously? Your Visual Prowess
was diminished? Makes sense.

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:37.698
Alright, easy there. Look who's
talking.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:42.135
Hmph. Everyone, get on.

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:48.975
In order to revive the Akatsuki,
I will kill Sasuke and take
his Sharingan for myself.

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:52.913
He doesn't deserve to
carry on the Uchiha
family name.

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:57.818
The only one who can
do that is me. Shin Uchiha!

00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.019
Hmph.

00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:12.398
<i>Wait for me, Mom. Don't worry,</i>
<i>I'm coming.</i>

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.697
<i>(Shin) As I expected, you're</i>
<i>all weak!</i>

00:23:50.731 --> 00:23:55.669
Your worthless parental feelings
<i>toward your children have</i>
<i>oppressed you completely.</i>

00:23:55.702 --> 00:24:02.008
<i>(Sakura) It's okay Sarada.</i>
Something like this isn't enough
<i>to defeat your dad. Trust us.</i>

00:24:02.042 --> 00:24:06.312
<i>Your father and I, we will</i>
<i>protect you no matter what!</i>

00:24:06.346 --> 00:24:12.653
<i>(Sarada) Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: "Bonds
<i>Come in All Shapes."</i>

00:24:12.686 --> 00:24:15.088
<i>(Sakura) Never underestimate a</i>
<i>parent.</i>
