WEBVTT

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.710
(soft lighthearted music)

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.617
(door opening)

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.618
So, then.

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:18.619
What's your decision?

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.287
Hey, come on.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.190
You think this is something
I can decide that easily?

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.494
The last Chunin
Exams were suspended

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.097
because of the attack
by the Otsutsuki.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.100
So, we've put off
selecting who, if anyone,

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.568
to promote to Chunin.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.070
I've been getting pestered
by a lot of departments

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.006
to hurry up and choose.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.941
Yeah, I know all of that.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.010
But still, it's really difficult

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.678
to pick just one person.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.313
That is the rule, right?

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.716
So, who do we promote to Chunin?

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:59.059
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.707
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:27.514
(Opening Theme Music)

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.193
(sighing)

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:41.862
This is really hard, isn't it?

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.398
A Chunin is the
leader of a team.

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.500
This isn't just about
fighting skills.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.902
But the ability to
take charge of a team,

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:52.206
discern battle situations,
and make decisions.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.574
So we have to think carefully

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:56.043
and chose someone
with those qualities.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:57.578
The first part of the exams

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.980
were Sai's true or false quiz.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.682
[Sai] A true or false quiz.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.318
(people groaning)

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.086
It's a quiz?

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.324
(shouting)

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:15.929
(screaming)

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:17.097
[Sai] The answer is.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.699
[Shikamaru] Quite a
few of the competitors

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:20.734
were eliminated in that round.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.302
We started out with 32 teams

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:24.571
but only eight teams
made it through.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.208
We definitely can't
promote anyone

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:30.577
who failed in the
very first round.

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.179
Right.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.213
Boruto!

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.583
(shouting)

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.986
(coughing)

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.122
(tense rock music)

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:46.226
[Naruto] Four teams from the
Hidden Leaf made it through.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.362
[Shikamaru] There were also
two from the Hidden Mist

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.198
and one each from the
Sand and the Cloud.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.366
[Sai] Were forced to find,

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.268
after being put into
a difficult situation,

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.970
whether you'd give up or not.

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:59.106
[Naruto] Okay, so that
means we have to chose

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.741
from among these guys, then.

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.044
(rock music)

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.980
In a team battle, the leader
can have big influence

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.249
over whether their
group wins or loses.

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:11.952
I'd say that it's the ideal test

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:13.687
to look for Chunin qualities.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.088
[Shikamaru] Of course.

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:17.791
That leaves out anyone who
disregards team coordination

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.393
and rushes in on their own.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.194
[Naruto] Oh yeah.

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:22.095
Actually, that reminds me.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.232
Shinki of the Sand rushed
in on his own, didn't he?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.400
[Shikamaru] Well
yeah, you're right

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.203
but he was way ahead
of the others in skill.

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:34.174
After all, he took on Iwabe,
Denki, and Metal all by himself

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:35.209
and won.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:37.177
[Naruto] Just what you'd
expect from Gaara's son.

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:40.180
You'd already lost when
you let me provoke you

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:41.381
and you forgot the rules.

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:43.717
[Naruto] Shikadai and
his team's coordination

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.085
was perfect right?

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.187
[Shikamaru] No, Shikadai's
strategy just happened

00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:48.388
to work out, that's all.

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:51.091
Inojin and Cho-Cho
just followed along.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.392
[Naruto] That's how it's been

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.394
since your own
Ino-Shika-Cho days.

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:57.130
I think that when you or
Shikadai are in the lead,

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.566
there's no real choice but
to follow your strategy.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.401
-I got it.
-Really?

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:04.338
Well, Sumire's team failed
to make it through round two.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:07.207
They actually had
quite a strong team

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:10.210
but back then they still lacked
balance in their abilities.

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:11.378
[Naruto] Sumire's joining

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.647
the Scientific Ninja
Tools team, right?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.582
[Shikamaru] Yeah, but that
doesn't change the fact

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:16.750
that she's a shinobi.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.853
Sumire qualifies as a
candidate, don't you think?

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:21.255
[Naruto] First,
let's look at Team 5.

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:24.091
Honestly, I was surprised
by how much Iwabe

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:25.425
and Metal had improved.

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:26.660
Sure did.

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.263
[Naruto] But they're more suited
for the front lines of battle.

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.231
Instead of putting in
charge as team captains,

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:34.501
it's better for them to
gain more combat experience.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.104
Also, when it comes
to Wasabi and Namida,

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:38.939
it's true that they've
gotten stronger

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.641
but I get the feeling
that they still

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.444
haven't really progressed
enough to be made team captains.

00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:46.713
[Shikamaru] Does that
mean we should get Denki

00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:48.248
and Sumire on the list?

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:51.084
Sumire was strong
enough to begin with.

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:52.719
She's sharp and
has the qualities

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:54.054
needed to be a Chunin.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.590
Now, as for Denki.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:59.226
I really believe that
out of all the others,

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.795
he's grown the
most as a shinobi.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.997
Yes, I see.

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.967
Originally, he had no
desire to become a shinobi

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.235
but now look at him.

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:11.338
He's a genin along with
Boruto and the others.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.373
[Naruto] Also, the
way that he's able

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:16.243
to analyze situations
from the back,

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:19.046
makes him well suited to
act as a team captain.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:22.382
So, it's five against three.

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:25.452
[Shikamaru] Okay,
up next is Team 7.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.387
[Naruto] It seems Boruto
thought he could use

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.923
his Shadow Clones and do
more than he actually could.

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:31.992
He failed miserably, huh?

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:33.827
[Shikamaru] And as a result.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.597
(grunting)

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.365
I won't let you.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.766
[Shikamaru] We
learned afterwards

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.403
that he was using his Scientific
Ninja tool during the test.

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:44.304
So, by all rights,

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:47.708
he technically should
be disqualified.

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:49.209
(laughing)

00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:51.578
Well, setting Boruto
aside for the moment.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.314
Regarding Mitsuki and Sarada,

00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:57.184
I can't think of a reason
not to consider them.

00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.258
He made the choice to use
that Scientific Ninja Tool

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:08.195
all because he just really
wanted me to acknowledge him.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.231
Still, after all that,

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.667
there's just no way
I can promote him.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.970
Sadly, Boruto isn't gonna
make the cut this time.

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:18.939
If we went strictly by ability,

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.674
Boruto has really grown.

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:23.210
I have high hopes for him.

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:25.512
Round three consists
of individual matches.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.948
[Naruto] The individual
battles of round three were fun

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.250
because of everyone's
unique personalities.

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.186
[Shikamaru] Yeah,
nowadays we keep hearing

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.388
that fewer people want
to become shinobi.

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:36.957
So it's amazing how
people with true ability

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.258
show up each time.

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.928
Shikadai, he
struggled quite a bit.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.095
Bad attitude.

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:43.864
[Naruto] If anything,
he's the type of shinobi

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.098
who supports from the back.

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.134
Where as Yodo's
skills are more suited

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.669
to actual combat.

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:50.103
So it was a poor matchup.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.239
But leave it up to Shikadai.

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:54.975
He came up with the right
tactic and won, didn't he?

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:56.944
[Shikamaru] Yeah but
according to him,

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.079
it was nothing but sheer luck.

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:04.585
Shikadai said he accidentally
stepped on a piece of gum

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:06.353
left from the previous match.

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:07.921
So he figured out his opponent

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:10.190
had the ability
to discern sound.

00:08:10.224 --> 00:08:11.358
[Naruto] Seriously?

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.260
Figuring out Yodo's
ability just from that

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.862
shows amazing perception.

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:16.830
Being modest is
so like Shikadai.

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:19.466
You're hearing is really
frighteningly good.

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.303
(grunting)

00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:26.707
(shouting)

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.943
There was no other
way for me to muffle

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:32.679
the sound of my shoes
when I shifted my weight.

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:38.318
So, shall we call this a match?

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:43.991
[Naruto] Sarada won
her match easily.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.593
[Rock Lee] The winner
is Sarada Uchiha!

00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:48.762
Ninja Art, Super Beast Scroll.

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.232
[Naruto] And in the
next match up, Inojin...

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.034
[Shikamaru] Lost thoroughly.

00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:56.236
How's that?

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.971
[Shikamaru] Araya was
using a puppet to battle.

00:08:58.005 --> 00:08:59.373
Inojin lost because
he couldn't see

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:01.175
through his
opponent's abilities.

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.943
[Naruto] He may
have lost that match

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:04.311
but I understand that he's been

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:06.513
using the Mind Transfer
Jutsu recently.

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:09.816
I think that his future
looks very promising.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.051
No way.

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.657
Snakes?

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.991
Why'd it have to be snakes?

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.493
[Naruto] Then Mitsuki won easily

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:23.197
and after that, the
next match was...

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.232
[Shikamaru] Cho-Cho
versus Shinki.

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.901
[Naruto] Yeah, I gotta say.

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:31.305
It was unusual seeing
Cho-Cho so motivated.

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:33.073
[Shikamaru] But of
all the bad luck.

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:35.442
She got Shinki for an opponent.

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:37.311
Partial Expansion Jutsu.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.082
(grunting)

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.719
All right, empty...

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:46.753
Crash!

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.525
[Naruto] Had she been
up against anyone else,

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:52.960
she might of won.

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:55.229
Honestly, I feel
kinda sorry for her.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.631
[Shikamaru] I just
wish she had decided

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.734
to display that determination
a little sooner.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.970
[Naruto] And then,
the next match.

00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:04.705
[Shikamaru] Hey, just hold on.

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:07.074
We gotta start
narrowing down the list

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.942
or we're gonna be
here all night.

00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:11.078
[Naruto] Yeah, I get
what you're saying

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.047
but it's just, it's like
they're all so close

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:16.517
and it seems like such a waste.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.453
(tense rock music)

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:25.025
(grunting)

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:28.495
(shouting)

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:34.468
You really need to make
some tough choices here.

00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:36.837
The captain's entrusted
with their team's lives.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.805
It's a huge responsibility.

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:40.707
We gotta be tough
and drop anyone

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:42.943
without the right qualities.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.344
Yeah.

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:46.513
I don't really think
that Inojin is ready

00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:47.848
to lead people yet

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:49.349
and Cho-Cho.

00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:52.186
Well, it goes without
saying, right?

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.190
(crowd cheering)

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:59.626
Next up was the match
between Shikadai and Boruto.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.962
[Naruto] Boruto used the
Scientific Ninja Tool

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.463
in that match, too.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:06.600
Under normal circumstances,
Shikadai would of won.

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:07.568
[Shikamaru] No.

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.569
[Naruto] Huh?

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:09.570
[Shikamaru] Even though Boruto

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:11.238
used the Scientific Ninja Tool,

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.807
he only created one
extra Shadow Clone.

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:15.943
Boruto could of managed
something like that

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:17.377
from training alone

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:19.947
but deciding that four
was Boruto's limit

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.683
only highlights
Shikadai's inadequacy.

00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:23.951
[Naruto] Hey, come on now.

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:26.086
Aren't you being kinda harsh?

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:28.455
[Shikamaru] Misinterpret
stuff like that in battle

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.190
and people will die.

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:39.333
(crowd cheering)

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.702
(tense music)

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:47.674
Damn it.

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:52.646
[Shikamaru] I'll retrain
the Ino-Shika-Cho

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.214
trio from scratch.

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:56.083
[Naruto] Wow, are you serious?

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.719
(tense music)

00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:03.590
Sarada's match against
Araya was a surprise, huh?

00:12:03.624 --> 00:12:06.226
(tense music)

00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:10.597
Lightning Style: Lightning Ball.

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:14.101
[Shikamaru] Who would of
thought the real Araya

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:17.037
was manipulating a
puppet from a distance?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.205
[Naruto] But what's
more shocking

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.674
was Sarada's ability to
see through his trick.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:25.245
She used the Sharingan and
Fire Style on top of that.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:28.782
It looks like we've got another
Sasuke on our hands, here.

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:31.418
(tense music)

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:33.787
[Shikamaru] The
leadership skills

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.524
to command a team, the ability
to analyze battle situations,

00:12:37.558 --> 00:12:39.092
she's definitely got them.

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:42.229
[Naruto] Qualities necessary
in a Chunin, you mean?

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.164
Wind Style: Breakthrough.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.000
[Naruto] While we're
on the subject,

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:48.969
there's a part of Mitsuki
that lacks awareness

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:50.204
about the world.

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:53.073
In that way, he's far
from being a Chunin.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.241
[Shikamaru] But the
most critical issue

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.443
about him is that he
deserted the village.

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:59.580
After being the epicenter
of an incident like that,

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:02.216
no one will accept his
promotion to Chunin.

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:06.119
[Naruto] Although, according
to Konohamaru's reports,

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.487
he's changed recently.

00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:10.090
For example, he's started
to speak his mind.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.692
[Shikamaru] Well, I
guess you could say

00:13:11.725 --> 00:13:13.460
that Mitsuki is growing, too.

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:20.067
Sarada made it to the finals

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.568
where she battled Shinki.

00:13:21.602 --> 00:13:22.703
Although she lost there,

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:24.204
I've got no qualms whatsoever

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:26.573
about her qualifications
to become a Chunin.

00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:29.376
Compared to Denki and Sumire,

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:33.080
I'd say Sarada's abilities
far outshine theirs.

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:40.787
Right, well I guess
that it's decided then.

00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:42.122
We'll promote her to Chunin.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.691
(door opening)
[Sasuke] Sorry to interrupt.

00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:47.861
(door closing)

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.096
Sasuke?

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:57.738
Sasuke.

00:13:57.771 --> 00:13:59.406
So, you're back, huh?

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:02.609
Yeah, I thought that I'd
out to come and report in.

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:05.846
Did you locate the
whereabouts of that guy

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.881
who had the fishing rod?

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:12.252
No, I haven't found
him just yet but...

00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:19.092
I did find several markers

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:21.695
that place him in
certain locations.

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:23.564
Seems he was
gathering intel here

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:27.401
even before the arrival
of Momoshiki and Kinshiki.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:31.004
[Shikamaru] Before
Momoshiki and Kinshiki came?

00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:33.440
So, he was here doing
reconnaissance then?

00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:36.009
[Sasuke] I can't
really say for sure

00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:37.811
one way or the other.

00:14:37.845 --> 00:14:40.113
But, it certainly
wouldn't surprise me

00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:42.516
if he were to show up
again sometime soon.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.818
[Naruto] Damn it.

00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:46.553
I guess that means
this situation's

00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:49.623
gonna remain as
unpredictable as ever.

00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:50.624
[Shikamaru] Got it.

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.426
Thanks for the report.

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:55.462
Sure, I'll keep
investigating, too.

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.535
Oh, this is--

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.805
Are you thinking of
promoting Sarada to Chunin?

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:07.941
Huh, how'd you ever
figure that out?

00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:10.677
You and Shikamaru, the
Leaf's top officials,

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:13.480
pouring over genin photos
this late at night.

00:15:13.514 --> 00:15:15.716
It's pretty obvious,
wouldn't you say?

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.085
Got us, you're right.

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:19.419
You should be happy.

00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:22.456
We just decided
Sarada's our pick.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.861
Uh, so why aren't you happy?

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:30.464
Well, it's the logical outcome.

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:31.665
But...

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:38.071
Shikamaru, there's
something on your mind

00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:39.673
you want to share with us?

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.074
Oh, uh no.

00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:43.577
I was just thinking that
a lot of time has passed

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.145
since the Chunin exams

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:48.081
and since then, a pretty
major incident occurred.

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.017
You must mean that incident.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.020
Where some genin deserted
the Leaf village?

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:54.221
Huh, wait.

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:56.390
How did you even
know about that?

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:59.393
Sarada was involved
and I am her father.

00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:02.095
Sakura filled me in
about everything.

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.997
Oh, right, of course.

00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:05.299
But I don't understand.

00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:07.234
What does that whole
situation have to do with us

00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:09.069
promoting her to Chunin?

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:12.339
I bet I know what
Shikamaru's thinking.

00:16:13.874 --> 00:16:15.275
I trust Mitsuki.

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.644
Right now, that's
what my will is.

00:16:20.013 --> 00:16:21.248
(sighing)

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.218
Let's take that snake
to Orochimaru's lab.

00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:30.023
We can probably find out
more information there.

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.693
Until we find out just
what Mitsuki's thinking,

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:34.461
I'm gonna keep you company.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.729
What, really?

00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:36.730
You okay with that?

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:38.966
You're gonna be pursued, too.

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.868
You and Mitsuki aren't
the only members

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:42.469
of Team 7, remember?

00:16:42.503 --> 00:16:44.671
[Sasuke] It was a
significant incident

00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:46.206
that even pulled
the Hidden Stone

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.408
into the investigation
around it.

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:51.011
Experiencing something
that consequential

00:16:51.044 --> 00:16:54.548
is almost certain to have
had a huge impact on them.

00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:56.984
[Shikamaru] Exactly,
and since we didn't take

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.386
that into consideration
when we made our choice,

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:01.021
I still have some
doubts that we should

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:03.290
go with Sarada as our pick.

00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:05.092
[Sasuke] Well, unlike you two,

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:07.027
my job takes me
straight to the scene

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.428
when incidents occur.

00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:11.164
From my perspective, I'd
rather you pick someone

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.233
for their skills
in actual combat

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:14.535
than for test scores.

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:15.736
[Naruto] Hey, come on.

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:18.338
You make it sound so simple but.

00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:21.008
[Shikamaru] I wasn't
expecting such valuable advice

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.943
from someone in the field.

00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:25.212
Still, taking that into account,

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:28.682
Sarada has met and even
exceeded the conditions needed

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.050
to become a Chunin.

00:17:30.918 --> 00:17:32.486
[Sasuke] You're
really okay with this?

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.555
I heard that she
had her genin rank

00:17:34.588 --> 00:17:35.989
stripped from her for a bit.

00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:37.124
[Shikamaru] That may be true

00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:38.825
but Sarada managed to fight off

00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:40.527
several formidable assailants

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:43.263
and because Sarada
helped resolve

00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:44.831
the Hidden Stone incident,

00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:46.867
the Tsuchikage herself requested

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.302
that she not be blamed.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.175
(sighing)

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:57.477
Oh well, guess your empty head

00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:59.213
can think about
it long and hard.

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:02.482
Huh, you're leaving already?

00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:03.483
But you're here now.

00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:04.685
Tell us your thoughts.

00:18:04.718 --> 00:18:07.354
But a good idea just popped
into your head, didn't it?

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:10.490
This would probably
go faster if I stayed.

00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:12.826
But then again, I
wouldn't want to take away

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.828
from your job as the Hokage.

00:18:14.862 --> 00:18:15.963
What was that?

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:18.966
Look, even if you're
not here, I can still...

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:20.767
And there he goes.

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:23.604
Hey, so what's
this idea of yours?

00:18:23.637 --> 00:18:25.239
Huh, well uh.

00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:27.708
Boruto and the others
went to another village

00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:29.643
and returned home safely, right?

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.513
Yeah, they did but?

00:18:36.016 --> 00:18:38.752
Huh, what's going on?

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:39.820
Just listen.

00:18:39.853 --> 00:18:41.021
From one point of view,

00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:42.956
what they did counts
as an S-rank mission

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.892
and the fact that
all of them managed

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:46.293
to come back safely,

00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:48.629
speaks volumes about
Shikadai's abilities

00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:49.997
and about his strength.

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:55.402
Just, hold on for a
minute, would you guys?

00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:57.938
[Naruto] Only Team 10 was
sent out on the manhunt

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.606
to find Boruto's team.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.276
That was your plan, Shikamaru.

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.478
[Shikamaru] Yeah, that's
because I believed

00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:06.513
Shikadai's analysis
of the incident

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:08.815
would be on the
level equal of mine.

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:12.719
That's the reason I entrusted
Shikadai to act on his own.

00:19:13.887 --> 00:19:16.623
Seems the game
board has changed.

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:18.025
Sorry, Dad.

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:20.093
[Shikamaru] Shikadai felt
something was out of place

00:19:20.127 --> 00:19:22.629
with the situation
and went with Boruto.

00:19:22.663 --> 00:19:23.764
[Naruto] During the debriefing,

00:19:23.797 --> 00:19:25.999
they all said that Shikadai
took over the leadership

00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:28.001
and it was in part thanks to him

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:29.469
that everything worked out.

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:33.307
[Shikamaru] Yeah, I kinda had
a feeling that would happen.

00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:36.610
I knew they'd act
without thinking

00:19:36.643 --> 00:19:40.280
and I'd thought it be
safer with Shikadai around

00:19:40.314 --> 00:19:42.416
and at the time, the
argument could be made

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:44.585
that the only ones
who could really move

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:46.053
around freely were genin.

00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:48.522
[Naruto] And just
as you predicted,

00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:52.025
Shikadai managed to get crucial
intel about the incident.

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:54.962
He immediately send
word to the Leaf, to us,

00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:56.897
and it was thanks to that intel

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.533
that we were able to
take decisive action.

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:01.568
All right.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:06.106
Yeah, the whole village
has been taken over.

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:08.442
[Shikamaru On Phone] Okay,
I understand the situation.

00:20:08.475 --> 00:20:09.443
Now, listen.

00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:10.677
Just lay low.

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:13.080
If you get captured again...

00:20:13.113 --> 00:20:16.683
[Shikamaru] Naruto, just
what are you trying to say?

00:20:16.717 --> 00:20:17.851
[Naruto] What I mean is,

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.086
you sent Shikadai out there

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:21.722
in order to help
Boruto in your place,

00:20:21.755 --> 00:20:23.223
isn't that right?

00:20:23.257 --> 00:20:26.426
So I, I've gotta do what I can.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.628
Just wait, Shikadai.

00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:31.632
The knight that jumps
far falls prey to a pawn.

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:32.833
That it?

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:36.637
Dad, I'm sorry that I'm
acting so selfishly.

00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:41.475
But after all, I did come
here of my own free will.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.012
[Naruto] Because of our
positions in the Leaf,

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:47.014
we couldn't move
around very easily,

00:20:47.047 --> 00:20:48.882
but someone like Shikadai
could be sent out

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:50.184
to act in your stead.

00:20:51.885 --> 00:20:53.220
He's able to stand in

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.222
for the Hidden Leaf's
most brilliant intellect.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:58.125
That's pretty remarkable,
wouldn't you say?

00:20:58.158 --> 00:20:59.393
-Naruto.
-How can you fight

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.562
in a way that exposes
yourself to danger?

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:02.896
You're really strong.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.498
Honestly, stronger than us.

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:08.068
We have to compensate by
using another kind of strength

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:10.137
to make up for the difference.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.739
Another kind of strength?

00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:13.740
That's right.

00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:14.942
The strength of the heart.

00:21:14.975 --> 00:21:16.877
It's because we're
able to put our lives

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.412
into the hands of our friends.

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.181
Friends that we trust in
with all of our heart.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:33.026
Do you know why you were
the one we selected?

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.230
It's because, most
importantly a Chunin

00:21:36.263 --> 00:21:39.233
must have the ability
to lead a team,

00:21:39.266 --> 00:21:42.870
discern battle situations, and
make appropriate judgements.

00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:44.271
That right?

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:47.508
That alone isn't the right
answer, not entirely.

00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:52.579
It's also because you have
the most importantly quality

00:21:52.613 --> 00:21:54.147
a Chunin needs.

00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:56.583
You truly care
about your comrades.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.088
Will you accept this?

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:06.994
Yes.

00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:14.635

00:23:42.022 --> 00:23:43.857
(energetic music)

00:23:43.891 --> 00:23:46.226
Really, my first
mission as a captain?

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.028
Your teams been
assembled in a rush

00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:50.364
but I'm sure it will
be a piece of cake.

00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:52.533
[Shikadai] What does that mean?

00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:55.102
This seems like it's
gonna be a real drag.

00:23:55.135 --> 00:23:57.271
[Moegi] Well, just do
your best, new captain.

00:23:57.304 --> 00:23:59.606
[Shikadai Voiceover]
Next time on Boruto

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.141
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:03.210
The Qualities of a Captain.

00:24:03.243 --> 00:24:04.978
[Shikadai] If it
comes down to it,

00:24:05.012 --> 00:24:07.214
I can probably manage it myself.

00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:08.248
Right?
