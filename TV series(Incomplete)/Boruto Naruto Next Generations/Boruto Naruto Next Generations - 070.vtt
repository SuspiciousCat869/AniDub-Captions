WEBVTT

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.210
<i>And now I'll tell you</i>
<i>what your mission is</i>
<i>going to be...</i>

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.946
Okay, Team 5, you
will transport a
plate that's been

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.982
designated as a
national treasure.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.851
We're gonna deliver
that?

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.687
Whoa... This is
making me super
nervous.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.222
Just leave it to me!

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.557
Huh?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.965
Hey... Uh... What's
that you're wearing?

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.537
Oh! You mean this? It
is an arcane necklace
that cures anxiety!

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.571
Uh--

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.275
With this, you can
wave goodbye to
nervousness!

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.977
Now! Let us go, guys!

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.149
<i>What?! You're back</i>
<i>already?!</i>

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:31.685
Mmm. Uh?!

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:37.024
The same second I
handed it to him, he
got all nervous.

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:39.793
And right away, he
dropped it on the
ground.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.995
I am sorry.

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.164
Then... that thing
didn't work at all!

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:46.767
It did not happen
'cause of anxiety!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.302
My hand just
slipped, that
is all!

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.436
[groaning]

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:52.806
But why did you even
start wearing it in the first
place, Metal?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.908
Oh... it is just
that...

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:58.045
I have some important
training coming up
and I absolutely

00:02:58.078 --> 00:03:00.113
cannot be nervous
during it!

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.549
So I bought this
to help me with that!

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:06.153
You're saying... that
you seriously believe
something like that

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.688
is gonna work
for you?

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.331
Eight Inner Gates!
First Gate of
Opening... Open!

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:21.668
[yelling]

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:27.741
Uh!

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:34.381
Okay! Let us begin!

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:37.551
Opening the Eight
Inner Gates allows
you to remove all of

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:40.554
your limits and
acquire enormous
power.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.590
<i>There are eight</i>
<i>places, or gates, that</i>
<i>control the chakra</i>

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:46.493
<i>flowing inside your</i>
<i>body. What you just</i>
<i>witnessed is the</i>

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:49.563
<i>result of opening the</i>
<i>first of these gates.</i>

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.599
It is the only
technique I can pass
on to you, since I

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.101
have no ninjutsu.

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:57.538
I thought it was time
to teach you.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.741
So this is it?!
The... ultimate
taijutsu technique?!

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:03.710
I will finally be
learning it?

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:07.381
But remember... as I
told you before, the
more Gates that you

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:10.918
open, the greater the
toll this technique
takes on your body.

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:11.618
[gulping]

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.255
My own master, Guy
Sensei...

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.891
...sustained grave
injuries over his
whole body from this

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.626
technique's effects.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.629
But understanding
this technique will
not just be about

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:25.799
enduring the harshest
training... You will
also have to face the

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.734
very core of your
being!

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:28.735
Mm.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.539
Are you truly
prepared to do that?

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:35.642
[panicking] Uh... Just
H-Hold on a minute!

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:36.743
I leave it to you!

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.178
What is wrong?

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:41.148
Oh! Yes! Of
course I am!

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:44.651
Hmm... What is that
necklace that you are
wearing?

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:49.256
Oh... You mean this?
It is just something
that cures anxiety!

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.324
Anxiety?

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.460
I absolutely cannot
afford to become
nervous while

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:56.930
undertaking this
training, so I found
this online!

00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.399
It makes me feel
really great!

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.934
[sighing]

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:04.004
Aw, Metal, perhaps
you are not ready.

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.273
Huh?

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.875
<i>I am postponing the</i>
<i>Eight Inner Gates</i>
<i>training.</i>

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:08.575
Huh?!

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.578
It seems that it
is a little too
soon for you.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.048
Huh?! But why?

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:18.452
Until you yourself
realize why...

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.021
...there is nothing
at all that I can
teach you.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.893
P- Papa?

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:30.831
[people chatting]

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.599
<i>Why did papa say that</i>
<i>to me...?</i>

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:39.173
All right, then! I
must do something
about my anxiety!

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:43.377
It's still morning and
the power of youth is
ablaze in you!

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.278
Huh?!

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:46.413
Ah!

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.584
<i>[chuckling] Sorry,</i>
<i>sorry! I was doing my</i>
<i>rehab when I saw you</i>

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:51.752
<i>looking troubled!</i>

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.057
G- Guy Sensei?!

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.458
Uh! Is that...?

00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:02.462
Is that you, Metal?!
Wow, look at you!
You're all grown up!

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:03.830
Y-Yes!

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.999
Uh... But Metal
what's the matter?

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:08.635
What's with the
long face?

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.571
Well, uh, you see...

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:15.642
I see. So it's the
Eight Inner Gates,
huh?

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:16.877
Yes, sir.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.713
I messed up. Papa is
disgusted at how I

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.648
always get nervous
so fast.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:22.749
[sighing]

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:25.385
Yes, I understand...

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.455
Hey, Metal... if
you're free, I'd like
you to come and hang

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:29.623
out with me today.

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:31.024
Huh?!

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.628
Come along. I'm on my
way to teach at the
Academy right now.

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:36.063
And maybe...

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:38.732
... you'll pick up a
hint or two about
your issue.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.267
<i>So? Let's go!</i>

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.568
Uh... sure!

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.307
[people chatting]

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:48.108
Hm?

00:06:48.976 --> 00:06:51.645
Hmm? Curious, huh?

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:53.914
Ah! I am sorry,
it is just--

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.415
No. It's fine!

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:59.720
Thanks to all the help I've
been getting, I've been able to
focus on my rehab.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.822
And now I can move
even better,

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.557
though only for
a short time.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.927
<i>And yet here I am,</i>
<i>worrying about my</i>
<i>anxiety.</i>

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.430
<i>You truly are</i>
<i>amazing, Guy Sensei!</i>

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.766
[groaning]

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:24.912
[grunting]

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:28.115
Amazing! You've
certainly trained
well!

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:29.917
Of course I
have!

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.120
This is the least I
should be capable
of...

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:36.056
...if I am ever going
to have any hope of
mastering...

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.325
... the Eight
Inner Gates!

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:38.725
Uh?!

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.328
[admiring]

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:43.330
[panicking]

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:49.369
[panting]

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:51.972
We are running
late because of
my anxiety.

00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:55.709
Maybe one of these
necklaces is not
enough.

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.445
I think that I had
better go buy another
one!

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.418
I still can't believe
it! Guy! He's a war
hero!

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:06.887
Getting to hear him
talk is gonna be

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.556
unbelievably
exciting!

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.659
W-Why are you here
even though you are
not students anymore?

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:15.596
Iwabe's a big fan of
Guy, in case you
couldn't tell...

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:19.066
Hey, hold up, Denki!
Don't you want to
hear him talk, too?!

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:21.735
Yeah! I do! Of
course I do!

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:24.104
You haven't changed
a bit, Iwabe.

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:26.673
Now, then, you
remember the
difference between

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:27.975
ninjutsu and
taijutsu?

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.910
Uh, yeah, sure
I do!

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:33.881
Ninjutsu goes boom! I
mean, you know, it
has force, and--

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:35.082
Good grief.

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:39.086
Often, ninjutsu is viewed as the
most essential skill for
shinobi.

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:42.055
But in reality, taijutsu is
just as important.

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.190
That's because--

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:46.460
Without relying on
chakra or seals, one
can swiftly counter

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:48.929
against an enemy.
Isn't that right?

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:50.297
Correct.

00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:54.868
The truth is, I'm not all that
great at taijutsu. That's why I
want to learn more about it.

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:56.103
And that's why I came.

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:59.039
[laughing] I like
your spirit!

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:00.874
I'm sure that just
listening to my

00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:02.142
lecture will make
you stronger!

00:09:02.176 --> 00:09:04.645
Yeah! I'll listen
real close!

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:07.781
<i>And I am hoping that</i>
<i>I will learn some</i>
<i>kind of hint that</i>

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:10.784
<i>will help me conquer</i>
<i>my anxiety!</i>

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:15.722
Of course Ninjutsu is
important. However,
because I worked hard

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:19.393
to hone my taijutsu,
I was able to fight
side by side with

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:21.895
Naruto during the
Fourth Great Ninja
War.

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:25.065
Without a doubt, we
were facing the
strongest foe that

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:26.600
we ever faced.

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.869
And his name was...

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.370
It was...

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.372
Hmmm...

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:33.640
I forgot!

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:35.909
[groaning]

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.912
Of course, I did
suffer some losses...

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:42.850
But still... we were
able to protect what
we valued the most.

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:45.018
So in the end, I
had no regrets.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.489
<i>Guy Sensei, thank you</i>
<i>for your inspiring</i>
<i>lecture.</i>

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:53.293
All right, do any of
you have any
questions?

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:54.761
Um...

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:57.965
Really? You don't
have any regrets at
all?

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:58.899
[gasping]

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.167
Nope! None!

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:03.871
It may sound funny to
say, but it's thanks
to these legs that I

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:05.539
can still persevere!

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.708
Instead of lamenting
the way things are...

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:10.878
...confronting the
truth and embracing
it makes people

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.579
become even stronger.

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:14.381
I truly believe that.

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:15.415
[gasping]

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:19.786
Okay... how about a
taijutsu demonstration?

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.188
Can you really do
that?!

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.992
Please, don't worry.
Now, then...

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:27.394
I'm going to ask you
two to volunteer.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:30.564
Huh? Two of us
against you, Mister
Guy?

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:33.400
Are you sure about
that? With your leg?

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:35.869
Of course! You heard
me earlier.

00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.472
I'm more agile now
than ever before.

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.239
All right...

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:43.143
Honestly, two against
one is nothing.

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:49.016
Now. Let's get
started.

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:52.953
[grunting]

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.922
Huh? [panicking]

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.357
<i>They're all</i>
<i>staring! Ahhhhhhh--</i>

00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:58.125
[grunting]

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.760
I can't depend
on him.

I am just not able
to conquer my anxiety.

Yes. I must
apologize.

00:13:58.605 --> 00:14:03.410
From here on, I will
have to face Metal in
my own way somehow.

00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:11.051
I can't believe it.
And we were so close to
capturing the thief, too.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:13.754
I am sorry. It
was my fault.

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:15.455
Yeah, you
got that right.

00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:17.391
There's no doubt it
was because of you.

00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:20.594

jangled, it was like
we were just telling

we were!

face this challenge,

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:12.546

are now... should be
able to figure out

Eight Inner Gates!

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:36.637
You have started!
That hit you landed
was so strong because

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.172
you opened
the First Gate.

00:20:38.205 --> 00:20:38.672
Huh?!

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.844

you felt produced an absolutely

unbelievable amount of
adrenaline.

00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:48.815

you to open the
First Gate.

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.150
[gasping]

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:53.921
And to mess with
your opponent the
way you did...

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:56.890
Your moves...
They were just
so unpredictable.

00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:58.926
They sure kept
Lee off balance.

00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:01.328
Seems that I was
right after all!

00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.429
Huh?

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:03.730
Yes!

00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:07.801
That facing yourself
makes you strong.
[chuckling]

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:10.571
G- Guy Sensei!
[sobbing]

00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:13.373
You guys! Now this is
the spirit of youth!

00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:15.576
This feels so
nostalgic, Guy
Sensei!

00:21:15.609 --> 00:21:17.544
<i>[sobbing]</i>

00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:19.046
[groaning]

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:20.380
All right, you two,

00:21:20.414 --> 00:21:24.017
Now it's time for
us to do three
thousand pushups!

00:21:27.421 --> 00:21:27.888
Hey, wait...!

00:21:27.921 --> 00:21:30.257
Hmm?

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.860
It's gone! What did
you do with that weird
necklace you had?

00:21:32.893 --> 00:21:35.596
Oh! I do not need
that thing anymore.

00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:39.600
Now I know the
anxious me is the
genuine me.

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:41.134
[confused groaning]

00:21:41.168 --> 00:21:44.004
Uh... Well, a lot of
stuff happened.

00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:45.772
It was amazing, huh?

00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:46.573
Hmm?

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:50.878
All right, Team 5,
your mission is to
deliver this vase,

00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:52.346
<i>a national</i>
<i>treasure.</i>

00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:56.483
Mm?!

00:21:57.684 --> 00:22:00.053
And please, do your
best not to break it
this time.

00:22:00.587 --> 00:22:03.056
[groaning]

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.491
[panicking]

00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:05.692
Now just calm down, okay? Just
stay calm!

00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:06.727
Hey, you're gonna
drop it!

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.561
<i>I cannot!</i>

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:46.827
<i>Hey, youngster! Show</i>
<i>me around the Leaf</i>
<i>Village!</i>

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.462
Hey, who's
the old guy?

00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:51.265
Are you Ohnoki the
Fence-Sitter, the
shinobi world's

00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:54.001
famous hero? The Five
Kage Summit's underway
and--

00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:57.671
<i>I don't care one whit</i>
<i>about that! Now take</i>
<i>me to a dumpling</i>

00:23:57.704 --> 00:23:59.773
<i>shop- Ow! My back!</i>

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:02.976
<i>Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next</i>
<i>Generations:</i>

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.546
<i>"The Hardest Rock</i>
<i>in the World"</i>

00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:09.016
Tell me the truth. Is
this geezer really a
legendary shinobi?
