WEBVTT

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.043
(birds chirping)

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.814
A training course
in Medical Ninjutsu?

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.216
I guess that the
time's finally come.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.452
We learned a little
of it in the Academy,

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.688
but this is the first time for
actual formal training, right?

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:22.723
(Sarada sighs)

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.226
When you become a genin,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.195
they make you undergo at
least some training in it.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.664
But when it was time
for our class to do it,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.199
the session got delayed.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.668
Mm-mm.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.503
[Mitsuki] Each team has
to send one representative

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:37.804
to take it, right?

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.173
Who should it be?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.341
Well, it requires
intricate chakra control.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.343
I'm not cut out for that stuff.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.912
They do say the skills required

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.480
are different than
those for fighting.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.550
And besides, Medical Ninjutsu
is really kinda low-key,

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:50.717
you know?

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.819
Although, it's a ninjutsu
that helps support others,

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.621
so it's important
to learn it, right?

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.191
If that's how you feel,
then why don't you go?

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.427
If you're not going to go,
then I'm not going either.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.629
Come on, that again?

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.699
Then I think you're the
perfect one to take it, Sarada!

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.168
Huh? Me really?

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.470
I mean, you are Sakura's
daughter, right?

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.673
I'm sure you've
got a knack for it!

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.909
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.578
If your goal's to
become the Hokage,

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.514
you should learn to use
Medical Ninjutsu, right?

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.449
Oh, yeah, I suppose so.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.085
Well, it looks like you're
the one we're choosing!

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.687
That okay, Mitsuki?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.955
It is. I agree.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:30.958
Mm-hm. Awesome! We're
counting on you!

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.659
(Sarada chuckles)

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:33.694
Right.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.568
(opening theme music
singing in Japanese)

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.767
[Shikamaru] Here's the
list of participants

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.870
for the Medical Ninjutsu class.

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.539
Oh, good! We can finally
start the training!

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:28.742
This year the genin seem
to keep getting involved

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.477
in a bunch of
troublesome incidents,

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:33.413
so we've had a hard time
scheduling this session.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.415
Well, there's a limit
to how much anyone

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.218
will be able to master
in one short session.

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:40.153
But all the same, because of it,

00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:42.956
we might find someone who'd
make a good Medical Ninja.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.825
I think it's really important.

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.693
That's true.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.428
I mean, they only teach
the basics at the Academy,

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:49.897
after all.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.632
Yeah, it's just like they say,

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:53.300
it's always good to be prepared.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.403
So it only makes sense to
have the genin learn it, too.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.872
Anyway, you're the head
of the Medical Department.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.040
I'm counting on you.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.675
(Sakura chuckle) Roger!

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.879
-Oh, boy.
-Is everything okay?

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:08.081
My daughter's on the
list of participants.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.283
I'd imagine that Sarada

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:12.152
would master Medical
Ninjutsu really quickly.

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:13.720
That sure would be great!

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.558
(Sarada sighs)

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.762
(Sarada continues sighing)

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.263
Oh, what am I gonna do?

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:25.599
Even back then, when I
was still in the Academy,

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.135
I was never any good
at Medical Ninjutsu!

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.405
I mean, you are Sakura's
daughter, right?

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.574
I'm sure you've
got a knack for it!

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:37.077
(Sarada chuckles)

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.345
The thing is,

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.013
you really can't learn
Medical Ninjutsu properly

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.949
unless you have a
mentor to guide you.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.183
(Sarada inhales anxiously)

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:45.118
I was gonna ask Mom to teach me,

00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:48.021
but since she's so busy, I
couldn't talk to her about it.

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:49.389
(Sarada sighs miserably)

00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:51.658
Maybe I oughta just be upfront
about all of this stuff,

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:54.261
and tell everybody the truth.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.362
But then,

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:57.064
if they were to find out
that Sakura's own daughter

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:58.565
can't do it!

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.802
I gotta say, Lord
Seventh is just perfect!

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:05.038
(Sarada gasps)

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.773
It's only natural
that the Hokage

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.275
is perfect and the strongest.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.311
I guess that's what it
takes to be a Hokage.

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:14.882
He couldn't be such a good
defender if he wasn't perfect.

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:18.051
The Seventh Hokage is perfect!

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:24.358
If I want to become the Hokage,

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:27.561
I have to be able to do
absolutely everything.

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.496
-The perfect Hokage-
-All right, I'm going in

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.032
with the super-special
rare Lord Seventh!

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:37.137
The Seventh Hokage SSR
really is the perfect card!

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.440
(instrumental music)

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:50.117
Anyway, I'll have to manage
somehow just for one day!

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:52.085
(birds chirping)

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:53.487
(Sarada inhales) Morning!

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.324
(sighs)

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.593
So, you're the
participant from Team 7.

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:02.296
If it was Boruto,

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:03.797
I figured that both of
us would be kept back

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.898
after class together.

00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:06.700
Listen, don't worry about that.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.068
If you are kept back,

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.404
I can give you some special
lessons to get you up to speed.

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:11.605
Huh?

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.007
Don't act so smug just 'cause
you know Medical Ninjutsu!

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.476
Or else Sarada'll
leave you in the dust.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.945
(Sarada groans)

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:19.379
(Sarada gasps)

00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:20.214
Well, sure!

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:21.582
After all, Sarada
is the daughter

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:24.218
of the Medical Ninjutsu
specialist, Ms. Sakura.

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.420
So she's cut from an
entirely different cloth!

00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:28.255
(Sarada groans)

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:29.823
This should be easy for you!

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:33.193
Uh, I wonder about that.

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:35.529
Please help me
out today, Sarada.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:36.830
Yeah! Me, too!

00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:38.131
Oh, sure!

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:40.467
If there's something that
you don't get, just ask!

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.070
What am I even saying?

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:44.671
Oh, I'm such an idiot!

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.740
(gasping)

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.175
Good morning, everybody!

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:52.546
In this seminar today,

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.048
we're all gonna be
studying Medical Ninjutsu.

00:06:56.183 --> 00:07:00.187
The most fundamental
aspect is chakra control.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.424
Doing Medical Ninjutsu requires
extremely delicate control.

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:07.094
Also, being able to
maintain chakra control

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:09.596
for a long period
of time is crucial.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.964
It's may not be very flashy,

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:12.466
but Medical Ninjutsu requires

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.868
a lot of really
hard work to master.

00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:16.270
[Students] Yes, ma'am!

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:22.276
Oh, boy, Medical Ninjutsu
is really difficult after all.

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.145
It's not something you
can learn overnight.

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:26.713
This is just the worst!

00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:29.550
All right, we'll be going
over five parts today.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.752
(students chattering)

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:32.953
(students sigh)

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:35.322
Knowledge is important
for Medical Ninjutsu.

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.090
So first, I'll give
a short lecture

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.293
followed by a written exam.

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:40.260
Aw, yes!

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:42.362
I may not be good at
practical application,

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:44.531
but I'm great at written exams!

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:49.536
(energetic music playing)

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:02.950
(Iwabe gasping)

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:05.485
Yes! I got through it!

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.486
Amazing!

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.754
A perfect score?

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:09.156
Nice job!

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:10.824
What score did you get?

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:12.025
A perfect score.

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:13.961
Just as expected from Sarada!

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:15.229
She always aced everything

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:17.164
back when we were
at the Academy too.

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:18.966
(Sarada chuckles)
Oh, I don't know!

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.567
(Sarada chuckles nervously)

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:23.403
I wish it was just written
tests from here on!

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:27.074
Now, part two's a
practical application!

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:28.542
(Sarada chuckles)

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:29.910
I shoulda known!

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:31.945
Being able to apply the
knowledge you've gained

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:34.615
is critical to making
Medical Ninjutsu work.

00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:36.817
First, Antidote Jutsu.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.021
You'll be using your chakra to
separate and isolate liquids.

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:42.189
All right, first of all,

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:43.891
I'm going to mix these
two liquids together

00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:45.292
to make coffee milk.

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:49.730
Then for the next step
I'll separate them again.

00:08:57.171 --> 00:08:59.506
(students gasping)

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.641
I've got a question,

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.743
when you separate them does
it taste any different?

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:04.144
This isn't a cooking class!

00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:06.480
What does it possibly
matter what they taste like?

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.749
(students laughing)

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:09.950
Shut up!

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:11.818
I'm just more interested
in the scientific method

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:12.886
than you guys!

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.957
(energetic music playing)

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.192
(Wasabi groans)

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:21.195
(Doushu groans)

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.098
Coffee and milk
are both liquids,

00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:27.434
but the composition of
each of them is different.

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.870
So, hat's why we're
able to isolate

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.004
the different components,

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:33.207
and extract them from
a liquid mixture.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.043
This lesson can be applied
to extracting poison

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.411
from the body.

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:40.013
During a mission, if your
teammate's poisoned by an enemy,

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:41.815
or bitten by a venomous snake

00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:44.184
knowing this'll be very useful.

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:46.486
It's a basic fundamental skill.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.523
It's this difficult, and
it's just a basic skill?

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:53.227
What do I do?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.896
It won't separate
even a little bit!

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.364
It's just getting
more mixed together!

00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:01.902
Oh, I should just be
honest and speak up!

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.637
Oh no.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.672
(gasps)

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:09.443
(Sarada groans)
Concentrate!

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:10.744
(Iwabe grunts)

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.379
Just a little more!

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:19.152
It separated!

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:21.021
Oh, thank goodness!

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:22.689
But I'm so thirsty now.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.426
Ugh, not good!

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.561
(Sarada groans)

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:28.929
What?

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.631
I did it?

00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:31.665
How?

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.034
Let's see!

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:36.904
Okay, you isolated them.

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:38.672
Uh. Yeah, I sure did!

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.340
(Sarada chuckles)

00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:41.375
(Sarada sighs)

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.946
(birds chirping)

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.080
(Boruto sighs)

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.482
This is so boring.

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:50.484
It's great that we get
a day off from missions

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.419
while they have to
go to a lecture but-

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:54.188
If you're not
attending the lecture,

00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:55.622
I guess you get homework.

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:56.490
Yeah, I guess so.

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:58.559
But we finished
all of it already!

00:10:58.592 --> 00:10:59.593
(gasps)

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.094
I know!

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:02.429
Mmh, what is it?

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:04.665
Let's get outta here
and kill some time!

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:07.134
(both sigh)

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:12.339
All right, now part three
is on Healing Jutsu.

00:11:12.372 --> 00:11:15.142
You're going to be concentrating
chakra into your palms,

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.711
and applying it to a
wound to speed up healing.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.547
Those are special
training dummies.

00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:22.950
They've been given
injuries that close up

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:26.386
when Healing Jutsu Chakra
is applied to them.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.389
If the area that's split
closes up you've succeeded.

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:37.598
What do I do?

00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:39.800
Focus!

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.168
Come on, focus!

00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:45.239
(Sarada groans)

00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:55.282
(screaming)

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:59.653
(students sigh)

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:00.921
What?

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.389
It's closed up!

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.092
Yes! You succeeded!

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:06.326
Wait, but how!

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:09.830
Maybe I can pull this off.

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:13.166
I think I can get
actually through this!

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.302
Thank you, Lord Hokage!

00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:18.305
(Boruto groans)

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:20.274
Hey, what are you
doing, Shikadai?

00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:22.409
I should be asking
you that instead!

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.011
We're on standby,
but we ditched.

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:26.346
If we get caught
we're in big trouble!

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.215
Listen, don't worry about it.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.884
Miss Sakura doesn't have
the Byakugan like my mom,

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:32.019
or Big Sister Hanabi.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:33.120
She'll never know!

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:35.289
Well, guess what,
you guys? I do know!

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.624
(both gasps)

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:38.659
(sighs)

00:12:40.127 --> 00:12:41.495
(students chuckling)

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:43.530
(Sarada sighs)

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.205
Well, uh,

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:52.673
we finished all of our homework,

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:55.943
so we figured we'd just
come observe for a while.

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:59.746
Oh, yeah? That's
really it? Then, sure!

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.014
Oh. Great! Thank you!

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:02.783
I'm just happy more
people will gain

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:04.518
Medical Ninjutsu knowledge!

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:12.893
Well, go ahead, Sarada,
show us all your skills!

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:15.596
Yeah, okay, but just
don't get in the way.

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:17.464
Who am I kidding?

00:13:17.497 --> 00:13:18.632
Of course it's not okay!

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:21.602
I have to do something!

00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:25.305
Okay, on to part four,
emergency life-saving measures.

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:31.211
Make this bud bloom,
and you've succeeded.

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:33.480
There's a good reason
for learning this.

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:35.415
If you're ever in
a real emergency,

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:37.751
infusing chakra into a
teammate who's wounded

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:39.019
could save their life.

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:40.954
Now, let's begin.

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:42.155
It's a battle against time

00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:43.490
when you're trying
to save a life.

00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:45.592
You must work as
fast as possible.

00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:48.762
Otherwise, a life that
could be saved may not be.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:49.930
In other words,

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:52.032
a precious friend lying
before you could die.

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.902
That's why we wanna make sure

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:56.270
that one person on each team

00:13:56.303 --> 00:13:58.472
knows how to use
Medical Ninjutsu.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.640
[Students] Yes, ma'am!

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:03.410
(Wasabi gasps)

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:04.344
(Inojin screams)

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:06.280
Sarada! Can you
even do this stuff?

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:08.382
What? Yeah, of course I can!

00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:10.083
What do I do?

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:11.852
I don't sense it
blooming at all.

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.454
Oh, come on! Please, bloom!

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:20.827
Sarada, are you okay?

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:21.828
What?

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.297
Huh? Well-

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.331
Boruto!

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:28.969
I need to concentrate, so
can you please just go away?

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:30.704
You got it.

00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:37.578
It won't bloom!

00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:39.513
(Sarada sighs)

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:46.653
(Doushu groaning)

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.123
I can't!

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:03.003
It bloomed!

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:04.805
No way! That's amazing!

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:06.206
The flower bloomed, you know!

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.542
Huh? Oh, no, I just...

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:09.776
This is-

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.944
Look at this, you guys!

00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:11.945
Check it out!

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:14.014
Hey, uh, Boruto!

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:16.550
And here I was doubting
whether you were any good

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:17.484
at this at all,

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:19.753
but you're actually
amazing, Sarada!

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:21.355
Yeah, well, you know!

00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:23.290
You really might become Hokage!

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:25.759
-Yeah, I agree.
-As expected!

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.528
[Wasabi] That was just awesome!

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:31.198
It was really nothing
at all, I swear!

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:34.735
I actually got through it!

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.937
Just one more lesson to go.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.939
I'm gonna be okay!

00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:41.441
I know that I can pull this off!

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:44.611
Good work, everyone.

00:15:44.645 --> 00:15:46.213
Ms. Shizune?

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.482
Madam Advisor, what
brings you here?

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:51.084
We haven't had Medical
Ninjutsu classes in a while.

00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:52.619
I was curious.

00:15:52.653 --> 00:15:54.755
I'm very glad that I came today.

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.757
You're doing absolutely
great, Sarada.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.458
Oh, not at all!

00:15:58.492 --> 00:16:00.661
And I actually brought
a guest as well.

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:02.496
A guest?

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:04.998
Hey! Working hard?
Or hardly working?

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:07.067
Lord Seventh?

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.102
-Dad, what are you-
-[Iwabe] Lord Hokage!

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.638
(Boruto chuckles)

00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:13.807
It's really awesome that you
showed up to see this, Dad.

00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:16.243
-Sarada's been totally amazing!
-Huh?

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:18.545
Yeah, so it seems!

00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:20.480
It's great we have a shinobi

00:16:20.514 --> 00:16:22.683
with a talent for
Medical Ninjutsu.

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:24.618
It's just so exciting.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.286
No, I'm just-

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:30.090
Okay, next practical exercise.

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:32.693
Who here wants to
demonstrate the final part?

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:34.962
-Go on! Do it, Sarada!
-Huh?

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:37.631
Uh, no, that's okay, not me!

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.533
Hey! Don't be so shy!

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:40.601
He's right.

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:42.936
Even Lord Seventh is
even here to witness it.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.873
So go ahead and show
us your skills, Sarada!

00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:47.107
What?

00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:53.080
Apply chakra into
the training dummy,

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:55.716
and if you can make it
move then you've succeeded.

00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:03.190
Why did it end up like this?

00:17:07.828 --> 00:17:10.097
(gasping)

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.498
What do I do?

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:14.635
I can't make any mistakes
with Lord Seventh watching me!

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.238
Please move!

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:22.576
Huh?

00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:25.112
What's wrong?

00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:27.014
Move! Come on!

00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:32.286
Huh?

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:33.320
Why?

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.991
Urgh!

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:42.029
(all gasping)

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:47.234
No! Why! Please, just move!

00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:53.740
That fish should
cancel his plans.

00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:56.343
I can't do this anymore!

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:58.412
Sarada,

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:01.615
are you actually not very
good at Medical Ninjutsu?

00:18:01.648 --> 00:18:02.649
Ohhh, mom!

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.553
Mm-mm.

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:07.588
[All] Huh?

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.225
I'm not good at it,

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:14.294
but somehow I ended up
completing all the exercises.

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:16.029
I didn't even know
what I was doing.

00:18:16.063 --> 00:18:18.165
And with Lord Seventh watching,

00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:20.667
I wanted to prove
that I could do it.

00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:21.535
But I couldn't!

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.203
And since I knew
that you're expected

00:18:23.237 --> 00:18:26.006
to know Medical Ninjutsu
if you wanna be the Hokage.

00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:29.142
I'm so sorry!

00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:31.512
What? Is that all?

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.682
Listen, Sarada, this is
nothing to worry about.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.352
Lord Seventh?

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:40.754
Is it possible that you
felt you had to be good

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.623
at Medical Ninjutsu
no matter what

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:44.791
just because you're my daughter?

00:18:44.825 --> 00:18:46.093
It's true.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.195
And if I'm gonna be the
Hokage like Lord Seventh,

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:50.764
then I have to be
able to do everything.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:51.932
Well, you know,

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.334
I can't actually do
Medical Ninjutsu at all!

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:57.905
Huh? But you're the Hokage!

00:18:57.938 --> 00:18:59.706
Yeah, well, to
tell you the truth,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.809
I probably have more
weaknesses than I do strengths.

00:19:02.843 --> 00:19:04.344
Yeah, you've sure
got that right!

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:06.513
Trust me, I can
vouch for it myself!

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:08.081
Not just Medical Ninjutsu,

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:10.317
but dad also can't
cook to save his life,

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.052
he always leaves the lights on,

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:13.620
and he oversleeps all the time.

00:19:13.654 --> 00:19:16.623
Hey, Boruto, come on! I
think that's enough, now!

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:19.326
And besides, if Naruto
actually were perfect

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.195
he wouldn't need me around!

00:19:21.228 --> 00:19:24.731
So you mean it's okay
if I'm not perfect?

00:19:25.866 --> 00:19:27.434
Yes, of course it is!

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:30.137
We're all human, so
no one's perfect!

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.573
You simply have to walk
your own path, Sarada.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.641
Thanks, Mom!

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:36.877
(Sakaru chuckles)

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.514
(soft instrumental music)

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:02.236
It moved!

00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:05.272
-Hey.
-Yeah.

00:20:06.473 --> 00:20:10.143
Do you think that you
could give me some tips?

00:20:10.177 --> 00:20:11.178
Ah.

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:14.147
Guess I've got no choice!

00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:16.483
But since you asked,
yeah, of course!

00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:19.353
(Sarada chuckles)

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.022
I think I'm starting to
get the hang of this.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.490
After all is said and done,

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:25.926
it seems Medical
Ninjutsu's growing.

00:20:25.959 --> 00:20:27.628
Yes, you're right.

00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:29.396
Ms. Sakura! It's urgent!

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:31.398
(both gasp)

00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:33.534
(beeping)

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:43.810
(patient sighs)

00:20:43.844 --> 00:20:45.012
(Sakura sighs)

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:47.381
[Shizune] The head of
the Medical Department.

00:20:48.215 --> 00:20:50.684
Mom truly is amazing.

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:52.019
Well you know,

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:54.821
Sakura wasn't very good at
Medical Ninjutsu at first.

00:20:54.855 --> 00:20:56.623
(Sarada gasps)

00:20:56.657 --> 00:20:57.791
[Shizune] Back in the day,

00:20:57.824 --> 00:20:59.726
Sakura apprenticed
under Lady Tsunade,

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.596
and she underwent unimaginably
difficult training

00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:05.532
in order to become a
top-rank Medical Ninja.

00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:10.170
How was she ever able
to work that hard?

00:21:10.204 --> 00:21:11.538
Well, to be honest,

00:21:11.572 --> 00:21:14.608
I really think you ought to
ask her that for yourself.

00:21:14.641 --> 00:21:18.245
(soft instrumental music)

00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:26.286
-Uh, hey, Mom?
-Yes.

00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:29.656
Can you tell me why
you decided to become

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.558
-a Medical Ninja?
-Huh?

00:21:31.592 --> 00:21:34.728
[Sarada] I mean, the training
was really hard, wasn't it?

00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:40.434
Well, I wanted to become strong.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.169
I didn't wanna keep
staring at Naruto's,

00:21:42.202 --> 00:21:44.137
and your father's backs.

00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:46.173
I wanted to walk alongside them.

00:21:48.175 --> 00:21:50.611
Although I admit training
under Lady Tsunade

00:21:50.644 --> 00:21:52.112
was seriously grueling!

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:56.283
But depending on the
effort you put into it,

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:59.353
you might be able to use
Medical Ninjutsu, too!

00:21:59.386 --> 00:22:00.554
Really?

00:22:00.587 --> 00:22:01.555
But having a clear goal,

00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:04.525
and not giving up on it
is going to be crucial!

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:06.660
Yeah!

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:16.036
(closing theme music)

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:45.559
Team 15's goal will be to
surpass Team 5's score!

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:48.095
Always getting made fun
of by Iwabe and the others

00:23:48.128 --> 00:23:50.030
is really infuriating!

00:23:50.063 --> 00:23:51.932
[Namida] But what
specifically do you suggest

00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:53.033
we do, Tsubaki?

00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:54.701
We will have a
competition to determine

00:23:54.735 --> 00:23:57.271
who within the team performs
the best on missions.

00:23:57.304 --> 00:23:59.206
If our individual
abilities improve,

00:23:59.239 --> 00:24:00.941
our team's score will, too!

00:24:00.974 --> 00:24:04.178
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:06.013
[All] "Harmony in Gold."

00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:07.414
[Tsubaki] Wasabi, Namida,

00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:10.417
if your abilities catch up
to mine, we'll surely win!

00:24:11.852 --> 00:24:15.589
(closing theme music)
