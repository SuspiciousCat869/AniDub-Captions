Mr. Jugo.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.853
I'm sorry, you guys, it's
just...

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.322
I think it's beyond
our control now.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.359
I think that we should
just let them handle it.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.663
I know that you're worried,

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.768
but we're not experts
on all this stuff...

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.503
so I don't think
there's really anything

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.238
more we can do.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.040
Yeah, I know that, it's just-

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.443
Besides, Mr. Tosaka's with them,

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:44.478
I think that for now,

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.847
we should just go
look for Sumire.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.815

returned to the leaf,

about this, you know.

now the Class Rep too.

who's the victim here.

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.834
Why do you think?

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:36.270
Lord Orochimaru sent
us to this place

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:38.472
so we could bring Jugo back.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.073
Bring him back?

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:41.742
Judging by your reaction,

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:43.944
you know where
Jugo is, don't you?

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.979
So start talking.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.323
So he came here to
save the birds, huh?

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.124
All right, then.

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:58.926
We can't waste any more time.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.894
But where are you
going to go, Suigetsu?

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:02.896
We gotta find that
investigative team

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.097
from the Land of Rivers

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.500
and get Jugo away
from them just as soon

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.935
as we possibly can.

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.770
And those are his orders?

00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:11.038
Yeah, of course.

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:13.273
Jugo's Curse Mark is special.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:15.275
If outsiders were to
find out about it,

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.544
no good will come from
it, that's for sure.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:20.447
Or if they find out
his link to Orochimaru.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.916
I hate to say it but
I seriously doubt

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.918
they're going to be able
to handle him anyway.

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:26.887
Yeah, but the villagers
were really mad before.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.922
They kicked us all out.

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.624
That's none of our business.

00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:33.827
And if they do try to interfere
with what we're doing...

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:35.796
then I'm just gonna have to use
force.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.097
Wait, hold on a minute!

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.132
Are you actually serious
about doing that?!

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.869
Hey, listen, I'm not
playing kid games.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.071
If a few outsiders
get mixed up in this...

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:45.572
then it can't be helped.

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:47.040
A few outsiders?!

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:49.543
But what are we gonna do
about the birds, then?

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.546
Mr. Jugo stayed here so
he could save the birds

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.548
that were infected
with the Curse Mark.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.583
Who cares if that's
delayed a little bit?

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:59.653
Look, I don't know exactly
what Jugo was up to,

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.922
but doing this takes priority.

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:04.758
I thought you were
Mr. Jugo's friend!

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:05.893
You'd actually let everything

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:07.761
he risked his life for

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.229
all just go to waste?!

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:12.799
(sighs) All right,
Boruto, enough.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:14.067
You just met Jugo.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.370
You don't really know
anything about him at all.

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:18.405
So why should I listen
to someone like you

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.940
lecture me?

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:21.008
Same goes for you!

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.442
You don't know a
thing about how much

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:23.944
Mr. Jugo has done here!

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.612
Calm down, Boruto!

00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:26.947
You're right, I don't.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.949
But you're still the one
who doesn't understand

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:30.584
what's really going on.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:31.752
What's that?!

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.887
Okay, okay. That's enough.

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.088
They're only kids.

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:36.890
Don't take all
this so seriously.

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:39.293
Yeah, I know that,
Karin. I'm not.

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.895
Okay then, you have
any other ideas

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.363
of how we should do this?

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.300
Please just,

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.602
wait until the
Class Rep wakes up.

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:53.907
But why? What good's
that gonna do us?

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:58.045
and infected with
the Curse Mark.

00:07:58.078 --> 00:07:59.880
Shouldn't we find out
about the connection

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:01.782
to the Curse Mark, as well?

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.383
You know actually,

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:05.953
it would definitely be
good to have that intel.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.421
Karin!

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:08.388
Hey, now!

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:10.057
Don't decide things
all by yourself.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.258
Don't be too hasty!

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.393
Don't take action
without proper intel.

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:16.163
Isn't that what we were
told before we left?!

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:16.964
But-

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.600
Yeah, whatever. Suit yourself.

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.168
Well! All right, then!

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.038
Huh?

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:26.240
Sarada and I

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.475
are gonna take over
from here on out.

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:29.810
So, go on!

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.045
You boys can just go away now!

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.785
She probably just wants
to talk to Sarada alone

00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:39.786
for a while.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.221
You're actually quite a softie,

00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:43.624
aren't you, Suigetsu?

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.025
And you're quite annoying!

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.965
(Sarada sighs)

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.166
Don't be worried.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.935
I think that she's going
to wake up pretty soon.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:55.936
Right.

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:57.638
So, how are those glasses?

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:58.972
They working out okay?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.208
They are, thank you.

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:03.377
Oh, that's great!
I'm really glad.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.313

together last time we met.

Thank you very much, Miss Karin.

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:16.957
Back then and this
time around, too.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.059
You always seem to be saving me.

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:21.061
Nah, don't worry about it.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:22.829
I mean, I've known
you practically

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:24.231
since the day you were born.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:27.134
We may not be related,
but you're dear to me.

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:29.636
Hold on, are you telling
me that you feel like

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.637
I'm family to you?

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:32.739
You know, I wonder.

00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:33.907
For people like me,

00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:36.577
it's normal not to
have any family at all.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.078
But, for better or worse,

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:39.947
I guess Jugo, Suigetsu, and I

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.282
are kinda like a
family to each other.

00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:43.550
That's why,

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:45.052
even though Suigetsu acts
the way that he does,

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.887
he's worried about Jugo.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.289
You've known each
other a long time.

00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:50.290
My dad too.

00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:51.258
Well, yeah!

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.927
But now your dad has
his very own real family

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.529
to take care of, so uh...

00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:58.932
Well anyway,

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.834
your friend would actually
get better right now

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.803
if only she could bite me.

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:03.804
Huh?! Bite you?!

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:05.005
Yeah!

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:07.741
We could revive her if
we made her bite my arm

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:08.809
or something.

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.277
It's a special ability that I
have.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.945
Hey, do you wanna try it?

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:13.747
No.(chuckles)

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.616
I think I'll pass, thanks.

00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:22.923
(Jugo exhales heavily)

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:23.790
Oh, good!

00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:25.025
You're awake, Jugo!

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:30.097
That's right.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.666
I remember...(groans)

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.934
Don't push yourself.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.103
The tranquilizer should
take effect shortly.

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:38.372
Where am I?

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:41.241
It's a facility the Land of
Rivers' team set up.

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:43.277
I'm here 'cause they
asked for my help

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.179
with their investigation
into the birds.

00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:49.383
It's actually very
well equipped.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.818
So I should be able
to make a serum

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:52.953
to help the geese.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.454
Please help me, Jugo.

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:56.623
The geese?

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.060
But I ...

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.796
Boruto and the others
asked us to help as well.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.465
(Jugo gasps)

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:09.169
I see.

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:19.980
There you go.(sighs)

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.316
(geese squawking)

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.852
You know, I still
haven't forgiven you.

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:27.020
Not after what you
did to the Class Rep.

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:29.156
Yeah, whatever you say.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.991
So, what do you want from me?

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.526
I just wanna warn you.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.828
Since it seems obvious
that you don't actually

00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:36.763
understand Jugo at all.

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:37.998
What do you mean?!

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.666
His Curse Mark.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.537
It's a burden he was born with
and destined to have for life.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.706
He can't get away from it.

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:46.840
And he...

00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:49.510
knows that better than
anybody else does.

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:51.879
That's why he tries
to isolate himself

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.547
as much as possible.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.583
Is that so he doesn't
get people involved

00:11:56.617 --> 00:11:58.051
and hurt them?

00:11:58.085 --> 00:12:00.621
(sad music)

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:03.056
We tried for a long time

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.325
to find a way to help him too.

00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:06.593
So we really don't need you

00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:08.695
to lecture us about it.

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:09.897
But that's--

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.732
But it was all pointless.

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:14.735
He's accepted his fate now.

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:15.969
That's why he's chosen

00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:19.039
a solitary path of
existence away from people.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.874
(sad music)

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:22.309
And now, to have strangers

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:24.378
suddenly burst into his life.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.980
Don't you think that's
kinda irresponsible?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.084
(bird squawking)

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.889
It's a destiny he was born with?

00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:36.723
Huh?

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:40.160
There was just, someone
else who suffered

00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:42.162
from something like that,

00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:44.331
but they're trying their hardest

00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:46.767
to live their life the way that
they want

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.868
to live it.

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:51.271
And I think Mr. Jugo
must feel the same way.

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.741
He's in so much pain,

00:12:54.775 --> 00:12:55.976
but he endures it

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:58.045
and suppresses his
transformation with medicine

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:00.214
just to help the birds.

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:02.850
If he's really
given up on himself,

00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:04.518
why would he go
through all this?

00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:07.855
Why risk all this danger
to help the birds?

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.056
But,

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:11.091
aren't you just making
your own assumptions?

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.627
Well, maybe I am.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.430
But ultimately, the
decision is Mr. Jugo's

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.731
and nobody else's!

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.700
It's not mine or yours!

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.336
He's made his decision.

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:23.837
And supporting him
to the very end

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.973
is what a friend does, isn't it?

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:30.477
(sighs) Man, you
sure can talk, kid.

00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:33.146
You're just like Mitsuki
but more annoying.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.182
(chuckles) Yeah,
well, excuse me!

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:36.717
[Mitsuki] You guys.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.718
Huh?

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:38.986
It looks like the Class Rep

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:41.154
is finally awake now.

00:13:41.188 --> 00:13:43.190
(birds squawking)

00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:46.126
Twins who undergo Curse
Mark Transformation?!

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:49.763
And they, both
wear these collars.

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:52.432
Twins with collars?

00:13:56.537 --> 00:13:58.138
It's those two!

00:13:58.172 --> 00:13:59.606
Then that means those guys

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.442
from the investigative
team were lying to us!

00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:05.012
If they attacked
us to prevent us

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.681
from returning to the
Hidden Leaf Village,

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:08.715
I think they're doing something

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:10.484
they don't want
us to know about.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.686
(harrumphs) I
thought their stories

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:13.820
lined up too well!

00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:15.822
[Sarada] But, why
would they go so far?

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.224
It's most likely,

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:19.626
that their goal is
Jugo's Curse Mark.

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.496
That would certainly
make a lot of sense

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.631
if the enemy possesses
Curse Mark abilities.

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.900
Seems like they're
definitely up to something.

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:28.735
Argh, are you kidding?

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:30.037
This is really bad.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.139
If the village is the
enemy's headquarters,

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:34.141
Konohamaru Sensei,
Wasabi, and the rest

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:35.876
are in danger while
they're being treated.

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:36.877
Yeah.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.679
And Mr. Tosaka is helping them

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:39.713
without knowing all this.

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:40.714
(Sarada sighs)

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:42.316
Right. Then it's decided.

00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:43.750
We're gonna go save everyone

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:45.219
and get Mr. Jugo back!

00:14:45.252 --> 00:14:47.487
It'll be impossible
for just you three.

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:49.389
It's gonna take
all of us together.

00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:50.524
Hey, Karin!

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:51.525
It's not your call!

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.027
The Curse Mark could
be used on the people

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:56.396
that are being held
in the village,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.032
and then they could in
turn come to attack us.

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:01.802
So we have to be careful about
how we handle this.

00:15:01.835 --> 00:15:02.836
You underestimate me.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.838
Do you really think I would
lose?

00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:06.573
And if the village
ends up destroyed

00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:07.841
in the process?

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:09.676
Just what do you
think these kids

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.178
are gonna report
back to the Leaf?

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:12.880
Do you seriously
want Lord Orochimaru

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:14.147
to punish us?

00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:16.817
Do you really think
that these kids

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.585
are gonna be of any use?

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.787
I see. So it's a diversion then?

00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:24.157
If we work together and are able
to lure the two of them

00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:25.192
away from the village...

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:26.994
...then we can save Mr. Jugo

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:28.996
and everybody else
in the village too.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.697
Exactly right!

00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:32.366
As long as we get Jugo back,

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:35.702
then we can extract the Curse
Mark and treat them.

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:36.870
Got that, Suigetsu?

00:15:36.904 --> 00:15:38.739
(sighs) Yeah, fine.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.307
But if you think I'm gonna be

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.209
some kind of stupid
lure, guess again.

00:15:43.177 --> 00:15:45.012
Suigetsu and I will
be the rescuers.

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:46.813
And Boruto if that's okay?

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:49.349
And Sarada and I
will act as the bait.

00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:50.350
[Sumire] Wait!

00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:51.585
Huh?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.020
I wanna go too.

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:54.054
Class Rep?

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:56.190
You should get some more rest.

00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:57.224
Not yet.

00:15:57.257 --> 00:16:00.594
I really wanna help you
save Wasabi and Namida.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.229
Please, let me go too.

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:04.164
(sighs) Just a warning.

00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:06.900
I'm not rescuing anyone
who drags me down.

00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:08.969
That's totally fine by me.

00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:10.838
It'll be okay, Class Rep.

00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:13.040
All of us are gonna
save them together!

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:21.715
(Wasabi groans)

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:23.717
(Namida groans)

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.185
Oh, man!

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:27.621
The power of the Curse
Mark is amazing, isn't it?

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:30.824
And you'll be getting a
taste of it very soon.

00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:32.659
You know, big brother,

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:34.995
biting somebody to pass
on a Curse Mark to them

00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:37.364
kind of gives me
a little thrill.

00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:39.032
(Momo chuckles)

00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:41.068
(groans) Damn it!

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.737
Sumire. (groans)

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.472
That sure looks like it hurts.

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:48.141
Well, the Curse Mark
isn't established yet.

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:51.712
And this serum here would
remove it completely.

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:53.814
But of course,

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.816
we aren't going to give it to
you.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:57.050
(groans) Damn it!

00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:00.521
Oh, you're here.

00:17:00.554 --> 00:17:01.855
You've got work to do.

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:02.756
Come on.

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:04.892
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:17:04.925 --> 00:17:06.493
You mean we have to go?

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:09.496
There are some things
we have to attend to right now.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.732
Besides, you two have to
learn to clean up...

00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:13.133
your own messes.

00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:19.740
(footsteps approaching)

00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:20.974
Is this the place?

00:17:21.008 --> 00:17:22.676
Where we found
those Leaf shinobi

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:23.977
wandering around?

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:25.812
Big brother!

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:27.047
Huh?

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:30.150
Oh it's that little girl.

00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:31.885
She won't get away this time.

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:34.388
(chuckles)

00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:40.527
So how'd it go?

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:43.430
I think that we hooked
them in very nicely.

00:17:43.463 --> 00:17:44.398
Well,

00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:46.700
since they were looking
for the Class Rep...

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:47.768
it just made sense.

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.002
(harrumphs) I doubt
they'll figure out

00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:51.705
it's actually Sarada
transformed.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.107
(rock music)

00:17:57.878 --> 00:18:00.047
Let's get going.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.016
And I hope that I don't
need to remind you guys

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.751
that I'm only
interested in Jugo.

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:06.019
But who knows what might happen

00:18:06.053 --> 00:18:08.021
if you go in there
all by yourself?

00:18:08.055 --> 00:18:09.189
So I'm coming too.

00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:12.359
Whatever go ahead,
suit yourself.

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:13.594
Let's split up.

00:18:13.627 --> 00:18:15.696
I'll go and search the area

00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:16.763
for Konohamaru Sensei.

00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:19.032
And I'll look for
Wasabi and Namida.

00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:21.502
Class Rep, you sure
you're up to this?

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.537
I just hope that
Summoning beast of yours

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.673
isn't gonna go all crazy
like it did last time.

00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:27.741
(Sumire gasps)

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.209
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:31.745
What's all this
about not being able

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:32.746
to control Nue?

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:33.747
Is that true?

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.815
Yeah.

00:18:34.848 --> 00:18:36.550
It's just that Nue's
gotten so strong

00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:38.819
that I had a hard
time reining him in.

00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:40.320
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

00:18:40.354 --> 00:18:42.556
I'm just gonna get going now.

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:44.725
(footsteps)

00:18:47.027 --> 00:18:49.897
(chuckles) Playing tag huh?

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.698
Hold on, big brother.

00:18:52.733 --> 00:18:54.168
There's something strange here.

00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:56.036
Look at the way she's moving.

00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:58.038
She doesn't get too
close or too far,

00:18:58.071 --> 00:18:59.840
like she's luring us in.

00:18:59.873 --> 00:19:01.542
What? You think-?

00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:04.678
(rock music)

00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:15.856
(shushing)

00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:17.090
Boruto?

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:20.561
(rock music)

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.670
(Sumire gasps)

00:19:29.703 --> 00:19:30.671
Wasabi!

00:19:30.704 --> 00:19:31.705
Namida!

00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:33.674
Sumire?

00:19:33.707 --> 00:19:35.576
You came to get us?

00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:37.711
Uh-uh. Oh you guys.

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:38.745
I'm so sorry.

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:40.881
Over on that desk,

00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:42.482
there's supposed to be a serum

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:44.585
for the Curse Mark
in those syringes.

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:45.552
Okay got it!

00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:48.288
So I just need to
inject you both, right?

00:19:51.925 --> 00:19:55.462
(footsteps approaching)

00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:11.745
Damn!

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:13.981
Where'd he run off to?!

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.851
Ah, I see.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.152
That's how it is.

00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:20.354
Ever since I arrived here,

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:21.822
I thought there was
something strange

00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:23.857
about that research team leader.

00:20:23.891 --> 00:20:25.559
If you know where Jugo is,

00:20:25.592 --> 00:20:27.828
then can you just take
us to him already?

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:29.196
Uh, sure.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.566
By the way Boruto, who
is this guy with you?

00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:33.867
It's okay.

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:35.969
I'll explain after
all of this is over.

00:20:36.003 --> 00:20:37.337
All right, then.

00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:38.372
Follow me.

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:41.542
(footsteps)

00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:46.113
(chuckles)

00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.526
(footsteps approaching)

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.827
Only one?!

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:01.828
(Sasami giggles)

00:21:01.862 --> 00:21:03.063
No! No way!

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:08.368
How are you feeling?

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:09.169
Well,

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.671
I'm starting to feel better now.

00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:13.640
But I think the serum is gonna
take a little longer...

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:16.677
before it has its full
effect on the Curse Mark.

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:20.380
Well, well, well!

00:21:20.414 --> 00:21:23.417
I figured this is
what you were up to!

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.985
Damn, it can't be.

00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.989
And this time, you
aren't gonna get away.

00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:31.091
Not even a single one of you!

00:21:35.429 --> 00:21:36.430
He's in here.

00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:38.899
(Jugo groans)

00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:40.133
Mr. Jugo!

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:42.970
You okay?!

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:45.205
Hold on a minute. We'll
get you out quick.

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:47.040
[Boruto] We came to rescue you.

00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:50.544
(gasps) No, don't do it!

00:21:51.712 --> 00:21:53.747
(groans)

00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:56.116
Why you--!

00:21:57.718 --> 00:21:59.987
No way Tosaka, why?

00:22:00.888 --> 00:22:01.822
I owe you one,

00:22:01.855 --> 00:22:03.423
Boruto.

00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:04.558
In any event.

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:07.694
I welcome you to
my research lab!

00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:13.634
(upbeat music)

00:22:16.737 --> 00:22:20.541
(singing foreign language)

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:44.625
I'm sorry, Boruto.

00:23:45.893 --> 00:23:48.428
You see, this was all
in the name of research.

00:23:48.462 --> 00:23:49.396
[Boruto] No way!

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:51.765
So this whole thing
being a mission

00:23:51.798 --> 00:23:53.500
was a lie from the
very beginning?!

00:23:53.534 --> 00:23:55.002
[Josaka] Jugo's Curse
Mark is undoubtedly

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:56.003
the original.

00:23:56.036 --> 00:23:57.171
It's very rare.

00:23:57.204 --> 00:23:59.206
There's still so much
we don't know about it.

00:23:59.239 --> 00:24:01.141
It's the very best
research subject ever!

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:02.676
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:03.710
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:05.012
"Melee!"

00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:06.880
I'm not letting you
experiment on Jugo

00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:09.449
just to satisfy your curiosity!

00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:14.221
(upbeat music)
