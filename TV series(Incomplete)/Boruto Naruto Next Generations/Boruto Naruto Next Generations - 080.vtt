00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.579
[MITSUKI] <i>It's pretty, isn't it?</i>

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:30.050
When humans see something like
<i>this, some even cry.</i>

00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:33.187
Mitsuki, have you ever cried?

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:34.688
I haven't.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.526
If I die here,... do you think
you might cry?

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:41.695
I wonder...

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:43.530
Not sure.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.034
That boy... Boruto?

00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:52.005
Do you think you'd cry... if
Boruto died?

00:12:53.507 --> 00:12:55.042
Weren't you friends?

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.011
Boruto...

00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:00.314
Hey there, Mitsuki!

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:03.116
What are you up to right now,
wanna hang?

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.653
Come on, Mitsuki! Why don't you
join us, ya know?!

00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:11.024
Boruto... You could say that he
was like the sun in my sky.

[SEKIEI] <i>(CONSIDERING)</i>

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:17.364
[MITSUKI] <i>Actually, Cho-Cho said</i>

00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:20.868
[SEKIEI] She's the one who eats
an unbelievable amount, right?

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:23.003
That's right. She said close
friends...

00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:26.573
...are often times people...

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:30.244
...who share a secret between
<i>just the two of them.</i>

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:33.180
Oh? A secret between just the
two of them?

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:38.619
If that's the case... then I
wish that you'd tell me...

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:41.922
What's your secret, Mitsuki?

00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:43.357
Secret? Me?

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.426
I don't think I have any.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.528
You're lying.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.064

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:56.503

(CONFUSED)

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:09.349
You faked killing that Hidden
Leaf shinobi...

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:13.287
and you let a snake go while we
weren't watching... right?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.055
I didn't think anyone saw me do
that...

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:18.158
Why did you leave the snake
behind?

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:21.828
Did you intend to betray us
right from the start?

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.231
I just left a message for
Boruto...

00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:28.101
...that I'm going to the Land
of Earth...

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.036
...by my own will.

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:32.072
And that there's no need to
follow.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.508
That's it, truly.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.944
Didn't you think doing something
like that...

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.446
...would make us
suspicious of you?

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:43.350
I'm suspicious of you now... did
you know that?

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.053
If that's true, then why
didn't you restrain me?

00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:49.389
Maybe I'm just...
curious about you.

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.359
However...

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.462
Putting our plan in danger is
something else entirely...

00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:59.032
Especially when we're staking
our lives on it.

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:01.134
If you were to kill me right
now...

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:03.937
You'd be in trouble,
wouldn't you?

00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:06.373
I mean... your body is
deteriorating.

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:09.109
[MITSUKI] <i>But at least then...</i>

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:13.380
You wouldn't be able to cause
<i>any more trouble.</i>

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:16.383
Back then...

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.453
[SEKIEI] <i>Boruto... still</i>

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:22.523

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:26.560
So could it be...
you still feel that way, too?

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.061

00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:30.197

this...

00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:37.638
Boruto... the one you
think so highly of.

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:40.207
I'm... really, really curious.

[SEKIEI] <i>Tell me!</i>

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.383
Boruto... is always smiling...

00:15:50.551 --> 00:15:53.220
[MITSUKI]
And he's...straight forward...

00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:57.457
<i>But for some reason,...he's</i>
<i>always getting scolded.</i>

00:15:58.058 --> 00:16:00.027
<i>He hates to lose...</i>

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.131
<i>and causes trouble now and</i>
<i>then, but...</i>

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:07.067
...if it's for a friend... he
<i>never gives up.</i>

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:12.506
And that's why almost always...

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:16.043
...Boruto's surrounded by a lot
of friends.

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:19.046
[MITSUKI] <i>Yes... he always has</i>

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:25.085

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:28.222
He's my sun, so far away.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:32.693
But...

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:34.061
...maybe these feelings...

00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:38.398
<i>...were simply</i>
<i>just...fabricated.</i>

00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:45.539

(WEAK CHUCKLE) Is this it?

00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:34.454
Is this what falling asleep

(RELIEVED SIGH)

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.532
Can he be saved?

00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:54.701
Probably. At least
that's what The Doctor said.

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:58.639
In any event, we should get him
to Lord Ku as soon as possible.

00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.541
Yes...But before that...

00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:07.181
So this is him, huh? That's
Mitsuki? Why isn't he tied up?

00:19:07.214 --> 00:19:09.550
He said he would come with us
willingly.

00:19:11.051 --> 00:19:14.188
I came along with them of my own
free will.

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:18.358
Or... you just made it look that
way to gain our trust.

00:19:18.392 --> 00:19:22.362
His eyes are clear... But they
aren't trustworthy.

00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:25.132
Maybe he's the one who did
something to Sekiei...

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.466
to make him like this!

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.501
You're right.

00:19:28.635 --> 00:19:30.771
It's strange this would happen
to Sekiei so suddenly.

00:19:30.804 --> 00:19:31.705
Well?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.475
[KIRARA] All right, anyway...

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:38.445
We can't let Lord Ku see him
straight away.

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:41.615
I suppose we'll just have to
knock him unconscious.

00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:43.650
And as for his body...

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:45.118
Oh, that's right...

00:19:45.152 --> 00:19:48.522
Having to limit myself is
difficult.

00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:52.192
I said that I'd go along with
you all willingly...

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:53.727
...but nothing about being
captured.
