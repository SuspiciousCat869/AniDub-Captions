WEBVTT

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.275
(whooshing)

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.444
(thumping)

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.814
I'll beat 'em at their own game.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.215
Just hold on.

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.550
Leave this one to me,

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.085
the two of you go on ahead.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.353
[Boruto] What, why?

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.688
It'll be easier if we
fight them together!

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.624
You don't get it, do you?

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:27.961
Those guys are puppets and
I'm a puppet specialist,

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.497
so there's no way
I'll lose, right?

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.499
And besides, the
strategy for right now

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.669
should be to put the
mission first and foremost.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.071
(tense music)

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.073
Yes, that's absolutely right.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.142
We'll head straight
for the Leaf Village.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.210
Why?

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.946
You don't have to fight
alone, Mr. Kankuro!

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.814
(whooshing)

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:50.184
(poofing)

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.688
This isn't the time for you
guys to be hanging out here.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.956
The mission we were given

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.692
is to keep Master Shukaku
out of harm's way.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.826
Yeah, but...

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.562
Go, Boruto.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.529
Besides, I'm getting tired

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:05.465
of refereeing fights
between you two brats.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.802
(humming)

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:10.137
All right, fine.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.439
But you'd better catch up
to us later, Mr. Kankuro.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.175
Of course I will.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.078
I really can't
afford to lose now.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.315
(teeth chattering)

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.554
(humming)

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:29.223
(humming)

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.491
(footsteps approaching)

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:34.828
[Temari] It's taking them too
long to come back, isn't it?

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:35.929
Yeah.

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.831
But still, it's kind
of hard to believe

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.366
that something bad would happen

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.336
to both uncle Gaara
and Mr. Sasuke.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.938
You're still so naive, Shikadai.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.373
Part of being a shinobi

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.009
means that you always have to
think about the unthinkable,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.744
or so your dad would say.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.983
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.052
(tense music)

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:11.098
(footsteps shuffling)

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.402
Is Mr. Kankuro really
gonna be okay by himself?

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.803
He should be.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:18.472
My uncle's puppet jutsu

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.608
gets stronger and better
against more enemies.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:24.545
So basically his specialty
is being outnumbered?

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:25.512
That's right.

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:28.148
We'd only get in the
way if we were there.

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:28.982
Huh.

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:30.350
Well, he did seem
really confident

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:32.586
about fighting
against those puppets.

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.956
Come on, let's hurry up.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.358
Our duty first and
foremost right now

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.460
is to protect master Shukaku.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.063
Even if we die trying.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.834
(humphing)

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:49.436
(tense music)

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.709
(Opening Theme Music)

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:13.193
(singing in Japanese)

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:26.733
(Opening Theme Music)

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.045
(tense music)

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:40.047
Heh.

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.419
(whooshing)

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.422
(teeth chattering)

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:53.427
(whooshing)

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.662
(crunching)

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:58.298
(tense music)

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:02.069
Four to one.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:03.203
All right, then.

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:05.405
I've still got some
tricks up my sleeve.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.643
(poofing)

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.478
I mean after all, a puppet user

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:13.814
can't let puppets make
a fool of him, right?

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.450
(tense music)

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.257
(whooshing)

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.258
Heh.

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.292
Black ant.

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:28.061
(zipping)

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.097
(whooshing)

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.798
(doors shutting)

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:34.067
Secret black move, iron maiden.

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:37.171
(teeth chattering)

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.340
(metal clanking)

00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:42.309
That's really all you got, huh?

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.245
(whooshing)

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.280
It's fast!

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.318
(skidding)

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:54.221
(grunting)

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:56.323
This one's not like the others.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.092
(swords swishing)

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:02.763
Okay, so it's not going to
be as easy as I thought, huh?

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:07.201
But, I still won't let you
get your hands on Shukaku.

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.536
I'm gonna stop you
no matter what,

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.438
because that's my job now.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.781
(footsteps shuffling)

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.015
Huh?

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:25.419
What's wrong?

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:29.156
(cape whooshing)

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:36.930
(thudding)

00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:38.165
Enemies?

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:43.437
Well, so I was wrong.

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.078
(skittering)

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.114
No way, seriously,
it was only a lizard?

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:56.683
Well, I guess even calm
and cool elites like you

00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:58.185
can make mistakes sometimes.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.522
Hey listen,

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:03.690
don't you think you're
getting a little too wound up?

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:06.793
(footsteps shuffling)

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:08.328
If you keep being so tense,

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:10.731
you're never gonna
make it to the leaf.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:14.368
I'm not like you, unable to
consider the consequences.

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:16.703
I've calculated my
chakra allotment.

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.474
Calculated, huh?

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:23.043
Humans aren't machines,
you know that, right?

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.613
And that's why, to
ensure a smooth mission,

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:30.417
we have to be calm and
rational just like machines.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.552
Come on.

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:33.820
Do you always act like this?

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.222
Ha.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:39.426
(footsteps shuffling)

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.695
(thudding)

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.430
(popping)

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.831
Ah man, seriously.

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.533
Talk about annoying.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:48.268
You know what I'm saying?

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.170
(gasping)

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:53.507
Hip hip ha hoop hawoop!

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.541
Up we go!

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.643
(thudding)

00:07:56.677 --> 00:07:58.412
Pon pon ka pon!

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:00.080
Master Shukaku.

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.448
[Shukaku] Oh, give me a break.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.350
I just need a little
change of pace.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.052
I mean, anyone
would get depressed

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:08.822
inside all that hot and
stifling iron sand of yours.

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.924
You can't just do
what you please.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.794
Come on, we're in
a hurry, aren't we?

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.562
(grunting)

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.531
(sighing)

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:20.701
(footsteps shuffling)

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.772
Does he always go
around acting this way?

00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:27.207
Eh, who knows?

00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:30.143
But he reminds me
of the old Gaara.

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:31.078
Huh?

00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:33.680
Really, Mr. Gaara was like that?

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:35.349
Yeah, the old Gaara

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:38.051
wouldn't let anyone get
close to him at all.

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:41.788
But then someone came
along and changed him.

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:43.657
Who was it?

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.691
Naruto.

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:46.727
It was my dad?

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:49.196
[Shukaku] Naruto taught Gaara

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:51.465
that he should live for
something other than hatred.

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:55.903
He completely changed
Gaara's isolated way of life.

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.038
[Boruto] Changed
his way of life?

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:04.011
Naruto possesses the ability
to pull others close to him.

00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:05.546
Oh yeah?

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:07.047
My dad does, huh?

00:09:07.848 --> 00:09:09.216
Although I have to say,

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:12.085
I don't think Shinki's gonna
turn out like Mr. Gaara.

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:15.422
Well, he certainly
can be stubborn too.

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.790
Especially now.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.825
He's desperately
trying to fulfill

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:21.428
the duty entrusted to him.

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.197
Entrusted to...

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.432
Do you mean by Mr. Gaara?

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:26.934
No, not quite.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.335
Not just by Gaara.

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.438
Come on, don't just stand
there, you're wasting time.

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:34.508
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:37.678
(footsteps shuffling)

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.513
Entrusted duty, huh?

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.682
(footsteps shuffling)

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:44.051
(clanking)

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.959
(gasping)

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:53.327
Someone's coming.

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:56.196
But who?

00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:58.232
Is it the enemy?

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:01.301
If Lord Kazekage gets
attacked now, then...

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:06.273
[Girl] No, it's okay.

00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:10.277
(whooshing)

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.314
Gaara.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.551
(tense music)

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:21.088
Yes, I understand.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.956
So Gaara was attacked.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.958
And I can't believe
what happened to Sasuke.

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:28.328
The Otsutsuki that
uses the fishing rod.

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:31.798
Lord Kazekage managed
to seal him away.

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:33.500
But he said that soon,

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:35.702
the seal is probably
going to break.

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:38.605
Hm.

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:42.809
I say we should rendezvous
with Boruto and the others.

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:45.946
Okay, then leave Lord
Kazekage with us.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.549
We'll definitely get him
back to the village.

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:50.417
Thanks, and good luck.

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:53.654
I know you're good
from the chunin exams.

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:54.788
Don't mess up.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.023
Protect them.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.559
Oh, uh, thank you?

00:11:00.561 --> 00:11:01.461
Let's get going.

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:03.330
Even though Kankuro
is with them,

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:06.099
I'm sure he didn't bring
all of his puppets with him.

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:08.202
But if we're talking
about Uncle Kankuro,

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:10.137
he'll manage somehow, won't he?

00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:13.674
That's just why I want to hurry.

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.343
He'll always find a way

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:19.346
because he's the elder
brother of the Kazekage.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:21.548
No matter what he
has to resort to.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:26.587
Just one last puppet,
but where'd he go?

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:28.555
(whooshing)

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:31.391
(gasping)

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:32.526
(grunting)

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.562
(thudding)

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:37.164
He was under the sand.

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.333
(grunting)

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:43.036
Guess black ant isn't going
to be able to catch you now.

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:48.041
You think you're gonna get
to torture me to death?

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:49.409
Well guess what?

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:52.679
(whooshing)

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:54.214
You aren't the
only puppet around

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:56.650
that can dive beneath the sand!

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:58.418
(crashing)

00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:01.054
(tense music)

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.327
(grunting)

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:10.430
Secret black move, salamander.

00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:14.234
(clanking)

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:15.235
(creaking)

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:17.771
(inhaling)

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:20.174
(chomping)

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:24.678
I lured you in exactly
where I wanted you.

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:26.380
Is that all of them?

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.582
(rumbling)

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:31.952
(thudding)

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:33.187
They're still...

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:37.057
(thudding)

00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:40.494
They're so stubborn.

00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:44.565
This might not be enough to
stop them from functioning.

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.733
(crashing)

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:50.137
(grunting)

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.409
(crashing)

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.678
(grunting)

00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:07.287
To win this, it's time
for my secret weapon.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.797
(explosions booming)

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.031
Heh.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.269
(explosion booming)

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.438
(gasping)

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:33.580
(gasping)

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.821
No way.

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.155
What was that?

00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:48.095
(tense music)

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:54.234
Did that come from the place
where we left Mr. Kankuro?

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.937
That was a paper bomb explosion.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.572
Do you think he's all right?

00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:02.109
(sighing)

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:03.577
Come on, let's hurry.

00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:05.846
What was that?

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.114
My uncle will finish this,

00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:09.850
even if he has to take
his foes down with him.

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:11.552
Down with him?

00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:13.120
Hey, listen!

00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:16.823
Did you know that he'd
do this all along?

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:18.125
That's right.

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:19.993
If he wins, great.

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.228
And if he doesn't,

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.864
then he's just going to
take them down with him.

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.232
In this situation,

00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:28.068
any sand shinobi would
do the same thing.

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:29.303
What'd you say?

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:32.940
You need to get your
mission priority straight.

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:35.242
And don't make me
keep reminding you

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:37.611
of what our duty truly is now.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:41.849
Aw, man!

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:44.117
We're to protect Master Shukaku

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:46.720
until we get to
the Leaf Village.

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:47.754
Got that?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:51.091
(grunting)

00:14:53.293 --> 00:14:57.631
But listen, even if that's
true, I won't accept it.

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:01.134
Hey, what are you doing?

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:02.503
Isn't it obvious?

00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:05.806
I'm gonna go back to
rescue Mr. Kankuro.

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:07.975
Are you serious, right now?

00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:09.510
You're damn right.

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:11.979
He could still be
alive and fighting.

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:14.081
So I can't just abandon him.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:15.682
Still, we can't.

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:17.851
There's no time to go back.

00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:18.952
Our duty is--

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:20.087
Shut up!

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.356
I'm telling you
we're not machines.

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:24.224
We can't be swayed by feelings.

00:15:24.258 --> 00:15:26.827
We must make calm,
rational choices.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.828
Face it.

00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:29.730
You're wrong on this.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.865
I don't even care if I'm wrong.

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:34.234
I just don't want to
be the kind of trash

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.436
who'd abandon a friend.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.471
What was that?

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:39.673
So I'm going.

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.408
I'm helping Mr. Kankuro.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.044
(tense music)

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:51.985
Are you just gonna
go on alone then?

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:53.220
Of course.

00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:57.858
My uncle fulfilled
the duty he was given.

00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:00.527
And if Boruto can't
understand that much,

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:03.363
then he's failed as
a shinobi already.

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:12.573
(footsteps shuffling)

00:16:12.606 --> 00:16:14.741
(panting)

00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:23.584
Damn it.

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:28.055
(air whooshing)

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.759
Mr. Kankuro!

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.963
(gasping)

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.731
Mr. Kankuro!

00:16:37.764 --> 00:16:40.567
Come on, please say something!

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:41.568
[Temari] Boruto!

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:45.839
Aunt Temari?

00:16:45.873 --> 00:16:46.974
Shikadai?

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.842
Why are you here?

00:16:48.876 --> 00:16:51.345
That's just what I'd
like to ask you, Boruto.

00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:54.114
I had heard that you and Shinki

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:55.949
were on your way
to bring Shukaku

00:16:55.983 --> 00:16:57.484
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:16:58.485 --> 00:16:59.987
Yeah, but then...

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.255
We've been looking,

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:03.457
but we can't find
Kankuro either.

00:17:04.558 --> 00:17:07.194
He might've simply
blown himself up.

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:09.096
No way.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.965
(sighing)

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:14.835
[Shikadai] Oh,
hey, are you okay?

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.970
Shikadai, check
the perimeter again

00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:19.072
and see if you
can find anything.

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:24.278
(sighing)

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:25.312
I got it.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.248
All right, Boruto.

00:17:28.282 --> 00:17:31.218
Why exactly have
you come back here?

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.320
I was worried for Mr. Kankuro.

00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:36.123
And I appreciate that.

00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:38.058
But then what about Shinki?

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.863
All he's concerned
about is the mission.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.264
Do you really think that Shinki

00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:46.733
doesn't care about
Kankuro at all?

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:48.669
(gasping)

00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:49.837
Let me guess.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.738
You argued with him
and then stormed off.

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:55.442
This is just as
difficult for him.

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:58.178
(somber music)

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.981
He may not show it,

00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:03.350
but he loves and
respects Kankuro a lot.

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.719
He Shinki's uncle,
one of his masters,

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:06.954
and most importantly,

00:18:06.987 --> 00:18:09.456
the trusted confidant
and supporter of Gaara,

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:10.858
whom he reveres.

00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:13.460
Kankuro is someone
he tries to emulate.

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.530
(whimpering)

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:18.832
That's the reason why
he hardened his heart

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:21.568
the way that he did
and put his duty first.

00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:23.237
It was entrusted to him.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.440
Not only by Gaara,
but Kankuro too.

00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:28.375
His duty?

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:30.978
[Temari] Abandoning the
mission and coming back here?

00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:32.212
Did you seriously think

00:18:32.246 --> 00:18:34.214
that was what Kankuro
wanted you to do,

00:18:34.248 --> 00:18:37.451
after he gave everything to
buy you the time to get away?

00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:40.754
But that's...

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:44.725
(whimpering)

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:48.962
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:48.996 --> 00:18:50.631
Maybe I didn't understand.

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:56.103
What Mr. Kankuro's resolve
meant and Shinki's either.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:19:01.074
But still, I can't accept
parting with a friend like that,

00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:04.711
in that way, is simply
saying it couldn't be helped.

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:07.748
Even if that's what
Mr. Kankuro wanted.

00:19:08.749 --> 00:19:10.117
I'm not Shinki.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.718
I can't just accept it.

00:19:12.886 --> 00:19:14.788
So it seems.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:17.457
But regardless, this isn't
about Shinki being right,

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:18.859
and you being wrong.

00:19:18.892 --> 00:19:21.628
(somber music)

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:24.498
Boruto.

00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:26.533
You rushed back here
for Kankuro's sake,

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:30.304
and as his sister, that
makes me feel very happy.

00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:34.308
Aunt Temari...

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.177
For a friend or for a mission.

00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:38.979
It's a difficult decision

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.481
that shinobi have to
make all the time.

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:45.118
Boruto.

00:19:45.152 --> 00:19:47.621
Tell me, what do you think
your duty is right now?

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:52.226
To protect Shukaku with
everything I've got,

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:54.094
for Mr. Kankuro's sake.

00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:56.730
[Shikadai] Hey!

00:19:58.332 --> 00:19:59.333
Over here!

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.604
(tense music)

00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:12.379
What are they?

00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:15.449
It almost appears as if they
were shielding something.

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:17.451
And look at this.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.589
No way!

00:20:22.623 --> 00:20:24.124
(grunting)

00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:27.327
(mysterious music)

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:32.866
Throughout this whole area,
quicksand flows underground.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.202
And that means if
those enemy puppets

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:38.572
can dive underground like
Kankuro's salamander, then...

00:20:39.606 --> 00:20:40.607
I get it.

00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:43.477
It's possible that they
could travel really far.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.213
Shukaku and Shinki
are in trouble.

00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:48.815
Shinki.

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.450
Hang on, I'll be there soon.

00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:54.454
(mysterious music)

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.362
(creaking)

00:21:02.396 --> 00:21:05.799
Shinki, you think
we have a chance?

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:09.102
I doubt that they're weak
enough to allow us to get away.

00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:14.208
Besides, I have to
avenge my uncle.

00:21:18.712 --> 00:21:20.681
Wait for us, Shinki.

00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:23.617
(mysterious music)

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:27.487
[Girl] We'll reach the
village soon, Lord Kazekage.

00:21:29.857 --> 00:21:32.192
(grunting)

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:35.596
Please, hang in there!

00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:39.266
Oh no.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:43.303
The seal on Urashiki's...

00:21:43.337 --> 00:21:45.572
(rumbling)

00:21:48.842 --> 00:21:52.045
(explosion booming)

00:21:57.684 --> 00:22:03.190
I admit, you gave me a
harder time than I expected.

00:22:03.223 --> 00:22:05.626
But this game... is mine.

00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:33.487
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.557
(tense music)

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.459
[Urashiki] Well, well.

00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:46.627
Found you.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.229
I'm going to enjoy our
play time together.

00:23:51.164 --> 00:23:53.634
I'll torment you to
my heart's content.

00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:58.972
[Shinki] I have to
avenge my uncle.

00:23:59.006 --> 00:24:00.440
[Boruto] Next time on Boruto,

00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:02.409
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:03.844
Urashiki returns.

00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:05.712
Shinki, I'll be there soon.

00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:07.080
Don't let him get you!

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:15.355
