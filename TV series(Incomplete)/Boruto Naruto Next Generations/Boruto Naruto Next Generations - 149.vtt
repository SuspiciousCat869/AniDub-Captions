WEBVTT

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.809
[Bandit] Looks like the
meeting with the feudal lord

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.078
is happening today as scheduled.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.547
We had some unexpected
interference,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.681
but whatever.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.316
Let's notify the boss.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.720
Finally, time for the Mujina
Gang to make our move.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.303
Lord Uzumaki, we've been
expecting you. This way.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.941
(Boruto gasping)

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.310
Lord Tento is waiting
for you in the garden.

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.312
R-right.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.592
This way, please.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.066
[Boruto] You booked the entire
hotel and all the gardens?

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.902
Wow, feudal lords sure
do things differently.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:11.205
Oh yeah? Is that weird?

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.907
I mean, it's not like we
bought the whole place.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:17.044
[Boruto] Oh, he's
such an arrogant jerk.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.215
(opening theme music)

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:25.185
(woman singing in Japanese)

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.283
But never mind about all that.

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:06.720
What's it called, the
Shadow Clone Jutsu? Show me!

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.192
Besides, the Feudal
Lord, Ikkyu Madoka,

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:15.829
has requested you
personally for this job.

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:19.032
(sighing) Fine, guess
there's no choice.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.101
Not just watch
closely, you brat.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.304
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.307
Whoa!

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:31.345
There's one, two, three,
four, five of you!

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.780
Real ninjas are
so amazingly cool.

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.949
You're definitely
the Hokage's son.

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.885
Gee, thanks.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.319
[Tento] So cool!

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:41.355
[Boruto] He's actually
really excited.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.291
Maybe he isn't so bad after all.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.927
But you know, I've
heard that the Hokage

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.962
can make over 1,000 clones,

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.298
and compared to that,
this is pretty lame.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:56.503
[Boruto] This mission might be
even tougher than I thought.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.173
Next I want to see that one,

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:00.541
oh, what was it called?

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.009
Where you transform?

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:04.478
Oh, you mean
Transformation Jutsu?

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.013
Yeah, that, that!

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.415
Uh, sure thing.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.583
(Tento giggling)

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:13.554
All right, now to give
him just a little shock.

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:14.588
Transform!

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:17.257
Sexy Jutsu.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.061
(Tento gasping)

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.996
Followed by...

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:24.998
The Harem Jutsu.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:31.171
How's that, you brat? So
shocked you can't talk, huh?

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:38.579
(Tento laughing)

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.982
What? That is so not
the reaction I expected.

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:44.818
Well, that was
fun, but honestly,

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:48.355
I would have preferred a less
flashy version than that one.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:51.358
Those sexy types come and
go all the time at my house.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.527
Frankly I'm kind of
tired of seeing them.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.128
Little punk.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.631
You know what?

00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:00.167
I'm willing to bet you don't
have any friends at all.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.303
Huh? But aren't you
my friend, Boruto?

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:10.310
(sighing) You know,
I've gotta say,

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:13.080
you really are kind
of dense, aren't you?

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:14.882
What about my
attitude ever gave you

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:16.617
the impression that's what I am?

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.619
Oh boy, I'm just so happy.

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.754
I've always wanted to
have a ninja friend

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:21.955
who's about the same age as me.

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:24.091
Are you listening at all?

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:27.261
[Tento] Take a look! This
is my X Card collection!

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.396
What? Amazing!

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:33.233
You even have a con exclusive
Sharingan Mode Kakashi Hatake!

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.402
You practically have
every single card!

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.272
Yeah, and that's only the
binder of my rares and above.

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:40.474
I have other binders as well.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.177
With all these, why
don't you have my dad's,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.413
I mean, why don't you have one
of the Seventh Hokage, then?

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.149
I haven't been able to get
the card I really want.

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.751
It's kinda weird.

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.219
Yeah, right?

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:54.454
Wait, don't tell me...

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:00.127
You, you have it.

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.629
What is it?

00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:04.231
That's the card that you want?

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:05.966
The card that I want?

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.100
That's an understatement.

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:09.403
It's the only reason
why I keep buying them.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.872
I've never seen the actual
thing before, you know?

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:16.476
Hm, should I give it to you?

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.377
What? Hey!

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:19.613
Do you even have any
idea just how rare

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.014
this card actually is?

00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:23.083
I mean, this one is
super duper rare.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.419
Ah, it's not a big deal.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.287
Even if it is rare.

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.956
As long as I have my black card,

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.557
I can just get it again.

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:37.397
In exchange, would you
teach me some ninjutsu?

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:38.198
Huh?

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:39.766
Ninjas are so cool and strong.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.335
I was thinking of becoming one.

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:42.202
Come on.

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:43.570
If you teach me ninjutsu,

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:45.806
then I'll give you that
really rare card you want.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.141
That's a pretty
good deal, right?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.011
No thanks.

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:52.613
Huh? Why not?

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:54.815
I'm the type of guy
who gets what he wants

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.149
by using his own strengths,

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:58.719
no matter how hard
it might be, get it?

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:01.822
How about something else?

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.857
Just name anything
you want, okay?

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.361
Ask me and I'll give it to you
if you just teach me ninjutsu.

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:10.898
[Boruto] This guy just
uses money to get his way.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.199
[Tento] Come on, please?

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:14.568
You don't have anything
else to do anyway, right?

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:16.737
Okay, fine.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.605
But training is
gonna be super hard.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.208
Really? Awesome!

00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:24.011
[Boruto] All right, time to
be really hard on the kid

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:27.414
and beat that bad
attitude right out of him.

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:30.717
Cut the defense budget?

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:34.488
But sir, we have to continue
to investigate the ruins

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.056
that Kaguya left behind.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.825
Also, there are
other things that-

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.494
Yes, I'm aware.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:43.697
And I know that this peace
is most likely temporary.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.898
I fully expect,

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.501
that this situation won't
continue forever.

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:51.138
So I think it's important
to put our focus

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.540
more on social services
and on education,

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:55.609
which we've never
really budgeted for.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.910
Maybe, but-

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.579
Shikamaru.

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:03.550
Lord Ikkyu.

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:06.587
Like I always tell you,
please just call me Ikkyu.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.157
You're the only person I can be
totally at ease and honest with.

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:15.963
Ikkyu, whether you decide
to divert the budget or not,

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:19.633
what we do isn't going
to change even a bit.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.235
Naruto.

00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:25.572
Shinobi have a duty to
protect our nation and people.

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:33.013
(sighing) Thank you so much.

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:35.949
Well, all right then.

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.484
I'll be heading out now.

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:38.685
You're leaving already?

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:42.022
To be honest, I'd like to
just stay here and talk,

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:43.624
but then, neither of us really

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.492
have the time for that, do we?

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.496
Oh, wait. That's right.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.399
Your son came along on the trip
with you this time, didn't he?

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:53.333
Yes, he did.

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:55.335
I don't often get to
spend time with him.

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:58.138
This was a way for me
to make amends for that.

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:00.307
It seems he's become rather
obsessed with ninja lately

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.743
because of something
called X Cards.

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:04.178
(Naruto laughing)

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.280
So when he found out that I
was going to the Leaf Village,

00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:08.415
he insisted on coming along.

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:11.552
Also he asked Boruto
to be his bodyguard.

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:13.854
Yes, so I hear.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.222
He can be quite a handful,

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.891
but please ask your
son to be good to him.

00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:20.360
I couldn't pay very
much attention to him,

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:24.097
so he grew up to be spoiled and
a little bit out of control.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:27.935
I think that's just how
every kid is, you know?

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:30.037
[Ikkyu] I really
hope that's true.

00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:37.544
(suspenseful music)

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:39.479
No more. I'm done.

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:41.982
I mean, is it even possible
to hit this target?

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.217
I don't believe it.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.519
You've gotta do a better
job of teaching me.

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:48.555
Look, I've been teaching you
just fine this whole time.

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.257
Watch.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.726
You see, you don't
actually throw a shuriken.

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:57.598
You kinda strike them, you know?

00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:59.233
Do you understand?

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.034
Strike instead of throw?

00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:09.176
Aw, come on! Why
doesn't it hit already?

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.711
Well, it isn't
something you're gonna

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:12.846
be able to do right away.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.081
(Tento sighing)

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:19.186
Hey, why do you want to train
to become a ninja, anyway?

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:21.488
Oh, I got interested in it

00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:23.524
after I started
collecting X Cards.

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:26.193
I mean, ninja are just
so strong and cool!

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:28.695
Is that all?

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:30.731
Okay, I'm feeling this!

00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:31.765
Go!

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.969
-I can't.
-Well, that was quick.

00:10:36.003 --> 00:10:38.338
I just can't hit
anything at all!

00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:40.474
Listen, don't you
want to become strong?

00:10:41.842 --> 00:10:43.977
You want to become a
cool shinobi, don't you?

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.579
Well, then you're
simply gonna have to

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:47.814
show a little more dedication.

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.816
Oh, just shut up.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.051
Hya! Hya!

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:53.587
Come on!

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:56.490
I hate this.

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.927
Yeah. I knew he'd give up.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.361
Are you starting to get it now?

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.664
Things don't usually go
the way you want them to

00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:06.433
unless you work really
hard to achieve them.

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.936
(Tento groaning)

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:11.071
You know what? Let's
just call it a day.

00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:13.807
What's the point of all
of this if we stop now?

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:16.009
I'm gonna keep
trying till I get it.

00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:18.045
Oh, what?

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.547
All right. Get up.

00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:21.448
Huh?

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:22.950
If you really want
to do this so badly,

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:25.586
then I'll stick with
you till you get it.

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:28.322
Boruto.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.824
Oh, right. Of course.

00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:32.659
I get it now. You still
want that rare card.

00:11:32.693 --> 00:11:34.795
No, that isn't the reason
why I'm doing this.

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:37.865
I'm doing it because you
finally got serious about it.

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:39.099
Sure, okay.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:42.703
[Boruto] Man, he
makes me so angry.

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:45.639
Oh dear me.

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:47.207
Where could he have gone now?

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:50.077
Seriously, what's that
bodyguard thinking

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.578
letting him run off?

00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:56.717
(energetic music)

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.820
Damn it! (breathing heavily)

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:01.822
That was close. Again.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.056
-Milord!
-Huh?

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:06.393
Yamaoka.

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:09.863
Oh, Milord. So this
is where you were.

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:12.099
Look, look, Yamaoka!

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:13.834
I just barely missed the target.

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.202
Before now, I
couldn't even get it

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.937
to go in the right direction!

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.506
Now what is the meaning
of this, Lord Boruto?

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.242
You were only asked to
guard the young Lord.

00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:25.546
We can't have you acting
without authorization.

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.947
Hold on, Yamaoka!

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.782
Milord, this is too dangerous.

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:32.553
Bu I asked him to teach me.
Please don't blame Boruto.

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:33.720
Well, that may be so,

00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:36.924
but you're the heir of the
Feudal Lord of the Land of Fire.

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:38.492
There is simply no need for you

00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:40.494
to undertake training
such as this.

00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:43.830
But I've actually made
progress! Just a little longer!

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:44.831
Milord-

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.100
-Let him do it.
-Huh?

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:49.336
He's finally starting
to get the hang of it.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:51.805
It's more fun for him to
hit a target with shuriken

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.373
through his own
strength then to just

00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:57.544
go out and buy a rare X Card
with his black card right now.

00:12:57.578 --> 00:12:59.279
Please, Yamaoka?

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:00.314
Hmm.

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:04.117
Good grief. Very well.

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:07.821
However, this is only
for the time being,

00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:09.356
while we're here in the Leaf.

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:13.460
All right! The next
one will be a bullseye!

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:17.197
I think there's something
deeper going on here with him.

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:21.735
Now put your focus on striking.

00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:28.375
Just a little while earlier

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:31.612
you had mentioned the
young master's black card.

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:34.348
It was a gift that the
Feudal Lord had given

00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:36.717
to the Young Lord
for his birthday.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.119
Huh? It was?

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.754
The Feudal Lord has been so busy

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:43.257
that he doesn't even know
what his son might want

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.392
when it comes to giving gifts.

00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:47.828
He decided to get
that card so his son

00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:50.097
could purchase
whatever he wants.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.566
Here, Milord, this
is a birthday present

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.535
your father left for you.

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:57.471
Wow! I wonder what it is!

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.308
Why, what is it?

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.711
Oh.

00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:08.482
Just leave it to Papa.

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:13.120
And still, he smiled so brightly

00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:16.490
and he said "This is
just what I wanted."

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:20.494
He then began collecting the
strongest X Cards he could find

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.664
and started to participate
in tournaments.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:29.069
Just recently, he made it to
the finals of a big tournament.

00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:30.838
So then trying to
win the tournament

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.207
was a way to deal
with his loneliness?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.342
You could very well
be right about that.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.345
It may be that he thinks
his father will watch him

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.347
if he's able to
garner some attention

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.616
playing in one of
these tournaments.

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:46.453
So he said that he's going to
win the next one without fail.

00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:50.858
No wonder he's
collected so many cards.

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:53.827
Yes, if he's able to
complete his collection,

00:14:53.861 --> 00:14:56.230
winning would be
a near certainty.

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:59.633
And the Feudal Lord would
be sure to attend the event.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:03.237
All he wants is simply for
his father to acknowledge him,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.606
even if it's just a little bit.

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:11.111
But today the Young
Lord might well have

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:13.714
discovered something
even bigger than that.

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:19.820
I have never seen him be so
enthusiastic about anything.

00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:21.321
Not like this.

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:25.325
(Tento shouting)

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.864
(Tento gasping)

00:15:30.898 --> 00:15:32.599
-I did it!
-Whoa there!

00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:34.134
I hit the target, I did it!

00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:36.803
You see? You really
can do it if you try.

00:15:36.837 --> 00:15:39.940
I finally hit the bullseye!

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:42.075
But if I don't
keep on practicing,

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.411
then I'm gonna lose
my touch, aren't I?

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.412
You got that right.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.948
If you don't keep at it,
muscle memory can fade.

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.116
And even with practice,

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:50.751
you won't always
hit the bullseye.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:55.088
But still, if you
just keep at it,

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:57.090
I bet it'll lead to something.

00:15:57.124 --> 00:16:00.194
(energetic music)

00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:02.629
[Tento] Something?

00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:07.401
Yeah, something you can't
buy with a black card.

00:16:07.434 --> 00:16:10.070
Something you can only
earn with your hands.

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:12.039
Here's a good luck
charm for you.

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:16.076
Now, make sure you
stop and come back

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:18.712
before you push
yourself too much.

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:20.113
I'm going to go ahead

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:22.716
and get your dinner ready
for when you return, Milord.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.553
Can you stay with me
a little bit longer?

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:28.555
Yeah, sure thing.

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:29.823
(Tento shouting)

00:16:29.857 --> 00:16:31.358
[Boruto] Hey, looking good.

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:37.464
Huh?

00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:40.567
(bird wings flapping)

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:41.735
Who goes there?

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:51.745
(Yamaoka breathing heavily)

00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:06.260
Dammit, a decoy again?

00:17:06.293 --> 00:17:08.996
Boruto, you fall for
traps too easily.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.131
That means I'm all out
of life points now.

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:13.867
Game over. I win again.

00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:14.935
Oh man.

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:16.203
Why don't they have
some kind of rule

00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:19.106
where you can win just
by persevering, huh?

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:21.308
What does that even mean?

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.811
You know, I was wondering.

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:27.114
What kind of people
become ninja?

00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:30.517
I mean, seriously, can
I actually become one?

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.486
Well, it really all
depends on how much effort

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:37.324
you put into it, but uh, do you
actually want to become one?

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:38.859
Yeah.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:42.362
My dad is always telling
me ninja are amazing,

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.331
that they're trustworthy people.

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:48.335
He's always working and
is hardly ever at home.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:51.071
And it seems like he's thinking
about ninja all the time.

00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:53.574
So I want to become a
ninja who's amazing enough

00:17:53.607 --> 00:17:55.342
to get put on an X Card,

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:58.846
and then maybe he'll finally
pay more attention to me.

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:01.682
(somber music)

00:18:01.715 --> 00:18:03.717
You did just great.

00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:09.056
It's important, you know?

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.595
Actually, it's, it's the
most important thing.

00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:19.333
I'll be watching.

00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.672
I'm-

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:26.707
You're what?

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:28.709
I'm just like you.

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:32.045
I wanted my dad
to notice me too.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.085
I did a whole lot
of stupid things

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.120
just to get his attention.

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.589
Even got banned from
being a ninja once.

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:46.693
I'm only able to be one now

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:49.196
because everybody forgave me.

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:51.465
Boruto.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:59.106
I just, I may not
be much right now,

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:02.109
but one day I want to
be an amazing ninja

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.610
who supports the Hokage.

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.346
I know that I will.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.452
Well, I know that it
isn't gonna be easy.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.089
(laughing) What's
that all about?

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.626
(both laughing)

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:25.132
Okay, just one more game then.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.433
Oh, that's right.

00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:29.269
You still don't have a
Seventh Hokage card, do you?

00:19:29.303 --> 00:19:30.304
[Tento] No.

00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:34.107
Now you do.

00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:38.078
What, seriously? (gasping)

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:45.586
No, I don't want it.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:47.221
Huh? Why not?

00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:51.859
Well, because I decided
I'm gonna get what I want

00:19:51.892 --> 00:19:53.260
with my own strengths,

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:55.629
no matter how hard
that might be for me.

00:19:57.264 --> 00:20:00.234
Well, then this is for
hitting the bullseye.

00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:03.570
You earned it by working
hard for it all on your own.

00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:05.572
What do you say?

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:08.342
(Tento gasping)

00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:10.444
Thanks so much!

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:12.212
Hey, will you keep
on training me

00:20:12.246 --> 00:20:14.348
with the shuriken tomorrow
and the next day, too?

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.950
Yeah, sure. But the road
ahead is long, you know?

00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:18.385
Yeah, I know that.

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:21.421
Okay. I'm gonna be super
strict with you tomorrow.

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:22.456
Mm-hm!

00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:26.627
(upbeat music)

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.994
Oh yeah. Tomorrow, huh?

00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:04.097
Yeah, but I don't want
to go home just yet.

00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:09.570
Boruto, it was just a
few days, but I had fun.

00:21:09.603 --> 00:21:10.804
Yeah. Me too.

00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:12.806
Who would've thought, huh?

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.042
We'll meet again, right?

00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:17.444
Hey, listen up.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.450
I mean, is that something
you'd say to a friend?

00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:32.626
(Tento whimpering)

00:21:33.994 --> 00:21:35.195
Oh, Boruto!

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:39.366
(Boruto laughing)

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:45.038
[Boruto] Hey, why
are you crying?

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:51.278
[Bandit] Did you get the face?

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.513
Yeah.

00:21:52.546 --> 00:21:54.948
Now the Feudal Lord
will have no choice

00:21:54.982 --> 00:21:58.085
but to give into the
Mujina Gang's demands.

00:21:58.118 --> 00:21:59.686
[Bandit] Understood.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.488
We're all counting on you.

00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:04.458
Boss.

00:22:13.133 --> 00:22:18.305
(closing theme music)

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:44.224
[Yamaoka] Milord, we must flee.

00:23:44.258 --> 00:23:46.126
[Tento] Yamaoka, what happened?

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:47.661
[Yamaoka] I saw
a suspicious man.

00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:50.364
It's possible he's here
to take Lord Ikkyu's life.

00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:52.866
If we stay here, he
might even target you!

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.801
[Tento] No, wait.
I'll catch him.

00:23:54.835 --> 00:23:56.103
Take me to him!

00:23:56.136 --> 00:23:58.238
It's time to show Papa the
results of my training!

00:23:58.272 --> 00:24:01.942
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations".

00:24:01.975 --> 00:24:03.477
"The Value of a Hidden Ace".

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.314
[Yamaoka] You're gonna be
our hidden ace, Lord Tento!

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:16.490
(closing theme music)
