WEBVTT

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.176
(intense music)

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:21.722
(Kokuri heavily breathing)

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.695
The entrance to the tank

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.797
is just a ways up ahead, right?

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.065
That's right.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.234
Sarada's filled it up
with water and is waiting,

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.271
and we'll release your
Celestial Prison jutsu there.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.806
How's the route look?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.842
I sent my snakes
ahead to keep watch,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.078
and they'll alert me if the
guards start to make a move.

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:48.682
(intense music continues)

00:00:58.592 --> 00:00:59.693
All right, let's go.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.367
[Kokuri] Whoa!

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:11.038
Man, Kokuri, weren't you
originally trained as a ninja?

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.472
I'm ashamed to admit it.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.175
I've just been an
accountant for so long now.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:24.952
[Mitsuki] That's it.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.020
The entrance to the
tank is right there.

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:39.700
Ah.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.278
Ah!

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.313
You gotta be careful.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.416
Sorry.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.085
Uh, hey, Boruto?

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.353
Yeah, what is it?

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.089
We haven't gotten any
word from Sarada yet.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.490
We'll be okay, right,

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:06.426
or do you think that I'm
just worrying too much?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.361
I've got total faith

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.596
Sarada has everything
taken care of.

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.667
(opening theme music)

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.405
(vocalists singing
in Japanese)

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:45.726
(opening theme music)

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.403
(water splashing)

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.477
That girl boasted about having

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.547
condemning information about
me or something like that.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.054
Ah, damn it! Where
could it be? (grunting)

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:26.667
They're all in cahoots
with each other.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.701
Don't tell me.

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.706
(low intense music)

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:34.775
(Boruto clone snoring)

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:36.310
Huh?

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:37.911
What's the big idea, this late?

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:39.146
Ah!

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.082
But Celestial Prison-

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.952
Never mind about that.
Just find them, quick!

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:46.486
Yes, sir!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.689
If they're found,
don't confront them.

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:50.791
Just notify me at once.

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:52.092
Hey, did somebody break out?

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.961
Serves you guys
right if they did!

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:55.896
Let the rest of us out, too!

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:57.931
I can't believe
you're the only one

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.334
who stayed behind, Kedama.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.171
You know, I have to say,

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.807
I give you high marks
for not going with them,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.575
so here's your chance.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:12.946
Where are Boruto and the others?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.181
If you speak up now,

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:16.450
I'll consider giving
you special treatment.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.954
Who can say? I can be
quite a deep sleeper.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.357
(grunts) Those brats are fools!

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.293
Not even a rat can slip
out of this castle.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:35.435
(prisoners yelling)

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.442
I wondered what he
was doing in secret.

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:44.578
Guess digging this
hole with his jutsu.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.348
We better hurry.

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:51.151
It looks like they discovered
my Shadow Clone already.

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:57.324
(Sarada gasps)

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.496
Oh, right, I fell
into that sinkhole

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.465
when I was just
about to fight Benga.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.501
Who would've thought
there'd be a place like this

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.136
under Hozuki Castle?

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:13.540
But how come there's all
this seawater underground?

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:14.675
Never mind.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.277
I have to go rendezvous
with Boruto and the others.

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.720
I wish I knew which
way to go, at least.

00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:30.724
I'm closer to the ceiling
than I was earlier.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.965
If the water keeps
rising, this'll be bad.

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:41.168
(low intense music)

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:48.475
They're planning to
use the old tank.

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.311
She's really quite
sharp for a little brat.

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:53.480
But thanks to her, it'll
be easy enough for me

00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:56.350
to deal with the
escapees all by myself.

00:06:56.383 --> 00:07:00.053
He's my golden goose.
I won't lose him.

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:08.428
Go on. It's time to eat.

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:11.331
(beast roars)

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:17.304
Anything?

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:19.473
I can only detect
our own footsteps.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:21.909
It seems they haven't
gotten here yet.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.343
According to the
castle blueprints,

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:26.013
the tank shouldn't
be too far up ahead.

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:27.781
It would be great
if Sarada's managed

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.716
to complete her side
of things by now.

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.420
We don't have to
worry about Sarada.

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:37.524
(beast roars)

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:38.692
What was that roaring?

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:41.395
(footsteps pounding)

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:42.663
Incoming.

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:45.432
(footsteps pounding)

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.433
[All] Ah!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.336
(beast roaring)

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.172
Sorry, we don't have
the time to play fetch.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.909
-(blast explodes)
-(Boruto grunts)

00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:57.144
Boruto!

00:07:58.445 --> 00:07:59.713
I'm okay.

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:04.318
(Cerberus growling)

00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.822
Just stay back, Kokuri.

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:11.158
[Kokuri] You don't
have to ask me twice.

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:16.830
(Cerberus roars)

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:18.365
(intense music)

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:21.435
I'm going to need you to stay
quiet for a little while.

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:25.806
Ah!

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.040
Gotcha!

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.049
[Kokuri] Did you get him?

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.587
(Cerberus angrily roaring)

00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.956
I guess that didn't
work so well after all.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.191
Damn it.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:48.462
(Cerberus growling)

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.200
Get back.

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:56.436
(Cerberus growling)

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.805
Lightning Style:
Lightning Strike!

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.909
(lightning surging)

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:03.177
Hey, you missed him!

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.458
I saw that the ceiling was
on the verge of collapse.

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:21.662
It don't think that thing will
come after us for a while.

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:23.697
Nice one, Mitsuki, thanks.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.965
We should hurry.

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:26.934
Let's get to the
tank and meet Sarada

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.936
and release the
Celestial Prison.

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.205
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:33.674
Just hang in there a
little longer, Kokuri.

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:43.717
Okay, for the next
step, we have to...

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:50.023
-(water splashing)
-Huh?

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:54.328
(Kokuri excitedly laughing)

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.797
Hey, what's going on?
What's the matter?

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.665
Be quiet and listen closely.

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.067
(water splashing)

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.201
I can hear water.

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:02.803
Leave it to Sarada.

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:03.937
It seems that she succeeded

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:06.073
in getting the tank
filled with water, huh?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.208
Awesome job noticing it, Kokuri.

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:10.077
I've so been waiting for this.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.313
I'm finally gonna be free
of the Celestial Prison!

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:20.420
Now all we have left is to
get out of Hozuki Castle.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.061
What is this?

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.410
-(despondent music)
-Wait.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.915
This is absolutely terrible.

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:51.585
(sobbing) How can this be?

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:59.059
What is going on here?

00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:03.697
Awe, that's too bad.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.167
There's not a drop of fresh
water left for me to give you.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:11.038
It's time to take the
trash out for good.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.477
Let's just keep
on going, Kokuri.

00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:20.214
They're gonna find us soon
if we don't get outta here.

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:23.317
But as things are, the
Celestial Prison in me'll-

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:27.521
Yeah, I know, but for now,
just put your trust in us.

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:30.691
(Cerberus roaring)

00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:32.559
It's the guard dog from before.

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:33.827
We have to go now.

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.196
We should avoid fighting
as much as we can.

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.640
Come on, now! (grunts)

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:48.575
Just the same as the last time.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:51.912
I'll drown at this rate.

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:55.082
(low intense music)

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.217
All right, just stay calm.

00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:59.786
Should I dive down
and look for an exit?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.422
But in this situation,
it's too risky.

00:12:03.257 --> 00:12:07.327
(low intense music continues)

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:14.168
(Sarada gasping)

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:16.537
Huh?

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:23.076
Thank you so much
for rescuing me.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.680
Your name is Mr. Kedama, right?

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:27.915
That's right.

00:12:27.948 --> 00:12:31.185
I don't understand.
Why did you save me?

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:34.621
Who knows? Call
it a simple whim.

00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:37.057
[Sarada] How did you even
know about this place?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.593
[Kedama] A long time ago,
I planned a break-out

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:43.230
and this is where I meant to
release my Celestial Prison.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.465
On nights like this
during the spring tide,

00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:48.902
the seawater rises and the
entire area becomes submerged.

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:51.471
That explains all
of the flooding.

00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:54.908
But forget that. Benga knows
about the prison break.

00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:56.009
This is bad.

00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:57.644
I really have to get
to the rendezvous

00:12:57.678 --> 00:12:58.912
with Boruto and the others.

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:00.814
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:02.182
If you do meet up with them,

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.818
you're going to end up
being pursued as well,

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:07.421
and there'll be no
turning back after that.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.555
I understand.

00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:12.092
The tank is up that way.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.661
If you just stay on the
path and go up the slope,

00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:15.762
then you'll see it.

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:19.366
You better hurry. This
place'll be submerged soon.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:22.035
Wow, Kedama, thank you so much.

00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:26.440
(mellow momentous music)

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:37.184
(Sarada gasps)

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:41.054
[Sarada] There's no water.

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.360
They must have gone ahead.

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:49.196
But then, the Celestial
Prison is still...

00:13:56.537 --> 00:13:58.539
A Barrier Sealing Tag?

00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:05.546
(Kokuri screaming)

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.684
You okay, Kokuri?

00:14:10.717 --> 00:14:13.086
Yeah, I'm fine. But this means-

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.289
Celestial Prison.

00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:16.657
[Mitsuki] That
appears to be marking

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.325
the border of Hozuki Castle.

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:20.460
We can't go any farther.

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:22.930
Damn it.

00:14:22.963 --> 00:14:24.331
If we could just release it,

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.466
then we could leave
here at any time.

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.737
All right, Mitsuki,
let's go look for a place

00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:32.306
where there's a
lot of fresh water,

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.208
and Kokuri, wait right here.

00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:37.778
-(Cerberus growling)
-[All] Huh?

00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:38.946
Well, I guess before that,

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:41.815
we'll have to take care
of Sparky here first.

00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:45.018
(blasts exploding)

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.590
(Cerberus roaring)

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:53.794
Like I'd let you. (yells)

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:55.729
Fire Style: Flame Capture!

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:02.035
You actually did pretty
well for a bunch of brats,

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:04.204
but I won't let you have Kokuri.

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:07.040
He's still my precious
little golden goose

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:08.942
and he's all mine.

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:11.178
Great. It's Benga.

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.046
(Cerberus growling)

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.616
What you're seeing is
a Ninja Hound Summoning

00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:17.951
passed down through
generations of wardens

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:19.453
to hunt down escapees.

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:21.655
Those jaws of his
are powerful enough

00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:23.457
to completely crush a fugitive.

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:26.326
(Cerberus roaring)

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.562
[Mitsuki] Lightning
Style: Snake Lightning!

00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:33.667
Come on! We were almost there!

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.404
(Cerberus angrily growling)

00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:41.808
(Kokuri groaning)

00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:44.378
(Kokuri screaming)

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:45.412
Kokuri!

00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:49.316
(Kokuri screaming)

00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:55.589
(Kokuri screaming)

00:15:58.325 --> 00:15:59.326
Ah!

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.499
The sealing mark of
the Celestial Prison

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:08.302
will burn a human
from the inside out.

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:12.573
Watch closely as Kokuri dies
writhing in abject pain.

00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:17.010
(Kokuri screaming)

00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:23.350
Enough, stop it!

00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:25.519
[Sarada] There's no way
we'd let that happen!

00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:26.553
Huh?

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:29.489
Sarada!

00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:32.759
Oh, so you were
able to escape, huh?

00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:36.330
Well, whatever you might try
now, it's already too late.

00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:38.198
Wow, you sure sound confident.

00:16:38.232 --> 00:16:39.633
That's right, I am.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.336
There isn't even a cup
of fresh water here.

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:45.405
No one can quench
Celestial Prison's flames.

00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:46.540
They'll consume him.

00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:48.175
So sorry to disappoint you.

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.344
What do you mean by that?

00:16:50.377 --> 00:16:52.079
That today's the spring tide.

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:55.182
There's lots of water.
It's all around here.

00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:58.051
Watch! (grunts)

00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:00.087
[Benga] What? Ah!

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.191
(water aggressively gushing)

00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:09.730
Kokuri!

00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:14.535
(Benga grunting)

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.176
Are you all right?

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:25.212
(chuckles) I really thought
that I was gonna die, there.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:28.448
Wow, you did it! We sure
owe you one, Sarada.

00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:30.817
(chuckles) I knew
that there was water

00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:33.220
brimming up underground
all around here.

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:36.356
'Course I only found that
out because I nearly drowned.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.959
But never mind that.
Let's go, hurry!

00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:40.827
(alarm blaring)

00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:42.229
[Doragu] What a coincidence.

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:44.064
Taking an evening stroll, too?

00:17:44.965 --> 00:17:46.500
So if you give a
bribe to the guards,

00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:48.335
then you get to take a
walk around the grounds

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.170
at this late hour,
is that right?

00:17:50.204 --> 00:17:53.207
Hey, come on, now. Besides,
you're one to talk.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.075
Anyway, look, tell me something,

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.176
you didn't actually help out

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.145
those guys who escaped, did you?

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.415
You're welcome to go
snitch if you want to.

00:18:01.448 --> 00:18:02.449
Huh?

00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:04.585
I'm sure your friend
Benga would listen.

00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:07.187
You think that a guy
like him is my friend?

00:18:07.221 --> 00:18:09.022
I'm just asking, huh?

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:16.196
Ah, was your Celestial Prison
released? Is your jutsu?

00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:19.499
No, don't do it, please.

00:18:19.533 --> 00:18:22.936
I won't say one word to
Benga, I promise you.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.039
Listen, I just, I
needed his influence

00:18:26.073 --> 00:18:28.575
to survive inside this
prison, that's all.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.048
But why?

00:18:35.082 --> 00:18:36.216
Why would you help out

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.218
with a prison break that
doesn't benefit you?

00:18:38.252 --> 00:18:41.555
I mean, just what are you
supposed to get out of the deal?

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.094
I have already been
rewarded several times over.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:50.430
They succeeded in something
that I wasn't able to do.

00:18:57.704 --> 00:19:00.641
(alarm blaring)

00:19:00.674 --> 00:19:02.776
[Benga] What are you doing?

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.044
Oh, Sir!

00:19:04.077 --> 00:19:05.779
The prisoners simply
won't settle down

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.481
since they learned
about the break-out.

00:19:07.514 --> 00:19:09.816
I was just about to
contact the Hidden Grass

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.084
to send reinforcements-

00:19:11.118 --> 00:19:13.687
That's completely uncalled for.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.455
But, sir, at this rate, they'll-

00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:20.160
I said that's
completely uncalled for!

00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:30.037
(eerie music)

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.581
Listen.

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:46.954
I took care of Kokuri
with my own two hands.

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:48.555
Give me the money you promised.

00:19:48.589 --> 00:19:50.290
[Tsukiyo] How pitiful.

00:19:50.324 --> 00:19:51.225
Huh?

00:19:51.258 --> 00:19:53.160
That sounds like
the voice of a man

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:55.095
whose luck has all run out.

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:57.331
(chuckles) And
when that happens,

00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:00.834
nothing such a man ever
does will go right for him.

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:02.336
What are you saying?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.905
You oughta stop
all of your lying

00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:06.907
or your luck will
only get worse.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.342
[Benga] I'm not lying.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.778
Let me out of here and
release my Celestial Prison.

00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:14.448
What do you mean?
I can't do that!

00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:17.818
[Tsukiyo] I'll be satisfied
as long as Kokuri is gone.

00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:20.954
I'll even get rid of
those brats for you.

00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:23.423
And then your luck
will come back to you.

00:20:34.968 --> 00:20:37.171
You had better
keep your promise.

00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:39.706
Release!

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.047
This is amazing. I
feel revitalized.

00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:53.253
Oh, that's right.

00:20:53.287 --> 00:20:54.288
Huh?

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:08.035
The look on your face
portends bad luck.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:14.808
[Boruto] Did we make it?

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:17.211
Yeah, and when morning arrives,

00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:19.413
the food supply
ship should be here.

00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:22.049
We just have to wait a little.

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:23.917
Yes, all right, we did it!

00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:25.686
Hey, come on, keep it down,

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:27.688
or else the guards
will hear you.

00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:28.956
Sorry.

00:21:28.989 --> 00:21:30.591
It's just that

00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:33.827
this means we're gonna
get out of Hozuki Castle.

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:36.530
I owe you guys big
time for all your help.

00:21:36.563 --> 00:21:38.065
Thanks, Boruto.

00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:39.700
(chuckles) Don't worry about it.

00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:40.701
Huh?

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:43.437
(blast explodes)

00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:49.543
Shall we test your
luck one last time?

00:21:49.576 --> 00:21:52.312
(intense music)

00:21:55.949 --> 00:21:58.452
No way. You're Tsukiyo!

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:01.688
There's a full moon out tonight.

00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:05.025
It's such a nice view to die by.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.672
(closing theme music)

00:23:42.523 --> 00:23:45.325
[Tsukiyo] Finally
we meet, Kokuri.

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:48.662
[Kokuri] Tsukiyo!
Why are you here?

00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:50.097
[Boruto] So that's Tsukiyo?

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.398
There's four of us.

00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:53.834
There's no way we'll lose
against just one person.

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:55.202
[Tsukiyo] I wonder just how long

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:57.070
you'll be able to protect him.

00:23:57.104 --> 00:23:59.306
Shall we test your
luck one last time?

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:02.676
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations",

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:04.344
"The Fateful Moonlit Battle".

00:24:04.378 --> 00:24:06.079
[Tsukiyo] There's a
full moon out tonight,

00:24:06.113 --> 00:24:09.550
so my jutsu can manifest
its utmost power!

00:24:11.718 --> 00:24:16.723
(closing theme music)
