WEBVTT

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:13.162
I found it! [chuckles]

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.002
[gasp]

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.275
[gasps]

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.046
[gasps]

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.319
Who is this? Why's she with my
Dad?

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:38.054
<i>(Sarada) A woman wearing</i>
<i>glasses...</i>

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:41.958
<i>(Naruto) It's Sasuke's hawk!</i>

00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:48.665
[gasps] This is...

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:52.168
It looks like I'll need to get
the details from Sasuke myself.

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.672
So in that case, I'm gonna take
off and go meet up with him.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:56.440
[gasps]

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:04.180
I'm leaving a Shadow Clone here
in the village, and then I'll go
there to meet Sasuke personally.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:19.563
I'm taking you away.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.400
[gasps] What are you gonna do
with me after you kidnap me?!

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:30.540
[grunts]

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:31.308
Cho‐Cho!

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:35.278
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:39.349
[screams]

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.884
[grunts]

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.652
You aren't needed.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:43.753
[gasps]

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:45.254
[screams]

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:47.557
[gasps]

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:52.962
(Naruto) Don't you think this is
a little much for a kid's fight?

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:54.464
Lord Seventh!

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:59.536
If there's one thing I know,
it's that the kids in my village
are generally well‐behaved.

00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:04.574
<i>(Naruto) Sharingan.</i>

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:13.282
<i>In just a little while, I</i>
<i>finally get to meet him! Dad!</i>

00:02:13.317 --> 00:02:15.652
[crying]

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:26.496
[heavy breathing]

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.197
[gasps]

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.375
[gasps] Dad!

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.710
I'm very impressed that you
found me.

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:45.949
Are you one of them?

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.484
[gasps]

00:04:33.457 --> 00:04:35.325
<i>(Sakura) Sarada went after</i>
<i>Naruto?!</i>

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.727
Yes, at least according
to Shikamaru.

00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:40.229
Where is he? Do you know
where she was headed?

00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:42.532
Wait, who said you could get out
of that bed?

00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:46.336
All she wants to do is ask
Sasuke a few questions.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.573
She came across a photo of him
when he was with his old
partners.

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:50.740
[gasps]

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:56.145
So she's seen that photo. That's
not good.

00:04:56.179 --> 00:05:00.249
<i>(Shizune) Can you blame her?</i>
<i>She's old enough now to wonder</i>
<i>about her father.</i>

00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:05.054
I always had the feeling that if
Sasuke were around...

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:08.425
Sarada would get involved in his
conflicts as well.

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:14.263
<i>(Sakura) I mean, the Sharingan</i>
<i>can also draw in sadness.</i>

00:05:15.632 --> 00:05:16.700
[whimpers]

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:21.270
[whimpers]

00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:22.972
[gasps]

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:27.311
[whimpers]

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:33.149
[whimpers] Dad!

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:40.724
Is that you? Sarada?
My daughter?

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.494
[whimpering] Mm‐hm.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.369
I see.

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:58.708
When I saw you I knew
immediately that you were my
dad.

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:09.486
Oh hey, there you are.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.889
Sarada, why did you run
off so fast like that?

00:06:12.922 --> 00:06:14.358
Oh!

00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.160
<i>(Cho‐Cho) He's so handsome!</i>

00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:19.963
Sorry Sasuke, I'm
a little bit late.

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:23.266
Naruto, what exactly is going
on?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.935
Why did you bring children with
you? Oh!

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:31.441
Um, this feels right, but I
think his touch was just a
little firmer than this.

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.209
What is she talking about?

00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:36.446
I came here...!

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.180
Huh?

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:39.583
I came here to
see you, Dad!

00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:40.650
[inhales]

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:47.123
I found out Lord Seventh
was meeting with you, so I
followed him here.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:50.159
There's something I really
wanted to ask you.

00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:52.095
Well what is it then?

00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:56.666
Okay, well, um...

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:04.674
[inhales] I want to know, is Mom
my real Mom?

00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:09.713
Oh. So Sarada's had the
Sharingan for a long time then?

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:14.250
Emotional trauma is a trigger
for the awakening of the
Sharingan.

00:07:14.283 --> 00:07:17.153
I would say that, perhaps
without knowing it...

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:21.525
Sasuke's absence over the years,
has affected her deeply and much
more...

00:07:21.558 --> 00:07:25.562
than any one of us could
have ever realized.

00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:31.267
Judging by your reaction she
probably never asked you about
the others in the photo either?

00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:36.239
Sarada is a very honest child.

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:41.378
Is she ever found out Sasuke was
an enemy of the Hidden Leaf
Village at one time...

00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:46.483
Of course but now he's traveling
around the world for the sake of
protecting the village.

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:49.453
Even if you kept it secret,
she'd find out eventually.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.791
Just like she's finding
out now about her birth.

00:07:54.824 --> 00:07:58.828
So maybe it's time for you to
have a little more faith in
Sarada, huh?

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:05.902
I'm a failure as a mother.
Aren't I?

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:07.136
Answer me now!

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.906
Is she my real mom or not?

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:11.675
Did something happen?

00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:14.344
[grunts]

00:08:14.378 --> 00:08:17.347
Did something happen?

00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:21.351
You have never been around my
whole life! Why won't you ever
stay and live with Mom?

00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:24.554
<i>(Sarada) Do you even care that</i>
<i>you've forgotten what your own</i>
<i>daughter looks like?</i>

00:08:24.588 --> 00:08:29.493
And who is this woman standing
next to you wearing the same
kind of glasses as me?!

00:08:29.526 --> 00:08:33.363
Do you really think this is
something any daughter could
ever ask her mother about?

00:08:33.397 --> 00:08:36.500
Hang on, I know that photo.

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:39.869
Situations like this make me
really uncomfortable.

00:08:39.903 --> 00:08:45.008
Mom won't tell me anything and
you're never around! I can't
trust either one of you!

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.744
My entire life is a big mess!

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.880
[heavy breathing]

00:08:50.914 --> 00:08:54.884
So Dad, what exactly is it
you've been doing this whole
time?

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.190
What I do, has nothing to do
with you.

00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:02.559
[gasps]

00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:07.831
[trying not to cry]

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.500
Forget it!

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.370
Hey, wait!

00:09:13.403 --> 00:09:16.506
You are a super insensitive
person!

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.778
I was thinking for a moment
there that you actually might be
my dad, but that's impossible!

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.848
[running efforts]

00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:28.885
Don't you think it's about time
you told Sarada what really
happened?

00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:31.955
Come on, at least tell her why
you can't return to the village.

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:45.902
Are you leaving already?

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.238
I'll be sure and send word
if I find anything.

00:09:49.272 --> 00:09:52.609
It wouldn't hurt to stop by your
house before you leave, would
it?

00:09:52.642 --> 00:09:57.013
The threat of someone like
Kaguya, whose existence nearly
destroyed the world...

00:09:57.046 --> 00:10:00.650
could arise again if we don't
remain diligent enough.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:04.554
We cannot afford to ignore any
traces of it.

00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:08.592
The peace we have now was
secured through huge sacrifices.

00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:13.763
Truth is, this is also a journey
of atonement for me.

00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:18.702
There's no need for that. Nobody
has any bitterness toward you
anymore.

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:19.836
Hmm.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.705
Come on, Sasuke, together we
can...

00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:24.240
You protect the village
as the Hokage.

00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:29.679
I'm the only one with the
Rinnegan. I can search for
traces of Kaguya.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:35.151
I suggest that you do what
you're meant to do, and I'll do
the things that I'm meant to do.

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:38.655
Isn't this the collaboration
that you always dreamed of?

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.694
Listen I want you to treat my
whereabouts as classified
information...

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.663
that only the top
brass know about.

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:49.132
But not knowing anything
hurts, you know.

00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:53.670
You should tell Sarada. Don't
you think she deserves to know?

00:10:53.703 --> 00:10:57.273
Knowing will create unnecessary
anxiety for her.

00:10:57.307 --> 00:11:00.877
That's true but she may
resent you some day.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:06.750
Even so, at least her future
will be bright. Am I wrong?

00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:13.089
She has Sakura. She
will always be there.

00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:15.158
They'll be just fine.

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:29.005
What am I gonna do now? I'm not
good at dealing with these
situations.

00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:31.608
[chewing]

00:11:32.376 --> 00:11:35.645
Oh? [sighs]

00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:43.219
Okay, after I eat this, I'm
gonna go over there and try
talking to her. Hmm?

00:11:50.594 --> 00:11:53.930
Sarada, there's one thing
that I know for certain.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:59.035
Just trust me on this one. Your
father is the finest shinobi
around.

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:02.271
[sighs]

00:12:04.007 --> 00:12:05.509
[sighs]

00:12:08.912 --> 00:12:10.714
[sighs]

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:19.055
Sakura, after this test, the
next one we'll have to do
is...huh?

00:12:19.088 --> 00:12:20.924
Where'd she go?

00:12:35.238 --> 00:12:37.474
[inhales]

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:42.812
For the purpose of finally
achieving our goals, let us now
begin.

00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:50.119
We will revive the Akatsuki.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.224
Yes!

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:20.016
[gasping]

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.152
[gasping]

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.857
[sighs]

00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:35.665
Take this.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.634
What is it?

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:39.202
It's consomme© flavor.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:42.772
You can have it. You should use
it to make up with Sarada.

00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:49.278
Wait! Just stop, Sarada!

00:13:49.313 --> 00:13:51.815
Please let me go!

00:13:51.848 --> 00:13:53.717
If no one is going to have the
courage to tell me the truth...

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:57.887
Then I'll go find that woman
with the glasses myself and I'll
ask her straight to her face!

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.857
Try talking to Sasuke one more
time!

00:14:15.405 --> 00:14:16.740
Let's go, Shin!

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.174
Yes, of course, Father.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.224
[grunt]

00:14:36.225 --> 00:14:40.864
[scared breathing]

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.806
He's all yours, Sasuke.

00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:55.945
Dad, no!

00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:13.963
[grunts]

00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:15.231
Heh!

00:15:15.264 --> 00:15:16.199
Hmph!

00:15:23.206 --> 00:15:24.140
[gasps]

00:15:25.542 --> 00:15:28.044
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:15:34.651 --> 00:15:36.786
Is that his Visual Prowess?

00:15:37.287 --> 00:15:38.288
[grunts]

00:15:40.457 --> 00:15:42.125
[grunts]

00:15:47.964 --> 00:15:50.367
Dad's amazing! He's incredible!

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.837
Actually, this is nothing. He's
even more skilled than this.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.972
I hope my real dad is like him.

00:15:56.005 --> 00:16:00.977
The type of guy with piercing
eyes who always has a way of
making the ladies swoon. [sighs]

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.250
I see, Sasuke Uchiha.

00:16:07.283 --> 00:16:12.055
Your technique is something that
I need, so I can finally revive
the Akatsuki.

00:16:12.088 --> 00:16:15.925
Akatsuki? Just who in the hell
are you?

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:20.864
Hah. I go by the name...Shin
Uchiha.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:24.468
Shin Uchiha? That's the same
as...

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.338
[gasps]

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.711
Those red eyes. Who are you?
Tell us!

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:37.213
I'm Shin Uchiha.

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.147
[gasps]

00:16:39.449 --> 00:16:42.452
He's the boy who attacked us!

00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:47.190
You can speak the truth freely
after we've captured you. Till
then, shut up.

00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:50.960
Who told you that you could rest
boy? Get up now!

00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:53.697
Yes. Okay, Father.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:59.903
So they're actually father and
son? Then that means he's using
his own son as his shield!

00:17:04.374 --> 00:17:06.876
Naruto, take care of Sarada.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.647
Sure. As long as she's in here
those two can't touch her.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.516
Be careful. Keep
your guard up.

00:17:16.486 --> 00:17:17.987
Heh!

00:17:20.524 --> 00:17:21.825
Hmm?

00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:23.893
Huh?

00:17:24.428 --> 00:17:25.395
[gasps]

00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:26.996
[gasps]

00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:28.532
[gasps]

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.804
[groaning]

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:36.406
What the hell just happened?

00:17:38.675 --> 00:17:41.077
This is my Visual Prowess.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.482
What do you think? I'd say it's
just as powerful as yours.

00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:47.451
[grunting]

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.218
Lord Seventh, no!

00:17:49.252 --> 00:17:53.390
You don't need to worry, Sarada.
I'm okay.

00:17:53.423 --> 00:17:58.227
That guy can control other
people's weapons with his power.

00:17:59.028 --> 00:18:00.630
<i>That moment he attacked...</i>

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:05.635
<i>He must have marked my sword!</i>

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.236
Huh?

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:14.043
[grunts]

00:18:20.817 --> 00:18:21.818
[groans]

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.252
[gasps] Dad, no!

00:18:25.622 --> 00:18:29.326
Unfortunately, peace keeps
humans from evolving.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:32.429
(Shin) Just like it has with the
<i>two of you.</i>

00:18:32.462 --> 00:18:35.198
[grunting]

00:18:35.231 --> 00:18:37.266
These things are making it hard
to move.

00:18:37.301 --> 00:18:41.405
Without evolution, all creatures
shall eventually perish.

00:18:41.438 --> 00:18:45.375
<i>(Shin) So I'll be taking your</i>
<i>Sharingan, right now!</i>

00:18:48.912 --> 00:18:51.915
Chaaa! Damn you to hell!

00:18:52.181 --> 00:18:53.450
[grunts]

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:55.619
It's Mom?!

00:18:55.652 --> 00:18:56.520
[gasps]

00:19:11.668 --> 00:19:15.905
Just what the hell do you think
you're doing to my husband and
my precious daughter?

00:19:15.939 --> 00:19:19.142
So, who the hell
are these guys?

00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:21.611
We were just about
to figure that out.

00:19:21.645 --> 00:19:24.581
But what are you doing
all the way out here?

00:19:24.614 --> 00:19:27.351
Hey I'm still here
too, you know?

00:19:28.385 --> 00:19:29.786
What in the heck.

00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:32.689
<i>(Sarada) Who are these people?</i>

00:19:32.722 --> 00:19:34.991
Are you going to be okay,
Naruto?

00:19:35.024 --> 00:19:38.428
Yeah. [grunts]

00:19:38.462 --> 00:19:39.863
I'll heal soon enough.

00:19:39.896 --> 00:19:41.565
<i>Huh? For real?!</i>

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:48.237
So much fuss over something like
this?

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:52.976
Your battle senses have really
dulled! It's rather sad.

00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:55.011
Come on, give me a break!

00:19:55.044 --> 00:19:57.514
Well, this whole thing is over
now.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.740
Uh. [sighs]

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:30.580
[sighs]

00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:33.450
Thank goodness, you're okay.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.452
Huh?

00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:53.470
I'm sorry. I thought I'd made
things clear to Sarada, but I
guess I didn't.

00:20:55.505 --> 00:21:01.244
No. It's actually my fault. You
don't need to apologize to me.

00:21:01.978 --> 00:21:03.813
I know, I have been...

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.058
Sarada!

00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:16.225
Huh?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.501
Huh?

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:26.903
<i>(Eyeball Clone) I'm taking you</i>
<i>along as well!</i>

00:21:26.936 --> 00:21:27.704
What's going on?

00:21:28.972 --> 00:21:29.906
Sarada!

00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:30.674
[grunts]

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.108
[grunts]

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.445
Transportation technique?

00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:36.913
Mom no!

00:21:36.946 --> 00:21:44.220
[grunting]

00:21:44.754 --> 00:21:47.691
Mom, come back!

00:21:57.534 --> 00:21:58.568
Huh?

00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:09.413
[groans]

00:22:10.814 --> 00:22:14.183
<i>It looks like I'm right in the</i>
<i>heart of enemy territory.</i>

00:23:49.813 --> 00:23:52.048
<i>(Shin) What is that we call</i>
<i>death?</i>

00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:56.486
<i>It's merely the expiration of</i>
<i>the corporeal vessel that is</i>
<i>completely disposable.</i>

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.587
<i>(Sakura) You're wrong!</i>

00:23:59.489 --> 00:24:01.991
<i>You're sorely mistaken if you</i>
think that the body only serves
<i>as a disposable vessel!</i>

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:05.295
The body is where one's feelings
<i>and one's will reside!</i>

00:24:05.329 --> 00:24:10.467
<i>(Sasuke) Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next Generations:</i>
<i>Connected Feelings.</i>

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.704
<i>(Sakura) It's like you don't</i>
understand at all what should be
<i>important as a parent!</i>
