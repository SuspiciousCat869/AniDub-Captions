[trembling and nervous breaths]
[grunt]

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:22.289
<i>A-A-A... A-a-a... A kissing</i>
<i>scene...?!</i>

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.460
This is it! [gasp]

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.728
Ooops! Uh...

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:31.465
[straining]

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.871
[sigh] I'm trying to get
married, here!

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.440
So that was completely
inappropriate just now!

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.442
[sigh]

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:47.447

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:54.354
[chattering]

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.556
Oh, Sarada!

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:56.623
Huh...? Wow!

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:00.594
Cho-Cho, you look like a real
<i>superstar.</i>

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.865
You see, when you're a true lady
like I am, you look stunning in
anything.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:09.703
[chuckle] Are you doing okay?
You didn't forget that we're on
a mission, did you?

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.104
[chuckle] No, of course not.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.108
I heard you're supposed to have
a kissing scene with that Tomaru
guy!

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:17.711
He asked, so I couldn't very
well say no. Oh, well!

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.881
I guess that's just what I get
for being too perfect.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.384
That is so like you! Okay, I'm
rooting for you!

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:29.756
[chuckle and pressing lips
together]

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.295
Alright! Time to bring on that
scene! I'm about to give Tomaru
the perfect kiss! [grunt]

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:26.573
[chattering]

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:31.144
[nervous groans]

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:34.448
You think that Cho-Cho might be
just a little bit nervous?

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.418
Looks like she shed all of her
confidence along with all
that weight.

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.787
Why am I feeling so nervous
about this?!

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:41.722
Just relax!

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:42.256
Huh?!

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:47.461
It'll be fine! All you have to
do is just be yourself, Cho-Cho.
<i>Sparkle.</i>

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.632
Oh, Tomaru... you're so kind to
me!

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.409
[kissing moans]

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.610
[groan]

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.414
Hey, makeup! Could you tone down
the gloss on her lips?

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.282
[annoyed grunt]

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:09.883
[groaning]

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:11.018
Is something wrong?

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:16.423
No, no... It's just that this
scene doesn't really fit in with
the rest of the show.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:20.727
Ugh, Tomaru always likes to jam
in a kissing scene. You know how
he is...

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:26.433
Come on! Aren't you guys ready
yet? I'm all set to roll here,
so let's get on with it!

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.137
Okay, we're rolling!

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.106
<i>And... action!</i>

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.444
Look... I'll never let you go!

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.612
Okay!

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.449
<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.285
My heart's gonna explode!

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.957
They're sure not making it look
like true love, are they?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.891
[gasps]

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:52.459
Ughhh! Idiot!

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.694
Ugh! Cut!

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:54.561
Huh?!

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:55.262
[chattering]

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:59.766
Aw, come on! Everything was
going so nicely!

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.438
You're absolutely right. Yep.
Okay, that confirms exactly what
I was thinking.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.840
Right! We're just gonna cut this
scene out!

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:08.542
Huh?!

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.377
You okay with that, Tomaru?

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.881
Well, if you say so! You're the
director!

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:19.720
I guess that's that, then! I'm
sorry. But in exchange, I'd like
to add another scene, okay?

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:21.388
Uh... Eh... Uh?!

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:24.725
Huh? What's up?

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:28.595
Do you have any idea what
you've done to me just now?!

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.373
Wow, the guy that attacked
earlier sure did leave an
enormous hole in the wall...

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:44.711
But despite his flashy entrance,
he didn't lay a single scratch
on either one of the stars.

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:49.917
Hmmm... I feel like this whole
situation is too much to just be
an attempt at simple harassment.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.318
So what's he after?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.757
I'll contact the village to see
if they have any leads, but
right now, we have nothing.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.895
If that's the case, our best
move would be to track him and
find his route of infiltration.

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:05.632
Well, this hole is certainly the
shortest route to get back
outside...

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:08.235
Which means regardless, the
culprit is pretty cunning...

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:12.606
It may be that this mission's
becoming something more than the
genin can handle...

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.214
[chattering]

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:24.418
Cho-Cho, I have to say that when
you're around, I feel so safe!

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:27.721
Uh, it's no big deal, it's
just... that's the mission, you
know?

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:33.093
We don't know if that guy is
gonna attack again. So maybe you
should postpone the filming.

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:36.296
I won't let some ridiculous
annoyance interrupt our work.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.933
I'm going to make this...

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.969
...the best production that ever
was.

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:46.440
(DIRECTOR) <i>Roll cameras! Action!</i>

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:50.277
You told me that our love will
shine brightly for ever and
ever...

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.580
Are you telling me those
words were just a lie?!

00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:58.452
No, of course not! Even at this
moment, my love is burning
bright deep in my heart.

00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:02.456
[seething]

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:06.627
Seeing the two of them together
makes you forget that this is
just a show!

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.461
And cut!

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.765
You know, I think you should
deliver those lines a little
more slowly.

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:13.433
[gasp]

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:15.068
Uh? Cho-Cho?

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:17.504
Hey, are you listening? I'm
talking to you.

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:18.405
Huh? What's that?

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:21.475
I was talking about the lines in
this scene...

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:22.409
Don't worry about it.

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:26.647
Honestly I doubt the viewers
would be able to tell the
difference anyway.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.617
You know what? Just listen...
Don't take this production so
lightly, alright?

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:35.389
Okay! Take number two is up!

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:39.393
You told me that our love will
shine brightly for ever and
ever...

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:42.963
Are you telling me those
words were just a lie?!

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.098
(FEMALE STAFF) <i>Take five,</i>
<i>everyone!</i>

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:48.235
I have to say, you were perfect
again today, Tomaru!

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:53.574
Oh, thanks. But in this case, I
think that I'd better let Ashina
take all of the credit...

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:57.211
...so that way, she can take her
final bow.

00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:00.280
Wait, does that mean this is
your last episode?

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:06.253
Go on. tell them. They ought to
know that you're leaving the
show, right?

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:06.987
What?!

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:11.592
Thanks for all your hard work.
You can leave the show to me.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.328
[groans]

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:19.800
Thank you for everything. I
believe that it's a good time
for me to move on.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.536
This is a chance for me to step
up.

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:25.372
Something's going on here. I'm
getting a weird vibe...

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:30.210
Yeah... I mean, I know that
Ashina can be difficult
sometimes...

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:32.279
<i>But I guess she can be</i>
<i>heartfelt too...</i>

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:40.754
[chuckling and chewing]

00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:44.591
Oh, it all looks so delicious...
It's just too cruel...

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.260
Aren't you gonna eat, Cho-Cho?

00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:48.395
My stomach is craving food right
now...

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:51.932
...but my heart is so full that
I couldn't possibly eat!

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.800
Is this about Tomaru or
something-?

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.702
He's got nothing to do with it!

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:59.673
Aw, man, how long is she gonna
keep this whole thing up? It's
such a drag!

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:04.778
She has a thing for Tomaru and
actually thinks she's hiding it,
right?

00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:07.147
If you're not gonna eat it, I
will.

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:07.414
Uh!

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:12.452
Oh, no... my hand just moved on
its own! [biting] Mmmm!

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:13.720
Wow, that looks good!

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:14.288
Mmm!

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:15.322
Mm!

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:17.624
You sure get flustered, don't
you?

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:19.426
Mm!

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:20.227
[nervous chuckles]

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.894
Eww...

00:09:20.928 --> 00:09:21.562
So pretentious...

00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:25.866
Hey, this really is good! Maybe
I ought to have one, too!

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.269
Oh, uh... what's the matter?
<i>Sparkle.</i>

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:33.207
Uhhh... [swooning]

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.843
Oh! Hey... You doing alright?

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:38.712
Maybe you should mind your own
business.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.215
What is going on with her now?!

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:43.984
Don't you think humans are
interesting?

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:52.593
Check it out!

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.396
They're the same footprints.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.601
There's no mistake at all. This
has to be the route that he took
when he escaped earlier.

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:04.838
We're right. He pinpointed the
least guarded section of the
studio lot for his attack.

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:08.876
And that would mean that he
planned this attack of his
really carefully.

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:10.110
Or else that...

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.280
...someone informed him in
advance about the security
positions.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:19.620
An insider... This is becoming
increasingly troublesome the
more that we learn...

00:10:22.523 --> 00:10:32.299
[cheers and squeals]

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:33.333
[chuckle]

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:40.874
[cheers and squeals]

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:41.742
[gasps]

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.578
[cheers and squeals]

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:48.549
So this is what it feels like to
be a star, huh?

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:52.452
Go, Cho-Cho! Get Tomaru out of
here and leave the rest of this
for us to handle!

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:53.220
Got it!

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:54.121
Uh?!

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.424
[cheers and squeals]

00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:01.595
I'm sorry you have to put up
with all this because of me.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.096
Yeah, it's really a bother.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.800
Ugh! Why can't I be more honest
<i>about my feelings?!</i>

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:07.835
(FAN) <i>Over there!</i>

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:09.536
<i>Tomaru! Where'd you go?!</i>

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.204
Hide!

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:10.971
Oh...

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.274
[giggles and squeals] Tomaru!
Where'd you go?!

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.680
[relived sigh] I'm pretty sure
we managed to lose them...

00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:21.582
Oh, yeah?

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:23.617
[nervous breath] <i>He's so close!</i>

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.920
Let's hide in here a little bit
longer, just in case.

00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:27.988
But, uh...

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:32.459
(TOMARU) <i>You're my bodyguard,</i>
<i>right, Cho-Cho?</i>

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:35.996
Which means... you'll always
stay close to me, right?

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.131
I'll always...

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.000
...stay close?

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.402
[nervous breath]

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:48.275
There you are! You can come out
now. All the fans are gone.

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:48.976
[sigh]

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.111
That was a close one! [chuckle]

00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:56.183
What's the matter?

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.753
Nothing at all. Don't worry
about it. Really.

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:00.621
Cho-Cho?!

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:08.762
[chattering]

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:10.397
Are you okay, Cho-Cho?

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.298
Yeah. Why?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.702
Cause you're not concentrating!
Is all of this because of that
Tomaru guy?

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:17.571
No, that's just ridiculous.

00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:19.506
No, it's not! Not even a bit!

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.376
Listen, we are smack dab in the
middle of a mission right now.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.711
So we can't afford even a single
slip up!

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:28.415
Then I guess that we'd better
stop talking now! After all...

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:31.585
I can't very well afford to
leave Tomaru alone if he's still
in danger.

00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:32.853
Well, yeah, but that's--!

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.555
-all part of my mission. Yeah,
you're right.

00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:35.222
(TOMARU) <i>Cho-Cho.</i>

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:39.593
Hey, can you bring me that ring
that I gave you?

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:40.460
Yeah! See ya, Sarada!

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:43.130
Uh... [sigh]

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:47.868
(TOMARU) <i>It's just as I thought.</i>

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:49.970
You look beautiful in that
dress!

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:54.541
Now, I was hoping that you'd be
willing to practice the final
scene with me.

00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:57.878
Sure, but... this outfit is so
beautiful...

00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:02.616
It simply dawned on me... I knew
that dress would fit you just
perfectly.

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.921
[nervous breaths]

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:10.591
So this is what's gonna become
of us...

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:11.625
Uh... Oh, okay...

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.096
We can't see into someones
heart. But like I asked you
before...

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:19.132
how can I confirm that your
feelings are actually real?

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:24.538
I-I want to get closer to you...

00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:27.441
...and I want to confirm
everything... Huh!

00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:33.480
...with your eyes... and your
lips...

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:35.616
And your lips...

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:41.388
I'm begging you! Please, marry
me!

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:41.989
Yes!

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.592
Hm? Hold on, that isn't the line
in the script...

00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:46.126
Yes!

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:48.996
Alright, well...

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.601
[giggle]

00:13:56.303 --> 00:14:01.608
At the end, we're supposed to
share a kiss after we gaze deep
into each other's eyes.

00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:03.977
Well, then...?

00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:05.746
Do you want to?

00:14:07.581 --> 00:14:11.718
[nervous breath] <i>Just- Just stay</i>
<i>calm! And then... after we</i>
<i>kiss...</i>

00:14:11.752 --> 00:14:14.421
<i>the next thing will be</i>
<i>to plan our honeymoon...</i>

00:14:19.793 --> 00:14:24.431
Are you in there? Ashina told me
to come over here and get her
dress...

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.869
Why are you wearing that?

00:14:28.902 --> 00:14:32.973
[angered breath and grunt] Why
you-!

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:39.446
You really are quite dangerous.
In many ways...

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:43.517
This was my... It was my--!
Ahhh!

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.318
[gasp]

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:48.255
Ugh! Hey, what is going on out
here?

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:51.558
Huh?! What do you think you're
doing?! That's my dress!

00:14:51.592 --> 00:14:52.092
[grunting]

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.127
Just what is going on here?!

00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:59.733
Ashina, I'll explain it inside
your dressing room, kay?

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:00.567
Explain?

00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:01.268
Just c'mon.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:06.907
Cho-Cho, remember our mission
is to protect both Tomaru and
Ashina.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.543
You can't do things on your own.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:13.747
Huh?! You barged in at what
could have been the best
moment of my life...

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.750
You cheap, pathetic little
nobody!

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:27.227
So, are you gonna stop
interfering now?

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.764
None of this really has anything
to do with you at all!

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:33.300
Well, if it doesn't have
anything to do with me...

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.836
then please don't go walking off
with my dress.

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:36.570
[exasperated sigh]

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.073
You know, unlike the character
that you play on the show...

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.709
you don't possess even a single
shred of kindness.

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:46.847
But that girl... is completely
different. She's nice even on
the inside.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.248
Well, now that's unusual!

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:53.387
And here I thought you were so
simple-minded that you weren't
able to see any further than...

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.288
a girl's looks.

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.423
Unlike your character on the
show...

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.792
Oh, come on! You've got me all
wrong!

00:15:58.825 --> 00:15:59.459
Oh, please!

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:03.931
You give all the pretty girls
autographs right away but make
everyone else wait...

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.800
and then you blow them off with
a little wave.

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:08.202
And tell them, "later!"

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.670
[chuckle] You don't get it.

00:16:09.703 --> 00:16:10.103
Oh?

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.607
I totally take into account how
people are on the inside.

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:16.109
Hm. Sure you do...

00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:20.581
That girl... She's
head-over-heels in love with me
but desperately hides it.

00:16:20.614 --> 00:16:25.452
And that's what makes her so
cute. I'm just going along with
it and playing with her.

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:30.424
[grunts and growls]

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:32.226
Hey, stop it Chubs!

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:36.463
Just come on... I mean, now...
You're like, um...

00:16:37.598 --> 00:16:40.934
[heavy breathing]

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:43.537
He means you're not being
yourself now.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.271
Huh?!

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:47.741
All of us are supposed to be on
a mission.

00:16:47.774 --> 00:16:52.412
So why are you attacking me,
then? Your actions just don't
make sense.

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:53.647
Your babbling's irritating!
[growling]

00:16:55.082 --> 00:16:57.718
Come on, stop! Honestly,
behaving this way isn't like you
at all Cho-Cho!

00:16:57.751 --> 00:17:00.153
[grunt] Enough! Cut it out!

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:05.225
[straining]

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:10.597
What's the deal with all of
you?! Are you trying to ruin my
wedding, is that it?!

00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:14.968
Anyway... in the show, the
characters you and I play are
about to get married...

00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:17.704
Look, we're gonna begin filming
soon...

00:17:17.738 --> 00:17:21.575
...so don't you dare lose the
ring, you understand me?

00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:23.577
Oh, yeah... Right, the ring...

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.444
What's wrong?

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:27.915
Don't worry. I'll make sure to
bring it.

00:17:27.948 --> 00:17:30.284
In the end, it's just a prop,
right?

00:17:30.918 --> 00:17:32.452
[grunt]

00:17:34.788 --> 00:17:36.723
In any event, before filming
starts...

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:40.427
I have to go get my dress back
from that shinobi girl!

00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:44.531
[straining]

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:48.068
[grunt] Hey, Cho-Cho! Just calm
down!

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:51.872
[chuckle] There are walls
standing in the way of love.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:56.777
But the power of my love will
shatter all of the barriers in
its way!

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.914
Breaking walls is the power you
have with your jutsu, the
Partial Expansion Jutsu...

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:03.250
Just snap out of it, would ya?!

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:07.421
Why you-! [straining] Ahhh!

00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:11.592
[straining]

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:13.527
Oh, no! Not the dress!

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.899
[straining]

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:22.503
Ehhhh...

00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:25.873
(CHO-CHO) [straining]

00:18:25.906 --> 00:18:27.107
Cho-Cho!

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:34.214
It's like she just molted...

00:18:34.248 --> 00:18:36.283
Idiot! That's Ashina's dress!

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:38.585
Cho-Cho!

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:40.721
[weary breath] Oh... Oh, no...

00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:41.588
(SHINA) <i>Hey...</i>

00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:42.122
Eh!

00:18:43.223 --> 00:18:43.991
(ASHINA) <i>What's the meaning of</i>
<i>this?!</i>

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.627
Ohhh. Whoa, talk about bad
timing...

00:18:49.763 --> 00:18:51.632
What'd you do to my dress?!

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.901
I-I'm so sorry! [cringing]

00:18:53.934 --> 00:18:54.601
Quiet!

00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:57.604
That shinobi girl! Where'd she
run off to?!

00:18:58.272 --> 00:18:59.106
Huh...?

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:04.111
Aw, man! What a drag! How do we
explain this situation?

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:09.383
Huh? What's going on? Is Ashina
making a scene yet again?

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:10.551
Uhhh...

00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:12.553
Can I ask you a question?

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:16.990
[nervous groans]

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.093
[nervous groan]

00:19:20.127 --> 00:19:23.397
I asked Cho-Cho to hold onto
that prop ring for me.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.532
Can you tell me where she's
gone?

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:27.801
Huh? [groan]

00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:32.105
This is really quite strange...
I could've sworn that I just
heard her voice.

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:37.411
What are you going to do to fix
this?!

00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:41.882
When will it be enough? How much
more are you gonna do to ruin my
scenes?

00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:46.286
What do you mean? It's just a
costume. Never mind about that;
where's Cho-Cho?

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.989
Oh, well, you see, here's the
deal...

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:52.125
Hm?

00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:56.730
Oh, great. Thanks so much!

00:19:56.763 --> 00:19:59.566
Are you one of the bodyguards
too?

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.300
Huh?!

00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:02.703
Oh. Sorry. You're a fan, huh?

00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:07.875
I'll give you an autograph
later on. I have an important
scene to do right now.

00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:08.976
Uh...

00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:11.111
It isn't that...

00:20:11.912 --> 00:20:12.980
Hm?

00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:17.518
Well, it's okay. So, could I
have that now, please?

00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:20.287
I hope you'll keep on supporting
me and-! Uh?

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:22.990
Hey, what's the matter?

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:25.459
Look, I'm very busy, here.

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:26.627
[sigh]

00:20:27.794 --> 00:20:31.598
[sigh] Well, about that...

00:20:31.632 --> 00:20:35.202
That ring's something you'll
probably never get to wear your
whole life.

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:35.869
[gasp]

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:37.271
I'll be blunt...

00:20:38.372 --> 00:20:42.276
Honestly, big girls like you
aren't really my type.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.379
[quivered breath]

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:46.780
[grunt]

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:48.982
Hey, listen here, buddy- Uh?!

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.589
But why not?!

00:20:55.622 --> 00:20:57.558
Damn it, what's your deal?

00:20:57.591 --> 00:20:59.426
Hold on! Just wait a minute!

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:01.495
How are you gonna fix this,
huh?!

00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:07.768
Why waste time on that guy?!

00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:10.404
Because that's our mission...

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.973
We're supposed to protect him
remember?

00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:16.009
[sigh] Oh, Cho-Cho...

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:28.388
[sigh] We're sorry! We didn't
mean to cause any trouble for
you or for the production.

00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:30.791
Too bad being sorry doesn't cut
it.

00:21:30.824 --> 00:21:36.463
This may be all fun and games to
you, but to me, this is a very
important production.

00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:38.298
Again, I'm so sorry...

00:21:52.613 --> 00:21:54.982
I see... You're okay with that?

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:58.285
Alright, fine by me.

00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:47.661

<i>long are you gonna stay in</i>

00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:53.734
