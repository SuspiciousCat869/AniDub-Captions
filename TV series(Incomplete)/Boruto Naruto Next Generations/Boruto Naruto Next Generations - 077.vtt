[hissing]

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:52.980
[gasp]

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.085
[hissing]

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.653
We're all gonna get crushed!

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.621
[hissing]

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:05.425
Do you still despise humans so
much, Garaga?

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.563
You're just letting' yourself
get used by humans!

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:13.667
[grunts and hissing]

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.102
Come on!

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.606
[quivering] Cho-Cho!

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:25.712
[hissing and grunts]

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:26.880
[flinching]

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.082
Not good!

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.319
You're not going anywhere!
[hissing and pained grunt]

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.422
Please, Lady Sarada, run!

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.456
But, Aoda...!

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:39.760
There's no chance I'm gonna run
away and leave things
unfinished!

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.497
Wind Style! Gale Palm!

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.435
Aggghhh! You brat!

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:52.973
Garaga, how dare you do that to
Cho-Cho! You're gonna pay for
that!

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:57.177
Huh?! What, you wanna be
turned to stone, too!?

00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.981
Shut up! I'm gonna take your
Reverse Scale, and that's that!

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.717
Take my Reverse Scale?!

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.185
[grunt]

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.622
Fine, try it!

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.491
I'll send you straight to hell!

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.026
[gasps]

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.995
(BORUTO) <i>You're not getting</i>
<i>away!</i>

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.296
Wait!

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.864
Huh?!

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:18.465
Are you gonna go alone?!

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.634
[groan]

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:22.302
[sigh]

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:29.076
Hey, Aoda... why did Garaga
retreat all of a sudden like
that?

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.547
He didn't. That hole leads to
his feeding grounds.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.684
He moved to a place where he has
the home advantage.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.419
Oh, so that's it, huh...?

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:41.755
Ugh...And we were already in a
tough spot...

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.191
Come on, we have to go!

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.894
If we don't get his Reverse
Scale, Mitsuki can't-

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:47.828
(AODA) [pained groan]

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.328
[gasps]

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.433
[pained groans and
labored breaths]

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:57.604
This is all our fault. We can't
let you push yourself anymore.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.574
Aoda, please just wait here.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.877
<i>(AODA) Lady Sarada...</i>
<i>please, listen.</i>

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:04.611
Hm?

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:10.884
You must avoid Garaga's Reverse
Scale at all costs. Long
ago...

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:14.888
a giant snake from Ryuchi Cave
turned into stone just from
touching it.

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:17.090
Like those statues we saw...

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:22.930
On top of which, Garaga despises
humans. To attempt to steal it
is...

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:26.099
So he won't allow us any chances
to get it...

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:27.334
(BORUTO) <i>We're wasting time.</i>

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.305
We can't leave Mitsuki. Or
Cho-Cho.

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:52.125
Thanks for all your hard work.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.795
Call me if something comes up.

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:56.330
Roger that!

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:17.751
[gasp]

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.754
Yurito. All this time, it was
you...?!

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:26.593
I thought if there was a
traitor, then they'd be sure to
go after the injured guard.

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.462
It seems that I was right!

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.430
[grunt and gasp]

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:36.637
Shikamaru told us to keep watch
over important areas in the
building.

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:39.406
But, why? Why do this?!

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.409
[chuckle]

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:49.183
[gasps]

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.621
[sighs]

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.625
[chattering]

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.564
Damn it. Boruto and the others
are in trouble, and we're
stuck here on patrol?!

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:08.168
C'mon! Just like I told you
earlier, security is important,
too.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:09.570
Hey, look!

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:12.573
[heavy breathing]

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:13.774
What's going on, Yurito?

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:16.443
Udon, perfect timing!

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:20.848
The chunin that was injured at
the gate was just attacked in
his hospital room, moments ago.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.983
You gotta get to the Hokage's
Office!

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:26.086
What cowardice! Attacking an
injured man?!

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.488
Yeah. I'll go notify the other
teams.

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.490
Just a minute.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:36.196
It may be hard to believe, but I
possess a pretty keen nose.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.065
Udon Sensei...?

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:42.603
You're in charge of security for
the medical department now.

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:47.741
So if someone staged an attack
there, then why would you ever
leave your post?

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:48.742
[gasps]

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:51.178
Oh... Right, about that...

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.013
[gasp]

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:55.449
[straining]

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.152
It'll be better for everyone if
you don't cause a commotion.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:01.255
Were you involved in Mitsuki's
disappearance, too?!

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:05.626
We're right in the middle of the
Leaf. There's no escape.

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:10.330
Please, let's not do this, Udon.
Your subordinate's life is on
the line, here.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.600
[straining and grunt]

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:14.535
[flinching]

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:17.504
[grunts]

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.608
You won't get away with this!

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:29.983
[grunts and heavy breathing]

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.623
[grunt] Making this hard,
huh...?

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:39.326
<i>Something's not right...</i>

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:41.595
[gasp]

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:42.596
Release!

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.764
[pained grunt]

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.134
I knew it. Genjutsu.

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:50.070
Huh? Where- Where am I?

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:52.606
Yurito, what happened to you?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.441
[gasp] Udon? What's going on?

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:57.644
Oh, no! Everyone, back!

00:07:57.678 --> 00:07:58.412
Hmph!

00:07:58.445 --> 00:07:59.112
Huh?

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.784
[gasp and worried cries]

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.885
[gasps]

00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:05.619
What the...?!

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:07.621
(IWABE) <i>What is going on?!</i>

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.292
Kaboom!

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:17.998
Detonation complete! And I bet
it made such a nice sound, too!

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:25.405
Good thing I laid a trap just in
case, huh?

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:28.575
<i>It's hard to believe your</i>
<i>genjutsu was released!</i>

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:33.881
It means they're not all fools
over there. In any case, my job
here is done.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:36.450
I'm heading back
first to make a report.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.922
Awww... it's so unfair!

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:44.992
We're running behind in our
plan. Enough talk.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:46.994
Yeah, yeah...

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:52.199
Let's go.

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:03.410
It's so dark, I can hardly
see...

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:04.878
[hissing]

00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:05.612
[gasp]

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:13.053
He vanished?!

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:17.424
It's just like Aoda said. Garaga
definitely has the advantage
here.

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:21.428
It's camouflage. He blends in
with the color of this cave.

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:24.398
That's why it looked like he
disappeared...

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:27.434
This whole situation is becoming
a real drag.

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:31.605
It's just a matter of time
before he finds us. We gotta
keep moving.

00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:44.585
It's no good. How am I supposed
to see anything in the dark?!

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:48.622
We can't really make a move
unless we know where he is...

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:50.657
[gasp] Inojin, jump!

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:51.458
Huh?

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:52.993
[gasp]

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:59.900
What is going on? It's like
Garaga can see everything that
we're doing...

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:05.472
It means that even in the dark,
he has ways to find his prey
inside this cave.

00:10:05.506 --> 00:10:06.974
This is bad...

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:08.542
[gasp]

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:09.643
Boruto!

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:10.644
[gasp]

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:12.145
[hissing and biting]

00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:18.886
Uhhh....

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.889
[heavy breathing]

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:23.991
[trembling] That was scary!

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.659
Yeah! What a close call!

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:27.094
You could say thanks!

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.629
[chuckle] Thank you!

00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:34.101
Seriously, thanks, Inojin!
You sure did draw that Super
Beast Scroll super-fast!

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:38.472
Nope! Wrong! Even I can't draw
anything that fast.

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:41.074
Wait a second, Inojin... What do
you mean?

00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:43.977
You know the one I jumped off
before?

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.946
Well... It ended up being
unharmed.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.181
[gasp]

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:51.585
Hmmm...

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:54.188
What? What are you thinking?

00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:59.026
I think I might've found a
way to bring Garaga down.

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.500
<i>Gotcha!</i>

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.002
<i>Huh? What the-?!</i>

00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:14.107
Ha! I knew it... Garaga reacts
to the movement of heat
signatures.

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:17.411
Heat signatures? What do you
mean by that?

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:19.813
I've heard of something like
that before, too.

00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:23.917
So they're able to hunt in the
darkness, some snakes can sense
heat.

00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:29.790
Yeah. Earlier, Garaga was able
to track us down, but not the
Super Beast Scroll.

00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:30.390
[growling]

00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:36.129
Oh, I get it! Because it's just
a drawing, it doesn't give off
any heat.

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:38.999
Which means if we can take
advantage of that...

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.935
<i>[growling]</i>

00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:43.837
(SHIKADAI) <i>This is his feeding</i>
<i>ground.</i>

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:47.808
It won't make a difference if we
<i>just do it once or twice...</i>

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:48.442
[groans]

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.645
(SHIKADAI) <i>But if we keep it up</i>
<i>over and over...</i>

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:53.647
[growling] You brats!

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:55.983

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.361
Hm...?

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.362
Huh?

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:14.334
Aggghhh!

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:15.302
Do it now!

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:15.769

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:16.303

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:29.316
Did we...?

You bastards!

Okay!

They've got some nerve coming
here to raid our territory!

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:06.153
This fortress must be protected
at all costs.

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:09.022
Make sure you're at the top of
your game, Garaga.

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:11.158
Who do you think you're
talking to?!

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:14.361
You're the one who'd better be
at the top of his game!

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:15.495
Yeah, of course!

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:18.832
Let's wrap up this mission with
a bold move!

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:22.069
Yeah, there's no way we're
gonna lose!

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.514
[grunts]

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:36.216
And take this, too!

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.589
[grunt] This place is gonna
fall! We've gotta retreat!

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:47.628
Not yet! I'm gonna take another
shot at finishing this! Back me
up!

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:48.829
[gasp]

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:51.231
There's no way they can beat us!

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.134
Let's go! Agh!

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:03.644
Why...?!

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:27.434
[gasp]

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.570
<i>What was that?</i>

00:14:29.603 --> 00:14:32.206
<i>(GARAGA) You persistent,</i>
<i>shameless brat...</i>

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:32.639
[grunt]

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:36.109
...barging into my mind like
this!

00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:38.679
Garaga! You mean, this is...

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:44.451
Why do you want my Reverse
Scale? Did you come here to kill
me, too?

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:46.119
Like him?

00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:50.123
No! All I want is to find my
friend who left our village.

00:14:50.157 --> 00:14:52.192
And for that, I need your
Reverse Scale...

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:54.328
You're such an
idiot!

00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:57.764
Coming to a place
like this just for a
traitor?!

00:14:57.798 --> 00:15:02.169
Mitsuki isn't a traitor, he's
my friend! You don't know
anything about it!

00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:08.108
Huh?! Sure, I do! I know just
how deceitful you shinobi are!

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:12.746
Aoda told us all, about how much
you hate humans.

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:15.449
But still, long ago, even you--!

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:20.821
That was when I was young and
dumb. Like you are now.

00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:25.125
Look, there's no denying that
the shinobi you had a contract
with was a terrible guy.

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:28.128
But it's also true that not all
shinobi are like him!

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:31.231
So you really are dumb, after
all.

00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:32.666
What'd you say?!

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:39.106
The guy I entered into a
contract with may have been
deceitful, but he was smart.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:42.442
Compared to him, you're
nothing at all.

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:46.680
When he abandoned me, do you
know the look he had in his
eyes?

00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:48.448
Hm?

00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:50.017
Well, I...

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:53.353
His eyes reflected his betrayal.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:01.328
He had the cold and calculating
eyes of a shinobi...

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:05.966
I know the pain of losing
someone you trust. I've felt
that, too.

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:09.102
You know-it-all! You think you
understand, brat?!

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.572
Yeah! I lost Mitsuki!

00:16:11.605 --> 00:16:16.577
Huh?! Don't make me laugh! You
only think you understand!

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.447
You may believe you know me and
this Mitsuki, but you don't!

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.619
You're right. I didn't
understand anything. Even now, I
don't...

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:27.855
But still-!

00:16:27.888 --> 00:16:31.458
Let me explain... Trust is just
something you take advantage of.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.760
[gasp]

00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:38.165
This Mitsuki... He made you
trust him... and then waited for
the chance to betray you.

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:41.468
Just shut up! [quivered breath]

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:44.438
It's too bad... If I kill you
right now...

00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:48.809
I won't be able to see you get
killed by this Mitsuki...

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.644
There's no way that's gonna
happen!

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.680
[gasp]

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:58.085
Hey! I can't hold him anymore!

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:01.688
I've made up my mind.

00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:06.360
I won't take Garaga's Reverse
Scale.

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:07.794
[chuckle]

00:17:07.828 --> 00:17:09.796
I'll do a Summoning Contract
with him!

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.797
[gasps]

00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:12.699
Who do you think you are?!

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:16.837
Garaga, you just said you'd like
to see me get killed by Mitsuki,
right?

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.506
Yes, I'd love it!

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.944
Except what I'll show you
instead, is me bringing
Mitsuki back home!

00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:25.078
Huh?!

00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:29.950
Garaga... Look, you're just
afraid! Afraid of trusting
someone!

00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:32.019
What did you say?!

00:17:33.854 --> 00:17:37.457
Trust isn't something to take
advantage of! Trust means being
there to lend a hand anytime...

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:38.592
anywhere!

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:39.459
Quiet!

00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:39.860
[gasp]

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:40.127
Ahhh!

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:53.774
What'll you do if you can't
bring Mitsuki back?

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:56.476
If that happens... then kill me!

00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:02.749
[chuckling]

00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:05.152
No way. What's up with Garaga?

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:07.120
Hey! What's so funny, huh?

00:18:07.154 --> 00:18:12.125
Interesting... Okay, I'll play
along...

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:19.967
...until you bring back this
Mitsuki. And if you can't,
I'll just devour you then.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.468
Fine by me!

00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:29.576
Well, well. Did you bring
Garaga's Reverse Scale?

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.144
It's right here.

00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:33.747
[chortle] Then show it to me!

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.083
Sure thing. Watch closely!

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:43.490
[chuckle]

00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:49.763
You've got some gall, trying' to
get my Reverse Scale. I
ought-a eat you right now!

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.465
[chuckle]

00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:56.470
For a human child... you're
really quite interesting...

00:18:57.471 --> 00:18:59.907
You mean she was a giant
snake, too?!

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.910
Alright then, I shall reward
you!

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:04.077
[gasp]

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:06.513
Now, watch carefully...

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:11.485
And you shall witness the
thoughts that were left inside
Mitsuki's snake!

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.022
[nervous breath]

00:19:19.893 --> 00:19:23.130
Wanna come with us to the Land
of Earth?

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.933
The answers that you're seeking
can be found there.

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:27.000
Wait.

00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:32.339
Stop his heart, but just for a
<i>little bit.</i>

00:19:41.148 --> 00:19:43.217
Let's get out of here now.

00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:49.456
You see? What did I tell you? I
knew Mitsuki would become an
ally!

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:52.659
Enough idle chatter, Sekiei...
Let's go.

00:19:56.697 --> 00:19:59.366
<i>Now go to where Boruto is.</i>

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:07.207
[cough]

00:20:11.345 --> 00:20:12.513
[swallowing]

00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:16.650
So Mitsuki asked that snake to
just stop the guard's heart
briefly.

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:21.455
And the enemy thought the guard
was dead, so they didn't bother
stabbing him.

00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:24.591
So, then... he used that snake
to trick the enemy?

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:28.128
It seems so. But what exactly
does that mean?

00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.831
It means Mitsuki saved the
guard's life.

00:20:30.864 --> 00:20:32.599
I knew it!

00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:36.570
It's true! So Mitsuki didn't
betray us at all, then!

00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:37.638
Mhm!

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:41.441
All that's left now is to get
Mitsuki back!

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:45.012
I'm sorry. But I don't agree
with your reasoning.

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:46.480
What? Why not?

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:49.750
Maybe Mitsuki actually did save
that guard. But even then...

00:20:49.783 --> 00:20:53.320
why would he leave with the
enemy in the first place?

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:54.388
But that's...

00:20:55.822 --> 00:20:59.459
Until I verify what he meant by
his "will," I can't simply let
him go.

00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:03.897
Well, in any event, at least now
we know where Mitsuki's headed.

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:09.303
The Land of Earth is one of the
Five Great Nations. So if the
perpetrators are from there...

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:11.104
then...

00:21:11.138 --> 00:21:14.441
Back when our parents were still
young, it might've meant the
start of a war.

00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:18.846
Wait, what? I mean seriously?
This situation is really that
bad?

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:20.480
[sighs]

00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:24.985
Hey! What do you
want to do, huh?

00:21:27.187 --> 00:21:29.323
I'm going, of course!

00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:32.926
I want to see Mitsuki! And hear
what he has to say in person!

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.128
I hope that you understand...

00:21:35.162 --> 00:21:39.700
if worse comes to worst, I'll
have to do everything in my
power to stop you.

00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:42.336
I know. I'm counting on it.

00:21:50.444 --> 00:21:59.152
(White Snake Sage) That kid! He
seems to be bound by a strange
<i>destiny. Be wary young man.</i>

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:04.658
One can not run away from one's
<i>own destiny.</i>

00:22:06.026 --> 00:22:08.128
Wait for me, Mitsuki.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.960
(Boruto) Looks like we made it
<i>out of Ryuchi Cave safely.</i>

00:23:46.994 --> 00:23:50.631
(Shikadai) Yeah, but as things
stand, we won't be able to get
<i>to Mitsuki...</i>

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:53.467
before he crosses into the Land
<i>of Earth.</i>

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.637
That's why we need to update the
<i>village on our situation.</i>

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.704
<i>(Boruto) How do we do that?</i>

00:23:59.072 --> 00:24:01.275
(Shikadai) We're gonna do it, by
<i>breaking into two teams.</i>

00:24:01.308 --> 00:24:05.979
Next time on Boruto Naruto Next
<i>Generations: "Everyone's</i>
<i>Motives"</i>

00:24:06.013 --> 00:24:09.716
We have to let the village know
<i>there's a chance Mitsuki's</i>
<i>innocent.</i>
