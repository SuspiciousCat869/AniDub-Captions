WEBVTT

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.010
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.214
Uh...

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.729
It is over! The winner is Sarada
Uchiha!

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.796
[giggles]

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.265
[cheering]

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.569
Should-a researched more! We're
growing stronger every
single day!

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.238
Don't you dare underestimate us
Leaf Shinobi!

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:42.476
<i>Now, show me! Show me your</i>
<i>power!</i>

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.615
I quit.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.416
[gasp]

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.551
[grunt]

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.790
Damn you... But why?

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.259
[cheering]

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:03.664
If we were to continue any
further than we did, it might
inconvenience my parent.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.733
What I want is to stay here...

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.876
You can definitely win this
Boruto! I know it!

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.978
Give it everything you have
Boruto!

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.848
And don't go losing to Shinki-
or to Sarada either!

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.319
You defeated me, so the least
that you can do is to keep on
winning!

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:29.590
And if you don't win, you'll be
paying for the pity party, you
got it?

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:30.724
Uh, wow, you guys...

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:33.293
[chuckle]

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:36.430
Yeah! Just leave it to me!

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:48.108
[cheering]

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.345
And now... The Chunin Exams
final round begins!

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:53.514
[cheering]

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:55.115
I made it this far...

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:59.386
I definitely can't lose now!
There's no way!

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:45.125
[cheering]

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.828
(ROCK LEE) <i>Boruto Uzumaki of the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf.</i>

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.130
<i>Sarada Uchiha of the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf.</i>

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:52.766
<i>Shinki of the Hidden Sand.</i>

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.540
[cheering]

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.743
The final match is in battle
royale format.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:06.813
<i>The last of these three</i>
<i>competitors left standing...</i>
<i>will be declared the winner!</i>

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.315
[cheering]

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.416
And now...

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.384
Begin!

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:15.722
[cheering]

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.927
Ah, so he's gonna attack both of
them at once, huh?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.932
What is he, an idiot? It's a
three-way battle. Doing that is
only inviting his own defeat.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:29.169
Or it could have another
meaning, as well... that he's
confident about himself.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.275
My jutsu is good against
multiple opponents at once.

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:39.179
It's easy for me to take you
both on at the same time!

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.648
He's underestimating us...

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:42.649
<i>(SARADA) Hey, Boruto!</i>

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:43.417
Huh?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.251
[grunt]

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.456
He's really strong. You wanna
join forces?

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.658
And we'll get some payback for
Mitsuki!

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:52.526
There's that, too...

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.330
But it's also personal. This is
our turf.

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:59.433
It'd be disgraceful for two
Leaf Shinobi to lose here.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.969
We can't let the Five Kage see
that!

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:04.037
I really couldn't care less
about that!

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.074
But, yeah! I'm with you!

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:09.243
<i>I can't lose, either!</i>

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:15.616
But if we attack at the same
time, we might not be sure who
took him down.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.919
If there's an opening, just go
ahead and take it. So...

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:21.421
I guess that we have a united
front!

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:23.624
Fine by me.

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:28.795
I'll show you that you can't
destroy my impenetrable Iron
Wall.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.431
Is that so? Well, let's test it
out!

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.433
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:44.244
Fire Style! Fireball Justu!

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.447
[grunts]

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:56.657
Oh, wow! Those two sure do have
some awesome moves!

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.627
But they're facing a strong foe
who hasn't even gotten a scratch
yet!

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:04.331
Don't forget, they've teamed up
now! I'm sure they'll pull it
off!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.701
Well... they'd better! Or I'm
gonna look like a fool.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:13.874
[cheering]

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:14.808
[gasp]

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:16.109
What is that?!

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.582
I already told you...

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.584
...my Iron Wall's impenetrable.

00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:31.124
Oh, I see... I wasn't expecting
this...

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:34.361
Huh, that fighting style reminds
me of someone...

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.062
Hmph!

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:42.102
The Black Iron Fist, Shinki's
favorite jutsu, it can be used
to both attack and defend.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:44.738
It can attack and defend? Which
means that-!

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:56.183
What the-?!

00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.486
Now, Black Iron Fist...

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.587
...Eject!

00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:02.122
[gasps]

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:05.492
[grunt]

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:08.762
[grunts]

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:11.765
[gasp]

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:14.501
[pained grunt]

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.970
[pained grunts and groans]

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:18.238
[grunt and gasp]

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:21.074
[grunt]

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:23.977
[grunt]

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.080
[grunt]

00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:32.753
Sarada...!

00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:34.922
[gasp] Is she okay?

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.658
Of course she is! The battle's
just begun.

00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:41.695
Yeah! Knowing the two of them,
they've probably got something
in mind already!

00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:49.169
Damn it! What is that... that
stringy stuff that's connected
to them?

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.642
An electromagnetic field!

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:57.311
Elctro what...?

00:07:57.344 --> 00:07:59.479
We learned about it at the
Academy.

00:07:59.513 --> 00:08:02.082
You manipulate Iron Sand with a
magnetic field.

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:05.152
That's the way you change its
shape and control it.

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.788
Where'd you find a Magnet Style
user like that?

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.590
An electromagnetic field...?

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:14.027
Then... if we hit it with
Lightning Style, do you think
that would work?

00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.129
Didn't you see his match against
Mitsuki?!

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:18.365
Lightning Style:

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:19.266
Snake Lightning!

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:28.275
A superficial Lightning Style
wouldn't even make him blink.

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:31.245
[chuckle] Alright, then how
about this?

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:33.747
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.417
Lightning Style!

00:08:38.619 --> 00:08:40.521
Sarada, you, too!

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:41.989
Oh, yeah! I get it...!

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:43.457
Lightning Style!

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.291
Lightning Ball!

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:48.662
I'll call this...

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:49.897
Improvised Secret Technique!

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.099
Lightning Ball Shuriken Jutsu!

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:03.744
One-handed?!

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:05.646
The concept isn't too bad...

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:10.417
But still... for this level of
Lightning Style, one hand's
plenty.

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:14.521
[gasps]

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:15.255
Whoa, no way...!

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.258
Let me show you the difference
in our power.

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:20.260
[grunts]

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:25.132
[gasps and struggling]

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:31.638
Oh, man... This could mean the
end of the finals.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:32.639
No way!

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:34.741
Come on, Boruto! Fight back!

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:36.510
This is really not good...

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:41.782
Oh. My, my... Is the Sand gonna
win this?

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:46.153
Even though it's two against
one? That would be just
pitiful...

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:50.457
As you just saw... Naruto, I do
feel bad, but...

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.258
[grunt]

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:54.962
[struggling]

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:57.397
I said nothing would suit me
better, right?

00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:00.267
The difference in our power's
<i>unmistakable...</i>

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.737
and I'm proving that for all the
<i>Five Villages to see.</i>

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.642
<i>My father overestimates the</i>
Hidden Leaf... because of his
<i>respect for his friend...</i>

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.444
<i>the Seventh Hokage.</i>

00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:12.412
For my dad?!

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:15.015
I'm simply proving it to him
now...

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:18.552
...more than the Leaf, more than
the Hokage's son...

00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:23.657
I, to whom my father passed all
his knowledge, am the one who
truly excels!

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.292
[struggling and pained groan]

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:30.097
[grunting] Like hell you are!
Ahhh!

00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:31.431
[surprised grunt]

00:10:32.533 --> 00:10:34.301
Alright, Young Lord, what are
you doing? Why delay?

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:35.569
Now...

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.238
Shadow Clone Jutsu...

00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:39.706
[grunt]

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.274
[struggling]

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.509
[straining] Sarada!

00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:43.510
[struggling and gasp]

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:45.612
Fireball Jutsu!

00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.114
[inhale and blow]

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.783
I see! While the Iron Sand hands
are occupied...!

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:50.584
[sigh]

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:51.552
[gasps]

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:52.252
[grunt]

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:56.690
We're free!

00:10:57.524 --> 00:11:00.394
But what do we do?! My chakra
is...

00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:05.399
Don't be such a wimp! He's in
the exact same position, too!
One more time, like before!

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:06.266
Uh...!

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.805
Is he going to use it...?!

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.774
(SHINKI) <i>Unfortunately...</i>

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:16.076
You have no more chances.

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:18.478
[quiet breath]

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:19.346
[gasp]

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:24.651
With my father watching, I'll
prove that the Sand is superior
to the Hidden Leaf.

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:27.588
First you, daughter of Uchiha!

00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:28.355
[quivered breath]

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.425
Iron Sand: Black Iron Wings!

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:35.429
Don't underestimate me!

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.470
Wait, that's... [gasp]

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.242
[grunts]

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:54.648
Sarada!

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:55.516
[gasp]

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.687
Ahhh!

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:17.638
Oh no...

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:19.239
No, that can't be real...

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.642
[grunt]

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:24.511
Sarada Uchiha cannot continue!

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:29.149
The Iron Sand that I cemented to
your body earlier acts as a
homing beacon.

00:12:29.183 --> 00:12:32.819
As you can see... there's no way
you could ever dodge it.

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:35.222
Damn it... how dare you...!

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.492
And now it's one on one. Just as
I thought...

00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:41.528
the Hidden Leaf are nothing
without their Lord Seventh.

00:12:41.562 --> 00:12:42.196
What's that?!

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.465
My foes in the semifinals were
the same.

00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:49.803
I guess when you grow up
protected by the Hokage, this is
what happens.

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:52.005
Sh-shut up! You don't know
anything!

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.242
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.884
Is he gonna do his Boruto
Stream?!

00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:06.153
Th-That's too reckless, Boruto!

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:08.989
He's used up almost all of his
chakra, too...

00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:18.098
Want to keep fighting till the
end? Fine by me.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.901
Then I'll show you what
devastating defeat is like!

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:22.069
Whatever!

00:13:24.338 --> 00:13:25.439
Boruto...

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:26.640
Black Iron...

00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:27.741
...Stream!

00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:29.243
...Wings!

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:36.416
[grunts]

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:41.321
[straining]

00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:43.557
[straining]

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.625
Boruto!

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:45.726
Boruto...

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:46.760
Oh, Boruto...

00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:49.429
Boruto...

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.298
Boruto!

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:00.574
[straining] Damn it! I'm not
gonna let you...

00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:33.040
...look down on us!

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:40.414
[straining]

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:44.117
With the strength I have now...
<i>I can't...</i>

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:47.387
Greater strength will be
required from here on out.

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:52.226
Don't let this get you down.
Take your time, build up your
strength.

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:55.028
In time, you'll be able to use
powerful jutsu.

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.263
[gasp]

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:29.830
Well, "in time..."

00:15:29.863 --> 00:15:31.698
...isn't gonna work for me...

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:33.700
I gotta...

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:35.736
...show my dad... right now...

00:15:36.837 --> 00:15:39.740
...that I... can do this!

00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:42.743
Purple Lightning!

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.378
What?!

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:45.179
How did-?!

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:53.086
Ahhh!

00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.658
Ahhh!

00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:58.592
[pained grunt]

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:13.407
[heavy breathing]

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:23.984
(ROCK LEE) <i>It is over!</i>

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:26.920
The winner, uh...

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:30.490
<i>...I mean champion is Boruto</i>
<i>Uzumaki!</i>

00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.492
[cheering]

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:35.162
He did it! Boruto actually did
it!

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:37.297
[chuckle] Yeah! Way to go!

00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:41.235
I always had absolute faith that
he was going to pull it off!

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:41.802
[gasps]

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:42.135
He did it!

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:47.341
Can you believe that it was
Boruto who took him down and not
Sarada?

00:16:47.374 --> 00:16:50.477
[chuckle] How many tricks does
he have up his sleeve anyway?!

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:53.280
When did he manage to master
Lord Sixth's technique?

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:56.650
Big Brother won! He won! Did you
see that?!

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.585
Yes... he did...

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:01.255
[gasp] I won?

00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:02.990
Really...?!

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:08.595
[chuckle]

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:14.401
[chuckles]

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.238
[chuckle] Yeah!

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:27.214
Huh?

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:29.283
What's with the Hokage?

00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:33.320
I bet he's so proud, he couldn't
help going down there himself!

00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:35.455
Now there's a doting parent for
you!

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.724
Hmmm...

00:17:37.758 --> 00:17:40.761
[chuckle] Hm?

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:44.431
Dad, did you see me?!

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:45.999
I actually won!

00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:58.345
[gasp]

00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:02.249
[worried groan]

00:18:03.684 --> 00:18:06.086
Well? Explain yourself. Go on.

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:11.925
[chattering]

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:16.363
[nervous chuckle and groan]

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:17.497
This is...

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:26.874
Boruto Uzumaki has used a
Scientific Ninja Tool...

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:29.142
which is prohibited in the
Chunin Exams.

00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:31.612
What-- scientific?!

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.583
Please try to catch them! They
knocked me out and then they
stole my magnum opus!

00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:40.220
Clearly you bratty kids are in a
situation that's over your
heads.

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:44.191
Wait, haven't I seen that thing
before?

00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:48.362
With this Shinobi Gauntlet you
can use jutsu without using your
own chakra.

00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:51.598
And also you can use other
people's jutsu!

00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:54.835
It defeats the Exam's purpose of
showing your true strength.

00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:58.672
Lee, Boruto Uzumaki is
disqualified.

00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:02.242
We'll have to figure out how to
revise the results...

00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:05.979
What happened to Big Brother?
Did he do something bad?

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.451
[sigh] Boruto...

00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:15.756
[grunt] He's been exposed. Well,
we have no choice but to act
now.

00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:21.128
(ROCK LEE) <i>Boruto Uzumaki has</i>
been disqualified for using an
<i>illegal ninja tool!</i>

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.864
Wow, I can't believe he'd do
something like that...

00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:29.603
[sigh] Oh, man... that idiot
kid's dragging the Hokage's name
through the mud...

00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:32.005
(SHIKADAI) <i>Boruto!</i>

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:33.207
[gasp]

00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:36.109
Why'd you do it?

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:40.981
I mean... You didn't... when we
fought, did you?

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:45.152
It's not... like that...

00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:50.557
[taken aback] Boruto...

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:55.195
[chatter and heckling]

00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:56.864
Just quit! Ya phony!

00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:58.832
Really?! Trying to win by
cheating?!

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.701
You're a disgrace to the Leaf!

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:01.969
[disappointed groans]

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.838
[sighs]

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:08.342
So now what will you do, Boruto?

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:16.617
You're no longer a ninja
either...

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.052
Come with me.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.621
We'll talk later.

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:22.322
[grunt]

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:22.389
[gasp]

00:20:23.724 --> 00:20:26.593
Really? You'll talk to me later?

00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:30.364
Yeah, right. Like you'd actually
make the time to do that, dad!

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.866
If you'd talked to me before
this...

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.434
[quivered breath] I...

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:36.703
Then I...

00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:40.007
I wouldn't have ended up in this
damn mess!

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:47.114
(KATASUKE) <i>He's right, you know.</i>

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:53.453
Boruto wasn't able to win, and
we're all very disappointed
about that, Lord Seventh.

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:55.622
Katasuke...

00:20:57.024 --> 00:21:00.594
To be honest, I really wanted to
make this announcement after he
won.

00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:05.999
Listen, everyone! Yes, it's true
that Boruto used a Scientific
Ninja Tool!

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:08.268
I know such things are
prohibited here...

00:21:08.302 --> 00:21:13.373
but there's no denying that this
tool made it possible for him to
reach this point!

00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:17.044
So, all of you from the Hidden
Leaf- and beyond... please...

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:19.546
consider implementing this
scientific Ninja Tool!

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.682
Enough, Katasuke!

00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:23.684
Hey, what are you doing, Old
Man?

00:21:24.351 --> 00:21:25.452
[sigh]

00:21:28.088 --> 00:21:32.292
This is simply the optimum stage
for the optimum tester.

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:36.296
Please don't take all of this
too hard, Young Lord!

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:55.449
What've I...

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:00.187
[gasp]

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.893
[chuckling]

00:22:05.926 --> 00:22:07.995
It seems I've finally found
you...

00:23:42.523 --> 00:23:45.125
(NARUTO) <i>Are you related to</i>
<i>Kaguya Otsutsuki?!</i>

00:23:45.158 --> 00:23:50.364
(MOMOSHIKI) <i>I am Momoshiki</i>
Otsutsuki. I belong to the same
<i>clan as Kaguya.</i>

(NARUTO) <i>Just what do you want</i>
<i>here?</i>

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:57.804
(MOMOSHIKI) <i>Why, you, of course!</i>
<i>You're the one who has the</i>
<i>strongest chakra.</i>

00:23:57.838 --> 00:24:00.574
Yes, that's right. Our mission
<i>is to...</i>

00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:05.279
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: "The
<i>Otsutsuki Invasion"</i>

Fruit and revive the Divine...
