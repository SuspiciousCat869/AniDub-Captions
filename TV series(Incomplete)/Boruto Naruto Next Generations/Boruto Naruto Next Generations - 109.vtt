WEBVTT

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.311
(soft music)

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:12.112
Really?

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.847
The Climbing Silver move.

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.849
Right off the bat
like that, huh?

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:18.118
Thought you hated risky moves.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.588
[Asuma] To defend your king
from a superior opponent,

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.358
one must make some sacrifices.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.730
What's going on with you?

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.132
Oh, nothing to speak of.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.668
I'm just finally
coming to understand

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.570
the true importance of the king.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:43.377
Shikamaru, if I picked
pieces to match Leaf Shinobi,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.446
do you know which
one the king is?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.081
Well, the Hokage?

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.852
See, that's exactly what
I used to think, too.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.855
But that is not
actually the case here.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.757
Then, who is it?

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.094
You'll know the answer
when the time comes.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:02.863
Mm.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.465
(soft music)

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:14.174
Mirai should be getting
close to the age

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:19.313
when she'll be able to
realize who the king is.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:22.182
(birds chirping)

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.122
Is there really a hot
spring all the way out here

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.357
in a place like this?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.092
[Kakashi] Don't worry one bit!

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.095
On the hot spring circuit,
it's known as a hidden gem

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.664
you must visit at least
once in your life.

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.501
[Mirai] Sorry if it's a bit
out of the way, Tatsumi.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:43.570
I know you came with us in
memory of your mother, but--

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.072
Oh, not at all!

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.808
Traveling with all of you
guys makes me feel safe!

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.811
Besides, I think my
mom would like the idea

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.379
of going to a hidden hot spring.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.982
I'm guessing you're like
your mother, Tatsumi.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.251
-(giggling)
-So I've been told!

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:00.554
And which parent do you
take after, Miss Mirai?

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.589
My mom, I think.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.790
My father--

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:07.694
Well, my father died even
before I was born, after all.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:08.729
What?

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:10.697
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:11.732
Don't be!

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.500
It really doesn't bother me.

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.204
[Kakashi] We should
be there soon.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:20.674
Oh, there's supposed to
be a hot spring village

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.943
just over the next hill.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.079
[Guy] Kakashi, I'm gonna
take the first soak!

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:27.848
[Kakashi] Hey, no fair!

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.484
[Mirai] Please, wait for us!

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:35.589
Oh!

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:38.325
It's a mountain.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.127
Yeah, sure is.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.130
It sure isn't a mountain at all!

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.600
Something really terrible
has happened here!

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.574
(Opening Theme Music)

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:34.808
-(birds chirping)
-(playful music)

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.476
Oh, hello.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.813
You folks have come here
to visit the hot springs,

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:40.814
am I right?

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:43.817
Yes, but what happened here?

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:46.553
Well, I hate to disappoint you,

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:48.355
but just about a month ago,

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:51.225
a giant boulder fell
down from the mountain.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:54.828
And everything just
got crushed beneath it.

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:57.631
So, the hot spring's
under there?

00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:00.367
[Proprietress] Yes,
but we were fortunate,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.337
since after all, nobody
ended up getting hurt.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.938
[Kakashi] Guess it's a blessing

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:06.340
this place is deep
in the mountains

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:08.075
and doesn't have many residents.

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:10.210
Ah, well, too bad!

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:12.479
If I were a mere
20 years younger,

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.215
a boulder like this
would be easy to move.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.818
But, it's been like
this for a month?

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.287
Even with all the
damage you sustained?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.822
Hey!

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.490
You guys travelers?

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:26.226
Thank you for
coming all this way!

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.963
We don't have much to offer,
but how 'bout a drink?

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:31.198
Come on!

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:33.567
There you are!

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.635
Go head, drink up!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.670
[Kakashi] Well, can't
say no to that offer!

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.071
[Villager] You, too?

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.174
[Guy] Yes, thank you!

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.343
[Kakashi] May I have another?

00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:45.812
-Well, uh--
-How did you--

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.214
Sure, why not?

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:49.816
You do look like you're
enjoying yourself!

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.719
I'm not gonna lose
this match, Kakashi!

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.223
Oh, so you're a drinker, too!

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:57.824
-(giggling)
-You bet!

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.093
I'm just getting started, here!

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:04.097
It sure seems like you're
quite well seasoned now!

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.700
So, how's the
reconstruction going?

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.335
It's impossible!

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.071
But you can't just leave
things as they are, right?

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.339
It makes no difference

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.474
if that thing is a
boulder or a mountain!

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:17.344
It's not like we can do
anything about it ourselves.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.479
-(Mirai groans)
-That's right.

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:21.481
We cleared away
the mud and sand,

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.218
but that's pretty
much all we can do!

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.620
What about the
Hidden Steam shinobi?

00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:28.622
Why haven't they come
up here to help out?

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:31.825
Recently, several young
women have gone missing

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:32.960
from the surrounding area,

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.695
and they've been busy with that.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:35.963
[Villager] Yeah.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:37.965
They were girls just
about the same age as you.

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:39.099
(gasping)

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.069
In that situation, human
lives are at stake.

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:45.072
So, of course, that takes
priority over our troubles.

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.674
Hey, why haven't
we sought out help

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.943
from the Land of Fire, anyway?

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.346
You think they'd
cross the border

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.348
and come to a little
village like ours?

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.949
-(scoffing)
-I doubt that!

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:57.684
-(giggling)
-We're here!

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.119
We're right in front of you!

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:03.357
And even if they did actually
decide to come here to help,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.092
for something minor like this,

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.427
they'd only send
some low-ranking guys

00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.428
with no authority.

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:09.229
Right?

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:11.098
Don't you think that's true?

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.232
You're wrong!

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:15.536
Look, that guy is
the previous Hokage!

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.305
(playful music)

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:23.443
(sighing)

00:07:24.978 --> 00:07:27.447
(grunting)

00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:33.420
Nope, not gonna happen.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.955
(sighs)

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:36.623
There's just no way.

00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:40.561
I'm not gonna be able
to move it by myself.

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:42.229
I'm terribly sorry

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:46.567
that you all embarked on such
a long journey for nothing.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.801
Oh, no--

00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:48.802
Try this.

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:51.071
A Land of Steam's specialty,

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.807
potatoes roasted in
an underground pit.

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.943
Oh, thank you so much!

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.312
(gobbling)

00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:00.347
Delicious!

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.483
I'm sorry that's all
we have to offer.

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:07.087
I wish you could've taken a
soak in the hot spring, but--

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.824
No, I'm sorry that we
can't help you out more!

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:13.093
Why'd I become a shinobi at all?

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.829
What's the point if I can't
even help this old woman

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:17.831
who's in a bad situation?

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:19.433
All right.

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:21.268
You eat up, now.

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:23.704
(soft music)

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:30.944
Even if the boulder's removed,
there'll be lots of debris.

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:34.548
Simply hauling that away
will be a huge task.

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.816
It'll be nearly impossible

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.085
with the number
of people we have.

00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:40.954
But, we can't just
give up, right?

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:43.957
I mean, isn't there
anything that we can do

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.459
to help these guys out?

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.829
You've sure got guts.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.364
[Mirai] Huh?

00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:53.200
[Kakashi] I've
already taken steps.

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.402
Mr. Choji?

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:56.336
Really?

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.339
Yeah, he was on a
mission nearby, so--

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:02.209
If anyone can move that
boulder, it's Choji.

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:06.046
He's the strongest man in the
whole Hidden Leaf Village.

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:08.415
Someone's coming!

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:09.683
-Huh?
-Mm?

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:13.086
(wind whistling)

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.558
(bright electric guitar music)

00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:19.593
He looks very strong.

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:24.431
[Mirai] Mr. Choji,
please help us!

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:25.832
Of course, Mirai!

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.801
[Mirai] That sharp gaze!

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:29.336
No wonder he's a
Hidden Leaf hero

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:31.939
who survived the
Fourth Great Ninja War!

00:09:31.972 --> 00:09:34.174
-(stomach growling)
-Huh?

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.678
I ate them!

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.947
All my potato chips!

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.049
Why'd you come here?

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.320
(birds chirping)

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:48.021
-Hungry!
-(stomach growling)

00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:50.924
I haven't eaten for so long.

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.292
[Mirai] I get it.

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:55.729
He had a rough mission
and hasn't eaten for days!

00:09:55.762 --> 00:10:01.134
I haven't eaten any potato
chips for, like, 30 minutes!

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:03.904
Huh?

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.440
I'm sorry, but in this state,

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:09.476
there's no way I can
move that boulder!

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.511
Hold on!

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.547
If you need food--

00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:15.782
Here!

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:16.917
Potatoes!

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.519
Oh!

00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:20.387
These are--

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.656
(gobbling)

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:34.201
The Land of Steam's
underground roasted potatoes!

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:36.036
They live up to
their delicious hype!

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:37.404
So, they'll work?

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.007
Uh, no.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.743
There isn't enough fat
in the roasted potatoes.

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:45.379
I have to have
some potato chips!

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:46.413
(giggling)

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.749
But why does it
have to be chips?

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:50.184
Can't you just drink
some cooking oil

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:51.518
or something like that?

00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:53.187
This is really bad.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.790
You just can't buy potato chips
this deep in the mountains.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.792
[Choji] Potato chips.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.627
If I just had some potato chips!

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:03.030
Oh, potato chips!

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:05.032
I'll fix this!

00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:08.001
(cheerful music)

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:12.039
You doing okay?

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.775
I feel bad making you
help me like this.

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:17.511
Actually, I'm a
pretty good cook!

00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:19.313
My mom taught me.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.416
I don't have a whole lot
of experience with cooking.

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:25.786
So, you're gonna have to be
the one in charge right now.

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:29.690
-(tapping)
-(grunting)

00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:33.694
Could you cut them more evenly
and even thinner than that?

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:36.897
Do you mean like this?

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.198
Yes, yes!

00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:40.901
I'm sure there are
thick-cut chips out there

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.402
that have a dense,
flaky texture.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:46.039
But I prefer thin and
crispy potato chips

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:49.009
that showcase the true
essence of the potato!

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:53.180
Well, then, why don't you
just make them yourself?

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:57.050
The simple action of
frying a potato in oil

00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:59.786
brings out all of the
aspects of its flavor.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.322
That's what a potato
chip truly is!

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:07.060
The five senses come alive as
one's appetite is stimulated.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:11.198
Deep frying seems easy, but
it's a complex technique.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.366
You must clear your mind

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.636
and listen to the sound
of the frying potato.

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:17.037
Long ago,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.740
Asuma Sensei would often
say to me during training,

00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:21.308
"Just clear your mind.

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:25.145
"You're too preoccupied
with your own thoughts."

00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:27.447
Clear my mind, that right?

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:31.051
Yes, he said it's best
to just focus strictly

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.886
on what you can do right now.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.921
So--

00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:36.423
-(moans)
-(cheerful music)

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:40.394
Mr. Choji, you were my
father's student, weren't you?

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.196
Yeah, I sure was.

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:45.666
Please, tell me, what
was my father like?

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:47.601
Let me see.

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:48.635
Sensei--

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:52.372
Well, he liked to smoke a lot.

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:53.740
(sighs)

00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:56.276
No, that isn't what I meant.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.279
He was blunt, but
how do I say this?

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:02.783
Still awfully vague
at the same time.

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:04.685
[Mirai] Oh, I see.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:06.920
But still.

00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:08.555
At the age I'm at now,

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:11.792
I can sorta understand
how Sensei might've felt.

00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:13.160
[Mirai] Huh?

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:14.695
I'm sure you know

00:13:14.728 --> 00:13:19.399
how Cho-Cho and the rest of
Team 10 wear earrings, right?

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:20.934
[Mirai] Uh, yeah.

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.003
[Choji] Way back in the day,

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.739
when I was still an
active member of Team 10,

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:27.407
I received my own as a gift.

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:31.144
Asuma Sensei gave them to
us when we became chunin.

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:33.413
My dad gave them to you?

00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:36.383
He didn't seem to
be paying attention,

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:37.417
but in actuality,

00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:40.420
he was completely aware
of everyone around him.

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:42.923
I believe that he
smoked all the time

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:46.527
mostly just as a way
to hide his shyness.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.461
I see.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:50.197
So, he had some
charming traits, huh?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.534
Miss Mirai, you seem
kinda happy now.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:54.902
(giggling)

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:56.036
Now!

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.771
The sound's changed!

00:13:57.804 --> 00:13:59.640
-Take them out, now!
-Uh, yes!

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:00.874
Right!

00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:01.875
Oh, no!

00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:03.243
Hot, hot, hot!

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:06.046
[Mirai] Seems like we did it!

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:08.015
Kinda, at least.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:11.185
Hm.

00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:13.820
Well, the shape
isn't quite correct.

00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:17.758
But then, what's really
important is the taste, right?

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.160
(gobbling)

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:23.530
Delicious!

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:25.933
[Mirai] Huh?

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:28.368
(gobbling)

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.138
Yeah, you did it, Miss Mirai!

00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:33.507
It's thanks to you, Tatsumi.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.976
(gobbling)

00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:40.380
(inspirational music)

00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:44.585
Actually, Mr. Choji,
isn't it too big?

00:14:44.618 --> 00:14:47.921
[Choji] You made me such
delicious potato chips.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:49.756
Now, leave this to me!

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.125
(sighing)

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:55.929
Let's just see what happens.

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:57.631
Right.

00:14:57.664 --> 00:14:58.799
Okay!

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.067
Here I go!

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.735
(exploding)

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.537
Super Expansion Jutsu!

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:08.742
[Mirai] What?

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:11.144
What's going on here?

00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:13.914
Mr. Choji's Super
Expansion Jutsu!

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:15.349
I've only heard about it.

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:16.149
Amazing!

00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:18.185
(villagers grunting)

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:20.787
You mean, you folks are shinobi?

00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:22.389
-(sighs)
-Oh, my!

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.258
Thank goodness!

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.026
(sighing)

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:27.794
Ah, here goes!

00:15:27.828 --> 00:15:30.297
(grunting)

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:34.601
[Mirai] Please, do
your best, Mr. Choji!

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:36.503
You're our only hope!

00:15:36.537 --> 00:15:38.972
(grunting)

00:15:39.673 --> 00:15:42.242
Just a little more!

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:43.610
(grunting)

00:15:43.644 --> 00:15:45.879
Just a little more!

00:15:45.913 --> 00:15:47.714
Long ago,

00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:52.319
Asuma Sensei would often say
to me while we were training,

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:55.189
it's really best to
just focus strictly

00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:57.291
on what you can do right now.

00:15:58.225 --> 00:16:01.261
What I can do right now.

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:03.063
(grunting)

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:04.798
(enthusiastic music)

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:07.467
If I can make it a
bit easier to move!

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.603
(grunting)

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:10.871
Come on, move!

00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:11.905
Hold tight!

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:13.307
I'll come push, too!

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.510
[Kakashi] Well, I can't
just stand by and watch.

00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:17.878
[Guy] All right!

00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:20.280
(grunting)

00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:24.284
Let's go!

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:26.620
But what can guys
like us even do?

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.022
(grunting)

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:35.762
C'mon, we can't let outsiders
come in here and show us up!

00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:37.064
You're right!

00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:39.266
Let's take back our
village and our hot spring!

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:40.367
Yeah!

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.735
(grunting)

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:43.103
Pull harder!

00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:46.340
We've gotta move it!

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:47.274
(grunting)

00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:49.543
[Mirai] Just a little more!

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:55.382
Let's do this!

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:58.285
(wings sparkling)

00:17:00.554 --> 00:17:01.522
Oh, wow!

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:02.756
Beautiful!

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:04.925
(grunting)

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:08.262
(enthusiastic music)

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:16.336
(grunts)

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.505
(banging)

00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:22.509
Yes! He did it!

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.411
But the hot spring--

00:17:26.947 --> 00:17:29.683
(water gushing)

00:17:31.785 --> 00:17:34.254
-(sighs)
-Oh, thank goodness!

00:17:34.288 --> 00:17:36.657
(cheering)

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.659
Yeah, we did it!

00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:39.793
Miss Mirai!

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:40.794
Awesome!

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:42.729
Thank you so very much!

00:17:42.763 --> 00:17:46.667
Now, our village can be happy
and prosperous once again.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.769
Oh no, it wasn't me.

00:17:48.802 --> 00:17:51.238
It was all Mr. Choji's doing!

00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:52.172
Hey!

00:17:52.206 --> 00:17:53.774
Where is Mr. Choji?

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:55.275
Yes, Mirai?

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.511
What is it?

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.647
Mr.Choji?

00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:01.915
-(gasping)
-(giggling)

00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:05.285
Yeah, this just kinda
happens when I do that.

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:09.189
His special jutsu
expends not just chakra,

00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:12.025
but it also burns a lot
of calories, as well.

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:14.595
Well, thank you very
much for your help!

00:18:14.628 --> 00:18:18.065
I may be a shinobi, but
I couldn't do anything.

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.934
If you weren't here
Mr. Choji, by now--

00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:24.671
Not quite, it wasn't
just my strength alone.

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:29.042
See, in the same way that you
inspired all the villagers,

00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:30.310
back when I was young,

00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:33.380
I had Asuma Sensei to
help me become strong.

00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:34.381
What?

00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:35.883
My dad?

00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:37.918
[Choji] When I
was still a genin,

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.287
I had a hard time
learning jutsu,

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.190
unlike my teammates,
Shikamaru and Ino.

00:18:43.223 --> 00:18:47.261
I got depressed all of the
time because of my failings.

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:50.197
(gasps)

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.599
Hey, what's with the sad face?

00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:56.136
Didn't I say you need to have
more confidence in yourself?

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.907
But it isn't as easy as
that to be confident!

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.743
Well, yes, that is true.

00:19:02.776 --> 00:19:04.711
(groaning)

00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:08.482
I wasn't confident in myself
for a long time, either.

00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:09.516
Huh?

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.185
You weren't?

00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:14.588
But if you just focus on
the things that you can do,

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:18.192
one day, you'll become
a full-fledged shinobi.

00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:22.162
Although I'm sure that's
little consolation to you now.

00:19:23.096 --> 00:19:26.667
But what if that
day never arrives?

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.402
Don't worry!

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:31.138
I will train with you
as often as you want

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.675
until you pass the Chunin Exams.

00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:38.779
Sensei's words back then are
what built my strength today,

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:41.748
And that allows me
to protect the king.

00:19:41.782 --> 00:19:43.150
The king?

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.485
That's like the question
Shikamaru Sensei asked me!

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.687
That's right.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.524
And it was Asuma Sensei who
first posed that question to us.

00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:51.758
[Mirai] My dad did?

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:54.428
-So, who is the king, then?
-Hm.

00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:57.064
I'm really sorry, but
I swore to Shikamaru

00:19:57.097 --> 00:19:59.266
that I wouldn't tell you.

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.601
Oh, okay.

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:04.171
[Choji] But one day, Mirai,
you'll understand, too,

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:06.006
exactly who the king is

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.642
that Sensei gave
his life to protect.

00:20:10.077 --> 00:20:12.045
You're just like him.

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:14.915
-Huh?
-I said you're like him.

00:20:14.948 --> 00:20:17.484
You're just the way
Sensei was, Mirai.

00:20:17.518 --> 00:20:18.652
I'm like him?

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:20.053
You think so?

00:20:20.087 --> 00:20:23.023
You consider every possible way

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.058
you might be able
to help someone.

00:20:25.092 --> 00:20:28.428
Watching you here and all
of the times before now

00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:31.131
brings back memories
of Asuma Sensei.

00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:35.502
You are Sensei's
child, after all.

00:20:35.536 --> 00:20:37.538
(sighs)

00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:39.740
Huh?

00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:43.243
Miss Mirai, that's so wonderful!

00:20:43.277 --> 00:20:45.913
(giggling)

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:47.648
(gobbling)

00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:49.783
[Mirai] Thank you once again!

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:52.119
I'll see you later!

00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:56.423
(sighs)

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:58.325
[Mirai] There's
really nothing better

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:01.195
than a nice late-night soak!

00:21:01.228 --> 00:21:02.896
Yeah, you're right.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.299
I gave my muscles a
serious workout today!

00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:08.001
So, this hot spring
is just what I need.

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:10.504
Miss Mirai?

00:21:10.537 --> 00:21:12.139
Yes, what is it?

00:21:12.172 --> 00:21:16.777
Do you wanna know more
about your father?

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.912
What's this all of a sudden?

00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:21.548
I mean, sure I want
to know him better.

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:25.452
But I did get to hear a
lot about my dad today,

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:27.654
so, I feel a little
bit closer to him now.

00:21:27.688 --> 00:21:30.390
But all the same, just a little.

00:21:32.626 --> 00:21:36.530
I wish that I could've
talked to my father

00:21:36.563 --> 00:21:38.031
for even just a moment.

00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:40.434
Yes, I see.

00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:45.639
Hey, are you feeling
okay, Tatsumi?

00:21:45.672 --> 00:21:47.407
Been in here too long?

00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.311
I'm sorry, but I've
been lying to you.

00:21:51.345 --> 00:21:55.148
I told you I was touring hot
springs in my mother's memory.

00:21:55.182 --> 00:21:57.150
But that's not the whole truth.

00:21:57.184 --> 00:21:59.453
[Mirai] What do you mean?

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:03.891
Miss Mirai, have you ever
heard of the hot spring

00:22:03.924 --> 00:22:06.360
where you can see
people who've died?

00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:08.395
(gasps)

00:22:12.241 --> 00:22:14.001
(Ending Theme Music)

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.178
[Mirai] A hot spring

00:23:46.211 --> 00:23:48.113
where you can see
people who have died?

00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:50.982
[Tatsumi] I came all the way
here to see my late mother

00:23:51.016 --> 00:23:52.384
at the Resurrection Hot Spring.

00:23:52.417 --> 00:23:55.086
[Mirai] There's no way
something like that is real!

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.089
I just wanna see my mom!

00:23:57.122 --> 00:24:00.625
Don't you wanna see your
father, too, Miss Mirai?

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:04.062
[Mirai] Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,

00:24:04.096 --> 00:24:07.833
The Steam Ninja Scrolls, The
Resurrection Hot Springs!

00:24:07.866 --> 00:24:11.403
Could I really get
to meet my father?

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:13.939
(soft music)

00:24:13.972 --> 00:24:18.043
