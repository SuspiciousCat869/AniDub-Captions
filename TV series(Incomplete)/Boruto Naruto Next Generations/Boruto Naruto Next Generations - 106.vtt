WEBVTT

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:10.177
(birds chirping)

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.455
Dad, I'm heading out.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.060
(joyful music)

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.099
All right, mom, I'm leaving now.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.801
You're leaving awfully late.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:38.372
Aren't you supposed to be on
Lord Seventh's guard detail?

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.974
No, I'm assigned to
the previous Hokage,

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.342
it's fine if I'm late.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.478
The previous, you mean Kakashi?

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.113
And Mr. Guy too.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.683
Don't expect me back for
at least two or three days.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.618
Well, just be careful.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:52.753
Okay.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.489
(joyful music)

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.859
My name is Mirai Sarutobi.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.094
My mom has distinctive
black hair,

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.996
and so did my late father.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.700
And this is the unruly
hair I'm cursed with.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.336
(joyful music)

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:12.139
I'm told that it was my father

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.974
who picked out the name Mirai.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.610
Why that name?

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.547
'Cause it sounds
optimistic and thoughtful.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.116
It probably just sounded
like a lucky name.

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:29.256
(Opening Theme music)

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.558
That's my grandpa,
the third Hokage.

00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:13.026
His name's Hiruzen.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.997
Please, please make sure
today's mission turns out

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.599
to be a huge success.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.169
Yeah, I'm praying.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.570
Of course I'm gonna pray,

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.939
Lord Seventh is someone
I respect a great deal.

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:28.542
And he personally asked
for me on this mission.

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.612
No one's gonna lay a
finger on Lord Sixth.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:35.449
And Mr. Guy, that's just not
gonna happen while I'm around.

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:38.085
[Boruto] I can understand
praying to the other Hokage,

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:40.687
but praying to my dad
won't get you anywhere.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.924
Boruto, Shikamaru sensei.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.325
Hey there.

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.728
How odd, I hardly
ever see you together.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:48.962
Well, he really wanted to try

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.832
the new burger they
just came out with.

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:53.934
Although it really
wasn't anything special.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.336
What, are your taste
buds destroyed?

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.506
And naturally I'm the one
that had to pay for it.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.842
Dammit, such a drag.

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.944
You heading out on
a mission, Mirai?

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:06.647
Oh yeah, you're
guarding someone, right?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.215
Yeah, Lord Sixth, and Mr. Guy.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.750
I'm a little early though.

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:13.954
So I thought I'd stop by here
to pay respects to grandpa.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:16.390
You really have become
quite a fine ninja.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.725
Thank you, but I'm
still just a student

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.093
compared to you, sensei.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:21.461
Listen, it's just my dad.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.931
You don't have to
use that polite tone.

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.700
I have no tone, okay?

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.803
So you using them?

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:31.305
Yes, of course I am.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.808
But they're proving
to be quite difficult.

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:37.444
I can't seem to use them
like you do, sensei.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:39.780
I understand.

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:42.349
But your chakra nature is
just like your dad's was,

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.952
so I don't think there's
any real reason why

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:48.088
you can't master your
dad's old chakra blades.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.725
Wow, thank you, sensei,
I'll do my best.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.928
There's that tone I
was talking about.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:57.130
All right, that's
enough out of you.

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:58.365
You keep it up, Shikadai,

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.068
and one day soon
you're gonna get it.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.937
I'm counting on you
for that, Mirai sensei.

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.305
Dad, come on.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.976
Better just give up
while you can, Shikadai.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.812
Oh yeah, sensei, the
answer is bonds, right?

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:14.214
Huh, what are you
talking about now?

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.216
The question that
you gave me before,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.352
you didn't forget,
did you, you know,

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:21.555
what's the king that a
shinobi should protect.

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:23.490
Oh right, that question.

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:26.059
The symbol for king can
also be read as gem,

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:27.928
it's a play on that
saying about a flawless

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.930
unbounded gem, right?

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:32.866
I mean, is it right?

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.536
Anyway, so what's
precious to a shinobi

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.538
is they're flawless bonds.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.906
Totally wrong.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:42.176
What, seriously, I wasn't right?

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:45.579
Look, Mirai, sometimes
you overthink things,

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.682
just try and look at it
more simply, that's all.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.217
(rock music)

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.119
Okay, sensei, don't worry,

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:53.921
I'll get it right the next time.

00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:56.089
Well, do your best.

00:05:56.123 --> 00:05:59.927
After that Himawari was
being such a know-it-all.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.828
Still, that's not so bad.

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.363
At least you have a sister,

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:05.365
I'm jealous, I wish
I had siblings.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:08.035
Really, I'm jealous of you
for the opposite reason.

00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:09.736
I wanna hurry up
and become a chunin

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.073
so I can go on missions
that are higher than B rank.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.676
Yeah, well guess what?

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.212
Just between the two of us,

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:20.848
the mission I'm being sent
on today is so important

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.617
it's been classified
as even beyond S rank.

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:26.320
What, S rank?

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:29.056
Whoa, what kind of
mission is it anyway?

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.492
Well, you see, Boruto, I'm-

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.194
You're just strolling
around the villages

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:36.597
along the national
border with Lord Sixth?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.131
And Mr. Guy.

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:41.368
That basically just sounds
like a leisurely vacation,

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.169
if you ask me.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:44.805
Yeah, on the surface it does.

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.807
However, Lord Sixth and Mr. Guy,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.842
is personally
handling this mission.

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:51.345
There's just no way that
it's an ordinary trip.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.348
A good shinobi must be able
to read between the lines,

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.949
you see, I'm supposed to pretend

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:57.918
that all I'm doing
is accompanying them.

00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:58.986
But if something happens,

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:00.354
I have to put my
life on the line

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.589
to make sure that
Lord Sixth stays safe.

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:04.825
It's completely obvious
that this is going to be

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:07.127
an extremely difficult mission.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.329
Well, all right, if
you say so, Mirai.

00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:12.332
Anyway, just give
it your all, see ya.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.768
That kid's got no charm at all.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.270
Oh, well.

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:18.672
(rock music)

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:23.777
In just a couple of days the
entire Hidden Leaf Village,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.179
no, the whole shinobi world

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:26.613
will know of the great
achievements made by me,

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:29.917
Mirai Sarutobi who crushed
all of the foul evildoers

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.220
and managed to protect
Lord Sixth and Mr. Guy.

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:42.095
[Guy] This breeze sure is
nice, isn't it, Kakashi?

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.231
Yes, I'm really glad that
the weather turned out

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:46.200
to be so lovely today.

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:47.367
Wait, I don't get it.

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.469
How come there isn't
any tension in the air,

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:51.338
and besides, what's
with that big luggage

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.307
for just a two or
three day trip?

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.576
Isn't that way too
much to lug along?

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:58.512
What, has he forgotten
that he's a shinobi?

00:07:58.545 --> 00:07:59.713
Mirai?

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.081
What is it, Mr. Guy?

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:04.785
Answer me this, have you
forgotten that you're a shinobi?

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.086
What's that?

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:08.222
Remember, all three of
us are just supposed

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:10.090
to be ordinary
citizens on a trip,

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:12.726
so we can't make it so
obvious that we're shinobi.

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:15.696
Oh, right, pardon me.

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:18.932
(birds chirping)

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:21.268
Listen, Mirai, blending
into the masses

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.638
is a technique that
shinobi need to master.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.973
I don't think the masses

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.308
walk on their hands
so much, though.

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:30.310
Guy, don't you think
you're gonna stick out

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.079
a little too much if
you're doing that?

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:35.082
Way to go, Lord Sixth,
a wise observation.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:37.918
I stick out whatever I do.

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:39.219
[Kakashi] Bull-headed
shrike, huh?

00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:40.921
Brings back memories.

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:42.656
Yeah, about what?

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.359
Well, for one thing, do you
remember how back in the day

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:47.261
you used to do those
one-handed pushups

00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:49.062
over a large post
that had been driven

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:51.265
into the ground all the time?

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:53.534
And once your hand slipped
and you fell belly first

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.103
down onto the post
and ended up vomiting.

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:58.172
Well, now when I see
a bull-headed shrike,

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:00.641
all that I can picture
is you out of breath

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.376
and all bent over that post.

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:04.945
Listen, would you please
forget about that?

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:08.115
What kind of
conversation is this?

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:10.217
I mean, seriously,
how can they take

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.054
this beyond S rank mission
that we're on so lightly?

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:16.056
No, this is a superior technique

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:17.691
of blending into the masses.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.226
I gotta hand it to Lord Sixth,

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:21.328
he makes himself
look so absentminded,

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.597
masking his stature as
the previous Hokage.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.533
He must always be dodging
evil left and right.

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:29.770
Yes, carelessness is a
shinobi's worst enemy,

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:30.871
like this knapsack.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.073
I have to keep my hands
free at all times

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:37.344
so that I'm able to use my kunai
or shuriken at any moment.

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.381
Well, there are exceptions,

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:43.183
but anyone carrying
a large knapsack

00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:46.286
should be viewed with suspicion
as a possible shinobi.

00:09:49.523 --> 00:09:52.793
That cane, is a
sword hidden inside?

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:55.596
(birds chirping)

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:08.375
What's wrong, you have such
a scary look on your face.

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:10.244
Oh, it's nothing.

00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:12.212
Don't tell me you
suspected that old man

00:10:12.246 --> 00:10:15.048
who just passed by
of being a shinobi?

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:17.451
No way, as if, I was
just checking out

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:19.353
that grassy area over
there to make sure

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.955
that no enemies leap
out at us or anything.

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.390
Leaping enemies, huh?

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:25.592
I don't think that
usually happens here.

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:28.328
Yes, you're right, of course.

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:30.864
Your ears are all
red, they're burning.

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:32.432
No, they aren't.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:37.104
I gotta calm down, this
journey's just getting started.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.505
If I wear myself out too early,

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:41.208
I won't be any good on
this beyond S rank mission.

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:44.044
You do know where the
sacred place is, right?

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:46.680
Yeah, don't worry, I
double checked everything.

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:49.316
Sacred place, sacred place?

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:51.952
Like a hallowed divine location?

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.587
I knew there was
something big going on.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.722
Maybe a secret code,
it's starting to smell

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:58.525
like a beyond S rank mission.

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:01.728
(eagle screaming)

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:02.930
Is that it?

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.164
It is.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:07.134
Sacred place, let's go.

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:10.537
(joyful music)

00:11:11.572 --> 00:11:14.007
(grunting)

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.647
We've reached a draw again.

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.583
Well, then let's try once more.

00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.053
What do you expect
with a rubber kunai?

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:28.322
Well, it was a nice
challenge between friends.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:31.959
All right, let's try
again at the next stand.

00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:32.960
-Sure.
-Wait,

00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:34.228
you're gonna do it again?

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:36.363
Shouldn't we go to
the sacred place?

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.566
-Hold on.
-Oh, my arm.

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:41.768
These guys are always around

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.504
in touristy places like this.

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:44.705
A pickpocket?

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:48.008
Hey, Mirai, can you go and
call a security guard for us?

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:50.544
There you go.

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:53.480
Oh, come on.

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:56.550
Dummies.

00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:57.584
Hold it.

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.587
Hey, stop.

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:04.558
Tree bind death.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.194
What, what is this?

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:10.330
Let me go.

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:14.034
Stop, stop it.

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:22.042
[Woman] Yeah, can I have.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.178
I hate to say it,
but I've gotten old,

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:25.646
back when I was still young,

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:29.783
I was able to punch 100, no,
make that 200 pickpockets

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:31.818
before they could
even grab my wallet.

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:32.986
Although to be fair, Guy,

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.254
you really shouldn't
punch someone

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:36.523
before they even
do anything wrong.

00:12:36.557 --> 00:12:37.824
Yes, that's true.

00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:39.860
(laughing)

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:41.495
Will you two knock
it off already?

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:43.697
How can you, guys,
be so careless?

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:46.967
I know it's my fault
for letting a pickpocket

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.802
get close to you, but still,

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.204
the both of you have
to be more aware

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.072
of the danger around you.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.508
First of all, merely
grabbing that guy's arm

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:56.109
was nowhere near enough.

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.778
You should have at
least broken his arm

00:12:57.811 --> 00:12:59.580
to remove the threat.

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.782
I wouldn't do something
like that out of nowhere.

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:03.083
I mean, I'm not Guy.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.586
Actually, even I
wouldn't go that far.

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.221
But, Lord Sixth, come on.

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.990
Hey, careful, Mirai, we're
supposed to be disguised.

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:11.592
So don't call me that.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:14.328
Calling him Lord Sixth is
like announcing to the world

00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:16.296
that he's the former Hokage.

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:21.101
I'm so sorry, Mr. Kakashi
and Mr. Guy too of course.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.371
Look, just hold
on, here, open it.

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.707
(rock music)

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.347
You see, they just
took my decoy wallet.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.949
This is just your decoy wallet?

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:38.785
To be well-prepared
means no worries.

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:40.821
Being earnest is
a great quality,

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.589
but still it's
important to remember

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:45.959
there are other ways besides
power to settle things.

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:48.428
Well, that's just how it is.

00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:50.497
Oh, I see.

00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:53.500
I guess I went a little
overboard back there.

00:13:53.534 --> 00:13:55.969
Yes, you're right, a
petty thief is nothing.

00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:58.906
Not compared to a mission
even higher than S rank.

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:00.340
Right, Mr. Kakashi?

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:03.010
Mr. Kakashi?

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.713
There it is, there's no mistake.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.049
Wait, there's what?

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:17.291
We've reached it,
the tree in question,

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:22.095
we finally found
the sacred place.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.537
(birds chirping)

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:34.074
This is really it,
the sacred place?

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.542
Yeah, seems so.

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:37.377
Since it's sacred,

00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:39.546
that means it must be
extremely important.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.848
Isn't that correct?

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.850
Yes, extremely important.

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:44.852
-Guy.
-Right.

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:47.788
-Mirai.
-Yes.

00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:49.857
I'm standing on it right now.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.124
I'm atop the sacred place

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:55.729
that's the site of
"Make-out Paradise".

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:57.731
What now, make-out what?

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.067
It's called "Make-out Paradise".

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.569
Kakashi's favorite book
since he was young.

00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:03.937
This is the very location

00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:06.840
where the movie
adaptation was filmed.

00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:08.909
It's what now exactly?

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:12.346
This is bad, I have absolutely
no idea what's going on here.

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:15.048
My long-cherish dream has
been realized at last.

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:18.318
You've wanted to come here
for so so long, Kakashi.

00:15:18.352 --> 00:15:21.121
For a grown man to become
as emotional as this,

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:24.091
that must be one
magnificent book.

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:26.793
So then this "Make-out
Paradise" book,

00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:28.562
what's it all about anyway?

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.500
You wanna know what
it's about, huh?

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.337
I can't, no, I
just can't say it.

00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:38.972
If it's as famous as you say,

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.108
then I'd really
like to read it too.

00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:44.344
-No, it's too soon for you.
-No, it's too soon for you.

00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:47.581
You saying that just makes me
even more curious about it.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.216
Very well, then read this book.

00:15:49.249 --> 00:15:50.851
It's called "Leap-out Youth",

00:15:50.884 --> 00:15:54.221
24 hours of hotblooded
exercises edited by me.

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:56.190
And there's a companion video

00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:59.259
that lets you exercise
with me for 24 hours.

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:02.629
24 hours of exercise,
that's not even possible.

00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:07.000
Don't be shy, let's all
take a commemorative photo.

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:10.437
[Kakashi] "Make-out Paradise".

00:16:11.605 --> 00:16:13.640
And here I thought the
whole sacred place thing

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:16.510
was somehow related to the
mission we were sent on.

00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:19.646
You think we can refocus
and get back to that now?

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.915
Why don't we spend
tonight here in the town?

00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:23.917
It's starting to
get rather late.

00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:25.219
Yes, I agree.

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.654
We should take a nice,
hot soak somewhere.

00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:30.090
We are on vacation after all.

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:32.793
Huh, on vacation?

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.329
I have to say, you
have it rough, Kakashi.

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:38.632
Unless it's for some kind of
mission, on paper at least,

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.701
you aren't really allowed
to leave the village

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:42.369
like this at all.

00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:45.305
So you mean the whole
purpose of this trip

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:48.008
was to just go on
vacation, really?

00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:52.613
But isn't there a mission
that's beyond S rank?

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:56.183
What, sorry, but there's
no such thing as that.

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:58.785
I thought it was strange
you being so pumped up.

00:16:58.819 --> 00:17:00.020
What?

00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:04.224
(playful music)

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.498
Guard duty, nothing unusual.

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:14.701
It's so cold.

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:17.304
Maybe a holiday for them, but
a mission's still a mission.

00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:22.075
I'll do this, you know,
tempura, that must be nice.

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:25.312
Hey, he's stole one.

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:28.081
Come on, acting like
a kid at his age.

00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:30.417
And Mr. Kakashi
didn't even notice it.

00:17:31.285 --> 00:17:32.286
Huh?

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:36.356
Where did he go?

00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:39.560
You're gonna catch a cold.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.965
It's really very hard
to enjoy my dinner

00:17:44.998 --> 00:17:47.201
while you're out here
doing this, you know?

00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:48.969
But you didn't even notice

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:51.205
when Mr. Guy stole your tempura.

00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:54.942
Tempura, oh, that, I've never
really been a fan of it.

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:57.444
So Guy always just
eats it for me.

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.378
Even though at his age

00:17:58.412 --> 00:18:00.781
he's always complaining
about indigestion.

00:18:00.814 --> 00:18:02.783
He's nice to help,
though, isn't he?

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:04.918
Oh, really, is that so?

00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:07.187
Look, why don't you quit
chomping on food pills

00:18:07.221 --> 00:18:09.623
and come inside, join us.

00:18:09.656 --> 00:18:11.959
No, thank you, but I
just couldn't do that.

00:18:11.992 --> 00:18:13.627
I'm only an attendant.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.931
Well, I'm just like a kid
acting so proud, terrible.

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:20.067
Besides, if I don't
eat food pills

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.335
and act like I'm
on a real mission,

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:24.304
then I wouldn't know
what I'm doing here.

00:18:24.338 --> 00:18:26.807
At least go warm up
in the hot springs.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.709
Aren't you getting
cold out here?

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:30.811
This is part of my mission, so.

00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:32.312
You know, Mirai, it's funny,

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:35.249
watching you reminds me of
Asuma when he was young.

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:36.984
The awkwardness that
you seem to be feeling

00:18:37.017 --> 00:18:38.685
is just so like him.

00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:42.222
Has anyone told you that?

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.592
A lot of people have told
me about my father before,

00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:48.996
but to be honest, it really
hasn't hit home for me.

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:50.430
He may be my father,

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:53.500
but everybody else knows so
much more about him than I do.

00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.803
Do you really
think I'm like him?

00:18:56.837 --> 00:18:59.806
You're exactly like
him in so many ways.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.508
The way you put on a tough front

00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:04.211
and the stubborn
sharpness you have.

00:19:04.244 --> 00:19:06.280
So my father was sharp?

00:19:07.214 --> 00:19:08.815
He had the eyes of
a carnivorous beast

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:10.250
that's hunting prey.

00:19:10.284 --> 00:19:13.453
I mean, he sure didn't look
like someone on a vacation.

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:16.123
I see, and not
winning any prizes

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:18.392
at the target game
and all of that stuff,

00:19:18.425 --> 00:19:22.129
was it merely part of the
plan to fool ordinary people?

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:24.865
No way, it was all
completely for real.

00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:26.333
Huh?

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.202
Guy thought that if
we won you a prize,

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:31.438
then just maybe you might
begin to loosen up a little,

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:35.642
but then that Kurama toy
was impossible to get.

00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:38.178
I think that I understand.

00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:41.248
I guess that you're
just too much for me.

00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:44.518
But you know, lately
I've been thinking about

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.855
how my generation can't ever
truly be like yours was,

00:19:47.888 --> 00:19:49.723
Mr. Kakashi.

00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:51.325
What do you mean?

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.627
The types of enemies that
we encounter these days

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.731
are armed bandits, or at
most degenerate shinobi,

00:19:57.764 --> 00:19:58.832
there's just no way

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.334
that catching petty
bad guys like that

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:03.670
is going to allow us to surpass
the previous generation.

00:20:04.838 --> 00:20:06.306
Huh?

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.376
I mean, I know that being
at peace is a good thing.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:11.712
It's just in an age
of peace like this

00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:15.115
I wonder what point continuing
to be a shinobi serves.

00:20:15.148 --> 00:20:16.383
I see, so that's why

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:19.019
you were so enthusiastic
this afternoon.

00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:23.323
You were hoping this mission
would let you leave your mark

00:20:23.357 --> 00:20:25.959
and win some
recognition, weren't you?

00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:27.995
That sounds about right.

00:20:28.028 --> 00:20:30.264
I'm sure that my father
never stressed out

00:20:30.297 --> 00:20:33.934
over something as
trivial as all of this.

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:36.069
I think that if Asuma
could see you now,

00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:37.604
he'd be very proud.

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:40.941
Thank you, even if
you're just consoling me.

00:20:40.974 --> 00:20:43.110
I'm going to take
a long, hot soak

00:20:43.143 --> 00:20:45.245
and then I'll
complete this mission.

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:47.447
That sounds like a great idea.

00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:49.049
Although, I really
have to tell you,

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:51.218
now I'm beginning
to have some regrets

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.719
that this is all
going to be over

00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:54.321
in just a couple of days.

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:57.691
Oh, well, I believe
that I told them

00:20:57.724 --> 00:21:00.093
this mission would take 20 days.

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:04.831
Is it possible that
when we said 20 days,

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:06.667
you misheard it as two days?

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.435
I got it all wrong.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.305
Yeah, I thought as much.

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.373
No, the thing is the number two

00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:16.210
just kept sticking in my brain
with all the running around

00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:18.111
and packing, and praying at
my dad's altar and stuff,

00:21:18.145 --> 00:21:21.648
20 days somehow turned
into two days in my mind.

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:22.916
What am I gonna do?

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.318
I only brought
clothes for two days.

00:21:24.351 --> 00:21:26.453
What am I gonna do,
what am I gonna do?

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:27.855
-This is just awful.
-Yeah, I wondered

00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:30.324
why you brought such
a small backpack.

00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:31.358
You know what?

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:33.227
For now I'm just
gonna take a bath.

00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:37.030
(rock music)

00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:42.936
You're really quite an
unlucky girl, aren't you?

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.073
It's just, no, I'm
normally not like this.

00:21:46.106 --> 00:21:47.508
Look, we'll be
crossing the border

00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:50.244
between nations tomorrow and
entering the land of steam.

00:21:50.277 --> 00:21:52.579
Just bear with it
till then, okay?

00:21:52.613 --> 00:21:53.680
Good night, Mirai.

00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:02.022
the land of steam,

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.226
the land where my
father's killer was born.

00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:15.736

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.057
(rock music)

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:45.492
Everyone in the hot
springs district

00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:47.828
is wearing either a
cat or a dog mask,

00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:49.596
I wonder what kind
of festival this is.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.798
[Kakashi] This is the
dog and cat festival

00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:53.166
or the cat and dog festival.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.069
It's a day when cat lovers
and dog lovers fight it out.

00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:58.138
[Mirai] What, Mr.
Kiba's here too?

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:02.109
Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations.

00:24:02.142 --> 00:24:05.112
The steam ninja scrolls,
the dog and cat war.

00:24:05.145 --> 00:24:07.314
Kiba and his girlfriend
are fighting.

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:15.556
