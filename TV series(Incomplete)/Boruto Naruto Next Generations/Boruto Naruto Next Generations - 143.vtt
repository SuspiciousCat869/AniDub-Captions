WEBVTT

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.609
(guards grunting)

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:12.212
It seems a worker in the medical
ward lost his wooden tag.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:13.614
Hey, so you don't think

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:16.283
this is gonna turn into
some big lock-down, do you?

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.684
[Mitsuki] He said the wooden tag

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.453
went missing three days ago.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.788
And shortly after that,
Kokuri was attacked

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:24.057
by a man in a prison jumpsuit.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.059
This isn't a coincidence.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:28.495
I get it. So the guy who
attacked Kokuri could've

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.731
been the one who stole
the wooden tag?

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.067
(alarm blaring)

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:37.271
(guards chattering)

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:43.944
Lock it all down!

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.345
Close off every cell block,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.347
and we'll search them
for the wooden tag!

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.684
No prisoner will be allowed
out until it's located!

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.321
(alarm blaring)

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:04.097
Aw man, say goodbye to
even the little time

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.099
we had left to spend
outside our cell.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.769
Ah, you've gotta be kidding me.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.139
(quivering) Boruto!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.809
Hey! I need to
confirm something.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.211
Sorry, but I'm
gonna need to check

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.946
through your belongings now.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.347
[Arai] Huh?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.449
[Kamata] What are
you talking about?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.421
It's simple. Someone in
here has the wooden tag.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.689
[Both] Huh?

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:29.923
(Kokuri gasps)

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.325
Yesterday, in the morning,

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:33.227
Kokuri was attacked
in the medical ward

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.462
by someone wearing
an inmate's uniform.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.931
Yeah? So what's that
gotta do with us?

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:40.434
Just hold on and
listen until we finish.

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:44.438
Just now, that guard
said a staff member

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.341
reported their wooden tag
missing three days ago.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:50.077
It might be that the
perp who took the tag

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.446
is the same person
who attacked Kokuri.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.781
You're saying that the
one who attacked me

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:56.750
is the same guy
who stole the tag?

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:01.054
No way. Is it even possible
to steal a wooden tag?

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:02.422
[Mitsuki] I think it is.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.924
[Both] Huh?

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:07.060
Remember, three days
ago Boruto collapsed,

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.530
and medical ward
staff came for him.

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:10.564
It occurred then.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.135
[Arai] Could be
true, but if so...

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:17.337
Back when that happened,

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.574
all the cells were
shut, except ours.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.544
All the other prisoners
were in their cells.

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.078
In other words,

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:27.781
the person who stole the
tag and attacked Kokuri

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.183
is in this cell.

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:34.054
(opening theme music)

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:38.725
(vocalists singing
in Japanese)

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:05.679
(opening theme music)

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:15.989
(intense music)

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.360
(gasps) Hey! Don't say
stuff like that, Boruto!

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:22.496
Listen, don't worry.
Calm yourself down.

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.998
Leave everything to me and
Mitsuki. We'll handle it.

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.366
Yeah, I don't like this.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.501
(both gasping)

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:30.404
It sounds like you're
accusing me of being the perp.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.407
But what reason is
there for suspecting me?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.212
Well, we don't know who's
associated with Tsukiyo, so.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:39.413
Tsukiyo?

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.015
Do you mean the guy who's
in solitary confinement?

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:43.417
That's right.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.954
Tsukiyo of the Mujina Gang
is targeting Kokuri's life.

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:48.755
So you're telling
us that this guy

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.226
was more involved with Tsukiyo
than we first believed?

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.461
Yes, Tsukiyo's confined,

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.230
and since he can't
take direct action,

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:58.165
that might be why
he's targeting Kokuri

00:04:58.198 --> 00:04:59.666
through an accomplice.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.968
Hold on a minute, here!

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.870
Even if what you're
saying really is true,

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.405
why would we be the only
suspects in this cell?

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.274
I mean, where's the proof
that you aren't actually

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.942
the ones working for Tsukiyo?

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.278
No way, Boruto
can't be the perp,

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.281
because he came to this
place just to protect me!

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.582
He what?

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.287
How exactly do you
two know each other?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.756
We're just friends, that's all!

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:23.957
[Kamata] Friends?

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.559
That's right!
They're my friends!

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:28.095
And when they found out that
Tsukiyo was targeting me,

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:31.231
they decided to, you
know, come protect me.

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:33.901
I never heard about all that.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.136
That's just because
I never told you.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.539
(sighs) So that's
how it is, huh?

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:41.508
You two guys seriously put
yourselves in that much danger

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:44.044
just to be in the same
cell as your friend?

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.946
(scoffs) Hearing it out
of the blue like that

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.948
sure makes it hard to believe.

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:51.218
No, I believe that
Boruto's telling the truth.

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:54.021
He already risked his
life for Kokuri's sake.

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:55.889
That's more than enough proof.

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:57.224
(Kamata scoffs)

00:05:57.257 --> 00:06:00.027
All right, I believe
you, Boruto! 'Kay?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.362
(Kamata scoffs)

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:04.164
Thank you.

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:05.933
-(cell door thuds)
-(Kokuri yelps)

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:07.234
We're starting the search!

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.203
If you're caught
with the wooden tag,

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.605
your cellmates will be
considered accomplices.

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.041
Everyone in that cell
will be sent to solitary,

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.943
not just the one responsible,

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:18.478
and all their sentences
will be extended!

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:22.049
So if you don't want that to
happen, then turn in the perp!

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:25.152
Start with Building One!

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.386
-Right!
-Yes sir!

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:34.394
[Prisoner] Come on, man!

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:36.096
Tell you what, there's no way

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.598
I'm going to
solitary confinement.

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:40.334
Seriously, that will mean
even less time out of a cell.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.203
My time in this
prison's almost up, too.

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:46.139
I'm not gonna get my
sentence extended.

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.141
[Kokuri] If I'm
sent to solitary,

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:50.577
it's definitely
gonna be over for me.

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:52.546
[Mitsuki] We'd better
do something quick.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.948
[Boruto] Yeah, I think we
need to settle this soon

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.017
before things get worse.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.820
All right, I'll cooperate.

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.189
(scoffs) Guess I have no choice.

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.226
You're going to go
question Tsukiyo?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.795
Then I'm assigning a
guard to go with you.

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:10.364
There's no telling
what he's thinking

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.799
or just what he's
capable of doing.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:16.069
Is he seriously that dangerous?

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:17.905
Normally, when we have members

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.174
of notorious organizations here,

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:22.075
especially like the Mujina Gang,

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:25.279
they're kept separate to
prevent collaboration.

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:28.282
If I'd known about
Kokuri, too, then...

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:29.950
You really couldn't help it.

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:32.486
Even Kokuri himself tried
very hard to make sure

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.354
that any ties he had
to the Mujina Gang

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:36.790
were kept a secret, after all.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.158
That is true.

00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:40.561
In any case, you must be on
your guard with that man.

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.030
Right.

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:44.898
[Arai] Kokuri, you
really didn't see

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.601
the face of the guy
who attacked you?

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.669
No.

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:49.937
I had my back to the doorway,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.139
and it all happened so quickly.

00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:53.974
-You either?
-Yeah.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:55.876
I heard a noise and
ran to Kokuri's room,

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.277
and the doctor and
guards followed me,

00:07:57.311 --> 00:08:00.414
but by the time we got
there, the attacker was gone.

00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:03.884
(snickers) Oh,
man, what an idiot.

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.052
Everything was in place,

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:07.221
but he still wasn't
able to kill his target.

00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:10.090
Kamata, are you the
one behind this?

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:11.491
What? No way!

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:15.295
I'm only saying I wouldn't have
messed up as bad as he did.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:16.797
Anyway, we'd better hurry

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.699
before Benga and
the others get here.

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:24.905
[Kokuri] This is bad.

00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:26.073
Hey, listen!

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:27.941
Don't forget that all of
this is only happening

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.343
because of you, buddy!

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:30.611
(yelps) Sorry!

00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:34.181
And why exactly is this
Tsukiyo guy after you, anyway?

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:36.350
I mean, if he wants
you dead this bad,

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:37.951
you must've done
something terrible.

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:40.020
Uh, well...

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:42.256
I'd keep my mouth
shut, if I were you.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.625
This guy's weak,
but he's conniving,

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:47.761
and he'll jump at anything
that might make him a profit.

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:49.029
If you let a secret slip,

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:50.964
who knows how he'll
end up using it.

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:52.099
What?

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:54.234
Huh? That's it, you're dead!

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:56.503
Then try it, if
you think you can.

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.307
You're all bark and no bite.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.277
You can't fight at all, you
just bluff all the time.

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:07.814
He sure doesn't seem like he
could really be an assassin.

00:09:07.848 --> 00:09:09.016
Nah.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.784
Guys like him only get gutsy

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:13.187
when they already
have the advantage.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.689
But even so, they'll
stab someone in the back

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.890
without even thinking.

00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:18.192
(Kokuri gasps)

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:21.495
Hey man, you better
watch yourself.

00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:24.898
Anyway, let's just check
out everyone's belongings.

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.500
The guards will be here soon.

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.202
You're right.

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.937
Do whatever you want.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.539
And yours, too, Kedama.

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:37.811
Be careful with him.

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.413
He may look like he
doesn't really care,

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:41.748
but he's a coward
who'll betray you

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.750
when you least expect it.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:45.285
Okay, got it.

00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:48.956
All right, I'm going to
check out all the bunks now.

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:50.891
They're just about
the only place

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.726
where someone could hide things.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.263
Fine. You can search mine
to your heart's content.

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.269
Now, hold on! Don't
be ridiculous!

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:04.471
You want me to let
you search my bunk?

00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:05.739
What's your problem now?

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.009
Didn't you literally just say
we could do whatever we want?

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:11.345
Yeah, but I mean, this
is different, okay?

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:13.780
Honestly, there's just no way
that I'm I gonna let anybody

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:15.215
rifle through the
place where I sleep.

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:17.651
[Boruto] Come on! This
is what's ridiculous.

00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:19.152
It's just gonna be a quick look!

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:20.687
No way, forget it!

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:23.223
Why are you so
against this idea?

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:24.892
You got something
hidden in that bed

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:26.627
you don't want us to see?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.295
Why are you eyeing me, man?

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:29.496
With the way you're acting,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.665
it just makes sense
to suspect you.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.938
Oh yeah, you always go talk
to Haie the guard, don't you?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.206
What's that?

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.542
That doesn't have anything
to do with this stuff.

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:44.878
I don't know, maybe it
does and maybe it doesn't.

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:47.281
I mean, you could be
contacting Tsukiyo

00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.183
through Haie, couldn't you?

00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:52.953
Hey! Quit all this grasping
at straws, you country thief!

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.087
What's that?

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:55.355
You heard me.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:57.291
You bragged about
being the lone wolf

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:59.226
in that little
village you came from,

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:01.228
but you got arrested
nearly the instant

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.530
you went into a Great Nation.

00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:04.565
Why you.

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.501
(chuckles) Oh, that's right.

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:09.603
I remember yesterday
during rec time

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:13.073
seeing you heading for the
medical ward, isn't that right?

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:14.675
I was watching you, you know.

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:18.011
You kept looking around
to see if anyone saw you.

00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:20.480
(snickers) Did the country thief

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:22.282
who was pretending
to be a lone wolf

00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:24.751
become Tsukiyo's lap dog?

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.653
That's enough. Now shut up!

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:30.324
So, what's the real story?

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.693
[Arai] I was just
going to the cafeteria.

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:34.161
The medical ward is past it

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.663
in the same
direction, that's all.

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.899
Can anyone back that up?

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:41.768
(snickers) No, of course not!

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.470
I mean, we're in Hozuki Castle.

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.639
There's not a single
person in this prison

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:47.007
that you can trust.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.676
Which means we can't
trust what you say either,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.178
isn't that right, Mr. Kamata?

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.213
Huh? Hey, knock it off!

00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:54.781
Quit trying to trip me up!

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:56.083
(Kokuri gasps)

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.285
There's someone you can ask.

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:00.153
When you saw me, I
was going to meet

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:02.322
the supplier in the cafeteria.

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:04.558
By supplier, do
you mean the person

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:07.461
who will get you things as
long as you can pay them?

00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:10.531
Yeah. You see, I
wanted something.

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.233
Oh, like what?

00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:15.569
[Kamata] (scoffs) Don't
bother, just forget about him.

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:19.006
He's got nothing. He's just
lying to try to fool us.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.607
[Arai] I'm not lying.

00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:23.544
[Kamata] Yeah? Then tell
us the truth, already.

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:25.512
It was...

00:12:25.546 --> 00:12:26.547
It was what?

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.517
(sighs) Chocolates.
It was chocolates.

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:31.952
[Group] Chocolates?

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:34.254
I've got a bad
sweet tooth, okay?

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:37.991
So once in a while, I ask him
to bring in chocolates for me.

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:40.294
See? Here's one of them.

00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:43.497
An actual chocolate!

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.765
[Arai] You want some?

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:46.033
You mean it?

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:48.335
Those things could be
poisoned for all we know.

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:49.269
Huh?

00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:51.972
Give me a break. There's
nothing bad in it.

00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.610
Anyway, you can just ask
the supplier about it.

00:12:56.643 --> 00:12:59.813
He can vouch for me and
prove that I'm innocent.

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:01.181
The supplier, huh?

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.685
I guess, in a way, he's
the person inside here

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:06.587
that we can trust the most.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.623
But we'd still have
to prove what you say.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:12.759
Why would you hide something
like chocolates, anyway?

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:15.696
It's kind of embarrassing
to love sweets so much.

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:17.164
I'm a grown-up and all.

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:19.967
Come on, why are you
putting up a front?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.034
[Arai] Shut up!

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:22.936
(Boruto laughing)

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:23.937
They're close.

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:26.540
-Huh?
-(Kamata gasps)

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.311
Next cell!

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:36.049
Not good. Benga and the
guards will be here soon.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:43.056
Yeah, we don't have
very much time left.

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.299
Well, I sure am lucky

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:56.036
to have such an upstanding
lady like you come to visit me.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.005
Your name's Tsukiyo, right?

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:00.641
Second in command
of the Mujina Gang?

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.609
(chuckles) I'm quite honored

00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:04.178
that a nice young lady like you

00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:07.414
would know the name
of somebody like me.

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:09.850
So anyway, would you mind
telling me about yourself

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:11.018
and the Mujina Gang?

00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:14.021
I would imagine that
in your position,

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:17.024
you wouldn't need to ask
me anything at this point.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:22.396
Instead, I'd like it if
you told me about yourself.

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:24.298
For example, why
did you come here,

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:27.000
all the while just
pretending to be a reporter?

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:34.007
[Sarada] Who is this guy?

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.476
[Benga] Okay, next!

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.711
[Guards] Sir!

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:41.481
There's no time! Look, I
showed you where I sleep.

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:42.382
You're next!

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:44.051
No, there's no way
that I'm letting you

00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:45.786
check through my bunk, okay?

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:48.121
Are you seriously
still stuck on that?

00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:50.257
Don't you want all
this to be over quickly

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.326
so you can go and
enjoy your free time?

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:54.761
This and that are
completely different things!

00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:56.330
I just don't get this at all.

00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:58.599
You know, when you're up there,

00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:01.134
it always looks like you're
up to something sneaky.

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:03.570
(gasps) It's, uh,
none of your business!

00:15:03.604 --> 00:15:05.372
Something's shady about you.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.541
I'm gonna take a
look at your bed.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.311
Well, all right, then,
I'm gonna go check it out.

00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:15.616
I wouldn't do that.

00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:16.650
Huh?

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.120
That bunk belongs to Kedama.

00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:21.989
Although it doesn't matter,

00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:24.024
since we'll need to
check it as well.

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:26.627
Oh, is this yours? I'm sorry.

00:15:27.828 --> 00:15:29.630
Don't touch my things.

00:15:29.663 --> 00:15:30.664
Ow!

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.166
Hey, what are you doing?

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.970
I never said that I'd
cooperate with this.

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:38.205
Wait, what?

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:49.316
(momentous music)

00:15:49.349 --> 00:15:50.350
But how?

00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:53.487
That's the!

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.022
He's the assassin!

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:56.423
[Boruto] Kokuri, come here!

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.464
It seems that you haven't
changed, after all.

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:06.667
You're still nothing
but a coward.

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:10.871
At one time, he
commanded the respect

00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:13.841
of all the other inmates
inside this prison.

00:16:13.874 --> 00:16:15.275
He did?

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:18.111
Yeah. But actually, he was
working with the guards,

00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:19.780
spying on the other prisoners.

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:22.716
He even ratted out a friend
who was trying to escape.

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:24.718
He's the worst kind of scum!

00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:26.353
So you're the one, huh?

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:28.989
Guess you're not gonna bother

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:31.391
to ask me for my
side of the story.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:35.429
'Course not. It isn't as
if we could trust you!

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:39.132
I understand that you
five can't trust me,

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:43.170
but I simply don't take
orders from anyone.

00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:46.106
Of course, I don't
expect you to believe me.

00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:50.043
Well, it's too soon to decide.

00:16:50.077 --> 00:16:52.446
I believe we should
hear him out.

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:53.647
You're right.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.850
Okay, go ahead, Kedama, tell
us what you were gonna say.

00:16:56.884 --> 00:16:59.987
Come on! We can't listen
to a word he says!

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.288
Look, it's okay.

00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:02.556
With the way that
things are right now,

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:04.858
he's not gonna be
able to deceive us.

00:17:04.892 --> 00:17:06.660
I said no!

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.695
Hey, what's gotten into you?

00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:11.665
It's just, you guys don't
know anything about him,

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.534
that's why you can say that.

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:16.103
But you can't be too
careful with him!

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:18.839
Ah, whatever. Just
hurry it up, would ya?

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.507
We're running out of time.

00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:23.377
I say we turn him in to the
guards and be done with it.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.413
Yeah, I'm gonna
call the guards in.

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:31.051
But I'm actually interested
in what he has to say too.

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:34.188
After all, it's possible
that he might very well know

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.990
something significant
about the Mujina Gang.

00:17:37.024 --> 00:17:38.158
[Arai] The Mujina Gang?

00:17:38.192 --> 00:17:40.294
Why would you want to
ask him about that?

00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:43.063
You probably know a lot more.

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:45.065
Huh? Well, um...

00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:46.533
Just a minute.

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.769
How would you know
that Kokuri would have

00:17:48.802 --> 00:17:50.838
any knowledge of
the Mujina Gang?

00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:53.006
Why? What's the big mystery?

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.843
I mean, he's a member
of the Mujina Gang, too.

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:57.511
Isn't it obvious?

00:17:57.544 --> 00:18:00.013
That's just it,
nobody said anything

00:18:00.047 --> 00:18:02.916
about Kokuri being a
member of the Mujina Gang.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.451
Ah!

00:18:04.484 --> 00:18:07.354
Seriously? He's part
of the Mujina Gang?

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:12.092
Kokuri has kept almost
everything about his past a

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:16.530
secret and yet, you knew
his true identity,

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:20.501
which means that you knew
everything about him before now.

00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:21.869
(momentous music)

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:23.971
All right, what's
going on, Arai?

00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:26.507
And in fact, you were the one

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.276
controlling the
conversation from the start.

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:33.046
Did you do that so you could
distract us from the truth?

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.882
No, that's not it!

00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:36.583
Hold on a minute.

00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:37.784
What about the wooden tag

00:18:37.818 --> 00:18:40.020
that we found inside
Kedama's bedding?

00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:42.456
Maybe when Arai pulled
his blanket down,

00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:45.025
the wooden tag was
wrapped up inside it.

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:47.661
You know, actually, now
that you come to mention it,

00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:51.331
he kept holding on to the
blanket after he grabbed it.

00:18:51.365 --> 00:18:52.499
That's right.

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:55.836
And then he slipped the
wooden tag into Kedama's bunk

00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:58.338
while we had our
attention elsewhere.

00:18:59.072 --> 00:19:02.075
(dramatic music)

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:09.550
Arai, that's not true, right?

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:13.287
You're the one I need!

00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:24.298
It does appear that you
thought all this through,

00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:26.366
but you were too overconfident.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:36.443
You let Tsukiyo control you
like some kind of puppet?

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:39.980
Now you've got some serious
punishment waiting for you.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.115
Better be prepared.

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:43.917
[Mitsuki] So, it's
settled, right?

00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.152
Hmm?

00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:49.122
End the lock-down!

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.227
(alarm blaring)

00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:55.796
Thank you.

00:19:55.829 --> 00:20:00.767
Also, keep a close watch on
Tsukiyo in solitary confinement.

00:20:01.535 --> 00:20:03.136
Don't be so smug, kid.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.143
[Mitsuki] Thank you for earlier.

00:20:10.177 --> 00:20:12.613
Why did you decide to
hear me out, anyway?

00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:14.715
You looked hesitant,

00:20:14.748 --> 00:20:17.484
and I just thought that there
was something behind that.

00:20:18.752 --> 00:20:19.753
I see.

00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:24.391
Imagine you, a member
of the Mujina Gang.

00:20:25.292 --> 00:20:27.528
I guess that looks
really can be deceiving!

00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:29.930
Oh, uh, no, I'm just...

00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:33.133
Hey, so you got hidden
treasure or something?

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.635
No, nothing like that.

00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:37.004
Come on! Don't keep it a secret.

00:20:37.037 --> 00:20:38.438
-Hmm?
-(Kokuri chuckles)

00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:41.975
Never mind. We should
be friends from now on.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.977
If you find something
that might turn a profit,

00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:45.846
let me in on it.

00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:48.482
(bright music)

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:54.254
I read the report
that you sent to me.

00:20:54.288 --> 00:20:56.790
Make sure this kind of
thing doesn't recur.

00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.025
Sir!

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:00.160
And also-

00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:01.528
[Mujo] What is it?

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:04.064
Well, do you happen
to know anything

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:06.266
about that Boruto
kid and Kokuri?

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.103
It appears that something
may be going on between them.

00:21:10.137 --> 00:21:11.238
They must've been acquainted

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.207
back in the past or something.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.775
I admit I'm not too keen

00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:17.077
on prisoners becoming
close friends,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.980
but at the same time, if you
push the prisoners too hard,

00:21:20.013 --> 00:21:22.583
then they just might
end up retaliating.

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:23.517
Yes, but!

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.086
There are foul rumors
about you, too.

00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:30.591
I'm sure you know this, but
try not to be suspicious

00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:33.160
of the prisoners when
there's no reason to.

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:36.396
Sir!

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.766
Damn it. What the hell
is going on here, anyway?

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.309
I'm shocked Arai
was the assassin.

00:21:49.343 --> 00:21:51.678
I guess looks really
can be deceiving.

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:57.584
Kokuri, too.

00:21:57.618 --> 00:21:59.152
Despite how he seems, he ran off

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:01.622
with the gang's
money and hid it.

00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:02.789
That's true.

00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:05.626
Even after all this time,
there's still quite a few things

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:07.027
we don't know about him.

00:22:13.634 --> 00:22:18.605
(closing theme music)

00:23:41.889 --> 00:23:44.258
(intense music)

00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:46.727
[Mitsuki] Hey Boruto,
Kokuri was a member

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.128
of the Mujina Gang.

00:23:48.161 --> 00:23:50.397
I think he's still
hiding something.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.465
[Boruto] Agreed.

00:23:51.498 --> 00:23:53.033
I mean, we know he's
hidden the money

00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:55.769
that he stole from the
gang, and pulled a robbery

00:23:55.802 --> 00:23:58.305
that landed him here
in Hozuki Castle.

00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:00.374
[Mitsuki] We should
just ask him flat out.

00:24:00.407 --> 00:24:03.977
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations",

00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.746
Kokuri's Secret.

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:08.148
Hey, Kokuri. Got a minute?

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:16.690
(closing theme music)
