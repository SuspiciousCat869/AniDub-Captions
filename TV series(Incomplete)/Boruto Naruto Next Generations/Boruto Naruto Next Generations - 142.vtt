WEBVTT

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:10.077
(erie music)

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.778
[Kokuri] It's true!

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.947
I really was attacked just now!

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.049
I understand, but you
were barely injured.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.351
It's only a scratch.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.053
Did you manage to get a
look at who attacked you?

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.222
He came at me so
fast that I couldn't.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:25.325
But I'm positive he was
wearing a prison jumpsuit.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.494
So the culprit's
another prisoner.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.030
That makes it even
more unbelievable.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.798
You can't get into
the medical ward

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.834
without a wooden tag like this.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.403
Naturally prisoners
can't just walk in.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.205
Yeah, but-

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.874
Maybe they got it from
someone who works here.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.644
I mean, couldn't someone have
just lost their wooden tag.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.212
No, that's unthinkable,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.314
but I'll check it
out just in case.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.184
Hey you! Why are you still here?

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.319
Get back to your
cell, you hear me?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.055
Boruto!

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.190
Can't be helped.

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.559
Don't worry, I'll
keep an eye on Kokuri.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.327
I'm counting on you doctor.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.962
(Kokuri nervously breathing)

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.931
Come on, don't look so worried!

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.166
I promise that I'm
gonna protect you!

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:12.573
(opening theme music)

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:43.330
(opening theme music)

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.338
(cell door shuts)

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.076
How were things over
in the medical ward?

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.678
The air conditioner on?

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.081
(chuckling) You were right,
it was like paradise.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:03.483
So were you able to have
nice dreams over there?

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:06.553
Yeah, it was so perfect,
but I got interrupted

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.389
and it ended up turning
into a real nightmare

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.994
Dreams aren't worth anything
in this place anyway.

00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:18.565
(whispering) Is Kokuri okay now?

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.034
[Boturo] Yeah, there's
someone watching over him

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.071
But where was that person
when Kokuri was attacked?

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:27.274
He was with me so there's
nothing to worry about.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.210
Although if the medical
ward is an unsafe place

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:32.546
for him too, then
there's no telling when

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.047
he could be attacked again.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.683
You know the cell has
room for one more inmate.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:41.255
We gotta do something to
get Kokuri in here with us.

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:43.423
Then we can protect
him all the time.

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:47.027
You're right, because
if we don't...

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.731
(thunder crackling)

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:56.637
(startled gasp)

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.473
It's Mitsuki's snake!

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.775
Sarada, the situation's
become critical,

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.277
Kokuri was attacked.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:05.512
There's something that we'd

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:07.447
like you to request
from Lord Mujo.

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:12.186
[Benga] The cell that Kokuri
is going to be assigned to?

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.655
That's right, after
his injury heals,

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.023
let's put him in with Boruto.

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:17.691
What do you think about that?

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:20.494
Although you're the one
that's coming from Lord Mujo,

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:23.964
I can't say that I agree
with this suggestion.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.566
Oh, and why is that?

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.435
Isn't there an empty
bed in that cell.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.505
That's the thing, actually,
it isn't technically empty.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:32.906
It's only being reserved

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.409
for the next prisoner
that comes in here.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.745
And as you know, new ones
are always coming in.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.147
Yes, I see.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.316
But Kokuri is leaving
the medical ward.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.052
Wouldn't it be a good idea
to place him somewhere close

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.588
to the guards so they
can keep an eye on him?

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.891
The rule is that when prisoners
get out of a medical ward

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:53.193
they're reassigned to
their original cells.

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:54.862
If we make an exception now,

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:58.098
then the other prisoners will
start making their own demands

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.667
about what cells they
want to be put in.

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.736
So Kokuri must be sent back

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.638
to his previously assigned cell.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:09.476
I do hope you'll back
me up on this decision.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.744
Yes, of course.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:11.979
Thank you, sir.

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:16.650
(Mujo painfully groaning)

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:20.888
(Benga impatiently sighing)

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:23.824
(Mujo swallowing)

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:24.825
We're done.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:25.893
You may go now.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.127
Yes, sir.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.101
[Sarada] Lord Mujo!

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:36.570
I'm sorry I couldn't help you,

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:40.073
but I am afraid I can't
make arbitrary decisions

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:43.911
regarding the prison population
without a valid reason.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.612
Please understand.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:48.148
Of course, we're grateful
for all of your help.

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.250
We'll handle the rest ourselves.

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.022
(frustrated) That bastard!

00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:56.757
He's just a figurehead
of the clan.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.660
Doesn't even know who actually
runs things in this castle?

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.661
Yes, sir.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.129
You're absolutely correct.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:06.967
This one?

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.607
[Sarada] It turns out
Benga has authority

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.810
over the prisoner
assignments not Lord Mujo.

00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:18.679
And Benga's planning
to return Kokuri

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.180
to his original cell.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:22.516
I'll check around and
look for any weak spots

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.984
that Benga might have.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.689
Well, this is turning
into a situation.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.625
[Boturo] At this rate, Kokuri
is going to be in trouble.

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:34.628
(foot slamming onto the desk)

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:37.564
(rapid swallowing)

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.770
(glass shattering)

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:46.507
(door creaking)

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.755
There must be something in here.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.023
(irritated growl)

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:05.959
I finally found
you, Mr. Benga, sir!

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.728
What do you want, Haie?!

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.296
I'm really sorry
to tell you this,

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:12.232
but he simply refused to
take no for an answer, sir.

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.267
Huh?

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.072
You've got some nerve demanding

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:22.442
that I come to see you
Tsukiyo, you know that?

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:24.711
[Tsukiyo] It's very
good of you to come.

00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:26.146
(metal clanging)

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.882
Depending on the reason, this
could end painfully for you.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.150
(gems clacking)

00:07:30.184 --> 00:07:31.552
Huh?

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:33.554
Lady Luck is very fickle.

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:36.490
If you make a loud
noise, she runs away.

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.626
But this is the sound
that brings her back.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.429
You-!, did you get those?

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.699
Those who give gifts
oftentimes profit

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:48.335
as much as those
who receive them

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.803
by way of luck.

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:51.772
Look, quit being so vague.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.074
Just what do you want from me?

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:56.877
Can you make Kokuri disappear?

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.147
That guy was born
under unlucky stars.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.649
The jewels are just
a down payment.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.420
I will forget we ever
had this conversation.

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:12.092
(snickering) How unfortunate.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.828
Seriously, how can
anyone get any work done

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:16.029
in all of this filth?

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:18.198
All I can find is trash.

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.436
(wood creaking)

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.272
(Sarada screaming)

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:27.574
(footsteps)

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:32.179
Hm?

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:36.917
(door creaking)

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.385
Must have imagined it.

00:08:46.827 --> 00:08:50.697
Everyone up, it's
afternoon rec time!

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:53.967
After being cooped up like this,

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:56.370
my body's so stiff, man.

00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:01.808
Everyone has a whole lot
of admir-, admired...

00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:03.010
(sighing) What is it again?

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.746
Is the word you're
looking for admiration?

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:06.980
Yeah!

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:10.784
What are you doing?
We finally get to go outside

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:13.353
after all this
time, Uncle Kamata.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.722
Shut up with the uncle
stuff, I'm only 16!

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:22.229
And Sarada I never contacted
us after that, did she?

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:25.065
Well, we can't just rely
on Sarada for everything.

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:26.834
There are so many people here.

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.001
If we ask around,

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:30.070
we'll find someone who
knows Benga's weakness.

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:32.005
Should we split up?

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.174
Okay, I'll go this way.

00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:38.178
I see

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.716
(grass rustling)

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:48.155
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.061
(prisoners cheering)
Do it! Yeah!

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.763
(prisoners grunting)

00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:58.232
It's so nice to be out.

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.400
Don't you want to
walk around a bit?

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:14.014
(prisoner grunting angrily)

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:22.155
Are you protecting the flowers?

00:10:27.261 --> 00:10:29.429
I got nothing.
No matter who I asked,

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.232
no one knew anything
about Benga's weaknesses.

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:33.634
I had no luck either.

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:36.203
Wait, Benga's weakness?

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:38.539
Why would you want to
know something like that?

00:10:38.572 --> 00:10:39.406
Why else?

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:41.175
Because that guy
punched me one time

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:44.344
and now I want to get back
at him for that, you know?

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:46.580
Well, absolutely nobody
in this place is going to

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:49.917
have anything nice to say
about that guy that's for sure.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.085
All right. Tell you
what I'll help you out.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.788
Don't tell me you know
something about Benga.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.291
Nope, not a thing.

00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:00.294
But still, I have an
idea of who might.

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.328
Hmm?

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.502
Shot caller?

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:12.272
Yeah, In other words, the
boss of this whole place.

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:15.843
Aside from the guards,
he's the top guy in here.

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:19.847
Doragu carries more weight here
than just about anyone else.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.248
Doragu the man, huh?

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.183
Uh, But why do we have to

00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:26.053
go to him to learn
Benga's weakness?

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.154
Wherever there's power,

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.922
you'll also find information.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.524
There's practically
nothing that goes on

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:33.293
in this castle that
Doragu doesn't know about.

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:37.297
Well, here we are.

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:47.174
Alright. So where can
we find this Doragu guy?

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.976
[Doragu] Well, what
do we have here?

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:51.678
Looks like we've got some
nice little visitors.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.915
Really, that's him?

00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:56.049
I said, you'd better.

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:58.185
Show him a little more respect.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.020
[Doragu] What do you guys need?

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.288
You came here because there's

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:03.323
something you want
to know, right?

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.192
Yeah. Tell me what
Benga's weakness is.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.928
I owe him some payback
for what he did to me.

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.364
Benga's weakness, huh?

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:14.434
(laughing) You're too funny kid.

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:17.971
I was just thinking I've been
getting sick of that guy too.

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:19.173
You mean-?

00:12:19.206 --> 00:12:19.973
Hold it.

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:22.509
Around here information is gold.

00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:24.111
Even if you're just a kid,

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:26.046
I can't give it to you for free.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.048
So what do you want from me?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.583
Now let's see.

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:32.786
Maybe we ought to have
a test of willpower.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.421
A test of willpower?

00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:38.725
You see that
lighthouse over there.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:42.529
The light that shines from it
every night is so irritating.

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:45.065
It makes it so I can
hardly sleep a wink.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:48.769
So, what I want is for you
to bring me the light bulb

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:50.838
What? Seriously, is that all?

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:51.839
You idiot!

00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:53.340
Lots of guys tried before-

00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:54.708
Hey, you.

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:56.109
If the kid's willing to try

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.979
then let him, don't
go discouraging him.

00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:03.317
So what'll it be kid.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.053
You're going to do
it or aren't you?

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:07.054
What do you think?

00:13:07.087 --> 00:13:08.522
Of course I'll do it.

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.193
It does look

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:14.995
like security is pretty
tight over there though.

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:16.263
[Doragu] The lighthouse
is surrounded

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.233
by barbed wire covered
in paper bombs.

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:20.601
If you don't want to die

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:23.370
you'll have to cross
over from that roof.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.106
Don't use ninjitsu or they'll
find out Celestial Prison

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.774
wasn't really used on us.

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:28.976
All right.

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:31.512
Clouds are starting
to look ominous.

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:32.679
When the rain gets heavy

00:13:32.713 --> 00:13:35.849
the guards will head on
back inside to seek shelter.

00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:38.585
Seems like a good
time to get started.

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:41.355
Of course, if you're too scared.

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:43.524
I'm going to finish
this in a snap.

00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:46.093
(doragu chuckling)

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:54.001
The young ones sure do
have a lot of spirit.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.372
(yelling) Hey,
doesn't anybody here

00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.841
wanna bet the kid's
gonna make it?

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.743
'Cause otherwise the bet's off.

00:14:04.745 --> 00:14:05.779
I want in!

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:06.780
(metal clanging)

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:08.315
Oh no, come on!

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.851
That's an awfully big
bet you put on the kid!

00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:12.653
No, come on, please hear me out!

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:13.921
I just made a mistake.

00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:15.756
Look, you placed your bet

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:17.424
and there are no take backs.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.260
But that's not fair.

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:24.398
(intense music)

00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:27.401
Guards are bound to
notice him any second now.

00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:39.213
Oooh?

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:46.386
(thunder crackling)

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.022
(rain pouring)

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:55.996
(thunder booming)

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:58.165
[Boruto] This just
got a lot harder.

00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.743
(tense music)

00:15:38.372 --> 00:15:40.641
(loud boom)

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:52.419
Well that was a close one.

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.630
Damn, this would
be a piece of cake

00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:05.432
if I could only use ninjitsu.

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.106
(excited) Woah, he did it!

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.107
What's the pay out?

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:15.876
What're the odds?

00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:17.411
Not too shabby.

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:25.152
(laughing) Done and done.

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:27.454
[Doragu] Congratulations kid.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.557
But now you'll end up a
loser, like all the rest.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:34.394
(alarm blaring)

00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:35.429
Not good.

00:16:37.231 --> 00:16:39.533
Don't you dare move a muscle.

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:40.601
All right.

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:42.569
Who's the idiot this time?

00:16:42.603 --> 00:16:44.371
Damn you, Doragu.

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:45.405
He tricked me.

00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.542
Did you know?

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:50.878
Did you expect that
this would happen?

00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:53.113
Information is golden here.

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.715
I told you that didn't I?

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.751
Come on, this isn't fair at all.

00:16:57.784 --> 00:16:59.920
This whole thing is just a scam.

00:16:59.953 --> 00:17:01.321
(yelling) Do not resist!

00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:04.091
Drop the bulb, put your
hands up and turn around.

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:09.363
That kid's done for.

00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:11.064
He's going to be
stuck in this place

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:13.534
for the rest of his
life after doing this.

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:19.640
Got to find a way
out if I don't, I'll-

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.380
(thunder booming)

00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:31.118
[Benga] Stand up, now!
And turn to face this way!

00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:34.321
At this point, I guess
there's no choice.

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:37.090
This is a waste of
time, get rid of him.

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:41.128
But sir, we haven't even
confirmed who it is yet.

00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:43.797
You can just confirm
that afterward.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.999
Use his corpse to identify him.

00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.235
[Guards in Unison] Sir!

00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.740
(electrical zapping)

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:56.743
What the hell?

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:04.484
Sir, the prisoner's gone.

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:10.224
(yelling) Why you idiots!

00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:16.296
(wet grass rustling)

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.706
I believe this is
what you wanted.

00:18:25.739 --> 00:18:26.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:28.775
How did you do
that trick before?

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:30.911
Ah, sorry, but I
can't tell you that,

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.380
information is
gold in here right?

00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:37.251
Now you have a promise to keep,
to fulfill your side of things.

00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:39.152
Tell me Benga's weakness.

00:18:40.087 --> 00:18:42.155
(laughing) You're
a really funny guy.

00:18:44.758 --> 00:18:46.059
Quit your complaining.

00:18:46.093 --> 00:18:47.060
Just get back inside.

00:18:47.094 --> 00:18:51.598
You there get back in line!

00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:55.302
Hey, so can you keep this
in a safe place for me?

00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:56.737
Like usual?

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.639
Yeah, For a fee.

00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:01.241
Oh, well in that case,

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:04.978
do you think you could
mail this for me?

00:19:05.012 --> 00:19:07.347
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

00:19:08.415 --> 00:19:10.617
[Benga] Why did you
call me here, sir?

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.089
We found this.

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:19.726
But that's...

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.128
It's filled with records

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.397
of secret deals that have
been made with the prisoners.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.201
What's more, it's all in
your handwriting Benga.

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:28.769
(pleading) No, this is-!

00:19:28.802 --> 00:19:31.138
I'm sure it's some kind of-!

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.874
Seems you were taking
bribes to determine which

00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:36.443
cells the prisoners
were to be assigned to.

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:39.746
No wonder you're against
moving Kokuri to another cell.

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:43.183
Please, just hold on
a minute Lord Mujo.

00:19:43.217 --> 00:19:46.153
I beg you give me
another chance!

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:49.189
I simply can't trust
your judgment any longer.

00:19:49.223 --> 00:19:51.458
I've decided that
once Kokuri is healed

00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:54.628
he'll be put in the cell
with Boruto and the others.

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:57.264
(cell door slamming)

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:58.832
Boruto!

00:19:58.866 --> 00:19:59.900
(boruto laughing uncomfortably)

00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.535
Well, that's a relief.

00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:03.837
I'll say, but there's
still the problem

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.173
of who exactly
attacks you before.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.108
The only clue we really have is

00:20:08.141 --> 00:20:10.110
that it was one of the inmates.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.383
Hmm.

00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:22.456
[Doctor] Chief Warden,
I'm sorry but, may I-?

00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:23.924
What is it doctor?

00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:25.759
I'm a very busy man, you know.

00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:30.330
(hand slamming onto the desk)

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:32.466
[Benga] Your wooden
tag has gone missing?!

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:34.067
(apologetically) Yes,
sorry. I've been searching

00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:35.035
for it but...

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.336
When did you find out?

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.439
Well, I know for sure that
I had it three days ago.

00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:40.841
And said nothing?!

00:20:40.874 --> 00:20:42.643
Have you even considered
what could happen?

00:20:42.676 --> 00:20:44.645
If a prisoner got ahold of it?

00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:45.846
(employee cowering)

00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:48.148
(guards frantically running)

00:20:48.182 --> 00:20:49.650
Did something happen?

00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:52.052
It's looking pretty serious.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.755
Hey you, guard,
what's all this about.

00:20:54.788 --> 00:20:57.524
Hm. It seems a worker

00:20:57.558 --> 00:21:00.194
in the medical ward
lost his wooden tag.

00:21:00.227 --> 00:21:02.062
It happened about
three days ago.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.364
So we're going to
sweep the whole castle.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.502
Man, this whole
thing's a real mess.

00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:11.038
Hey, so you don't think
this is going to turn

00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:12.840
into some big lockdown do you?

00:21:12.873 --> 00:21:14.441
That would be so annoying.

00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:15.442
Boruto.

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:17.344
Yeah?

00:21:17.377 --> 00:21:19.680
He said the wooden tag went
missing three days ago.

00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:22.649
And shortly after that
Kokuri was attacked by a man

00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:24.151
in a prison jumpsuit.

00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:26.086
This isn't a coincidence.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:29.022
I get it. So the guy who
attacked Kokuri could have been

00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:31.658
the one who stole the wooden
tag, but it'd be nearly

00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:33.794
impossible for a prisoner
to get the chance to

00:21:33.827 --> 00:21:37.130
steal a wooden tag from a
worker on the medical ward.

00:21:38.165 --> 00:21:39.266
[Mitsuki] Three days ago,

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.068
one of those employees
came here when

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:42.903
you collapsed, right?

00:21:42.936 --> 00:21:45.639
[Boruto] Actually
come to think of it.

00:21:45.672 --> 00:21:48.308
[Mitsuki] Back then all
the cell doors were shut

00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:50.577
and every prisoner
was locked in.

00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:54.648
The only door that was open
was the one to this cell.

00:21:55.349 --> 00:21:57.217
In other words, that means...

00:22:03.056 --> 00:22:06.660
That the perp must be one
of the people in here.

(closing theme music)

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.992
[Boruto] The person who
stole the wooden tag

00:23:45.025 --> 00:23:47.327
and attacked Kokuri
is in this cell.

00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:49.029
[Mitsuki] Benga said
that everyone in the cell

00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:50.898
with the perp who
stole the wooden tag

00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:52.933
will be sent to solitary.

00:23:52.966 --> 00:23:54.168
[Boruto] If that happens,

00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:55.702
we'll be separated
from Kokuri again.

00:23:55.736 --> 00:23:58.839
We have to do something to
find the culprit ourselves.

00:23:58.872 --> 00:24:02.042
Next time on "Boruto
Naruto Next Generations"

00:24:02.075 --> 00:24:04.278
