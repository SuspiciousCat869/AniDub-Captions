WEBVTT

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.352
(sighs)

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:22.823
Why do we have to eat ramen
for breakfast, anyway?

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.824
What's wrong?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.025
This stuff tastes great!

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.094
I can't eat this first
thing in the morning!

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.229
Besides, this is what
we had last night!

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:30.731
But it's not the same!

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:33.100
Today, we're having salt broth!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.369
Yesterday was miso broth!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.172
Yeah, I know, but that's
not really the point!

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.940
(sigh)

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.175
Fine.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.111
I'll have ramen for breakfast.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.481
But don't you have
any other flavors?

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.717
Like Dynamic Hot Chili or
Red Avocado or something?

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.319
Wait, what are those?

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.556
Seriously, you don't even know?

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.624
You're so behind the times.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:00:59.860
If you haven't tasted
those flavors before,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.863
it's like you've
wasted half your life!

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.097
Seriously?

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.203
Okay!

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.605
I'm about to change your life.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.807
[Naruto] Whoa! What're
you putting in there?

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:15.576
[Boruto] Some of this,
a little of that.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:16.810
And why not?

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.178
How bout some of these.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:21.215
Voila!

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.352
My pristine salt ramen.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.554
Yeah!

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:28.522
It's good!

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.490
It's gotta have a
little bite to it.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.093
Come on, just humor me
and try it, would ya?

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.195
Are you really sure about this?

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:45.739
So spicy!

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:50.410
But it's kinda
good, too, ya know?

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.079
Yeah! See?

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.349
If you like this, we'll
get along just fine.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:58.318
So how long are you gonna
be in the village, anyway?

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.487
You know, I don't know.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.623
My master has stuff
he needs to do here,

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:06.393
so he told me I should just
take it easy for a little while.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.362
Our captain, Kakashi,
isn't here either,

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:10.731
so we don't have
any team missions.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.132
I guess it can't be helped.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.268
Since I'm the one
keeping an eye on you,

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.703
I'll just have to show
you around the village.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.575
(opening theme music)

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:51.231
(opening theme music)

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.542
"Genin, Assemble!"

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.945
This place is the
best diner in town.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.914
The lady that owns
this flower shop here

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.448
is always taking a nap.

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:11.451
And this bookstore is
run by a pervy old man.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:14.555
Wow, the village seems
different in almost every way!

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.323
Hey!

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:18.825
This month's issue is out now!

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.060
Hang on a sec.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.196
Sasuke was a kid
in this time, too.

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.064
Hey!

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.465
[Naruto] Hm?

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.035
So, why don't you introduce
me to your teammates.

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:30.204
There's three to a team, right?

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:32.506
There's Sakura, the
one from yesterday,

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.174
and the other one is?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.910
[Naruto] I can't right now.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.212
Why not?

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:41.915
The other one's, away
from the village.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:42.950
Like on a mission?

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:44.952
When's he coming back?

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:46.653
I don't know.

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:48.088
What does that mean?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.590
[Naruto] He'll
come back someday.

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.792
Or, more like, I'll
make him come back.

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:53.560
But he's not here right now.

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:58.799
Aw man, I thought I was
gonna get to meet Sasuke

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:00.534
when he was a kid.

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:01.502
Well!

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:02.803
Let's keep moving on!

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.505
[Konohamaru] Big Brother Naruto!

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:05.906
[Both] Hm?

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.176
(scheming chuckle)

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.278
So, who's the shrimp?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.079
Hey!

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:13.447
I'm not a shrimp!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.684
I'm Big Bro's rival and I'm
gonna be Hokage one day!

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.052
His rival?

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:20.687
And you just said "hey!"

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:21.688
Wait, shrimp are--

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.357
Who you calling shrimp?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.059
I'm the future Hokage,
Konohamaru Sarutobi,

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:28.228
grandson of the Third Hokage!

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.430
So you better not mess with me!

00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:31.465
Seriously?

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.668
Big Bro Konohamaru was
this annoying back then?

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.770
So, what's going on, Konohamaru?

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:37.771
(sneaky chuckle)

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.173
I thought that I'd show you

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:41.375
just how far I've gotten
with all of my training.

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:42.409
What? You mean?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.812
I challenge you!

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.047
Sexy Jutsu!

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:55.389
Huh?

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:57.391
(proud chuckle)

00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:59.059
Check it out!

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.361
Well, what do you think?

00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:04.531
Frankly, it's hard to praise
your sloppy execution.

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:05.532
Watch and learn!

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:07.167
Here's a real Sexy Jutsu!

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.573
(shocked, awed gasp)

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.075
What do you think?

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.543
See, Konohamaru?

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.446
You simply don't
have enough charm!

00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:21.682
Aw, man!

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.054
I guess that I simply
didn't train hard enough.

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:28.555
(chuckle) Yep!

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.791
You're still just too naive.

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:32.459
What even was the challenge?

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.596
Look, Konohamaru, you
gotta be way more diligent.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.799
Even this guy has a pretty
good Sexy Jutsu, you know!

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.067
He what?

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.202
You? Seriously?

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:44.037
Listen, I know one
thing for sure,

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:45.939
that my Sexy Jutsu
just has to be

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:48.041
a lot cooler than yours is!

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:50.410
You think so?

00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:51.945
Then show it to me!

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.647
I guess there's no choice!

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.815
If that's what you want.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.551
Of course, his is still
not as good as mine.

00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:01.154
You idiot!

00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:11.365
Big Bro!

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:14.401
What the hell do you think
you're doing this early?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.637
Sakura is scary!

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.373
Unhand him, you violent woman!

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:20.407
Huh?

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.179
What did you just say to me?

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:28.382
Forgive me, Big Brother!

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:29.683
Hey, wait!

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:32.452
Sakura, please, wait.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.490
Uh, please, Sakura, calm down!

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.560
Seriously, if he'd just
stop acting like an idiot!

00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:40.827
Right, Hinata?

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.062
Huh?

00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:44.064
Mom?

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:47.601
Listen, it makes
things harder for me

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.070
when I have a numbskull
like you for a partner,

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:51.305
you got that?

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:56.043
Oh, Sakura, could we
just leave it at that?

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:04.051
Wow, Mom seems really
different in the past.

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:06.820
That was close!

00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:08.422
Thanks for that, Hinata.

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:11.792
Hey, what's wrong?

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.527
Are you feeling okay?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.695
Oh...

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:16.063
Yes...

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:17.297
Yes, I'm fine.

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:20.567
Watching them is
so embarrassing.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.173
[Neji] You guys, what
are you up to, here?

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:28.008
Hey, Neji!

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.045
He's Uncle Neji?

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:33.914
Don't look at me!

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.082
I'm innocent!

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:36.817
Naruto was up to
his usual antics,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.452
so I told him to stop.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.688
And who are you?

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.090
Oh, I'm, uh--

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:45.092
This guy, he's a
traveling performer.

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:46.393
[Rock Lee] Neji!

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:47.427
There you are!

00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:48.462
What is it, Lee?

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.332
[Boruto] He looks just like him!

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:55.636
Oh!

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.337
Naruto, Sakura and Hinata.

00:08:57.371 --> 00:08:59.640
And you must be the
traveling performer

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.308
Lady Tsunade was talking about.

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.810
I've been assigned to watch
over him for now and--

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:05.045
Uh, hey!

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.247
Nice to meet you!

00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:08.248
Yeah!

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:09.349
Likewise!

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:12.085
Now, Naruto, I've
been looking for you

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.688
per Lady Fifth's
special direct orders.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.823
Her direct orders?

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:18.358
Earlier, Lady Fifth ordered me

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:21.828
to assemble all the available
genin in the Village.

00:09:21.862 --> 00:09:23.564
Are all you going?

00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:24.798
Of course we are!

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:25.966
Mm-hmm.

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.534
You're coming, too, right?

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.002
You're free, aren't you?

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.072
I guess that I
can't really train

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.208
if Pervy Sage
isn't here, anyway.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:37.044
And keeping an eye
on him is boring.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.679
All right, I'll come!

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:40.047
Okay, don't be late.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.582
Yeah, I know that.

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:43.684
All right, then, Naruto.

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:44.685
See you later.

00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:45.719
You bet!

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.256
Well, let's get going.

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.057
Huh?

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.692
Wait, I'm coming, too?

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:53.360
Yeah, of course you are.

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:55.362
I may be tired of
monitoring you,

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:58.432
but I've still gotta keep
an eye on you, don't I?

00:09:58.465 --> 00:09:59.466
Anyway, for now,

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:02.035
let's finish up our tour
of the village, okay?

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:07.641
(quick flinching gasp)

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:09.409
Naruto, what are you doing?

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:10.677
Are you okay, Sir?

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:13.647
Uh, yeah, I think so.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.649
I'm so sorry about that!

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.085
Hey, what's the hold up, huh?

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.319
Right!
Sorry!

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:21.054
-Hm?
-Hm?

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:24.091
This'd be way easier
with the Thunder Train.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.425
The Thunder Train?

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:26.593
What's that?

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:29.830
A kind of giant vehicle that
carries people and things.

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:32.232
It runs in a big circle
around a village.

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:33.667
[Naruto] What are you saying?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.701
Let's just go.

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:40.541
A giant vehicle that
carries people and things?

00:10:40.574 --> 00:10:41.909
Hey, Kaminarimon!

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:43.944
Quit your dawdling or
we're gonna be late!

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.445
[Kaminarimon] Uh, yes sir!

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.420
Hey, how come there's no Great
Stone Face of Lady Fifth?

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:54.555
Oh, right.

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:55.956
The thing is, Granny Tsunade

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.659
just became the Hokage
a little while ago.

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:00.394
It'll be carved real soon.

00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:01.428
Oh...

00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:04.731
I'm gonna be the
Hokage one day, too!

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:08.035
And then I'll get to have my
face carved right over there.

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.070
Seriously?

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:11.939
Dad really wanted
to become the Hokage

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.374
ever since he was just a kid?

00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:15.509
Hokage, huh?

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:16.443
Yeah! Why?

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.412
Don't you dare say
it's impossible!

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:25.052
Nope.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.087
I was just thinking that
you could probably do it.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.822
(chuckle) Aw yeah!

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.090
You get it!

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:32.326
Well, I only said
that you could,

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.695
but maybe you won't be able to.

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:35.729
What did you say?

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:38.799
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:40.067
And it always will be!

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.702
Okay, okay!

00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:53.447
According to Lady
Fifth's special orders,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.216
this is where we're all
supposed to assemble, right?

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.585
Yes, there's no mistake.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.955
And just what are we
supposed to do here?

00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:04.458
I got a bad feeling about this.

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:08.462
I see everyone's here.

00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:10.631
I've been assigned to coordinate

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:15.602
the Hokage's special orders,
although it's real drag.

00:12:15.636 --> 00:12:16.570
Huh?

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:19.239
Are you the observer
that Naruto mentioned?

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:21.074
Yeah!

00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:22.442
(stifled chuckle)

00:12:22.476 --> 00:12:25.646
Shikadai and Uncle Shikamaru
are almost identical!

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.148
Now, Shikamaru...

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:30.417
Just what are Lady
Fifth's special orders?

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.218
(sigh)

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.220
Yeah, uh, about that.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.023
All of us are supposed
to clean this place up.

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:38.058
Huh? What's up with that?

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.027
I guess that an
acquaintance of Lady Fifth's

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.595
has a connection
to this bathhouse,

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:44.398
so she can't really
say no to this request.

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:46.300
Why can't she say no?

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.535
None of us really know.

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:50.804
Anyway, she just told us
all that we have to do it.

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:52.806
She didn't give
us any reason why.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.008
Oh, man, Aunty Ino
and Uncle Choji

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.277
have hardly changed
at all, either.

00:12:57.311 --> 00:13:00.280
Granny Tsunade's acquaintance
must be Pervy Sage.

00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:02.015
Now she has to
clean up after him

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.017
because of what
happened last night.

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:07.087
If people find out, I'll
totally get beaten up!

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.423
Hey, why do you look
so pale, Naruto?

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.558
No, no, I'm not
at all, you know!

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:13.427
Really?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.629
You've been acting weird
ever since earlier today.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:17.531
Uh, don't be ridiculous!

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:18.732
I'm fine!

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:21.535
I'm just, uh, gonna go and
get the cleaning supplies now!

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:24.438
Hm?

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:26.940
You kinda look like Naruto.

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.408
Don't you think so?

00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:29.409
What?

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:31.245
No way, ya' know!

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:32.045
Hinata!

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.547
What are you guys talking about?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.416
C'mon, we'd better
go and help out, too.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.451
Oh. Right.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.554
See you!

00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:41.588
Yeah!

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:48.562
Hinata, you're usually so shy!

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.298
I'm surprised you spoke
to someone you just met!

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.566
Huh? Oh...

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:56.436
For some reason, I just didn't
feel nervous around him.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.605
[Ino] Sounds like
someone likes someone!

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:59.940
[Hinata] It's nothing!

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.508
[Sakura] Cut it out, Ino.

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:02.509
[Ino] Just kidding!

00:14:02.543 --> 00:14:03.677
Just kidding!

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:15.956
(sigh)

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.958
I just can't get into this.

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:18.959
Oh, yeah?

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:20.160
Too bad.

00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:23.664
It's an order from Lady
Fifth, so get cleaning.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.966
Well, we are still only genin!

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:27.367
Just think of it as training!

00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:29.036
I get that we have to do this,

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.471
but to be called up
just for cleaning duty?

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:33.273
Maybe that person
from the bathhouse

00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:35.542
has something that they're
holding over Lady Fifth

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:37.177
to force her to into this?

00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:38.412
Something over her?

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:40.681
Ooh. Should we
investigate later?

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:42.482
Um, you guys!

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:43.483
Who cares about that?

00:14:43.517 --> 00:14:46.620
C'mon, let's hurry and
get this cleaning done!

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:47.487
You know, normally,

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:50.357
you'd be the one
complaining the loudest.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.692
That isn't true!

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:52.826
Fine, let's go!

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.461
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:58.532
Come on, let's finish this fast!

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:00.534
Even as a kid,

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.270
he could do Shadow Clone
Jutsu better than me, huh?

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:06.006
All right, let's do this!

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:07.975
(determined yell)

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.413
You are really full of energy.

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:16.483
Wow, no wonder he's
the future Hokage.

00:15:16.517 --> 00:15:19.019
You think that he's
the future Hokage?

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:21.755
Like I'd let Naruto
steal the spotlight!

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:22.890
Let's go, Akamaru!

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:24.057
(eager barks)

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:26.393
Man-Beast Transformation Combo!

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.999
Soapy Fang Over Fang!

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.671
Hey, Kiba, stop!

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:38.672
Calm it down!

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:40.274
There're too many suds!

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:47.614
So, that's the guy that
everyone in the village

00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:49.016
placed their hopes in, huh?

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:50.817
Who're you talking about?

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:52.085
Well, Kiba of course.

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:53.220
He just says stuff.

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:55.155
Don't take him seriously.

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:56.156
Huh?

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.559
He can't be the one that
everyone in the Village

00:15:58.592 --> 00:15:59.893
puts their hopes in.

00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:01.228
The reason is because--

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:03.397
Hey! What are you
guys talking about?

00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:13.774
(discomforted whine)

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:14.775
(disillusioned sigh)

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.610
No! I will not be outdone!

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:17.644
Huh?

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:21.615
Cleaning the bathhouse can
also be used as training,

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:22.883
so here I go!

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:25.285
(determined yell)

00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:28.088
Why are you making
it all sudsy again?

00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:30.691
Hey, rinse that off, quick!

00:16:30.724 --> 00:16:31.725
Right!

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.661
Hm?

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:38.665
(laughter)

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:39.700
Water Style Jutsu!

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:40.901
Get it?

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.604
All right, if that's
how you wanna play it.

00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:44.638
Take this!

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.508
Hey!

00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:49.142
That water's too hot!

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:54.948
Ha! Ya missed me!

00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:56.183
Why you little!

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:01.755
I'm over here!

00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:02.923
-[Naruto] Why you!
-Hey, guys!

00:17:02.956 --> 00:17:05.292
Quit making this more of a drag!

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:07.494
Oops!

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:09.196
Sorry, Shikamaru!

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.532
Okay, the changing
rooms are all done.

00:17:11.565 --> 00:17:12.633
Ahh!

00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:13.667
Why...

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.537
Come on, you guys!

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.774
Huh?

00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:21.942
[All] Huh?

00:17:21.975 --> 00:17:24.378
(crashing)

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.150
(surprised gasps)

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:33.887
What's all the ruckus about?

00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:35.122
Huh?

00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:39.693
Ow.

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:45.699
Hey, Choji!

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.568
What's the big idea, anyway?

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.938
Oh, so you're back
again, you peeping brat!

00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:52.739
Peeping brat?

00:17:52.773 --> 00:17:53.807
Huh?

00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:55.042
But I...

00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:14.561
So that special order

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:17.030
was just to clean up
after your mess, huh?

00:18:17.064 --> 00:18:18.365
I told you guys!

00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:20.167
It was all Pervy Sage's fault!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.902
Ugh, you are so annoying!

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.737
Aw, come on, Sakura!

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.973
Please don't say
stuff like that!

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:29.877
So where did you study taijutsu?

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.278
Huh?

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:35.249
Oh, uh, at a kind of like a
school where a sensei taught me.

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:36.183
I see.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.151
Your movements back
there were pretty good.

00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:41.288
But I noticed some slight
inefficiencies in them.

00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:44.424
Did your sensei ever
tell you about them?

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:46.059
Uh, not really.

00:18:46.093 --> 00:18:48.462
Then I'd say your
sensei was careless.

00:18:50.197 --> 00:18:52.766
Yeah, that Sensei was you.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.434
You're a street
performer, right?

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:57.604
If you can move that well,
you could be a ninja, too!

00:18:57.638 --> 00:18:59.173
Yeah, your instincts were great!

00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:00.741
You might even surpass Naruto,

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:02.476
and it probably
wouldn't take long!

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:03.277
What?

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.945
C'mon, no way that'll happen!

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.313
It makes sense.

00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:08.916
I bet you could be
battle-ready quick.

00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:10.083
What do you say?

00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:12.619
Do you guys seriously
need people that badly?

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:15.822
Well, we had a guy desert
the Village recently,

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:17.057
and things've been kinda tough.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.425
So what do you think?

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.459
Hey, Kiba!

00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:27.367
Wait, don't tell me
the deserter is--

00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:31.004
Uh, listen, sorry, but just
forget about what we said.

00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:33.640
You know, I'm
feeling kinda hungry.

00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:34.741
Oh.

00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:35.809
Well, Choji?

00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:36.810
Yeah!

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:38.045
I'm totally starving.

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:39.746
But isn't that always the case?

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.747
(chuckle)

00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:42.249
You got that right!

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:47.154
Okay, guys, we're all
excused for the day.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:07.207
Well, so far, I haven't
sensed Urashiki nearby.

00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:10.110
Although, he could
appear anytime.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:14.147
Has Karasuki awakened
since we first got here?

00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:16.683
No, he hasn't come
out of his shell once.

00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:22.556
What is it?

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:25.325
I wanna know what you
were doing in this time.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.961
Why's that?

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:29.329
I asked Dad and the others,

00:20:29.363 --> 00:20:32.266
but they just said
that you were away.

00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:37.971
And Granny Tsunade mentioned
a genin who deserted the Leaf.

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.240
It was you, right?

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:43.677
Why?

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.181
Because back then, I
couldn't see another choice.

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:51.318
You're the Sasuke you are now

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:54.288
because of what happened
back in this past.

00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:56.924
So why can't the current
you from right now

00:20:56.957 --> 00:20:59.560
just go and talk to them
or something like that?

00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:01.795
We can't.

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:03.030
But...

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:05.899
The reason that we're here

00:21:05.933 --> 00:21:08.602
is to protect Naruto
from Urashiki.

00:21:08.635 --> 00:21:09.603
Do you understand me?

00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:12.172
We can't stir up anything
else in the past.

00:21:13.974 --> 00:21:16.310
So, go back to Naruto.

00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:29.823
All right, talk!

00:21:29.857 --> 00:21:31.825
Where've you been, mister?

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.227
Here in the village.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.596
Then you shoulda shown your
face or something, ya know!

00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:38.899
I mean, it's my job to keep
an eye on you two, remember?

00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:39.900
Yeah.

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:41.168
I'm sorry.

00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:42.336
(exasperated sigh)

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:44.872
Well, anyway, I wonder
where Pervy Sage is

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:47.007
right about now.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.009
He made a promise that he
was gonna train me today.

00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:51.411
(shocked gasp)

00:21:51.445 --> 00:21:52.446
Hm?

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.214
My, my!

00:21:54.248 --> 00:21:57.284
My plans sure did get
knocked off-kilter!

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:01.154
I guess that I'll
have to exterminate

00:22:01.188 --> 00:22:01.822
these annoying insects.

00:22:01.855 --> 00:22:06.994
Huh?

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:14.101
(ending theme music)

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.094
I've wanted to meet you for
a long time, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:48.428
Who is this guy?

00:23:48.462 --> 00:23:49.630
You know who I am?

00:23:49.663 --> 00:23:50.631
Why, of course!

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:52.799
You're very famous, after all.

00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:55.469
I'm here to take
your Nine Tails.

00:23:55.502 --> 00:23:57.004
I won't let you!

00:23:57.037 --> 00:23:58.739
[Sasuke] I'll handle Urashiki!

00:23:58.772 --> 00:24:00.541
Boruto, you guard Naruto!

00:24:00.574 --> 00:24:03.877
Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:03.911 --> 00:24:05.946
"The Power of the Nine Tails"

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:07.381
We'll protect you, Dad!

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:14.721
