-(train screeches)
-(train rattling)

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.543
(steam hissing)

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.646
(train horn tooting)

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.253
You were my light
in the darkness.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.259
Why won't you just tell
me how you're feeling?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.130
I just can't put my
feelings into words.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.533
I understand.

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.302
Thank you for everything.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.248
(dramatic romantic music)

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.721
(woman sobbing)

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.070
-(Boruto grunting)
-(eyebrows squeaking)

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.106
(Cho-Cho crying)

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.545
(loud clanging)

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.984
-(comical tense music)
-(people chattering)

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.522
So, what did he
wanna say anyway?

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.557
[Both] What?

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.093
I mean it's not like they
actually loved each other

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.361
or anything like that, right?

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.364
Man, that movie was so boring.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.432
[Both] What?

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.833
[Sarada] What're
you talking about?

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.602
Of course they loved each other!

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:42.803
They were both in love,

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.938
but they just couldn't
stay together!

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.541
It was a totally
tragic story, ya jerk!

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.475
What? But how?

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.210
They didn't say
anything to each other

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:52.746
about being in love at all!

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:53.914
I just don't get it!

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.749
How can they be
boyfriend and girlfriend?

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.217
Hey, listen up!

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.352
Romantic relationships

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:00.287
-are complicated.
-(lighthearted music)

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.890
Fine. We'll just have
to watch it again.

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:06.093
And this time, I'll sit next
to you and explain everything.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.762
(groans) Actually,
I just remembered

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.764
I have something
to do (chuckles)!

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.299
-See ya!
-(slide whistle whistling)

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.968
(grunts) He just ran away?

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.239
(Opening Theme Music)

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:36.323
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:50.063
(Opening Theme Music)

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.807
-(people chattering)
-(birds chirping)

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:02.943
What? A romantic movie?

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.511
Well, uh, actually, I thought

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:07.214
it was gonna be an
action movie, but...

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.189
Listen, if you have time
to watch a movie like that,

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:16.723
you have time to go train.

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:17.724
Yeah, but I...

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:20.093
Ugh, look just forget it.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:23.297
You ever watch movies like
that, Konohamaru sensei?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.398
Hm!

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.234
The only girlfriend I
have is my Ninja Way!

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.369
My goal is to become the Hokage!

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.972
I can't let things like
romantic relationships

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.174
get in the way of my focus.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:35.843
What are you talking about?

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:38.745
(Yoimura panting)

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.318
[Both] Huh?

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.453
(tense music)

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:49.122
(men vocalizing)

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:51.692
(Yoimura panting)

00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:53.727
(dramatic chase music)

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.630
(Yoimura panting)

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:17.017
(Yoimura panting)

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.724
(Boruto grunts)

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:26.627
(Yoimura panting)

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:29.963
(Yoimura screaming)

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:31.198
(Boruto and Konohamaru grunting)

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:35.536
(Yoimura shouts)

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:39.439
(wind whistling)

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:42.342
(Yoimura panting)

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.817
(birds chirping)

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.386
(air whooshing)

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.421
(upbeat music)

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:57.324
(Yoimura gasping)

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.066
(wind whistling)

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.472
(gentle music)

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:15.008
[Konohamaru] Hey,
it's all okay now.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.413
Um, are you all right?

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.648
Amazing! Delightful!

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.183
I flew through the air!

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:24.418
Huh?

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:26.820
I have never seen a village
from so high up above before!

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:28.522
I'm sorry!

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.992
I guess I got carried away and
ended up jumping pretty high.

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.828
(sighs) I never
thought I'd experience

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.196
something like that!

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.432
(Konohamaru laughs)

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:39.466
Uh, mm.

00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:44.404
(Boruto grunts)

00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:45.439
Huh?

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:54.915
Please forgive my rudeness.

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:57.251
First of all my
name's Remon Yoimura.

00:06:57.284 --> 00:07:01.221
I was so overjoyed that I forgot
to thank you for saving me!

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.223
So, thank you, and I'm sorry.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:05.192
I'm just happy you're all right!

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:08.428
And I'm also honored that
you enjoyed it so much!

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:09.463
Mm.

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.298
Uh.

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:14.768
[Boruto] Hey.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.936
Uh?

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.105
Why were those guys
after you, Miss Remon?

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:20.474
Oh, that was... mm mm.

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:25.379
I came to this village
to do some sightseeing.

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.714
Along the way, I
ended up getting lost

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:29.483
and I ran into those men.

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:32.486
I guess that I upset
them for some reason.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:35.255
I see. I'm very
sorry to hear that.

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.225
Yes! But now I must do something

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:39.826
to thank you for saving me!

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.827
No, no!

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:41.828
You don't need to

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:43.063
worry about that a bit.

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:44.064
It's really all right.

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:45.999
(whimpers) But, I...

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:48.068
Please forget about
all that stuff.

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:49.903
Just keep sightseeing.

00:07:49.937 --> 00:07:50.904
Mm.

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:52.239
If that's the case,

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:54.741
there's something that
I've been wanting to eat.

00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:57.778
[Konohamaru And Yoimura] Uh?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.848
(people chattering)

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:02.082
-Uh, thank you
-(gentle music)

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:04.418
for treating us both to lunch!

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:05.385
Of course!

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:07.521
Besides, it would've
bothered me to no end

00:08:07.554 --> 00:08:10.257
if I didn't do anything to
repay you for your help.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.594
Hey, it's kinda funny to think
he just wanted a hamburger.

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:15.929
I guess deep down
he's still just a kid.

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:18.098
Mm? Hey huh.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.436
[Both] Hm?

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:23.470
Thanks for waiting!

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.406
(funky music)

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.575
Hey, what is this?

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:29.943
The latest thing on the menu!

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:31.812
The super-sour lemon burger!

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.847
Oh! Looks delicious!

00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:35.082
(lively rock music)

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:37.584
I simply adore eating
things that are sour!

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:38.819
(Konohamaru groans)

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.121
But actually, I've
never eaten anything

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:42.122
quite like this before.

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:43.257
[Boruto And Konohamaru] Huh?

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.027
Uh, do I sound
strange or something?

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.596
Oh, no. Not even a bit.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.797
Just watch.

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:52.799
This is how you
eat it, Miss Remon.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:55.669
(grunting and gobbling)

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.304
Super sour!

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:02.209
Ah, I see. (giggles)

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:04.211
Oh, mm mm mm.

00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:07.314
Hm!

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:10.384
-Super sour!
-(magical music)

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:13.086
-But it's so delicious!
-(lively rock music continues)

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.454
(boys grunting)

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:16.623
The tartness is
just indescribable!

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:20.194
I've come all the way
from the Daidai Village

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:23.463
and there's nothing that's
this delicious there!

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:24.498
I think I...

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.003
I want to stay and live
in the Leaf Village!

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:32.506
(boys laughing)

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:34.174
Well, okay, that's great!

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:35.976
Aren't you kinda overreacting?

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:38.645
Mr. Konohamaru, you
have to try this!

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:39.680
Uh, uh.

00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:43.317
Mm.

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:45.219
Okay, here goes.

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:49.189
(funky music)

00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:52.693
(Konohamaru stammering)

00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:55.062
Uh uh um.

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:59.399
(reverberating music)

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:02.069
-Super sour (coughing)!
-(gong clanging)

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.204
Are you all right?

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:08.075
Actually, I don't like
sour things very much.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:11.778
(coughing) I'm sorry! (coughing)

00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:12.779
Uh?

00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:14.515
Here, please, you can use this.

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:16.483
Oh, thank (coughing)
you (coughing).

00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:20.988
-I'll wash this and return it!
-(lighthearted music)

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:23.357
Big Brother, so uncool.

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:27.094
(light upbeat music)

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.363
I'm really sorry about that.

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:32.533
I didn't know you disliked
sour things so much.

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:35.169
Oh! No, I thought that
maybe I could learn

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:36.937
to like sour things
by eating it,

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.107
but it just ended up
being too much for me.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.341
(Yoimura giggling)

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.177
-So, where to next?
-(upbeat music)

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.244
Huh?

00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:46.647
You're gonna keep on
sightseeing, right, Miss Remon?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.781
Well, come on!

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.116
We'll show you
around the village!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.818
Oh, but I don't wanna impose!

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:53.620
You wouldn't be imposing at all.

00:10:53.654 --> 00:10:56.990
And this way, we'd both be
able to guard you, as well!

00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:58.859
(Yoimura sighs)

00:10:58.892 --> 00:10:59.860
All right, then!

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:01.595
I'd appreciate that very much.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.463
Hey, this'll be easy for us.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.632
Mm, hey again?

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.405
(light upbeat music)

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.207
Wow, amazing!

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.942
I've heard so much about them,

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.944
the Hokage's Great Stone Faces!

00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:19.613
You see the third face
from the left up there?

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.315
That's Big Brother's grandpa!

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:23.417
Oh?

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.351
Yes.

00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:26.486
But of course, I'm
nowhere near Gramps',

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.822
uh, I mean, my
grandfather's level.

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.691
Kind of embarrassing to admit.

00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:33.427
But your goal's to become
Hokage, right, Big Brother?

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.629
Your girlfriend
is your Ninja Way?

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.097
(grunts) Hey, come on!

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.033
You talk too much,
you know that, Boruto?

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:42.870
Mm, mm. I think it's wonderful.

00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:44.104
[Boys] Mm?

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:47.107
To decide on a goal and
to pursue it vigorously.

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.943
I think being able to do that,

00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:52.079
well, it's nothing
short of amazing.

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:58.018
(Konohamaru groans)

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.887
Anyway, come on.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.889
There's still so
much more to see.

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:03.123
Hm? Right.

00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:10.063
(lively upbeat music)

00:12:43.463 --> 00:12:46.466
(people chattering)

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:48.335
Oh, how cute!

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.538
Would you like me
to get you one?

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:54.141
(gasps) Oh, no, I couldn't.

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:56.677
As a thank you for
the hamburgers.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.711
Uh, hm.

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:01.048
All right.

00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:06.253
Which one do you think
would look best on me?

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:09.623
Uh, I think that they'd
both look great on you.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:11.625
Uh. (grunts)

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:13.026
-Just choose one.
-Uh!

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.261
Uh, uh...

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:16.964
Okay, lemme see.

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:22.169
Mm, I'd say, um,
I'll pick this one.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:29.476
Miss Remon, the hair clip
you already had looked fancy.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.211
You really didn't have
to accept something

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:33.213
as cheap-looking
as that new one.

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:36.083
No. I actually like it.

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:37.885
(Konohamaru groans)

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:39.620
(Yoimura giggles)

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:40.654
Hm.

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:47.628
-(birds chirping)
-(light emotional music)

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.534
How pretty.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:56.203
Yes, well, the village
may look impressive now,

00:13:56.236 --> 00:13:58.272
but a while ago, it
came under attack

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.174
and was completely destroyed.

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:02.142
Yes.

00:14:02.176 --> 00:14:04.211
I heard all about that.

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:06.346
Back then, it was an age of war.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.615
Even earlier, when
I was still a child,

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:12.052
my grandfather sacrificed
himself to protect our village.

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:14.588
(Yoimura gasps)

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.590
I'm Konohamaru.

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:19.560
My grandfather named me that
after the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:23.630
When I think about
that, I feel energized

00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:27.734
and motivated to protect this
village and all its people.

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:32.306
It sounds like your
grandfather was a great man.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:33.340
Yes!

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.209
He was exceptional,
and he was respected

00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:36.877
by everyone in the village.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.880
That's the reason why
I wanna become a Hokage

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:41.281
just like him!

00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:44.885
That being said, I still
have quite a long way to go.

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:47.020
Unless I train like
my life depends on it,

00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:49.223
I'll never surpass
my grandfather.

00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:51.225
But, hey, I suppose
there are no shortcuts

00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:53.493
to becoming the Hokage, right?

00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:54.494
(Yoimura gasps)

00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:56.496
Mm? What's the matter?

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.501
Um, I noticed earlier
that you, well,

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:04.071
you keep saying
that same word, hey.

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:06.006
(gulps) Oh, I'm sorry!

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:08.342
It's a habit that
pops up here and there

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.142
but, hey...

00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:10.944
-(stammers)
-(comical music)

00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:12.412
-I mean, uh-
-Aw, come on!

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:15.482
When the conversation was
going so smoothly too!

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:16.750
So uncool, Big Bro.

00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:18.819
Mm mm. What did you say?

00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:19.987
I don't think he is.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.955
[Boys] Huh?

00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:25.692
How do you feel
about me, Konohamaru?

00:15:25.726 --> 00:15:27.494
(Yoimura gasps)

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:28.295
Uh...

00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:29.296
-(light upbeat music)
-Uh.

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:30.297
[Yoimura And Konohamaru] Mm.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.000
Mm? Anyway, where to next?

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.568
To be honest, we've
already shown you

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.204
most of the major
sights in the village.

00:15:37.237 --> 00:15:38.939
Oh! Then how about...

00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:40.340
(foot thuds)

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:41.341
(Yoimura shouts)

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:43.343
-(lighthearted music)
-(Konohamaru grunts)

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:45.412
(Yoimura gasps)

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.413
(both sighing)

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.549
(both panting)

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:50.250
Hurry up, you guys! Huh?

00:15:51.652 --> 00:15:53.320
What are you doing, ya know?

00:15:54.888 --> 00:15:57.558
(Konohamaru grunting)

00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:00.460
(Yoimura whimpering)

00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:01.495
Hm?

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:08.602
-(light upbeat music)
-(people chattering)

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.537
Oh, wow, look at how late it is!

00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:13.140
Huh? You going home already?

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:15.676
Can't you stay any longer?

00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:16.977
Yes, okay.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.246
Maybe for just a
little while longer.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.748
Could you accompany
me to... (gasps)

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:24.551
(gong clangs)

00:16:24.585 --> 00:16:27.054
(all grunt)

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:31.625
(people chattering)

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:32.626
(Konohamaru groans)

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:33.660
It's all right.

00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:36.296
I must take my leave now.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.098
But, please, rest assured.

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:40.634
[Boruto] Miss Remon?

00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:43.670
These men have come
from my household.

00:16:43.704 --> 00:16:46.139
I left there without telling
anyone where I'd gone,

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:48.976
so they've come here
to take me home.

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:50.878
Your household?

00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:53.347
(sighs) All that I
really wanted to do

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.083
was enjoy this
day all by myself.

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:58.218
And that's the reason
I lied to you earlier

00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:01.088
about why I was being
pursued by these men.

00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:04.224
Please, I hope you
can forgive me.

00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:06.126
So that's what this is about.

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:09.429
[Yoimura] (gasps) I truly
had so much fun today.

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:12.733
I really don't know how I could
ever repay the two of you.

00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:14.501
Please don't worry about it.

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:18.438
We're just glad you were able
to have some fun, Miss Remon.

00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:20.140
Mr. Konohamaru.

00:17:20.174 --> 00:17:22.476
Yeah, he's right!
Don't worry about it.

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:25.546
And if you ever wanna do
it again, just let us know.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.747
It'll be like a mission.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.148
We'll escort you
anywhere you want.

00:17:28.182 --> 00:17:31.318
Oh, Boruto. Thank you.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.820
(Yoimura sighs)

00:17:33.854 --> 00:17:35.856
You know, hearing
about your grandfather

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.424
made a big impression on me.

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:40.394
Sacrificing himself
to protect everyone.

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:43.630
It's something that will
motivate and energize me.

00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:44.665
Mm?

00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:53.173
(gentle guitar and flute music)

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:07.855
Hey, I'll never forget
your kindness! (giggles)

00:18:07.888 --> 00:18:09.022
(boys chuckle)

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:11.892
(Yoimura giggles)

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.293
-(Konohamaru laughing)
-Miss Remon was

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:16.230
kinda strange, but she
was nice, too, wasn't she?

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:17.965
(sighs) All right, well,

00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:19.633
I'm gonna head home and train.

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:22.936
His girlfriend's his Ninja Way.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.505
I guess he really meant it!

00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:49.296
Lately, Konohamaru
Sensei's been acting weird.

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:50.230
Oh, really?

00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:52.032
You're still such a
kid, you know that?

00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:54.301
What's that supposed to mean?

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:56.336
Right now, my gut's telling me

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.005
-(bells tinkling)
-that he's...

00:18:58.038 --> 00:18:59.473
(people chattering)

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:00.507
in love!

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:03.744
What?

00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:05.612
No doubt about it.

00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:07.014
No way that's true!

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:08.882
I've been with him
this whole time,

00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:10.951
and I didn't notice
anything like that.

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:12.219
(Cho-Cho growls)

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:13.754
-(Boruto groans and grunts)
-(Sarada groans)

00:19:13.787 --> 00:19:15.622
When the potato
chip met consommÃ©,

00:19:15.656 --> 00:19:17.624
a gastronomic reaction occurred.

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:21.361
And thus was born a
miraculous collaboration.

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:23.897
Just like when a
man met a woman.

00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:24.898
Mm mm.

00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:26.500
Mm mm?

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:27.801
It's begun.

00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:28.936
-The chemical reaction
-(gong clanging)

00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:30.504
of love's already started!

00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:33.807
-(electricity cracking)
-(Boruto gasping)

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:35.409
Come on, no way.

00:19:35.442 --> 00:19:37.744
Big Brother didn't mention
a word about anything

00:19:37.778 --> 00:19:38.979
like that whatsoever.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.081
Look, Boruto, you
didn't even understand

00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:42.482
that romance movie.

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:45.819
You wouldn't notice even
if something did happen.

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:46.820
(gasps)

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:47.821
(eerie music)

00:19:47.855 --> 00:19:50.190
You mean that was...

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.427
Hm?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.428
(Boruto grunts)

00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:55.495
Hey, wait, Boruto!

00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:57.698
-(Sarada stammers)
-(lively rock music)

00:19:57.731 --> 00:19:59.600
(sighs) He's
totally still a kid.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.474
(air whooshing)

00:20:07.508 --> 00:20:10.677
Uh, Boruto, shouldn't
we just go home?

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.613
Nope, it's too late for that!

00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:13.814
You gotta return
the handkerchief

00:20:13.847 --> 00:20:15.749
you borrowed, right?

00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:17.084
Well, I guess so.

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:18.285
But, all the same-

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:21.088
Can't go empty-handed
so I brought a gift.

00:20:23.624 --> 00:20:24.558
What's up?

00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:26.727
Staying quiet isn't
gonna get you anywhere.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.095
Which means I'll just go ahead

00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:29.897
and say what needs to be said.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.833
You sit back, relax,
and leave it to me.

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:34.034
Uh?

00:20:45.379 --> 00:20:48.348
Miss Remon is from
a rich family, huh?

00:20:48.382 --> 00:20:51.285
Yeah, I sorta got
that impression.

00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:52.986
Anyway, let's just go in!

00:20:54.121 --> 00:20:56.323
-Hello.
-(birds chirping)

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.061
[Both] Uh?

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:10.537
(Yoimura gasps)

00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:11.672
Miss Remon?

00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:12.706
Uh...

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:17.444
(Yoimura gasps and sighs)

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.356
(Yoimura sighs)

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:31.258
Uh, Miss Remon?

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:35.629
I don't ever want to
see either of you again.

00:21:35.662 --> 00:21:37.464
Now please, take your leave.

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:45.172
-(boys grunting)
-(tense music)

00:21:47.107 --> 00:21:50.377
(suspenseful music)

00:22:00.053 --> 00:22:03.257
(suspenseful music)

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:07.594
(wind whistling)

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:14.168
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:30.017 --> 00:22:34.121
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.922 --> 00:23:43.891
(suspenseful music)

00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:45.125
[Boruto] Miss Remon seemed

00:23:45.158 --> 00:23:47.294
like a whole different
person, didn't she?

00:23:47.327 --> 00:23:48.562
[Konohamaru] You're right.

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.163
There must be a reason why.

00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:51.265
[Boruto] I knew it!

00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:52.633
There's something
weird going on!

00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:53.634
We can't just leave.

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:55.335
Let's try talking to her again.

00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:58.138
[Konohamaru] Yeah, but
this isn't a mission,

00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:00.474
so getting involved
is forbidden.

00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:01.608
[Boruto] Next time

00:24:01.642 --> 00:24:05.212
on "Boruto Naruto Next
Generations: Remon's Secret".

00:24:05.245 --> 00:24:07.714
All right, let's go
and see Miss Remon!

00:24:11.652 --> 00:24:15.589
