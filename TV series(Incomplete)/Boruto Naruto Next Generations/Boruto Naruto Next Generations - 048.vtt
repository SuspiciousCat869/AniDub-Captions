<i>It's been one week since</i>

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.410
<i>the Byakuya Gang incident.</i>

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.845
<i>Things have finally settled</i>
<i>back down to normal,</i>

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:12.579
<i>haven't they?</i>

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:12.679
<i>They have.</i>

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.016
<i>t's all thanks to everyone</i>
<i>in the village</i>

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.084
<i>listening and taking</i>
<i>my speech to heart.</i>

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.720
<i>However,</i>
<i>the rumors that were started</i>

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.355
<i>by the Byakuya Gang</i>
<i>caused a lot of damage.</i>

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.124
<i>I realize that</i>
<i>there are people</i>

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.492
<i>who are still dissatisfied</i>
<i>and I don't blame them.</i>

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.194
<i>I intend to address</i>
<i>their concerns.</i>

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.696
<i>There's been a decrease</i>

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.132
<i>in the number of genin</i>
<i>applicants lately...</i>

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:35.035
<i>but I heard our genin</i>
<i>performed quite admirably!</i>

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.837
<i>Genin don't usually</i>
<i>have an opportunity</i>

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.438
<i>to go on a mission</i>
<i>like that</i>

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.207
<i>but the ones in the area</i>
<i>greatly helped our efforts.</i>

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.744
<i>I'm so thankful and</i>
<i>especially proud of them.</i>

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.477
<i>(COMMENTATOR)</i>
<i>How wonderful.</i>

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:44.578
[scoff]

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.380
<i>So why did you ignore</i>
<i>your orders?</i>

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.649
<i>[grunt]</i>

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.951
<i>You're suspended for now,</i>
<i>so go on home.</i>

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.653
<i>(COMMENTATOR)</i>
<i>Thanks to those genin...</i>

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:56.523
<i>we have peace and security</i>
<i>in the Hidden Leaf Village!</i>

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:59.159
I finally got through a school
year without repeating

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.460
and made it as a genin,

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.662
but still...!

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.129
<i>And you also have news</i>
<i>to share about</i>

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:03.964
<i>the upcoming Chunin Exam...</i>

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.632
<i>That's right.</i>

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.502
<i>I'm very happy to report</i>
<i>that this year's Chunin Exam</i>

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.436
<i>will be held in</i>
<i>the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.238
<i>I want all genin</i>
<i>to do their best</i>

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.674
<i>so that they</i>
<i>can participate</i>

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.041
<i>in the Chunin Exam.</i>

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.610
Chunin...

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:17.477
Exam?!

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.748
Oh no! At this rate,
I'll have to repeat again!

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.750
But this time, as a genin!

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.454
Now that you're managing

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.223
all the hamlets
far from the village,

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.325
your work has expanded
big time.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.960
And there were already
enough things

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:15.495
on your plate to begin with.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.263
You don't need to
worry about me.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.465
The one I'm worried
about is...Shikadai!

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.668
Why are you worried
about him all of a sudden?

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.237
As usual, I have no idea
what he's up to

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.539
or what he's thinking about.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.240
However, since the incident,

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.810
he seems to be studying
the art of war.

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:32.378
[laughing]
Sounds familiar!

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.080
He's starting to
take after his dad

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:35.582
and not just in looks.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:36.182
Yeah...

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.383
The question is

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.220
should I be happy
or sad about that?

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.122
As if we didn't have
enough going on...

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.224
Now we have to prepare
for the Chunin Exams

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.325
at the same time...

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.260
Man, what a dra‐‐
I mean...

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.029
All right, easy there.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.230
The genin are getting
pumped up

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.497
about taking the exam,

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.099
so us grown‐ups
need to be careful

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.167
about what we say.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.269
[laughing]
Good point.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.237
[laughing]

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.476
Well, anyway,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.513
we're really short‐handed
overall right now.

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:09.349
The lack of genin applicants
is a serious issue.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:11.151
It's not like it used to be.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.053
Guess there's a lot of
other career choices

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.254
besides being a shinobi.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.622
Hmmm...

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.258
It really is becoming
a problem, isn't it?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.293
Huh?

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.928
(UDON)
Excuse me...

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:23.864
Oh! Hello there, Udon!

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:23.964
Good afternoon.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.801
Your team is the one
that's still on suspension,

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:28.935
isn't that right?

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.003
Ah... Yes.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.572
I'm ashamed to admit it.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:34.140
Well, let me inform you that
it's over as of right now.

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:35.475
Uh...!

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.278
I have the perfect mission
for your team.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.280
I swear...!

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.315
I'm gonna become a chunin,
no matter what!

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.517
There's no way in hell

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.219
I'm gonna repeat
this year again, dammit!

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.654
Actually, I don't think

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:49.656
it's called "repeating"
anymore at this point.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.457
Besides, the number
of applicants

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.627
for the Chunin Exam
is limited every year.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.295
So it is not that big
of a deal

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:59.365
even if you do not make it
the first or second time.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.167
While all of that may be true,

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.503
I'm sick and tired
of being the one

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:04.270
who's always left behind...

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.973
by you guys and the others!

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:07.874
I understand.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.409
Denki!

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.779
So then, what do you think
our team should do, Iwabe?

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:15.215
Well...
You have to be recommended

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.250
by the sensei that's
in charge of your team

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.953
to be able to participate
in the Chinin Exam.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.990
We worked hard to become genin
and we earned these headbands,

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:25.158
but when
the crucial moment came,

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.426
we weren't allowed to help

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.261
with the Byakuya Gang
incident one bit!

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.663
‐ Hm.
‐ Hm.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.766
At this rate, we won't
ever get recommended.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.268
We have to show everyone
how good we are.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.737
Don't you agree?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.404
Yeah...
I see what you're saying.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:39.506
And the worst part is,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.208
if we do not get
to take the exam,

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:43.910
then we will totally
end up being called

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:44.978
"Team Repeater!"

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.913
‐ Ehhhh...!
‐ Ehhhh...!

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:52.152
So, from now on, you guys...
We have to give 100%!

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:52.919
‐ Right!
‐ Right!

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.593
All right, Team 7,
here's your assignment:

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:00.861
"Please deliver these items

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.563
"to the hamlet
outside the village."

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:05.065
Gotcha! We can get
this done super quick!

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.432
Wait a second.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.502
You might not wanna
make it sound so easy.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.437
But...if we do not
act on this quickly,

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.373
the villagers
are going to suffer.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.608
Yes, that's true, but...

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:16.109
saying we can get it
"done quickly"

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.511
isn't necessarily accurate.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.813
This is different from
the Byakuya Gang stuff

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.382
because we're actually
gonna be helping people.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.717
[chuckle]

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.150
[chuckles]

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:26.720
Yes! Let's get to it!

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:27.854
(SARADA &amp; MITSUKI)
Right!

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:28.622
[sigh]

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:32.158
Uhhh...

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:34.260
Long time no see, guys!

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:36.062
Is your arm
all better now, Metal?

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:37.731
Yes!
I am as good as new.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.300
I'm so glad to see
you've recovered.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.536
Hey, sorry for all
the trouble we caused.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.538
I promise to do my best!

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.172
It's your first mission
in a while.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.941
Are you feeling nervous?

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.776
[laugh]
Yeah, kinda...

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.646
We have to put
our best effort into this.

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.648
Hey, Udon...
You got a mission already?

00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:55.949
[sniff]

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:59.185
Oh, hey, Konohamaru.
Yeah, it sure looks that way.

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.488
All right. Let's see what
the assignment is for Team 5.

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:03.957
[gulps and sighs]

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.593
"Enrollment in the Academy's
ninjutsu curriculum

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:08.629
"has been steadily
dropping every year,

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:11.532
"so you will all appear in
a promotional documentary."

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.133
A documentary?

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.635
We've never done that!

00:07:14.668 --> 00:07:17.437
I wanna be in the documentary,
Ms. Suika! Pick me!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.572
As I was saying...

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.040
Pull yourself together.

00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:22.676
You were just talking about
helping people remember?

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:23.076
[grunts]

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.344
Heh heh.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.212
We're gonna set out
on our mission.

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:28.148
Huh? But wait a second...

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:30.851
[sigh]
Fine...

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:32.152
[grunt]

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:35.622
I don't know, you guys...
This is an unusual mission.

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.358
A‐Are you sure we are
qualified to do this?

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.527
We are just coming off
a suspension.

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:42.228
Yeah, since it's for PR,

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:45.231
shouldn't it be a team that's
already distinguished itself?

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:46.767
‐ [growling]
‐ Oh! I'm sorry!

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.669
I didn't mean it like that!

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:50.036
This could be our chance!

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.505
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:54.007
If we could somehow shine
in this promotional video,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.409
then our reputation
would really sky rocket!

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:57.778
Oh yeah!
That makes sense!

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.479
This really could
be our chance!

00:07:59.513 --> 00:08:00.180
(UDON)
You guys...

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.682
Huh?

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.884
Your suspension being lifted
doesn't mean anything.

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.185
[sniff]

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:08.522
In fact, from now on,
your true worth as a shinobi

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:09.355
will be questioned
at every turn.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.824
Of course!

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:13.694
We'll just have to prove
ourselves with our actions!

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.232
<i>Ch‐Ch‐Ch‐Ch‐Check,</i>
<i>is this on?</i>

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.634
<i>Mmmm!</i>
<i>D‐Don't slack off!</i>

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.903
Y‐You hear me?!
‐ What're you doing?! Cut!

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.270
You need to relax!

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:25.506
We're not filming a drama here

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:26.607
so you need to
settle down a bit.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.708
Just be natural.

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:30.176
Oh, uh...right...
I am very sorry.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.411
Damn it.

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.713
I'm under a lot of pressure
right now

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.447
to come up with
some cool footage.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.617
Th‐That's the director's job
all right!

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.984
Don't be a smart aleck!

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.020
This thing has to
be cool and flashy!

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:43.456
This documentary must convey
the "ideal image of a shinobi"

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:45.726
so that it draws in
potential applicants.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:48.662
Oh right! We got it.
We'll be cool and flashy!

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.732
I'm counting on you.
Let's go.

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:52.533
Rolling!

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:56.069
‐ Mmmmm...!
‐ Mmmmm...!

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:56.803
[sniff]

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.039
Oh, there you are!

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.107
Look, I really don't think
this is gonna work out.

00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.609
What's the problem?

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.845
I didn't want to have to
ask you this, Captain, but...

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.312
Do you think that
there's another team

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:06.947
you could introduce me to?

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.148
Huh?

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:10.651
The thing is...if they're
gonna act so nervous,

00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:12.519
I just can't film them
like that.

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:13.720
Would you mind talking
to Lord Hokage

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:14.420
about getting another team?

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:16.056
I'm sorry,

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:19.359
but this team was personally
chosen by Lord Hokage himself.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.126
Huh?

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.364
Ah...but, you know...

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.465
[exhale]

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.900
They're the same guys

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.369
who were just released
from suspension, right?

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.704
I'm a bit worried...

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.639
You don't have anything
to worry about.

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:35.141
They are all
exceptional shinobi.

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.043
Oh? Is that right?

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.745
Well, since you're
their jonin in charge...

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:39.880
maybe I should just
listen to you

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.948
and continue filming, right?

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:43.550
You know, I used to
want to be a ninja

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:45.051
at one time in my life!

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.053
I mean, jutsus are like...
the coolest thing.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:50.056
You know what I'm saying?!
[laughing]

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:54.360
Okay, let's try it again!

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.033
Stop there! Cut!

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:00.801
‐ Hmmm?
‐ Hmmm?

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:02.869
You guys still look tense!

00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:05.572
Ah, I just wanted to get
an everyday‐type of shot...

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:06.940
but I guess you guys

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:09.543
just don't have that
kind of spark, do ya?

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.711
Huh?

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:12.412
Guys! Listen up!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.280
Try doing something
more ninja‐like!

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.749
Or at least something edgy!

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.552
W‐We can definitely do that!
Right?!

00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:19.485
‐ Right!
‐ Right!

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.253
[grunt]

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.657
Earth Style: Mud Wall!

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.894
Hmph!

00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:30.396
Wow!

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.966
Leaf Hurricane!

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.235
Nice one!

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:38.104
Denki!

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:40.040
[pained grunt]

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:45.979
Substitution...Jutsu!

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:49.550
Fantastic! Now that's what
I call ninja‐like!

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:51.451
This is what I've been
looking for all along!

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.619
[gasps]

00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:53.554
(UDON)
Just a minute!

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:53.954
‐ Hmmm?
‐ Hmmm?

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.724
You guys are scaring
everybody in the village.

00:10:57.758 --> 00:11:00.426
[murmuring]

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.196
[gasp and groans]

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.264
But Sensei...

00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:05.999
If we have to worry about
things like that,

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.502
then I'm going to miss
getting all the cool shots!

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:09.736
A ninja's life...

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.272
has to be super dramatic
and spectacular!

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.607
That's what'll capture

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.576
the eyes of
potential applicants, right?

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:17.210
I know!
We should block traffic

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.646
and that way,
we won't have to scare anyone.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.114
I've decided that

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:23.216
we're not able to carry out
this particular mission.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.618
I'm very sorry,

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.152
but our team must withdraw
from this project.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:26.753
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:28.288
B‐But that's‐‐!

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.557
You can't just suddenly decide
to withdraw your team

00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:32.092
in the middle of a production.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.727
I still have many more
cool scenes

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.495
I was planning to shoot.

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:37.598
[sniff and exhale]

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:38.832
What do you guys think?

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.601
You think that
getting "cool shots"

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:42.536
is important for
this film as well?

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:43.970
Ah... Yeah, I guess so.

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:45.939
If we want more kids
to become ninja.

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:48.174
Those kinds of shots
might help, right?

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.276
It's important to
show 'em ninjutsu.

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:53.379
We're pulling out
from this mission now.

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:54.548
[groans]

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.248
But why?!

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.783
Fine then.

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:59.653
I have no idea what you're
suddenly so unhappy about.

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:01.087
But I'll tell ya this:

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:03.489
I never wanted a bunch of
wannabe ninja losers

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:05.325
who've been suspended
to be in my film

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:06.426
in the first place!

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.761
[groans]

00:12:07.794 --> 00:12:08.695
I'll just have to
make a request

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.163
for more suitable ninja

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:13.600
and start my film over again
from the beginning!

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:16.970
Seriously! What was
Lord Hokage thinking?!

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:19.272
Choosing kids like you
to be in this film!

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.173
Let's go!

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:22.408
[grunts and groans]

00:12:23.644 --> 00:12:25.078
[grunting]

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:33.386
[grunting]

00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:35.622
<i>I'll just have to</i>
<i>make a request</i>

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:37.223
<i>for more suitable ninja</i>

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.826
<i>and start my film</i>
<i>over again from the beginning!</i>

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.228
I'm a capable ninja!

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.296
It's not fair!

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.666
Why does it always
end up like this?!

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:48.034
[roar]

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:54.541
[roar]

00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:56.009
Damn it!

00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:01.281
[grunt and emotional breaths]

00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:02.716
Stop!
Do not do it!

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:04.685
[pained grunt]

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:06.452
Damn it...
What are you doing!?

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:07.487
[grunt]

00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:08.722
The headband is the symbol

00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:10.423
that proves you are
a real ninja!

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.859
If you throw it away,
it means you are a quitter!

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:14.227
You swore over and over again

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.696
that you would make it
as a ninja

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:16.963
during the Genin Exams.

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.331
So was that a lie?!

00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:21.267
I haven't thrown it away yet!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.069
Stop!
Please, guys, stop fighting!

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:25.038
‐ Let go, Denki!
‐ [pained grunt]

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:26.339
Ahhh!

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.241
[gasp]

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:30.143
Stop right there.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.915
Seriously...

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:37.317
You guys just
got out of suspension.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.986
Do you really want to go
through it all over again?

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:42.656
Shut up.

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:43.389
Hm?!

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:44.658
Iwabe, stop!

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:45.892
I said, shut up!

00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:47.661
You can't understand
losers like us

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.062
'cuz you've always been
the cool teacher,

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:51.965
who's never had to
deal with any of it!

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.768
You think I've always
been cool?

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.302
Oh yeah!
That's right...

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.506
You guys never saw how awkward
I was back in the day.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.041
[gasps]

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.576
As a matter of fact...

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.045
I was a complete loser.

00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:10.316
The Academy was run
differently back then,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.622
but I failed the graduation
exam several times.

00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:17.691
Really...Udon Sensei?

00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:20.927
Even when I became a genin,
I messed up on my missions...

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:24.030
and I was a burden to
Konohomaru and Moegi too.

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:26.332
I‐I can't believe it...

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.467
[sniff]

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.170
But then, it was because
I went through all that,

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.405
that I realized something.

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:35.876
Until that's true for you,
no more missions.

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:38.244
C'mon.
Let's go and report in.

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:39.279
Yes, sir.

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:43.750
<i>What do you guys think?</i>

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:45.318
<i>You think that</i>
<i>getting cool shots</i>

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:47.521
<i>is important for</i>
<i>this film as well?</i>

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.590
What exactly...did he mean?

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.702
I was planning to do
the action shots right here...

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.070
to bring the film
to an exciting climax.

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.906
Now it's all for nothing.

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.674
Oh...um...okay...

00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:09.109
Should we remove
the paper bombs

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:10.777
that we set up earlier then?

00:15:10.811 --> 00:15:12.813
Nah... It's already set up...

00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:14.480
and it's a condemned building
anyway,

00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:18.585
so maybe we can still get some
usable footage out of it, huh?

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.053
Let's go ahead and blow it up

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.556
and see what kind of awesome
shots we can get!

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:29.229
[chattering]

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:30.631
Huh?

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:36.603
Heh?

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:43.343
Wow... That was a really
small explosion.

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:44.377
Tch.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.679
Let's do it again.

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:50.951
If we just get a shot
of the smoke rising,

00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:53.520
it really isn't going
to be all that exciting.

00:15:53.554 --> 00:15:54.287
Huh?

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:55.789
Oh...

00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:57.958
It's coming from up there.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.461
Ahhh!

00:16:02.763 --> 00:16:05.231
Great Leaf Hurricane!

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:08.535
[gasp]
Wait, isn't that‐‐?

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.004
Did anybody get hurt?!

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:12.272
You okay?!

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.340
Denki, please give us
your analysis!

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:15.108
Right!

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.179
(DENKI) I'm inside
the building's system,

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:20.581
activating the cameras!

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:24.117
I'm honing in on
the center of the crack.

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:26.219
It's not good.

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:29.422
The roof is about to collapse!
We've got to evacuate!

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:30.190
[gasps]

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.761
[gasps]

00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:35.461
[grunt]

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:37.798
[grunt]
Iwabe!

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:38.565
Right!

00:16:44.738 --> 00:16:46.006
Ahhh!

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.575
Don't worry, I got this!

00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:49.342
Huh?

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.078
Earth Style! Stone Brick!

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:56.750
[winding up]

00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:01.755
[winding up]

00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:07.961
[grunt]

00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:10.997
[panting]

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.733
That...was amazing!

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.137
Sensei! Watch out!

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.440
It's way too dangerous now!
We gotta get outta here!

00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:21.041
[sniff]

00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:21.942
Just a second...

00:17:21.975 --> 00:17:23.109
I'm about to show you

00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:24.978
an interesting jutsu
right now.

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.548
Actually, it's kind of
become my specialty.

00:17:27.581 --> 00:17:30.984
But you guys have
to promise not to laugh.

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:33.053
Ninja Art: Dripping Nose!

00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:43.329
‐ Ahhh!
‐ Ahhh!

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:52.839
‐ Ahhh!
‐ Ahhh!

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.277
Hm? Hehhhh!

00:18:01.715 --> 00:18:02.516
[gasps]

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:03.850
It's incredible...

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:05.986
It is snot though...
[laughing]

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:08.488
No, it doesn't matter
what it is.

00:18:08.522 --> 00:18:11.357
You stopped all this rubble!
Instantly!

00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:12.092
[gasp]

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:13.426
<i>What do you guys think?</i>

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.161
<i>You think that getting</i>
<i>cool shots</i>

00:18:15.195 --> 00:18:16.797
<i>is important for</i>
<i>this film as well?</i>

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.100
<i>I get it now.</i>
<i>That's why Sensei said that...</i>

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:20.867
[sniff]

00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:24.070
Everything's all right now.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:25.572
(DENKI) Doing stuff

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:29.242
just to look cool doesn't
necessarily mean it is cool.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.877
And what we were taught
at the Academy

00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:32.913
about being ninja
had nothing to do

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.215
with whether or not
we looked cool.

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:37.283
But all we were concerned
with was how we look,

00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:39.085
so we tried to show off.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.721
Ugh... That was really lame.

00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:43.724
Well, it seems that
you finally understand.

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:45.926
It's a fact that enrollment
at the Academy

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.794
has been steadily dropping.

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:49.395
But you know...

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:52.198
It's not the cool ones
who become ninja.

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:55.636
Only those with determination
can become ninja.

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:58.338
No matter how tough
the training and lessons are,

00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:00.774
even if you're covered in
mud and sweat

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.275
and look "uncool"...

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.378
you still have the strongest
desire to become a ninja.

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:08.481
That's the kind of student
the Academy needs.

00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:11.918
You three did great
rescuing everyone back there.

00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:13.587
You put everything
into practice,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.922
and all of you did
a flawless job.

00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:18.625
I think I'm finally beginning
to understand why it is

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:21.995
Lord Hokage chose our team
for this particular mission.

00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:23.730
No way, he did?

00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:24.497
[chuckle]

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:27.901
Hey, Iwabe,
where's your headband?

00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:29.102
Huh?

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:32.238
‐ Oh no! Where did it go?!
‐ [gasps]

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:35.308
You must have lost it
during all the chaos.

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:36.610
We will definitely find it,

00:19:36.643 --> 00:19:38.845
even if we end up
looking all night!

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:39.980
No.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:40.981
It's okay, Metal.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.448
What? But why?

00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:45.385
It's my punishment for
trying to toss it earlier.

00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:46.887
Besides, it's not about
whether or not

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.121
you have a headband on.

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:49.690
That's not what
makes you a ninja.

00:19:49.723 --> 00:19:52.358
What really matters is
the action you take.

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:54.561
‐ That is cool, Iwabe...
‐ Cool, Iwabe...

00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:55.796
Um...

00:19:55.829 --> 00:19:58.164
I realize I have no right
to ask you this, but...

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.633
If it's okay,

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:02.268
do you think I could
continue filming your team?

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:03.770
N‐No, it's our fault.

00:20:03.804 --> 00:20:05.438
We're the ones
who pulled out earlier.

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:07.674
Are you sure
it's our team you want?

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:10.210
I wouldn't want to do it
with anyone else.

00:20:10.243 --> 00:20:13.146
I promise to make
a great documentary.

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:14.380
[chuckle]

00:20:20.954 --> 00:20:22.889
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>right over there please!</i>

00:20:22.923 --> 00:20:24.591
<i>[grunt]</i>
<i>Ah!</i>

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:27.293
<i>One‐two, one‐two,</i>
<i>one‐two...</i>

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:29.696
(NARUTO) I was a loser
at one time too, you know.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.864
‐ Huh?!
‐ Huh?!

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:33.466
I failed my graduation exams
over and over

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:35.736
and I always got
scolded by Iruka.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.905
L‐Lord Hokage?!
That's hard to imagine...

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:40.841
Yeah, I cannot believe it.

00:20:40.874 --> 00:20:42.776
Your name is Iwabe, right?

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:45.478
[gasp] Y‐You actually
know my name?

00:20:45.512 --> 00:20:46.647
I do!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.949
I heard there was
an amazing student this year

00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:49.983
who was a repeater!

00:20:50.016 --> 00:20:53.219
[gasp and quivering]

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.588
Even if you repeated,

00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:57.057
you gave it your all
to become a genin, right?

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.158
[quivering]

00:20:58.191 --> 00:20:59.560
It's guys like you,

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:02.062
with the guts to stick it out
no matter what

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.397
that the Academy needs
more than ever.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.199
So can you see why I thought

00:21:06.232 --> 00:21:08.935
this mission
was perfect for you?

00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:10.470
You've already made it
this far.

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:12.405
You're a totally cool ninja.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.808
It doesn't matter
if you're genin or chunin.

00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:18.679
Don't rush.
Focus on getting stronger.

00:21:18.712 --> 00:21:19.445
[gasp]

00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:20.881
[stunned exhale]

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:23.850
Everyone helped to
look for it.

00:21:23.884 --> 00:21:25.686
Don't lose it again, okay?

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:26.953
[gasp]

00:21:26.987 --> 00:21:29.355
[chuckles]

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:33.994
[quivering into sobbing]
Th‐Thank you very much!

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:39.365
[sobbing]

00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:43.436
They were cool.

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:44.871
That was well done.

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:48.108
Yeah, I think this film
will be super popular.

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.375
I really question

00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:52.045
the choice of putting Dad
in it though.

00:21:52.078 --> 00:21:53.680
Damn it,
we should've been the ones

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.149
starring in this documentary!

00:21:56.182 --> 00:21:59.686
That's right!
We can't afford to lose!

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.453
[chuckle]

00:22:04.024 --> 00:22:05.659
<i>Oh yeah,</i>
<i>come to think of it,</i>

00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:07.393
<i>I never took</i>
<i>the Chunin Exam,</i>

00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:09.195
<i>so I guess</i>
<i>I'm still a genin.</i>

00:22:09.229 --> 00:22:10.797
‐ Huh?!
‐ Huh?!

00:23:44.525 --> 00:23:46.192
(SUMIRE) Once we capture
the Miniature Monkey,

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:47.528
we'll complete our mission.

00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:48.762
(WASABI)
Leave it to me, okay?

00:23:48.795 --> 00:23:49.763
(NAMIDA)
Shouldn't we figure out

00:23:49.796 --> 00:23:51.497
a strategy together instead?

00:23:51.532 --> 00:23:53.534
(WASABI) No, this'll be fine.
Be quiet, Namida!

00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:55.168
(NAMIDA) But... I...

00:23:55.201 --> 00:23:58.104
(WASABI) It's so annoying when
you start bawling like that!

00:23:58.138 --> 00:24:00.106
(NAMIDA)
Wasabi, you're so mean!

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.775
I don't care anymore!

00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:05.078
Next time on Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:05.946
(WASABI)
Wasabi and...

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:07.247
(NAMIDA)
Namida!

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.383
(SUMIRE) [nervous groan]
Wait, just hold on, you guys!

00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:11.618
Don't fight!
