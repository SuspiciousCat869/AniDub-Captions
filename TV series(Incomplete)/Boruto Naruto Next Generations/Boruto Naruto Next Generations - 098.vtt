(♪♪ Japanese Theme Music ♪♪)

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:51.979
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.289
Good morning, Boruto.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.390
Hey!

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.859
Tell me, did you hear we're
going on a joint mission

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:07.060
with Team 15 today?

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.596
Oh, that's different.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.598
Well, no matter who
we're teamed up with...

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:15.035
I'm sure that Team 7 will be
the one to wrap this up quick!

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.004
I thought you might say that.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.642
Huh?

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.413
Is something the matter?

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:36.123
(bird cawing)

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.367
Is that a Peeping
Tom over there?

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.468
In broad daylight?

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.738
How about we scare
him a little bit?

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:55.542
Ah.

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:58.212
(screams)

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.847
Hey, you, Peeping Tom!

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.115
You can't just creep
on people like that!

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:06.453
(grunting)

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:11.758
Looks like you were
wrong about him.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.697
[Boruto] I'm so sorry!

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.733
I didn't know you were up
in that tree studying birds!

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.901
No, it's okay.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.003
I'm just glad the
eggs are still safe.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.838
There, there, little guys!

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:28.275
Wow, Tosaka, you
really like birds, huh?

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.545
Boruto!

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.013
Huh?

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.014
Could it be?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.616
Do you like birds, too?

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:36.917
Huh, me?

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.185
They're okay.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.554
I just suddenly had a
feeling that you did!

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:41.788
Look at this nest!

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:42.923
(licking)

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.025
I'm certain, that it belongs

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.261
to the Long-Tailed Swift Pigeon!

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.364
You licked it!

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.600
Imagine, me finding a super
rare nest here, of all places.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:54.735
How lucky!

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:56.904
He just licked that egg, right?

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.372
I want to observe everything,

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.874
not just with eyes and
ears, but taste, too.

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:02.776
After all, they say
the tongue speaks

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.911
louder than the mouth, right?

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.079
No, nobody says that!

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:08.715
(birds cooing)

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.020
There you go!

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:14.254
Good as new.

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:15.422
Sorry.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.091
Is that species
really that rare?

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.027
The feathers that
are on the tail

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.862
of the Long-Tailed Swift Pigeon

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:25.732
are a little longer than those
of an ordinary Swift Pigeon.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.733
What?

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:27.768
That's it?

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.336
It may just be a
slight difference...

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.872
but all of it is
written in their genes.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.073
In their genes.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.742
You mean the things that
make up chromosomes?

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.211
[Tosaka] The long tail feathers,

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:40.180
the bird's instinct to
return to its nest like this.

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:41.882
Genes determine the appearance

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.384
and behavioral patterns
of all living things!

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.787
So are you telling us
that all this stuff

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.989
is predetermined
before we're born?

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.258
For some things.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.561
Like your hair and eye
color, your physical agility,

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:56.096
your likes and dislikes.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.398
Come on, where's the
fun in all of that?

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:00.868
Who I am has nothing
to do with my genes.

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.736
I'm who I choose
to be, you know?

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.338
Uh-huh, I see.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:07.074
Well, you are very
interesting, that's for sure.

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:09.710
Do you mind if I give
you a quick lick?

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:11.845
(licking)

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:12.846
What?

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.847
No way!

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.215
See ya, Tosaka.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.618
Just make sure you don't do
anything too weird, okay?

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:18.919
See you again soon, Boruto.

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:20.787
Bye, Mitsuki!

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.856
We really got
sidetracked by that.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.992
You think Sarada will be mad?

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:28.896
[Boruto] Oh yeah, she's mad.

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:30.797
We're really sorry!

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.933
Ugh, yeah, whatever.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.334
As I explained to you before,

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:37.037
the mission that you're being
given will be a joint one

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.806
carried out by both
Team 7 and Team 15.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.777
That sounds great, but where's
Big Sis Hanabi, you guys?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.779
Hey, it's Hanabi Sensei, got it?

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.147
Yeah, that's right!

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:49.850
You may be related to her,
but she's still our captain.

00:05:49.883 --> 00:05:51.351
Yeah, okay, okay.

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:54.188
Hanabi's busy assisting
the border patrol team now.

00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:57.024
It seems that there may
have been an infiltration.

00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:58.559
For the duration
of this mission,

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:01.261
I'm gonna be leading
both teams as captain.

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:03.397
So then, what's our mission?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.099
Your mission is
investigate and try,

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:08.735
to find the cause of
aggressive wildlife.

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:10.237
Aggressive wildlife?

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.573
In a village near the
Land of Fire's border,

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:15.008
some birds have basically
been going into a frenzy

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:16.577
and attacking people.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.078
The entire forest in that area

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.080
is the birds' natural habitat.

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:23.250
We've been asked to find the
cause and try to stop it.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.419
And that's why we
need two teams, right?

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:28.288
Because the area we have to
check out is so extensive.

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:29.356
Seriously?

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.525
Hanabi Sensei gets to
be in a real battle

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:34.194
while we're stuck in the woods
babysitting a bunch of birds?

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.395
Hey, quit complaining!

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:36.396
Yeah, she's right.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.632
Even small missions are
worth our time, Boruto.

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:39.633
That's right!

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:40.634
You tell him!

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:41.602
Thanks, Class Rep!

00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:42.669
(giggles)

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:45.172
Oh, man, why do I keep
running into birds today?

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:47.741
Well, anyway, let's just
get going, you guys!

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:48.842
Okay!

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:50.344
But before you leave.

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:53.046
We may be experts when it
comes to things like ninjutsu,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.515
but we're completely clueless

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:56.717
when it comes to knowing
anything about birds.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.187
And that's why a specialist
who specializes in birds

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.756
has been 'specially chosen
to accompanying you!

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.759
Wow, that's a lot of specials.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.227
[Suika] Oh, here he is now!

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.763
Mr. Tosaka the ornithologist!

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.465
Hello, there!

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.466
Oh, hey!

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.734
Hi, Boruto!

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:14.701
No way!

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:15.736
Tosaka?

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.013
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I see.

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:27.848
The birds around
here mainly subsist

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.551
on the berries of the
Bullseye Creeping Vine.

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:31.852
That guy's over there poking

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:33.587
at some bird poop on the ground.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.557
At least the only thing
he's doing is poking at it.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.791
Huh?

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.094
I'm almost positive that it's
the Bullseye Creeping Vine.

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:44.264
But to be sure I need to
look into this more closely.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.434
What the...

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.403
What does that guy
think he's doing now?

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:51.738
He has a habit of
licking everything.

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:52.739
Ha!

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:53.740
I knew it!

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:55.008
Mr. Tosaka, let's hurry.

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.711
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:08:00.881
When it comes to birds, it's
just so easy for me

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:01.915
to become engrossed.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.250
He licked it.

00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:09.389
You know, guys, I think that
a mission involving animals

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:10.357
is perfect for us!

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.059
I mean, it's right up our alley!

00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:14.261
We have experience with
them from that one mission.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:15.529
All right, this time around,

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.731
let's outdo Boruto and
the rest of his team!

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:22.402
(upbeat rock music)

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.172
Stay alert.

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:01.375
The village is just
up ahead over there.

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.911
I'm not hearing any
strange sounds so far.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:05.579
That's got to be
good news, right?

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:08.549
To be honest, I actually
think it's too quiet.

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:11.919
I don't hear a single
bird chirping or anything.

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:12.886
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.588
Something feels weird here.

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:15.589
[Villager] Stop!

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.724
(frightened yell)

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:18.725
Team 15!

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.727
Stand by and guard Mr. Tosaka!

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:22.329
Team 7, come with me!

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:28.569
It came from nearby.

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:40.781
Ah!

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:41.782
Boruto!

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:42.783
I'm okay!

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.017
Go on, keep moving!

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:47.754
(grunting)

00:09:56.496 --> 00:09:58.098
Who are you guys?

00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:00.033
We've come from the Hidden Leaf.

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:01.568
To help you.

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:02.603
Lightning Ball!

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:08.876
Damn it!

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:10.110
Stop!

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:17.484
Not good.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.592
Why did they attack
all of a sudden?

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:33.300
Who's there?

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:41.642
(angry roar)

00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:46.914
I don't suppose I'm
lucky enough that you're

00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:48.615
the caretaker of the birds.

00:10:52.786 --> 00:10:55.422
(angry roar)

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:09.736
Wow, that guy's powerful!

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.539
(angry growl)

00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:14.741
(angry roar)

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:18.045
What could be making that noise?

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:20.080
Namida, just stay focused!

00:11:37.965 --> 00:11:40.000
Come on, you monster!

00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:02.256
Boruto!

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:06.059
Thanks, I owe you
one, Class Rep.

00:12:06.093 --> 00:12:07.261
You, too, Nue.

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:09.763
Hey, when did you
become so big, anyway?

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.999
(growling)

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.735
It's all okay, Nue.

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:16.136
You can relax now.

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:22.075
Thank you so much.

00:12:22.109 --> 00:12:23.911
I was out foraging
for wild greens

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:25.879
when I was suddenly attacked.

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:27.247
Is your village close by here?

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.750
Yes, I can show you the way.

00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:31.985
Oh good, you guys are okay!

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.188
Careful.

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:36.089
This is no ordinary forest.

00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:38.625
A monster just appeared
and attacked me.

00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:40.794
What do you mean, monster?

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:42.429
Well, I'm not really sure.

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:44.631
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:46.266
(villager grunting)

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.068
Boruto, we'll talk later on.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.237
You can tell me
the details then.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.973
Right now, we need to get
this man to his village.

00:12:57.211 --> 00:13:00.247
(shallow heavy breathing)

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.082
His breathing's very shallow.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.885
And his temperature
is rising, as well.

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:06.887
By the way, Sumire,
really awesome job.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.722
You saved Boruto!

00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:10.624
I just happened to be there.

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.725
-Is something wrong?
-Huh?

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.293
You seem a little bit down.

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:16.897
Actually, I knew
you could do it!

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.899
Keep up the good work, Nue.

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:21.602
(chuckles)

00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:22.970
Sumire, are you?

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:28.075
No, it's okay.

00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:32.379
Huh?

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:33.413
Hey!

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:41.388
We've come here from
the Hidden Leaf Village

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:42.789
at your request.

00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:45.359
Yes, thank you very
much for coming.

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:48.028
Please, bring him this
way, if you would.

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:50.364
Please come, Mr. Tosaka.

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:52.399
I want to investigate
this thoroughly.

00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:53.400
Oh.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:54.401
Yeah, sure!

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.507
(labored heavy breathing)

00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:03.410
You think that his illness
was caused by that bird?

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:05.212
There are many
instances where birds

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.014
have been known
to spread disease.

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:08.916
But still, I
couldn't say for sure

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:11.084
without investigating
more fully.

00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:13.086
It was just about a month ago

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.390
when we first began noticing
the changes in the birds.

00:14:16.423 --> 00:14:18.358
They started
destroying our crops

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:21.228
and then eventually
began attacking people.

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.931
It was also around that
time that we began hearing

00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:27.234
strange beastly cries
coming from the forest.

00:14:33.807 --> 00:14:35.542
Beastly cries, huh?

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:36.543
Yes.

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:37.578
Frightening cries,

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:39.713
as though they came from
the depths of the Earth.

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:42.716
We were wondering if the
cause might be in the river

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:43.884
since the first animals

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:46.186
to start acting
abnormally were waterfowl.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.855
And where's the
source of the river?

00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:50.557
It flows from the top of the
mountain, past the village,

00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:52.860
and into the Land of
Rivers next to us.

00:14:52.893 --> 00:14:54.361
For the time being,

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.530
don't go near the river
until the cause is found.

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:59.299
Please only use well water
for your daily needs.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.268
Mm.

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:03.737
[Village Woman] I knew it!

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:07.875
What's that?

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:10.077
What did she mean, I knew it?

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.479
Oh, well, you see...

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:16.016
(low groans)

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:30.564
What's up?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.000
It looks like something's
going on over there!

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.002
Who's this?

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:37.404
He was found unconscious
by the river.

00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:43.610
Wait, hold on.

00:15:43.644 --> 00:15:44.912
I think I know him.

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.013
Huh?

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:47.181
His name's Jugo.

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:49.716
He was at Orochimaru's place.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.784
Yes.

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:51.885
It's him all right.

00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:53.921
Both of you are friends of his?

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:56.323
No, I wouldn't
call him a friend.

00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:03.030
Hello, it's Sarada Uchiha.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.732
Do you remember me at all, Jugo?

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:11.138
[Sumire] You were found
unconscious down by the river.

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:16.844
I probably just slipped and
then fell into the river.

00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:18.078
Boy, I thought for sure

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.480
you were gonna say that
a monster attacked you.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.549
A monster?

00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:24.751
It came out of the forest.

00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:26.720
And it was on a serious rampage.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.991
Oh, I see.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.561
(angry hiss)

00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:35.596
Hey, stop that.

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:40.901
So, Jugo, what are
you doing out here

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:42.302
by this village, anyway?

00:16:45.873 --> 00:16:48.542
(low groans)

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:49.910
This marking looks...

00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:51.778
Could it be?

00:16:51.812 --> 00:16:54.014
If the villagers
find out about this,

00:16:54.047 --> 00:16:56.049
who knows what they'll say?

00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:57.918
That's why you
didn't mention this

00:16:57.951 --> 00:16:59.586
when requesting our help?

00:17:00.654 --> 00:17:02.856
I'm begging you, help us.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.658
Find the cause and stop this!

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:22.643
(frightened yell)

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.014
No, please!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.049
Just stay away from me!

00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:31.084
(angry yell)

00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:33.253
What are those
markings on his skin?

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.257
Boruto, protect Tosaka!

00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:39.860
The rest of you,
evacuate the villagers!

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:41.428
[All] Yes, sir!

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:43.730
(angry roar)

00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:54.074
(attacking yell)

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:57.911
Wait a second, isn't he?

00:17:57.945 --> 00:17:59.880
(attacking snarl)

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:00.881
Jugo, no!

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.584
(pursuing snarl)

00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:13.660
Jugo, what?

00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:18.732
Stay away from the forest!

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.468
What do you mean by that?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.842
Boruto, where is Jugo?

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.010
Well, uh...

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.278
Hey, look!

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:38.752
The markings have faded.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.888
What does that mean?

00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:43.290
I guess we'll just have
to go and find out.

00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:54.034
Careful.

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:56.537
The pattern we saw earlier
is called a Curse Mark.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.771
Curse Mark?

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:58.772
That's right.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.040
One effect of a Curse Mark

00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:02.376
is to stimulate a creature's
fighting instincts.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:04.845
So that's why he
suddenly went berserk.

00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:07.281
The birds going into a frenzy.

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:08.315
You think?

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.251
And it's also well known

00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:14.087
that Orochimaru
utilizes Curse Marks.

00:19:14.121 --> 00:19:16.890
Is that guy mixed
up in this, too?

00:19:16.924 --> 00:19:19.092
But that isn't the
real problem right now.

00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:21.261
The bigger concern
is that man Jugo

00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:23.564
supposedly also
possesses a Curse Mark.

00:19:23.597 --> 00:19:26.600
And it's one that's
extremely dangerous, to boot.

00:19:27.568 --> 00:19:29.536
Do you think that Jugo
in involved in this?

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.206
Well, I don't think it's
all just a coincidence.

00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:34.374
In any case, make
sure to keep in mind

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:36.543
that whatever's in this
forest is more dangerous

00:19:36.577 --> 00:19:39.279
than anything we've
ever encountered before.

00:19:39.313 --> 00:19:40.314
[All] Right!

00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:44.718
[Konohamaru] Mitsuki and I
will continue to move forward.

00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:46.887
Team 15, head downriver.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.755
Boruto and Sarada, upriver.

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:51.925
If you find anything,

00:19:51.959 --> 00:19:54.061
don't try to deal
with it by yourselves.

00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:56.763
Make sure that you
contact your comrades.

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:02.269
(sigh)

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:07.307
Hey, are you taking this
seriously and looking?

00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:11.278
What are you doing now?

00:20:12.746 --> 00:20:14.748
(echoing)

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:16.884
Wait, that sound.

00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:18.018
Right?

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.119
It's an echo.

00:20:19.152 --> 00:20:20.754
I've been thinking
about that villager.

00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:22.890
Remember how he
said that he heard

00:20:22.923 --> 00:20:24.191
what sounded like
beastly cries that

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.560
coming from the
depths of the Earth?

00:20:26.593 --> 00:20:29.429
The village is over in
that direction, right?

00:20:29.463 --> 00:20:32.566
And the wind is blowing
from north to south.

00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:36.303
The slope of the mountain is
just about 20 degrees, so.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.074
I think we found it.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.721
This thing's really solid.

00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:56.657
It's like an underground prison.

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:01.562
[Sarada] Wait, shouldn't we
contact Konohamaru Sensei?

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:04.898
[Boruto] He said only
when we find Jugo, right?

00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:08.268
(sigh) You're always
so sly like that.

00:21:08.302 --> 00:21:09.736
(groaning)

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.004
Is that Jugo?

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:12.739
Do you think that he's hurt?

00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:15.709
Don't come near me!

00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:17.110
Please, just stay away!

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:21.014
(heavy breathing)

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.723
(animalistic growl)

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:31.925
It's us, Jugo.

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:34.761
We came here to try
and help you out.

00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:38.265
(low growl)

00:21:39.433 --> 00:21:40.601
Jugo, are you?

00:21:43.937 --> 00:21:46.240
Sarada, we gotta get
out of here right now.

00:21:51.912 --> 00:21:52.713
He's...

00:21:54.815 --> 00:21:56.650
The one I ran into before.

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:01.088
He's the monster!

00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:04.057
(eager laughter)

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.993
I'm gonna kill the both of you!

00:22:11.064 --> 00:22:14.301
(ending theme music)

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.792
So Jugo was the monster?

00:23:45.826 --> 00:23:47.628
What is going on?

00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:48.629
[Konohamaru] This is bad.

00:23:48.662 --> 00:23:50.397
Full Curse Mark Transformation.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.932
[Boruto] Curse Mark
Transformation?

00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:53.534
What does that mean?

00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:55.502
[Konohamaru] It's not just
a physical transformation.

00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:58.405
Right now, he's being controlled
by homicidal impulses.

00:23:58.438 --> 00:24:01.175
If this keeps up, the
villagers will be in danger!

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:04.578
Next time on Boruto
