<i>(Himawari) [coughing]</i>

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:20.020
[heavy breathing/coughing]

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.122
(Boruto) Are you okay, Himawari?

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.225
There's been something going
around.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.328
Big Brother...

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.062
Hmm?

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.966
I want to eat...hamburger steak.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:37.638
Sure. When you get to feeling
better, Mom will make some for
you, okay?

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.241
(Boruto) So you just rest up now
<i>and get healthy.</i>

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.078
Okay.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:51.051
I'm gonna go now. I need to pick
up medicine for her.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.986
Would you keep an eye on
Himawari for me?

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.420
No problem.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.389
Hmm?

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.300
Yeah, that's right...

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.103
<i>(Boruto) We had a rough time</i>
<i>with Himawari back then, too.</i>

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.377
[mumbling/laughing]

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.848
[deep breath]

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:12.225
It's getting late. Where's
Naruto?

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.861
The ceremony starts really early
tomorrow.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:15.862
[mumbling]

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.631
[gasps]

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:22.002
Oh, no...

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.770
There you go.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.940
[hiccups]

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.742
Hey, you're home now.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:29.710
Oh, yeah...

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.213
Sorry, Hinata. He ended up
getting pretty wasted.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:38.785
[chuckles] Aw, poor Naruto. He's
never really been a strong
drinker.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.888
Naruto is finally going to take
center stage tomorrow!

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:46.392
And all of us will be there! All
of his friends will cheer him on
at full power!

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:52.132
Well, if you ask me, it's
obvious I gave up my seat so he
could be the 7th Hokage.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.567
That's quite the
claim you're making...

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.870
considering you were never a
candidate in the first place,
Kiba.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.739
[grunts] You shut up, Shino!

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:03.810
Hey guys, I'm sure that the kids
are probably asleep so could you
keep it down?

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:05.478
[sighs]

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:11.151
Iruka Sensei. I promise I'll
become the Hokage.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:14.054
I'm gonna show you I can do it,
ya know.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:14.955
[gasps]

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.023
[chuckles]

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:21.327
[snoring]

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:30.436
Mhm!

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:41.515
Can you two please go
wake your father up?

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:42.683
Okay!

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:49.656
Is Dad seriously still asleep?
He is so completely hopeless.
[yawns]

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.658
[giggles]

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:54.494
Daddy, wake up!

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:01.301
[snoring]

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.303
Hey Daddy!

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:08.241
Come on! Wake up!

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:09.342
<i>(Boruto) [laughs]</i>

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:13.479
All this cutesy coaxing isn't
gonna work on him, Himawari.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:18.384
Now watch and learn. We said get
up, ya know!

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.186
Huh?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.354
[grunts]

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.025
(Boruto/Himawari) Thank you for
<i>the food!</i>

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.960
<i>(Naruto) Yeah, thanks.</i>

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:31.397
Hey, isn't today the Hokage's
Inauguration or whatever it is?

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.299
Shouldn't you be getting up on
your own?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.736
Yes, you're absolutely right.

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:39.005
[giggles] Boruto's been looking
forward to it for a while.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.208
Last night he insisted on
waiting up for you until you got
home...

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:44.444
(Hinata) So he went to bed very
<i>late.</i>

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.479
Really? Is that so?

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.281
[grunts] Come on, Mom!

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:50.617
I can't wait! I can't wait!

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:53.654
(Hinata) I'm going to go pick up
<i>your formal attire.</i>

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.790
Huh? It isn't ready
yet? Really?

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.859
Sadly, it's not.

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:03.597
Apparently the artisan who's
doing the embroidery is very
picky.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.567
This is the one thing I can't
delegate!

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.436
This has been my job for many,
many, many years!

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.708
You see, She's done the
embroidery for every Hokage so
far, and wants it to be perfect.

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:18.812
<i>(Hinata) I was told that it</i>
<i>isn't going to be finished</i>
<i>until the very last minute.</i>

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:19.680
<i>Sorry.</i>

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.081
I see.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:26.352
<i>Oh, right. It wasn't finished</i>
<i>in time for Kakashi Sensei's</i>
<i>inauguration.</i>

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.723
<i>Man, how old is this lady by</i>
<i>now?</i>

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.793
I plan on going straight to the
venue after I pick it up.

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:35.796
So please go on ahead with the
kids and I'll meet you there.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.097
<i>(Naruto) Okay.</i>

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.031
Alright!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:38.965
Bye Mommy!

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.069
[crowd chatter]

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:49.009
So this means I'm finally being
relieved of my duties.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:52.813
I can't wait to spend the rest
of my life relaxing at a hot
spring.

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:57.350
Oh man, it's gonna be a drag if
you leave a bunch of work for us
to do.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:07:01.287
We're definitely going to need
you to stay on as a trusted
advisor.

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:04.991
Ahem! Smoking's not
allowed here, Sir.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.393
<i>(Shikamaru) I can't smoke</i>
<i>anywhere these days.</i>

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:11.431
In any case, he's late.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.935
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:16.202
Hey Hinata.

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:19.105
<i>(Kakashi) Where's Naruto? It's</i>
<i>almost time to start.</i>

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.775
Huh?

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:24.511
So you mean, my
husband isn't here yet?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:25.979
Huh?

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.714
Can you take this please?

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:28.114
Uh.

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:30.183
I'll go check on him!

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:33.486
Uh, wait! [sighs]

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:40.794
Hey! Come on, you two! Hurry,
let's go!

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:43.530
<i>(Naruto) What are you guys</i>
<i>doing?</i>

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:46.733
No! Gimmie it! It's mine
I'm bringing it!

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.802
Leave it here, it'll
only get in the way!

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:52.305
Besides, you'll get tired and
I'll be the one who ends up
carrying it!

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.007
No, I'm bringing it!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.376
<i>(Boruto) Come on, everyone's</i>
<i>gonna be there!</i>

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.144
<i>Put yourself in my shoes!</i>

00:07:58.178 --> 00:07:59.846
<i>I don't wanna be</i>
<i>carrying something so</i>
<i>embarrassing around!</i>

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.781
Let go!

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.916
I told you to leave it at home!

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:08.254
Hey, stop you two! We have to
leave right now otherwise we'll
be late for the ceremony!

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:09.956
You are!

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.092
[grunting]

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.563
[grunts]

00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:18.832
[grunts] Uh‐oh!

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:24.771
<i>Now I've really done it.</i>

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:32.979
Uh, look I'm sorry, but if you
weren't pulling so hard then...

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.216
Enough kids! I told you two to
cut it...! Huh?

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:40.687
Huh?

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.890
(Boruto) Her eyes look just like
<i>Mom's!</i>

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.761
[grunting]

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:48.695
Boruto!

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:54.801
Himawari's snapped! She's really
strong! And all of the sudden
she's really scary too! [yells]

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:59.706
Byakugan?! What the heck's going
on?

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:03.376
Ah! She's coming!

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.812
Locked on.

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:07.380
Oh no!

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.749
Ah! [grunts]

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.686
[grunts]

00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:19.960
[chattering]

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:23.897
What in the world is holding
Naruto up? He's not gonna
make it in time.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.834
Well then, we have no other
choice. Hey, Konohamaru!

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:30.671
Huh?

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:39.312
[chattering]

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:49.756
We will now begin the
inauguration of the Seventh
Hokage!

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:56.897
I Kakashi Hatake the Sixth
Hokage will be the one presiding
over the ceremony today.

00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:59.265
[sighs]

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:07.508
All right then, let's bring up
the man of the hour himself!

00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:12.846
(Kakashi) The hero of the ninja
<i>world who guided us after the</i>
<i>Great Ninja War.</i>

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:16.683
The man who will succeed me as
the Seventh Hokage!

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.284
The man you all know...

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.555
<i>(Kakashi) Naruto Uzumaki!</i>

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:26.827
[cheering]

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.231
Th‐thank you! Thank you!

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.066
Huh?

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:38.772
[chuckles] That guy's something.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.842
Oh, I mean uh, you know?

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:48.549
Sorry Big Brother Naruto, but
I'm gonna fool everyone with my
Transformation Jutsu, ay?

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:51.618
Naruto? Naruto! What happened?

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:58.424
Huh? this is Halted Chakra
Points! He'll be unconscious all
day!

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.761
But who did this?

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:05.331
Big Brother.

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:09.269
<i>(Himawari) Are you playing</i>
<i>hide‐and‐seek?</i>

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:14.174
I had no idea Himawari was this
<i>dangerous when she's upset!</i>
<i>[grunts]</i>

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.444
<i>(Himawari) Are you in here?</i>

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:23.249
[evil giggle]

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:31.191
(Himawari) Big Brother, I found
<i>you!</i>

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:33.393
[groaning]

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:41.334
<i>(Boruto) On that day, I swore</i>
that I'd never make her mad ever
<i>again.</i>

00:11:45.606 --> 00:11:47.307
<i>I thought I was dead.</i>

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.444
<i>She could see where I was with</i>
<i>her Byakugan no matter where I</i>
<i>hid!</i>

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:54.447
<i>Talk about unfair!</i>

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.118
<i>(Boruto) And ever since that</i>
<i>day, when he became the</i>
<i>Hokage...</i>

00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.821
<i>my stupid old man hasn't come</i>
<i>home all that much.</i>

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:12.733
<i>(Boruto) Damn it. I can't</i>
<i>believe he's not even coming</i>
<i>home at a time like this.</i>

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.468
<i>(Naruto) I'm home!</i>

00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:16.302
Hmm?

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:22.208
[gasps] I heard Himawari has a
fever. Is she all right?

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.178
Uh, mhm. Don't you
have to work, Dad?

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.848
Shikamaru and my shadow
clone are still there.

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.385
Hey uh, Dad?

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.055
<i>(Boruto) Your cloak is inside</i>
<i>out, you know.</i>

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:40.393
Huh? Seriously? Oh wow, you're
right! That's weird, wow.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.361
Damn.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.799
(Boruto) You're still so uncool.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.905
[snoring]

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.509
<i>(Boruto) Hamburger steak!</i>

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:56.743
<i>(Naruto) Nope!</i>

00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:57.878
<i>(Boruto) Hamburger steak!</i>

00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:58.879
<i>(Naruto) Rice porridge!</i>

00:13:00.313 --> 00:13:02.949
I'm telling you Himawari said
she wanted to eat some hamburger
steak!

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:06.953
She shouldn't have that! Rice
porridge is what you need when
you're not feeling well!

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.055
Excuse me, boys.

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:10.356
Hamburger steak!
Rice porridge!

00:13:11.725 --> 00:13:13.459
<i>(Boruto) But her fever went</i>
<i>down, so what's the harm?</i>

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:15.161
<i>(Naruto) No means no!</i>

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:16.730
<i>(Boruto) Why not? Hamburger</i>
<i>steak!</i>

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:17.931
<i>(Naruto) Rice porridge!</i>

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.099
<i>(Boruto) Hamburger steak!</i>

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.802
<i>(Naruto) You're not the one</i>
<i>who's gonna eat it!</i>

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:22.703
<i>(Boruto) I know I'm not gonna</i>
<i>eat it!</i>

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:25.205
<i>(Hinata) Stop it. Enough.</i>

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:32.145
<i>(Hinata) If you're going to be</i>
<i>loud, then go outside!</i>

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:38.885
See what you did? You got Mom
all upset.

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:42.422
No I didn't, she got upset
because of you! Hmph.

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:45.491
All right, well, Himawari seems
to be doing better.

00:13:45.526 --> 00:13:49.763
And I left a pile of unfinished
papers at work. So I guess I'll
go.

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:52.833
[stomach growls]

00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:57.170
Hey you wanna go get a bite to
eat?

00:13:57.203 --> 00:14:01.041
Huh? You want to go out? I
thought you said you had work to
do.

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:03.910
Yeah, I do, but I can't work
when I'm hungry.

00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:06.246
So what do you say
we go get something?

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:09.616
You don't want to?

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:21.862
Fine, I guess I'll go. So where
are we gonna eat?

00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:27.634
[people chattering]

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.874
You know, I've been coming to
this place since I was a little
kid.

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:35.576
I've got a lot of fond memories
here.

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:40.046
And it used to be such a small
little place. But now, it's
huge!

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.082
<i>Seriously, ramen?</i>

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:46.620
Mom says you eat hamburgers
every chance you get, and it's
the only thing you eat.

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:50.456
Is that really true? If it is
that's a totally unbalanced
diet.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.260
Huh? You're one to talk, Mr. "I
only ever eat ramen!"

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:58.799
[chuckles] Yeah, you have no
idea how good Ichiraku ramen is.

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:02.903
Believe it or not, it has the
same nutritional content as Food
Pills do.

00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:08.441
It comes highly recommended, and
by every jonin in the village,
and the Sixth Hokage!

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:10.276
Uh, seriously?

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.515
Hi welcome! Oh hey! It's been
quite a while, Lord Seventh.

00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:17.618
Yeah sorry I haven't been able
to drop by lately.

00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:20.186
No worries! You must be really
busy.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.489
Hello! How wonderful that you
brought your son today!

00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:24.390
Hello.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.728
I can't believe how much you've
grown since the last time I saw
you!

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.230
(Naruto) Nah, he's still just a
<i>kid!</i>

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.065
(Ayame) [giggles] What can I get
<i>you?</i>

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:36.202
We'll have two ramen specials
and, hold on a sec.

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:40.040
(Naruto) [chuckles] Is my Naruto
<i>gift certificate still good?</i>

00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:43.610
<i>(Ayame) Of course it is!</i>

00:15:43.644 --> 00:15:46.046
After all, it was a wedding gift
<i>to you from my father, and</i>
<i>founder of this shop!</i>

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:51.618
We'd be so honored! Besides
we're indebted to the world's
greatest Ninja hero!

00:15:51.652 --> 00:15:55.589
It's because of your patronage
our shop has grown so much! See?

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:01.127
Uhh.
[chuckles]

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:19.279
Oh man, it smells so good! Sure
brings back memories.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.482
Everything around here's all
shiny and new now.

00:16:22.516 --> 00:16:25.852
Actually, this is where your mom
and I went to eat on our very
first date.

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:31.291
Aren't you supposed to go
someplace fancier for that kind
of thing?

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:36.563
No, your mom just said. "I'd
love to go out and get some
ramen! I'm serious ya know!

00:16:36.597 --> 00:16:41.735
Are you sure about that? I
really can't picture Mom being
all that in love with ramen.

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:44.738
Well I'm telling you that's
exactly what happened.

00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:48.642
And ever since that day, your
mother's been in love with this
place.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.710
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:54.147
(Naruto) [sighs] By the way, how
<i>are things at the Academy?</i>

00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:58.919
Ah, so‐so.

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:02.856
Don't give your teachers too
much trouble now. Although when
I was your age...

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:04.758
It's Kagemasa!

00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:07.293
Wow, I didn't know they had
this.

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:09.763
What? Oh, I didn't know you
liked that kind of thing.

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:13.199
I didn't say that. My friends
are the ones who like it.

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.736
<i>(Boruto) Denki, and Iwabe.</i>

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:19.740
(Naruto) Of course he likes this
<i>stuff, all the kids do.</i>

00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:25.245
Well, he seems to be making more
<i>friends, so that's good.</i>

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:27.313
Here you go, thank you for
waiting!

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.219
[slurping]

00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:36.690
<i>(Newscaster) The time‐honored</i>
<i>Five Kage Summit is fast</i>
<i>approaching.</i>

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.192
The Leaf Village will host this
year's conference.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:44.665
The Kage from each village will
be meeting to discuss a wide
variety of important subjects.

00:17:44.698 --> 00:17:45.766
[slurping]

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:47.601
<i>(Newscaster) According to the</i>
<i>official press release...</i>

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.203
I guess you're gonna
get busy again.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.939
Probably. [blowing on noodles]

00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:57.678
That's fine with me. Just don't
make Himawari and Mom sad, okay?

00:17:57.711 --> 00:18:03.383
I won't. Ha! You're still a kid,
you don't need to worry so much.

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:10.724
Hmm. And whose fault is it that
I can't just be a happy‐go‐lucky
<i>kid?</i>

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.425
<i>(Ayame) Welcome!</i>

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:13.794
<i>(Choji) Huh?</i>

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.195
Hey, what a coincidence.

00:18:15.862 --> 00:18:17.130
Hey.

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:19.600
Choji! I didn't know you bring
your daughter here.

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:22.703
[chuckles] You bet!

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:26.439
My dad and I always come here at
least once a month to do our
ramen‐eating contest.

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:30.944
You're actually battling your
daughter in a ramen eating
contest?

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:33.046
You stay out of it, Naruto.

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:37.050
This is a serious battle for us
chubby types. Our pride is on
the line here!

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:42.789
In this world of extreme
calories, parental ties are of
absolutely no consequence!

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.826
Well, good luck then!

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:51.765
<i>I don't quite get it but they</i>
<i>seem to be having fun.</i>

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:55.168
<i>Why can't our family be more</i>
<i>like that?</i>

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.372
[slurping] Hmm?

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:03.810
[grunts] That makes it seem like
<i>I want to be closer to that</i>
<i>stupid old man!</i>

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:05.211
What's wrong?

00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:07.347
There's nothing wrong! [gulps]

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.482
I'm gonna break
your historic record.

00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:13.687
No, I'm gonna break the
Legendary Queen of Gluttony's
record!

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.388
Legendary Queen of Gluttony?

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.123
What the heck is that?

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:21.562
[chuckles] That's enough now!
Let's eat before the noodles get
too soft!

00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:23.329
Uh, okay.

00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:25.932
<i>(Naruto) [sighs]</i>

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:27.467
That hit the spot!

00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:30.537
Ah!

00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:32.372
Wasn't that tasty?

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:36.810
I guess it was okay.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:40.781
Well I'm glad that you enjoyed
it. As I said, I have lots of
memories in this shop.

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:42.883
<i>(Naruto) Things may look</i>
<i>different around here...</i>

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:46.587
<i>But I've still got a lot of</i>
<i>great old stories from this</i>
<i>place.</i>

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:11.277
It looks like it's a tie.
[groans]

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:15.516
I guess I was a little short of
beating the Legendary Queen of
Gluttony.

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:18.985
But there's always next time.
[groans]

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:20.521
<i>(Naruto) See ya, Choji!</i>

00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:21.487
Okay...

00:20:21.522 --> 00:20:23.624
Thank you so much for coming!

00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:26.092
I can't believe those two ate
all that food.

00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:30.163
Hey, the Legendary Queen of
Gluttony...who is that person
anyway?

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:33.767
What? Don't tell me you never
told your son!

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.002
Uh, well, Boruto?

00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:36.803
Hmm?

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:40.674
<i>(Boruto) No way! Mom?!</i>

00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.442
[gasping]

00:20:43.143 --> 00:20:44.878
<i>(Boruto) Seriously?</i>

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.984
Oh.

00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:59.960
This photo. Naruto, it's from
after the Inauguration Ceremony.

00:20:59.993 --> 00:21:01.094
<i>(Naruto) Yeah, exactly.</i>

00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:04.297
Who knew she would
awaken her Byakugan?

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:12.639
[snoring]

00:21:14.174 --> 00:21:18.311
But it's still such a shame. It
made you miss your own
inauguration.

00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:20.547
It had been your dream for so
long.

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:26.086
[chuckles] Yeah, but now I have
a different dream. It's just
changed a bit, that's all.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.954
Oh? A different dream?

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:31.858
That's right.

00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:35.395
<i>(Naruto) Now that I'm the</i>
Hokage, the entire village is my

Oh, Naruto.

I'm starting to sound exactly
like Grandpa Third.

<i>(Naruto) But I've realized my</i>

<i>This is my new dream now.</i>

00:21:59.586 --> 00:22:04.525
(Hinata) Even if you realize one
dream, it's never over for you.
