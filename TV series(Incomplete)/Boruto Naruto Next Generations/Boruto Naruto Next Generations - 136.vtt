WEBVTT

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.542
[Kiba] I guess he was
hurt or something,

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.943
but he seemed fine to me!

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:11.111
[Shikamaru] They admitted him

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.080
so they could keep an
eye on him just in case.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.481
He lost a lot of chakra.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.551
[Ino] Man, he always
causes such a fuss!

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.419
We rushed over after hearing

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.688
that they were fighting
somebody dangerous.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.090
But once we got there,

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.759
it was just a sparring
session with Master Jiraiya.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.294
Konohamaru and his team

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.363
probably just stumbled
upon the training,

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.032
saw Master Jiraiya with
a scary look on his face,

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.567
and mistook him for
a white-haired ghost.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.069
It can't be helped if they
couldn't tell the difference.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.538
The reason is because--

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.073
Seriously, I got worried
over nothing at all!

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.076
Well, whatever happened, I'm
just glad everyone's okay.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.345
[Nurse] Please, sir,
this is a hospital!

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.414
[Jiraiya] Nurse, don't
get the wrong idea!

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.216
This is just part
of my research!

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.952
[Naruto] C'mon, Pervy
Sage, quit flirting!

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.353
[Jiraiya] Let's retreat for now!

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.956
[Naruto] Look, don't get
me involved, ya' know!

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:56.957
Hey, wait!

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.425
Yup, they're fine!

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.961
I'm thinking they're gonna
be discharged any moment now.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.563
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:03.764
Good grief!

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.301
[Naruto] Hey, where did
you run off to, Pervy Sage?

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:11.205
(opening theme music)

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:15.309
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:43.463
(opening theme music)

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.674
(birds chirping)

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.215
[Jiraiya] Ah, there you are!

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.817
You well enough to be
up and moving around?

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.321
[Sasuke] Yeah,
and how about you?

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.322
(scoffs)

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.357
Oh, please, that
was nothing at all!

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.659
Sorry for the trouble
we caused you.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.127
Ah, forget it.

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.730
All that matters is I was
able to protect Naruto,

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.234
and that was all thanks to you.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:23.971
But still, the jutsu that guy
used was seriously strange.

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:25.973
Yeah, to tell you the truth,

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.641
we don't really
understand it, either.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:31.745
What really matters is that
we were all able to stop him.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.115
So, if someone else like
him shows up down the road,

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.451
we'll confront him head on.

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:38.452
Ah, hm.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:41.088
Well, for now, further
conjecture about it

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:43.223
all seems rather pointless.

00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:47.060
So, now that you're done
with this, what's next?

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.831
We're going back home
where we belong tomorrow.

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.734
That's right, we gotta get home.

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:54.768
[Jiraiya] What?

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:55.802
Already?

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.337
Why don't you stay
a little longer?

00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.506
Why not wait until you've
recovered completely?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.310
Because this place simply
isn't where we belong.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:04.311
Hold it!

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.546
(stomping)

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.248
Ha, I finally found you!

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:10.951
All right, why do you
have a piece of paper

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.920
that has Sasuke's name
written on it, huh?

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:15.355
And also, why did you
say my name earlier?

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.592
Now, start talking, what's
your connection to Sasuke?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.594
Come on, answer me!

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.264
(whimpering)

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:26.867
[Boruto] That's right,
I forgot about that!

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.802
Sakura picked up
Sasuke's letter!

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:29.970
[Sakura] Talk!

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.005
[Jiraiya] Now, hold on a minute!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.074
Just calm down.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.777
No, I can't be calm about this!

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.011
Hm.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.681
Look, this guy--

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.015
This guy is--

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.352
He's one of my biggest fans!

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.455
Huh?

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.827
Allow me to clear up
whatever suspicions

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.562
you might be
harboring about him.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:56.363
[Sakura] Huh?

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.131
It's really all quite simple!

00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:00.734
You see, these two guys
are wildly devoted readers

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.669
of my "Make-Out Paradise" book!

00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:06.340
(playful music)

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:08.742
Surely you've read a
book that touched you,

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:11.678
and then, took a keen
interest in the author, right?

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.247
Haven't you felt
that way before?

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.550
Well, yeah, sure, I guess
that I have, but still.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.185
[Jiraiya] There, you see?

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:21.355
Well, these two read my book
and became so enamored with it

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.857
that they tried to learn
everything they could about me

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:25.526
and the people connected to me

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.861
before they came to
the Hidden Leaf Village

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.830
disguised as
traveling performers.

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:31.398
That piece of
paper you picked up

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.600
was simply one of
their research notes.

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:37.204
I mean, Sasuke is
connected to me, after all.

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:39.239
Why'd they do combat training,

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:41.775
even getting hurt in the
process, when they're not ninja?

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.044
And how did they
know about me, too?

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.346
Oh, the same reason, of course!

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.949
These two guys believe
that their mission in life

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.585
is to entirely follow
in my footsteps.

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:54.254
And with that sense of
devotion fueling their purpose,

00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:55.522
they looked into your name,

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:57.257
physical characteristics,
this, that,

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.526
everything that has some
kind of connection to me.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.828
Then, they tracked
me down personally,

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.397
and declared that
they wanted to do

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.365
some actual combat
training with me,

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.867
which unfortunately
resulted in things

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.704
becoming a little intense, so
they ended up getting injured.

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.105
(groans)

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.075
It was all just
because they adored me!

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.212
Only true fans would go so far.

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:21.315
And they are
definitely true fans!

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:24.251
(wind blowing)

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.286
Is that actually the truth?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.321
Mm.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:38.098
Yeah, it's the truth.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.202
The simple fact is
Master Jiraiya's

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:46.173
"Make-Out Paradise" novel
made such an impression on me

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:50.377
that I went out and researched
everyone connected to him.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.715
-(wind blowing)
-(playful music)

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:55.716
Creepy.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.917
(sighs)

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.852
I want nothing to do
with this anymore.

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:01.421
So, please just cross
me off your list.

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:04.191
(playful music)

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:08.662
I guess you were
just another weirdo.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.365
And I wasted my time.

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:14.535
I'll have to start searching
for Sasuke all over.

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:15.702
(laughs)

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.704
That sure went well, huh?

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:18.839
(Boruto groans)

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:20.607
Thanks, but you really
couldn't come up

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.743
-with a better excuse?
-No, you don't get it!

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.245
It had to be that extreme
or it wouldn't've worked!

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:28.582
Ha, so I finally
found you, old man!

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.683
Oh, Naruto!

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:31.385
Your timing is perfect!

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:33.854
These two are gonna
be leaving us shortly.

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:35.856
We'll see them off tomorrow.

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.090
Huh?

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:40.494
(birds chirping)

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:42.729
Did you bring our
clothes and headbands

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.097
from when we first got here?

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.832
Yeah, I got everything!

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:48.635
I mean, we can't forget
that stuff, or this!

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.572
-(sighing)
-I slept so well!

00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:54.208
Good morning to you both!

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:56.176
Getting ready to leave, are we?

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.946
Did you enjoy yourselves
in this time period?

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.081
Yeah, I guess you
could put it like that!

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:02.516
Must've been nice.

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:05.085
You know, having it
easy this whole time.

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.222
We'd like to borrow your
power again to get home.

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:09.823
[Karasuki] Understood.

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:11.859
[Naruto] Hey, Boruto!

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:12.860
Not good!

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:14.228
Stay hidden for now, okay?

00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:17.130
Hey, you guys, sorry
to keep you waiting.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.566
I brought a little
parting gift for ya!

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.668
Oh, wow, thank you!

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:22.703
Sure thing!

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.805
But don't open it yet, okay?

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.773
It's better to save
the surprise for later!

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:29.076
What's up with that?

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:30.611
But yeah, I got it.

00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:33.313
I just wish that I could've
gotten everyone together

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.848
so we could've shared a meal

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.917
and given you a proper
send-off, ya know!

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.652
Lemme guess, Ichiraku?

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.255
Anyway, there's no need
to make such a big fuss.

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:43.490
Aw, come on now, don't say that.

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:45.392
Besides, their ramen
was great, right?

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:48.562
That's true, I can't
really complain about that!

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.899
Be careful on your
way back home.

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:55.235
Make sure you don't worry your
mom and dad too much, okay?

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.036
(chuckles)

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:58.839
Wow, you sound just like a dad.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.207
(giggling)

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.910
Come back and visit
again anytime you want!

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:04.244
But if you take too long,

00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:06.713
when you do, I might
already be Hokage.

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:10.083
(inspirational music)

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:13.587
I really think you can do it.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.322
You know, the next time we meet,

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:18.225
I'm willing to bet you
really will be the Hokage.

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:21.061
-Huh?
-(giggling)

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:22.462
Just you wait!

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.400
I'd like a word with
you before you go.

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:30.070
The past few days have been
a very strange experience

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:31.104
for all of us.

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:32.472
We learned a lot,

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:35.209
maybe even some things
we shouldn't know.

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:39.680
Like yesterday, when Sakura
confronted us so accusingly.

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.216
Yeah.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.484
All right, let's just
make a little trade, then.

00:09:44.518 --> 00:09:47.087
I'm hoping to get
something in exchange

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.590
for all of the help we gave you.

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:51.058
You do have the means

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.594
to erase the stuff we
shouldn't know, don't you?

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.063
Yeah.

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:58.098
With my jutsu.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:00.167
I see!

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.969
All right, I'll
take you up on that!

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:05.572
I want you to erase my
and Naruto's memories.

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:06.940
You got it.

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:09.042
After all, as the saying goes,

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:10.377
a novel is much more interesting

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.713
if you don't know how
it's going to end.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.715
-Naruto, come here!
-Huh?

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:17.284
Why, what's going on?

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:18.218
Huh?

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:20.721
Okay, please go ahead and do it.

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:27.861
(sharp metallic clunk)

00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:33.066
Huh?

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:39.840
(soft thud)

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:41.542
What did you just do?

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.646
-(Hinata panting)
-(Neji panting)

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.181
[Hinata] Naruto!

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.950
-(Naruto groaning)
-(Jiraiya groaning)

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.318
[Naruto] Oh, hey, Hinata.

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:53.554
Are you doing all right, Naruto?

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:55.189
[Naruto] Huh?

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:56.223
Yeah.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:59.293
So, what were the two
of you doing out here?

00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:00.494
We were--

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.230
Yeah, just what were
we doing out here?

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:05.566
Your injuries from the other day

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:06.967
could be having an effect.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.769
Nah, I'm totally fine.

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:09.770
Just look!

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:11.238
(groaning)

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.707
Anyway, what are you
two guys up to now?

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.011
[Hinata] Oh, I was just
training with Big Brother Neji.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.782
Hey, wait, Naruto,
where's that other guy?

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.183
What guy's that?

00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:25.152
You know, the one you were with!

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:25.953
Huh?

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:27.521
Wait, what guy?

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:28.655
Who do you mean?

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:29.723
Huh?

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.825
The one who was with you!

00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:34.795
Actually, who was it, again?

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.697
I can't seem to remember.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.198
He was here, right?

00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:39.266
Hm.

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.502
Yeah, I think that
there was someone,

00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:45.606
but I can't quite
remember too clearly.

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:48.542
Did you really have to
go as far as all that?

00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:50.511
There was no other option.

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:53.814
And besides, we shouldn't
get involved in the past.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.383
Yesterday, after we
left the hospital,

00:11:56.416 --> 00:12:00.153
I erased the memories of anyone
you came into contact with.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.157
Let's go.

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:06.293
Right!

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:13.100
(beeping)

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:18.772
Man, it sure was a lot of
fun seeing Dad in the past.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:20.340
"Son, when I was
around your age,

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:22.309
"even I was more
reasonable than this."

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:24.611
I guess that wasn't
true, was it?

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:28.916
Mr. Jiraiya was
irresponsible and pervy!

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:31.685
I mean, he really didn't
seem that great at all.

00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:35.556
Sasuke?

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:37.057
(whooshing)

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.027
[Karasuki] We'll reach
your time period soon.

00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:43.864
Can we return to the point
just after we set out?

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:45.866
[Karasuki] Yes,
that will be easy.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.668
And with the chakra I have left,

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:50.671
it's also possible to go
to another era if you wish.

00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:52.072
No, that's fine.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.174
Wait a second,
after all of that,

00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:55.576
you still have chakra left?

00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:58.111
[Karasuki] When we traveled
to the first time period,

00:12:58.145 --> 00:12:59.913
my chakra was exhausted.

00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:02.182
But the next day,
I came upon a spot

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.785
where massive amounts of
chakra were leaking out.

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:06.987
So, I took some
of it for myself.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.090
You mean the Nine
Tails' chakra in Naruto?

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.592
[Karasuki] Yes.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.327
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.929
[Karasuki] You honor
me with such praise.

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:18.799
So, what are you
gonna do after this?

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:21.134
[Karasuki] That
depends on you two.

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:22.636
What does that mean?

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:25.305
Isn't there something that
you're interested in doing?

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:27.307
[Karasuki] I am merely a tool.

00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:30.644
I've never given any thought
to something like that before.

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:33.714
Why don't you look for
something you wanna do now?

00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:35.649
[Karasuki] I don't understand.

00:13:35.682 --> 00:13:37.050
I'm saying just go and do

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:38.785
whatever it is
that you wanna do.

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:40.821
[Karasuki] Is that a command?

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:43.557
Ugh, good grief, never mind!

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.992
[Karasuki] Understood.

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:47.661
After I bring you two to
your original time period,

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:51.365
I'll set out on a journey to
find something I want to do.

00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:54.067
Wow, you are really
something else!

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.270
That's fine, right, Sasuke?

00:13:56.303 --> 00:13:57.237
Yeah.

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:59.706
It's not like we should
be using his powers

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.908
however we want to.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:02.242
[Karasuki] Well, then,

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:04.912
thank you both for everything
during this journey.

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:10.150
-(air whooshing)
-(electricity buzzing)

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:22.996
So, is this--

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.699
(panting)

00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:26.834
(gasps)

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:29.570
(playful music)

00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:34.508
Sasuke, look!

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.776
[Sasuke] Yeah.

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:37.578
We're back home, ya' know!

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:39.646
[Konohamaru] Boruto, Mr. Sasuke!

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.114
Big Brother Konohamaru!

00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:42.983
What are you two doing here?

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:44.117
Never mind!

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:46.386
Listen, Urashiki has
infiltrated the village

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.622
and things are really
bad here right now!

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.692
It's okay!

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.460
That's all over, ya' know!

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:56.263
(soft music)

00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:58.332
[Naruto] So, with Urashiki gone,

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:00.968
every Otsutsuki that
we've confirmed so far

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:01.969
has been defeated?

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.537
[Sasuke] That's right.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.505
For some reason,

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:06.573
it just doesn't feel
like it's real to me.

00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:09.710
But if you say so, I'm
sure there's no mistake.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:12.246
Thanks for your
hard work, Sasuke.

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:15.249
Half of the credit
should go to Boruto.

00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:17.818
He figured out what
Urashiki's target was,

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.786
and that allowed
us to go after him.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.121
Huh!

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:22.990
Boruto, you say--

00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:24.958
[Sasuke] The
time-traveling turtle

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:27.394
is no longer in the
Otsutsuki's possession, either,

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.330
so they can't come after
you in the same way again.

00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:31.398
[Naruto] No?

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.499
That's good.

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:35.435
I guess everything's
pretty much back to normal.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:36.837
We will have to notify

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.972
the other villages
about this, though.

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:40.507
Well, anyway,

00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:43.177
now, you can stay
here and relax a bit!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.613
No, Kaguya's ruins
are still out there.

00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:49.516
I'll keep on investigating,
just in case.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.786
Nothing wrong with taking a
little break now and then.

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:55.722
After all, Sakura's
gonna be lonely.

00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:58.091
I plan on returning
to the village

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.027
more often than I usually do.

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.230
I see.

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.632
Still, it's funny.

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:08.802
I have no memory at all
of meeting you and Boruto

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:10.671
back when we were kids.

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:12.439
And Shikamaru and the others

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:15.108
don't remember anything,
either, you know.

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:17.845
[Sasuke] We didn't have
much contact with them.

00:16:17.878 --> 00:16:19.913
It was mostly just
you and Jiraiya.

00:16:19.947 --> 00:16:21.715
And I erased
anything unnecessary.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.117
Yeah, I know.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.486
But, man, what a waste, huh?

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.324
I almost can't believe that
Boruto and I were face to face

00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:32.659
and then spoke to each other!

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:34.728
Yeah, that's true.

00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:36.730
[Naruto] And how was it

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:38.632
being the Leaf
Village of the past?

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.969
[Sasuke] Well, I was able
to see things in the past

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:45.172
that I'd turned
away from back then.

00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:49.710
And you were still the same
old loser that you always were.

00:16:49.743 --> 00:16:51.378
(Naruto chuckles)

00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:53.747
(soft music)

00:17:06.627 --> 00:17:08.729
Oh, hey, welcome home!

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:11.098
Have you been waiting up for me?

00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:14.134
Oh, I just got back home
a little while ago myself.

00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:16.670
The village alert's
been canceled, right?

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:17.905
[Sasuke] Yeah.

00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:20.741
Sarada was awake until
just a bit ago, too.

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.444
Are you feeling hungry?

00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:27.281
Give me a second, I'll
make you something.

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:28.282
Sakura--

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:29.316
Yes?

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:32.319
[Sasuke] I'm sorry
about everything.

00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:34.454
What are you talking about?

00:17:34.488 --> 00:17:37.457
Listen, you don't have to
worry, we're completely fine.

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:41.228
So, please just keep on looking
out for everyone, Sasuke.

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:43.330
Yeah.

00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:48.035
(birds chirping)

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:51.572
(yawning)

00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:54.675
[Boruto] Mom, is there
anything to eat for breakfast?

00:17:58.011 --> 00:17:59.613
[Hinata] Boruto!

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:02.082
[Boruto] Morning, Mom.

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:04.117
You sure you wanna
be up this early?

00:18:04.151 --> 00:18:06.787
Aren't you exhausted from
your mission yesterday?

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.821
(Boruto chuckles)

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:09.056
[Boruto] I'm okay.

00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:11.925
[Hinata] Dad's photo?

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:13.360
Yeah.

00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:17.931
Hey, Mom, back when Dad
was still a little kid,

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:19.967
he really went through
a lot of suffering

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.836
'cause of the Tailed
Beast inside him, right?

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.139
Looking at him now,
it's hard to imagine it.

00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:29.776
Your father really hasn't
changed much at all

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.111
since those days.

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:33.180
He smiles no matter what.

00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:36.817
He stays positive and
gives everything his all!

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.853
(soft guitar music)

00:18:39.887 --> 00:18:41.321
[Boruto] I see.

00:18:41.355 --> 00:18:43.323
Your father gave me strength

00:18:43.357 --> 00:18:45.659
because he refused to
give in to his fate

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:47.861
and just kept on doing his best.

00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:49.997
And I wasn't the only one.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.266
He helped the whole village!

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.333
Hm.

00:18:53.367 --> 00:18:55.035
Even Uncle Neji?

00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:56.803
[Hinata] Of course!

00:18:56.837 --> 00:18:59.573
I guess Dad's pretty
amazing, after all!

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:02.309
(gentle music)

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.179
[Hinata] Where'd you get that?

00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:07.681
Someone gave it to me.

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:08.916
(grunts)

00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:12.519
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna
go see Dad real quick.

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:14.821
(gentle music continues)

00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:16.823
When I walk around the village,

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:18.659
I hear the most unusual things

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:20.260
in the most unexpected places.

00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:23.263
I find it to be
very educational.

00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:24.431
Oh, yeah!

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:26.400
A long time ago, you got the
idea for the Thunder Train

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.902
from something you heard in
the village, isn't that right?

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:30.337
Yes, exactly!

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.440
And that's why I like to get
out and take strolls like this

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:34.675
every once in a while.

00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:37.377
Hey, Boruto!

00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:38.378
Huh?

00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:39.479
Oh, hey, Denki!

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.850
I'm sorry, I'm in
a hurry right now.

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:43.851
See you later!

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:45.052
(steps knocking)

00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:47.721
Aw, come on, I can't
find him anywhere!

00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:48.989
Where could Dad have gone?

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:54.228
-(gentle music)
-(birds chirping)

00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:57.097
Hey, Dad!

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.398
[Naruto] Huh?

00:19:58.432 --> 00:19:59.867
(Boruto panting)

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.568
Boruto!

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:03.637
I'm glad I finally found you!

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.773
So, this is where you ran
off to to ditch work, huh?

00:20:06.807 --> 00:20:08.976
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:11.378
Just hold on, I'm not
ditching anything!

00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:14.214
Actually, I'm on
an official break.

00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:17.317
Hey, is this Master Jiraiya's?

00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:19.820
Yeah, I've gotta come
visit now and then,

00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:21.321
or he'll be lonely.

00:20:21.355 --> 00:20:22.422
I see.

00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:27.427
[Naruto] So, how was Pervy Sage?

00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:28.428
[Boruto] Huh?

00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:29.229
(Naruto chuckles)

00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:30.597
[Naruto] You met him, right?

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:32.933
Sasuke told me all about it.

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:34.134
Yeah.

00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:36.970
He was irresponsible,
pervy, and a slob!

00:20:37.004 --> 00:20:38.906
I don't know how anyone believes

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:41.074
he was one of the
Legendary Sannin!

00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:43.644
I guess you had a
pretty hard time, huh.

00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:45.112
(chuckles)

00:20:45.145 --> 00:20:48.715
Although, he was
really super cool, too!

00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:49.750
I know.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:54.555
[Naruto] So, why did
you wanna see me?

00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:55.856
[Boruto] Oh, right!

00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:56.857
(Naruto gasps)

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.325
[Naruto] That's--

00:20:58.358 --> 00:20:59.326
(giggles)

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:00.661
-(stars twinkling)
-(Naruto chuckles)

00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:04.498
Ichiraku Ramen's super
special rare soy sauce flavor!

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:06.967
You were the one
who gave it to me!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.769
Do you wanna share it?

00:21:08.802 --> 00:21:12.172
(lively music)

00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:14.374
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

00:21:14.408 --> 00:21:17.144
(slurping food)

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:20.848
-So good!
-So good!

00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:22.649
(giggling)

00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:25.652
Well, I guess that you're
finally starting to recognize

00:21:25.686 --> 00:21:27.855
what good ramen tastes like.

00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:30.591
Yeah, but I still prefer
it when the flavors

00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:31.859
are a little bit richer.

00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:34.328
We oughta add some
ketchup or mayo to it!

00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:37.331
But then the ramen will
lose its delicate flavor!

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:40.801
Plus, when ramen is too rich,
it becomes unhealthy, ya know!

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:41.969
C'mon, dad!

00:21:42.002 --> 00:21:44.204
You're way more boring
than you were back then!

00:21:44.238 --> 00:21:47.040
You're worried about your
health after all these years?

00:21:47.074 --> 00:21:49.042
I mean, it's kinda
ridiculous hearing that

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:51.545
come from someone who only
eats ramen all the time!

00:21:51.578 --> 00:21:52.779
What was that?

00:21:52.813 --> 00:21:53.947
C'mon, give me a break!

00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:55.916
I eat Mom's cooking
when I'm at home!

00:21:55.949 --> 00:21:57.918
[Boruto] Yeah, but you're
hardly ever at home

00:21:57.951 --> 00:21:59.653
'cause you're so
busy all the time!

00:21:59.686 --> 00:22:02.322
(lively music)

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.066
(closing theme music)

00:22:22.609 --> 00:22:26.480
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:43.190
(gentle electric guitar music)

00:23:43.223 --> 00:23:45.325
[Boruto] I heard you
found a new team member

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:46.727
to take the Class Rep's place!

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.229
[Wasabi] She's an exchange
student from the Land of Iron.

00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:51.732
[Namida] Her name
is Tsubaki Kurogane.

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:53.133
[Tsubaki] I have no intention

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:54.835
of becoming friends
with shinobi,

00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:56.837
since it seems the
ones in this village

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.172
are good-for-nothings
who lack conviction!

00:23:58.205 --> 00:23:59.540
[Wasabi] What did you say?

00:23:59.573 --> 00:24:00.741
(Sumire whining)

00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:03.911
[Boruto] Next time on "Boruto
Naruto Next Generations,"

00:24:03.944 --> 00:24:05.512
The Samurai Exchange Student.

00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:07.714
[Sumire] I leave Team
15 in your hands!

00:24:07.748 --> 00:24:10.918
(enthusiastic drum roll)

00:24:10.951 --> 00:24:15.055
(closing theme music)
