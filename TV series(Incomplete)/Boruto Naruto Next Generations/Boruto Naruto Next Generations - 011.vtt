WEBVTT

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.515
Seriously, thank you, Class Rep.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:59.119
If you hadn't been there when it
happened then, we would've
been...

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.822
[nervous laugh] You're
exaggerating.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:08.061
Really, the reason we're safe is
only because Lord Hokage just
happened to be in the area.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.731
Yeah, that was really fortunate
for us.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:15.368
Workplace experience field trips
were my idea. I'm very sorry.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:20.807
Oh, Sensei, you don't have to
feel so bad. All you need to do
is learn from your failures.

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:24.545
Don't you think it's strange?
People going wild for no reason?

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:26.647
Seems like it's happening too
often.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.651
It's hard for me to put into
words, but when it happened to
me...

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:34.521
I had this horrible feeling of
uncontrollable anger welling up
inside me.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:38.559
Yes. It felt like I suddenly
had a raging fever.

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:40.994
How strange, I've never heard of
an illness like that before.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:45.899
Well anyway, I wasn't hurt very
badly, so everything's okay!

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:50.804
You did hit your head though. So
it's a good idea if you take it
easy for a while.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.974
Hey, where are Boruto and the
other guys?

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.743
They are probably on their way.

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.979
But maybe it is better that they
are not here...

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:03.149
since the Class Rep can rest up
better without those noisy guys
around. [screams]

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.851
Class Rep, you alright?

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.953
[gasps] Oh, Boruto!

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:08.889
So, how are you feeling?

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.524
Fine! I'm okay.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:11.758
Are you sure?

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:16.196
Well I am sure that I am not
okay. [groans]

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.099
I really messed up.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.402
Please, don't worry about me.
It's really just some bumps and
bruises.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.269
[sighs]

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.273
I'm really sorry. If I'd been
more on the ball, then...

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:31.111
Don't beat yourself up, Boruto.
It wasn't your fault!

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.947
No, you're wrong about that!
[sighs]

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.815
<i>(Wasabi Izuno) Enough!</i>

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.050
You're scaring the Class Rep,
she needs her rest!

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.119
Oh, no, I really didn't mean...

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:42.823
Come on, let's go! No
noisy visitors allowed.

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:44.858
But...

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.797
Look, you really shouldn't blame
yourself.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.099
You're not responsible for what
happened to her.

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.035
No, it isn't that.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.871
If I hadn't made such a mess of
delivering the mail...

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.607
then we could have had all day
today to patrol.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:05.111
<i>Maybe we would have noticed</i>
something happening at the water
<i>purification plant, you know?</i>

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:07.080
Hmm.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:09.115
Well maybe that's true, but...

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.784
<i>(Naruto) Boruto!</i>

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:17.057
Uh, Dad, uh, what are you doing
here?

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.393
Thank you for rescuing the
Class Rep and the others.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.364
You're hunting for the Ghost
too, aren't you Dad?

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:27.133
If you know something, please,
let us in on it!

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.401
[grunts]

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:34.240
Ow! Come on, now's not the time
to be pulling on my ear!

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.976
<i>(Naruto) Just come with me!</i>

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:41.147
Ow! Let go, that really hurts ya
know!

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:46.386
[grunting] Just what the hell
was that all about? [gasps]

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.325
Take a good look.

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:56.029
Hold on, that's...

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:59.933
<i>(Naruto) Yeah. The person who</i>
<i>attacked your classmates.</i>

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:04.204
The chakra in his body has
been almost completely depleted.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.940
<i>Listen...</i>

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.275
The only reason that you've been
safe during these incidents...

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.345
is sheer luck, and
nothing more than that.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:15.381
This is no longer a matter for
kids playing detective.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.983
Yeah, I know that, all right?!

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.055
You don't. You don't understand
the true horrors of battle till
you've seen them for yourself.

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:26.392
First graduate from the Academy,
and then we'll be able to talk.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.795
What? Come on, Dad, that isn't
fair!

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:32.032
Boruto and the others were just
getting workplace experience.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:34.334
As I assigned them to.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.437
Correct, Boruto?

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.275
Look, Shino. You know he's only
a kid. He's too young to really
understand.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:46.079
You may well be right.

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:50.116
But still, there are times when
a child is able to show us
he can do more than an adult.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.219
If he is treated like an adult.

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:55.088
Shino Sensei?

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:56.456
What's more...

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:02.796
As his Academy teacher, I
have a precise idea of Boruto's
abilities.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:05.398
That is, what he can, and cannot
do.

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:14.608
[chuckles] Well since you're so
convinced, I'll just leave it in
your hands now.

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:18.444
Sensei!

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.116
Don't worry, we'll solve this
case no matter what happens!

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:27.120
Don't get the wrong idea. I
don't recall telling you boys to
solve anything at all.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.323
<i>(Shino) But...</i>

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:33.026
The three of you were the ones
who saved me.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:37.664
So I won't treat you like mere
children anymore. [chuckles]

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.633
Thanks, Sensei!

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:44.104
We owe Sensei one
for standing up for us.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:47.841
It's true. We can't betray the
trust that he put in us.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.844
We'll take care of our
on‐the‐job training first...

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:53.647
and then we're gonna go catch
that ghost!

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:59.352
<i>(Mitsuki) But what about the</i>
Bureau Chief? Isn't he going to
<i>be mad at us?</i>

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:05.926
I forgot about him! If he gives
us another job inside, we can't
go on patrol!

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:09.029
Hmph! Are you still
dilly‐dallying around here?

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:12.899
You three should have started
your deliveries ages ago!

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:16.069
What? You actually want us
to go deliver the mail?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.906
Well, the person you have to
thank for that is Tayori.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.143
<i>(Komame) He practically begged</i>
<i>me to look past what you've</i>
<i>done...</i>

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.547
<i>and allow you to deliver the</i>
<i>mail with him again.</i>

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:28.882
Tayori did that?

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.285
But if you dare to handle the
mail carelessly this time...

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:35.689
even if it's just workplace
experience, you will be fired!

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.292
Thank you, ya know!

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:42.328
I'm pretty sure that you guys
picked this particular job...

00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:44.397
because of an important reason,
right?

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.399
I realize it's not that flashy
here.

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:50.436
But if there's anything I can do
to help, I'd be happy to be of
service!

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.241
Yes, thank you! You'll
definitely be a big help!

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:58.712
Today, we're going to be in
charge of that area. Route two.

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:02.415
Is that different from what we
did before?

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:04.284
This is called a
village, but it's big!

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:09.322
We have four postal teams here.
Each day we take turns to
deliver mail to each route.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:14.060
Which means, that other than the
route we're taking, the rest
will be blind spots.

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:18.464
Hmm. But without Boruto's eye,
we can't see the ghost anyway.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.300
What are you guys
talking about?

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.502
Ah!

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.571
What about this?

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:26.139
No way, no way.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.042
We just can't put that much
distance between us and you.

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:33.013
They're right. What can I say?
We gotta be able to see you.

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:36.416
Come on! What happened to "where
there's a will, there's a way?!"

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.951
There's that can‐do attitude.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:40.386
Listen, what's impossible
is impossible.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.523
Yeah, what he said.

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:45.091
You clones are
completely useless!

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:49.596
Wow, see that? Now that's a
good example of the "boomerang
effect."

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.304
<i>(Namida) Sorry Class Rep.</i>

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.239
But we've got to get going now.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:37.944
Oh no! Please don't worry about
me! Your parents are here to
pick you up, aren't they?

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:39.445
Go on, don't keep them waiting!

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:42.448
We'll come by to
visit you again.

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:44.751
So just let us know
if you need anything.

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:45.686
Mhm.

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:13.179
Right! Break's over! Let's go,
you guys!

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:15.281
Uh, yeah, okay.

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:19.620
Although, shouldn't we wait
until Mitsuki comes back from
doing his shopping?

00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:21.588
I wonder where he could
have gone, anyway.

00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:24.625
Mitsuki, come on, already!

00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:26.292
Boruto...

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:26.760
Hmm?

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:31.364
No matter how impatient you may
get, the ghost will only show up
when it shows up.

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:33.567
<i>(Shikadai) Just deal with it.</i>

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.701
[grunts]

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.670
<i>(Mitsuki) Boruto! Shikadai!</i>

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:38.338
<i>(Boruto) Mitsuki!</i>

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:41.608
Seems the Ghost's appeared
again.

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:42.576
[gasps]

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.877
So where is it?

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.318
[whispers]

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:07.868
[grunts]

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:12.673
[frustrated grunt]

00:11:20.947 --> 00:11:22.749
Hey.

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:28.088
I'm gonna go out to get some
ramen. You wanna come along?

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:30.390
No I want to finish
checking this today.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:35.361
[sighs] Sai...Aren't you pushing
yourself a little hard?

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.297
That's funny coming from you.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.832
Hah.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:44.605
Listen, even if the Foundation
is connected to these incidents,
it's got nothing to do with you.

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:47.473
You're not responsible
for everything.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:55.481
[sighs] Well anyway,
I'm getting ramen.

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:56.550
Naruto.

00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:57.217
Hmm?

00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:01.855
If it's true that someone from
the Foundation is involved in
this...

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:05.258
I want to help them as soon as I
can.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:10.764
Because they should know they
don't have to be bound to a
misguided ideology.

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:13.800
They don't have to be the way
that I was.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:33.587
Damn it! It looks like we got
here too late again!

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.355
This is the fifth time.

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:39.526
It always seems to occur just a
little bit away from the route
we're on.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.463
And here we are again with no
answers. What do you think is
going on?

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:46.466
It's almost like whoever's doing
this knows where we'll be.

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:52.038
[gasps] Actually, you might be
on to something there Boruto.

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:59.445
It was in a whole other area.

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:03.750
Looking at this, I get the
feeling that we're being
watched.

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.853
You mean spied on by the Ghost?

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:09.790
Well, for right now, we're just
speculating.

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:12.492
But if you're correct, then to
cover the blind spots...

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:15.529
we'd have to go along every
single route at the same time.

00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:20.867
Damn it! If only I were able to
make Shadow Clones the way my
dad does!

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:22.836
<i>(Shikadai) I figured.</i>

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:25.806
So I called for a little help.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.208
I don't like being
called "help."

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:31.377
I'd prefer "Awesome Champion of
Righteous Justice."

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:35.081
It seems like you guys are going
to be sneaking around and having
fun.

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:40.453
After the Class Rep got hurt in
that incident, we could not just
sit idly by anymore!

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:44.925
That's great but, you guys, what
about your workplace experience
assignments?

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.394
Not a problem! We already
finished our reports!

00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:49.930
We're not slackers like you!

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:53.700
All right, so what's the plan?
What do you want us to do?

00:13:53.734 --> 00:13:56.637
Yes, share your plan with us!

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.607
Well, then in that case...Hmm!

00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:05.345
All of you split up! And you'll
cover every postal route
throughout the whole village.

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:09.516
Then, if you see anything
strange happening, let us know
immediately.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.484
How are we supposed
to notify you?

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:15.989
Iwabe. Did you bring all
the gear? The things I
asked for?

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:20.727
Yeah! I got em from the
fireworks factory. This good?

00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:22.963
[chuckles] They'll be perfect.

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:26.667
If anything happens, fire one of
these into the air.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.536
Hey, this feels like
a real mission!

00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:34.775
Guys, I'm counting on you!

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:35.909
Just leave it to us!

00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:37.944
Right! Move out!

00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:39.546
All right! Yeah!

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.784
Hey, hey wait!

00:14:43.817 --> 00:14:47.788
What do you think you're doing?
What's the meaning of this?
[sighs]

00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:53.527
I let them have another chance
and just look! As soon as I turn
my back this happens.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.297
What do young people think rules
are for these days?

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.267
Huh? Oh! I always tell them to
be careful separating these.

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:04.337
And just what are these doing
over here on this shelf?

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.774
It's no wonder deliveries have
been getting delayed! Huh?

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:11.077
Hello? Is somebody else in here?

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:13.647
[yells]

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:19.886
This stamp was put on crooked.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.088
The name and address are too
faint.

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:26.426
How many times must I remind
people to write down the postal
code clearly!

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:29.930
I do my job with the utmost care
and dedication and yet!

00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:33.534
This one, too! And this one, and
this one!

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:37.037
I'm completely sick and tired of
this job!

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:40.106
<i>(Boruto) We finally found you!</i>

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:46.780
But how did you know?

00:15:46.813 --> 00:15:51.585
It was simple. Once we figured
out that our moves were being
monitored...

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.320
we knew that it had to be a
person manipulating the Ghost.

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:58.424
(Shikadai) At that point, we
just had to make them believe...

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:02.763
That all of our friends were
going to be positioned on every
route.

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.566
Meaning that the entire village
would be under observation.

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:09.836
So the last blind spot would be
right here inside the post
office.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.237
Yep! There you have it.

00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:15.041
And you showed up, exactly like
all of us expected you to!

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:20.847
[screaming]

00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:21.982
Bureau Chief!

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.318
I don't know what's going on,
but we can attack right?

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:26.119
Yeah.

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:28.855
<i>(Shikadai) Capture him, and</i>
<i>it'll be clear.</i>

00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:30.891
We're gonna end this whole thing
right now!

00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:32.926
[yelling]

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.061
[grunting]

00:16:37.898 --> 00:16:39.032
[gasps]

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:43.737
Hmm.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.719
We've been waiting for you!

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:01.755
Hmph.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:13.066
[yelling]

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.135
This is bad.

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:18.872
Yeah. And being forced to use
that jutsu is hurting him.

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:21.107
Let's move in!

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.147
[angry yelling]

00:17:27.948 --> 00:17:30.016
[gasps]

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.785
[grunting]
Boruto!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.655
Earth Style: Mud Wall!

00:17:37.658 --> 00:17:39.192
Thanks, Iwabe!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.094
If we can't get close, we can't
stop it!

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:45.732
Huh?

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:49.770
Hey! What about the spirit of
organization and neatness?

00:17:49.803 --> 00:17:53.907
A worthless job like this
doesn't deserve my attention!

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.110
Who cares if I mess up
everything!

00:17:58.679 --> 00:17:59.079
Huh?

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.648
What?

00:18:01.682 --> 00:18:03.083
[grunts]

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:05.151
Tayori, no!

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:07.688
It's too dangerous! Just come
back!

00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:09.189
<i>(Tayori) It's not worthless!</i>

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:14.127
For every letter we have,
there's someone anxiously
waiting to receive it!

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.530
[screaming]

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:19.866
And that is the reason why we
must never cut corners!

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.603
[screaming/groaning]

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.706
Now!

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.440
Let's go!

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:29.275
[grunts]

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:31.812
[screaming]

00:18:32.813 --> 00:18:34.147
[grunts]

00:18:35.816 --> 00:18:38.184
[grunts]

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.021
We pulled it off.

00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:42.689
[giggles]

00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:54.200
[grunts]

00:18:59.072 --> 00:19:01.107
Stay alert! We're not finished!

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:03.009
Can you see anything?

00:19:03.043 --> 00:19:05.178
I can't! Nothing!

00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:09.015
[grunts]

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:11.151
You're not getting away!

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.823
[grunting]

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:18.158
What's that?

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:20.393
[grunting]

00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:33.273
Was that thing what you guys
were trying to track down,
Boruto?

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:40.113
This guy is way too fast!

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:41.181
I can't do it!

00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:43.383
[grunting]

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.821
You will not escape!

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.956
Hmph!

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.191
Cha!

00:19:51.992 --> 00:19:53.193
Ah!

00:19:55.228 --> 00:19:56.262
Metal, where did he go?

00:19:57.531 --> 00:20:01.167
[gasps] I do not know! I thought
I had caught up to him, but...

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.771
[sighs] I guess we
must have lost him.

00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:09.042
(Inojin) Well, since we don't
know how to walk on water yet...

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.243
(Metal Lee) Hello?

00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:39.339
Bureau Chief!

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:44.845
[groans] Do you know that your
hat is crooked?

00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:47.781
[chuckles] I'm sorry, sir.

00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:52.886
It looks like we don't have to
worry about him anymore.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:57.090
Boruto. Sorry, but we
lost the masked figure.

00:20:57.123 --> 00:20:58.258
I am sorry too.

00:20:58.291 --> 00:21:01.094
It's okay. Forget about it.

00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:03.063
But at least we got some data.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:07.267
Yeah. It turns out that there's
someone who's been manipulating
the Ghost.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.003
I don't really even want to
consider this...

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:12.839
but that masked guy could be
someone close to us.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.343
Someone close to us?

00:21:17.377 --> 00:21:21.515
Okay, come on now! We still
gotta finish up our work!

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.751
Our work?

00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:27.053
Just take a look around this
place!

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.327
If we don't do something to fix
all this, we'll probably get
yelled at again!

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.030
[chuckles] All right, then.

00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:42.235
C'mon, don't just stand there
doing nothing. Hurry up guys, or
we'll never get it done!

00:21:42.268 --> 00:21:44.137
(Iwabe) What? Why do we have to
<i>help out?</i>

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:49.075
<i>(Metal Lee) Let us join in! We</i>
will have a race to see who can
<i>clean the fastest!</i>

00:21:57.083 --> 00:22:01.121
(Tanuki Shigaraki) The negative
chakra of the weak‐hearted opens
<i>the door...</i>

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:07.193
<i>created by the Hashirama Cell</i>
and becomes the nourishment that

00:22:07.227 --> 00:22:12.465
<i>The time for our dearest wish</i>
<i>to come true draws near...</i>

00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:51.364
<i>(Boruto) The Hokage is someone</i>
who sacrifices those closest to
<i>him for the village.</i>

00:23:51.397 --> 00:23:53.433
Someone like that can get lost!

00:23:53.466 --> 00:23:55.201
I'll never abandon those who are
<i>close to me!</i>

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:58.238
<i>I'm gonna do what my Dad</i>
<i>couldn't. I'll make him</i>

00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:01.808
<i>(Mitsuki) Those feelings of</i>

<i>you close.</i>

00:24:01.842 --> 00:24:04.477
Hey Boruto, I've been wondering
<i>if I should tell you...</i>

00:24:04.511 --> 00:24:05.579
<i>(Boruto) What is it?</i>

00:24:07.347 --> 00:24:10.250
<i>(Mitsuki) Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: "Boruto
<i>and Mitsuki."</i>

00:24:10.283 --> 00:24:13.954
(Mitsuki) I came here tonight to
