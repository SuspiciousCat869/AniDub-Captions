00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.630
<i>It's been several weeks since</i>
<i>everything happened...</i>

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:25.034
and the strange power in my eye
<i>stopped activating.</i>

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:28.805
Is it because the Ghost is gone?
<i>Or?</i>

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:31.073
<i>(Hinata) Boruto!</i>

00:00:31.107 --> 00:00:33.843
<i>Hurry downstairs to eat your</i>
<i>breakfast, or you'll be late!</i>

00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:35.778
I'll be right there, ya know!

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:39.315
Well, whatever.

00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:31.493
[happy murmuring]

00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:34.396
Well, everything's back to
normal here, huh?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.699
It was such a drag.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.837
So, what happened to Sumire
Kakei?

00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:44.040
She confessed about everything.

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:45.574
I see.

00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:47.977
One thing still bothers me.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.113
What made her finally stop doing
what she was doing?

00:02:52.314 --> 00:02:53.816
It was Boruto.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.583
Huh?

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:57.720
Or more accurately, she stopped
because of all of her friends.

00:02:57.754 --> 00:03:00.522
She had been alone
for a long time.

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:03.325
She really enjoyed being with
her new friends at school.

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.328
[chuckles] Really? That's
what stopped her?

00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:09.365
Were any of her classmates there
when it happened?

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:12.401
No. She did witness Nue's power.

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:16.072
Maybe the thought of him
destroying all of her friends
scared her.

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:17.573
And that's what stopped her.

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:20.777
You really believe that's the
truth? I don't know...

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.845
Makes sense to me.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.647
Children can't choose who their
parents will be.

00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:28.650
However, they can definitely
choose their friends.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.053
[grunts]

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:32.989
[chuckles] thank you!

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:36.625
Even now, I'm glad we allowed
her into the Academy.

00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:38.895
Yeah.

00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:41.731
Speaking of that.

00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:44.967
Letting Sumire come back to the
Academy might create some
tension.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.740
The school repairs are almost
completed.

00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:54.376
Which means classes will no
longer have to be held here.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.613
Good. We won't have to be
outside all day.

00:03:57.646 --> 00:04:01.383
Now today, we will be forming
new three‐man teams.

00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:05.187
Do these teams have to be
different from the ones we
formed last time?

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:06.588
Yes they do.

00:04:06.622 --> 00:04:07.990
That's the whole point.

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:11.060
The most compatible will work as
teams after graduation.

00:04:11.093 --> 00:04:14.630
What about the Class...I mean,
what about Sumire?

00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:16.866
She's been absent a long time.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.869
We don't know when she'll
return.

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:21.971
Until she's completely
recovered...

00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:25.842
it's impossible for her to
participate in any shinobi
training.

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:29.645
Is she going to quit the Academy
and never come back?

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.548
Well, we don't know.

00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:36.252
All we can do in the meantime is
just wait and see.

00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:40.857
(Shino) Anyway! We will form our
<i>teams today with those in</i>
<i>attendance.</i>

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.124
I understand.

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.295
I tried to go and visit her at
the hospital but we were just
turned away.

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:51.433
Maybe Sensei's right. We should
leave her alone while she
recovers.

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:55.838
After you chose your teammates,
let me know about your new
formations.

00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:59.141
We will begin practical training
tomorrow.

00:05:01.944 --> 00:05:03.946
Who should I team
up with this time?

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.215
I'm going to team
up with you, Boruto.

00:05:06.248 --> 00:05:10.853
Are you serious? Isn't there
anybody else you would want to
train with?

00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:13.756
I want you close by
where I can watch you.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.126
Ah, man. I had a
feeling you'd say that.

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.162
But not many students can keep
up with you, Boruto.

00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:22.999
Mitsuki and Iwabe are the only
ones who can right now.

00:05:23.032 --> 00:05:24.734
So who's on your team?

00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:26.836
Denki and I are teaming up.

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:27.536
Huh?

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.271
For real?

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:31.741
Yeah. Iwabe asked me
and I said sure.

00:05:31.774 --> 00:05:33.743
Got a problem with that?

00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:37.747
Not at all. Well, maybe we
should ask Shikadai then.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.383
Sorry to say no, Boruto. But I'm
already on a team.

00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:44.586
Hey! You guys are the
Ino‐Shika‐Cho trio!

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.991
I kept telling them we don't
have to be on the same team just
because our parents were.

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:52.762
I mean, it's the reason why I
avoided this combination.

00:05:52.795 --> 00:05:56.298
But we knew that the jutsu
compatibility between us wasn't
bad.

00:05:56.332 --> 00:05:59.301
And just because our individual
talents work so well together...

00:05:59.335 --> 00:06:01.603
doesn't mean we have to hang out
all the time, either.

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:06.375
That adds a bit of mystery and
tension to our relationship.
It's good for us.

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.877
I get it!

00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:11.647
This formation works but
nevertheless it's the most
unlikely match up for you guys.

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.616
And that's what makes
it a drag. On all fronts.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.820
Well that's too bad. Who
else is available?

00:06:17.854 --> 00:06:22.024
By the way, I already asked
Sarada to join us.

00:06:22.058 --> 00:06:23.625
Interesting.

00:06:25.294 --> 00:06:27.864
So you're gonna lead the charge
while Sarada and Denki both
take care of back up.

00:06:27.897 --> 00:06:29.799
How'd you figure that out?

00:06:29.832 --> 00:06:34.670
Your strategy is simple, but
it's actually not that bad.

00:06:34.704 --> 00:06:36.739
Wow, you mean it?

00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:39.709
Man, we're striking out.

00:06:39.742 --> 00:06:39.976
Uh.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.111
<i>(Denki) What about Metal?</i>

00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:43.245
[panicked reaction]

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.982
Probably not a bad choice.

00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.417
He can be really strong as long
as he keeps his nerves under
control.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.289
Personally, I wanted to ask the
Class Rep to team up with us.
She's very strong.

00:06:53.322 --> 00:06:55.491
Mitsuki!

00:06:55.524 --> 00:06:57.794
Keep it down when
you talk about her.

00:06:57.827 --> 00:06:58.360
Mhm.

00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:01.663
It's weird, ever since she's
been gone, the Ghost stopped
appearing.

00:07:01.698 --> 00:07:05.735
Yeah. And the power in my eye
stopped activating, too.

00:07:05.768 --> 00:07:10.639
Once the Leaf Police took over
there really wasn't anything
left for us to do.

00:07:10.672 --> 00:07:13.175
The case is probably closed now.

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:14.676
I hope she's doing okay.

00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:17.179
She did commit treason against
the village.

00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:20.482
So she may never be able to
return to the Academy.

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:21.283
No way!

00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:23.820
She's definitely coming back.

00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:25.822
How can you be so sure?

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:29.225
Because the Class Rep
is the Class Rep.

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:31.694
What's that mean?

00:07:31.728 --> 00:07:34.363
Look, we all know the grown‐ups
will decide what happens to her
next.

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:36.532
The grown‐ups, huh?

00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:37.466
<i>(Mitsuki) Hey.</i>

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:38.134
Huh?

00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.704
Our team? So who do you want as
our third member?

00:07:46.776 --> 00:07:50.012
The report on Sumire Kakei just
came in.

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:51.147
Yes.

00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:56.986
To prevent any contact with
other Foundation survivors,
she's under Police custody.

00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:01.791
As for the Academy,
will she be returning?

00:08:01.824 --> 00:08:06.662
I expect she'll ultimately be
placed into a protective
surveillance program.

00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:10.666
But she did cause quite a
disturbance. Whether they'll
allow her to return...

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.936
I will watch over Sumire.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.908
If she is allowed back into the
Academy, I would like to take
her under my wing.

00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:21.410
I completely understand
how you feel.

00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:22.444
So when can I...?

00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:23.846
Hold on now.

00:08:24.914 --> 00:08:28.985
We need to know how she feels
about the situation.

00:08:29.018 --> 00:08:32.288
She's in an extremely tough
position right now.

00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:35.792
She may decide she doesn't want
to come back at all.

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:39.028
I will go see her immediately.

00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:39.696
Hm?

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.233
It's my duty. Because I'm still
her homeroom teacher.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.638
Hey, I'm home!

00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:50.572
(Hinata/Himawari) Welcome back!

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:53.009
Oh! Welcome back!

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:55.912
Dad's here? What are you doing
home?

00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:57.914
What's wrong with me being here?

00:08:57.947 --> 00:09:01.751
Even I get to come home early
from work sometimes, ya know?

00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:04.887
Hey. What's wrong?

00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:09.892
Uh, Dad? Actually, there's
something I wanna ask you about.

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:13.262
Huh, really? You rarely ask me
anything.

00:09:13.295 --> 00:09:16.465
I wanna know about a friend from
my class.

00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:20.436
Oh, you mean Sumire Kakei?

00:09:20.469 --> 00:09:23.105
(Naruto) She got hurt and she's
<i>recuperating, right?</i>

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:28.010
That's old news! Come on! I
already know about all the
stuff she did.

00:09:34.016 --> 00:09:37.319
Hey, Himawari. Why don't you
come help me with dinner?

00:09:37.353 --> 00:09:38.955
Okay!

00:09:42.058 --> 00:09:44.694
The Class Rep is one of my
friends, ya know.

00:09:44.727 --> 00:09:50.199
I know that. And I also know
that she's in a really difficult
spot right now.

00:09:50.232 --> 00:09:54.136
Give me a chance to take care of
this. I won't let her down.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.972
Just let her go back
to the Academy!

00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:58.741
I'll try. But I can't promise
you it'll happen.

00:09:58.775 --> 00:10:01.343
But why not? You're
the Hokage after all.

00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:06.282
Yes, but as Hokage, I have
to think about the well‐being of
the entire village.

00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:09.852
As I already told you, I will
not let her down.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.224
Don't worry. But just try to
stay out of trouble, okay?

00:10:15.257 --> 00:10:19.261
It's for your own good. Don't
stick your nose into dangerous
situations.

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:23.465
What do you mean by that? When I
do something I always see it
through.

00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:25.267
It's time for dinner, you two.

00:10:25.301 --> 00:10:28.738
All right! Something
smells really good.

00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:30.272
Hey, we're not done yet!

00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:34.243
Let's go and sit down. You don't
want the food to get cold.

00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:39.081
<i>You never listen to me, stupid</i>
<i>old man!</i>

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:55.064
<i>(Shino) Are...</i>

00:10:55.097 --> 00:10:58.000
Are you feeling any better?

00:10:58.034 --> 00:10:59.368
Yes.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.471
<i>(Sumire) Sensei...</i>

00:11:02.504 --> 00:11:03.105
Uh.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.178
I know what happened. And I know
what I did was unforgivable.

00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:13.215
But for the sake of everybody
who once thought of me as their
friend...

00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:16.485
I have to make amends for my
actions.

00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:18.554
Now, don't do anything hasty.

00:11:18.587 --> 00:11:23.359
[gasps] But Shino Sensei, I even
took your chakra!

00:11:23.392 --> 00:11:24.393
Don't you worry.

00:11:24.426 --> 00:11:25.261
Huh?

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:30.967
That actually gave me the
opportunity to grow as a
teacher.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.402
How can you say that?

00:11:33.435 --> 00:11:36.138
Your detention is
coming to an end.

00:11:36.172 --> 00:11:39.641
In large part because no
one was seriously hurt.

00:11:43.545 --> 00:11:46.683
Please listen to me.

00:11:46.716 --> 00:11:49.585
If you don't give up, you'll see
there are other choices you
can still make.

00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:55.692
If you wish I'll have you moved
somewhere outside the village
where you can think.

00:11:55.725 --> 00:12:02.231
<i>(Shino) It's because there are</i>
<i>times when there should be no</i>
<i>shame in running away.</i>

00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:08.037
Don't rush. The Gozu Tennou
isn't inside you anymore.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.173
Your body is yours and yours
alone.

00:12:12.674 --> 00:12:14.543
Sensei...

00:12:27.724 --> 00:12:30.559
[school chatter]

00:12:30.592 --> 00:12:35.164
Out of the blue, my father's
been gathering brochures for
Academies in other villages.

00:12:35.197 --> 00:12:37.900
Huh? Are you going
to transfer, Inojin?

00:12:37.934 --> 00:12:39.168
Why would I do that?

00:12:39.201 --> 00:12:41.403
Maybe it's for the Class Rep.

00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:42.438
Huh?!

00:12:44.106 --> 00:12:47.109
I don't know what's going on. Of
course, Dad was in charge of the
recent investigation.

00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:50.813
I guess returning to this
Academy would be a little bit
tough for her.

00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:52.381
That sucks.

00:12:52.414 --> 00:12:55.184
You didn't tell Boruto about
this, did you?

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:55.584
No.

00:12:57.086 --> 00:13:00.022
If he finds out something like
that's happening, he'll make a
big fuss.

00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:03.659
We should keep this quite for
now.

00:13:03.693 --> 00:13:09.398
(Shino) Today we will engage in
battle training on the
scaffolding around our building.

00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.101
(Denki) This is kinda like when
<i>we destroyed the building last</i>
<i>time.</i>

00:13:12.134 --> 00:13:14.670
<i>(Boruto) And this is probably</i>
<i>gonna turn out the same way,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

00:13:14.704 --> 00:13:19.241
[groans] [coughs] I have total
faith in all of you.

00:13:19.275 --> 00:13:21.978
But there is something I must
emphasize.

00:13:22.011 --> 00:13:26.382
During this training, it is
absolutely vital that you do not
destroy any school...

00:13:26.415 --> 00:13:29.518
Yeah! Let's get this thing
started!

00:13:31.153 --> 00:13:33.723
(Shino) Two teams will begin at
<i>the same time...</i>

00:13:33.756 --> 00:13:36.125
<i>and make their way from the</i>
<i>bottom to the top.</i>

00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:39.128
<i>The first team to have one</i>
<i>member reach the top, wins.</i>

00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:41.998
<i>Obstructing your opponent is</i>
<i>allowed.</i>

00:13:53.109 --> 00:13:56.145
This training is definitely not
good for my heart.

00:13:57.213 --> 00:13:59.716
Are you feeling okay, Sensei?

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:01.751
Yes, I'll manage.

00:14:01.784 --> 00:14:05.988
Uh, what's the point of having
us specifically train here?

00:14:06.022 --> 00:14:10.259
We don't want you traumatized
because you previously damaged
the school.

00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:14.731
So the principal wanted to give
you an experience that was both
positive and successful.

00:14:14.764 --> 00:14:19.101
I'm pretty sure destroying the
building didn't actually
traumatize any of us.

00:14:19.135 --> 00:14:20.770
Aburame Sensei.

00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:24.440
<i>(Shino) Sumire Kakei has what?</i>

00:14:24.473 --> 00:14:24.807
Huh?

00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:27.109
Can you take over please, sorry!

00:14:27.143 --> 00:14:29.178
What? Sensei!

00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:35.251
<i>(Inojin) Go, Chubs!</i>

00:14:35.284 --> 00:14:37.419
Watch out, I've got moves!

00:14:37.787 --> 00:14:39.455
Hmph!

00:14:39.488 --> 00:14:43.259
Hey Metal! Everyone's watching
you!

00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:45.728
[screams]

00:14:47.864 --> 00:14:48.931
[grunts]

00:14:48.965 --> 00:14:50.632
[screams]

00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:52.634
Are you kidding me? [grunts]

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.507
Cho‐Cho, go on ahead! Show them
your latent chubby power!

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.143
There's nothing more powerful
than me and my moves!

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:03.145
I'm not done here yet!

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.649
Mitsuki! This thing's weaker
than it looks!

00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:10.486
I think you're right!

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:12.621
But that all depends on how I
use it!

00:15:13.823 --> 00:15:15.758
[grunts]

00:15:18.928 --> 00:15:20.629
Now I get it.

00:15:21.163 --> 00:15:24.033
Yeah, that's what it is!

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:26.869
How's that? Just as good as
Boruto, huh?

00:15:27.369 --> 00:15:29.105
Mitsuki!

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.575
You won't be able to beat us
like this!

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.144
[grunts]

00:15:36.178 --> 00:15:38.414
I knew it. These guys are tough
<i>opponents.</i>

00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:47.724
Hey, Boruto. I would like to try
out my new technique. Is that
okay with you?

00:15:47.757 --> 00:15:50.392
Yeah, yeah, fight them with
everything you've got!

00:15:52.594 --> 00:15:53.262
[grunts]

00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:54.897
Damn it!

00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:56.398
[chuckles]

00:15:58.735 --> 00:15:59.568
Right here?

00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:03.339
[grunts]

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:08.110
[grunts/screams]

00:16:08.144 --> 00:16:09.311
[gasps]

00:16:09.946 --> 00:16:11.613
Huh?

00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:17.720
[gasps/screams]

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.222
<i>[crowd coughing]</i>

00:16:21.724 --> 00:16:23.592
Looks like our team wins!

00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:24.694
[gasps]

00:16:26.796 --> 00:16:29.531
He really screwed up super bad
this time.

00:16:29.565 --> 00:16:31.000
<i>(Mitsuki) What are you talking</i>
<i>about?</i>

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:31.801
Huh?

00:16:32.869 --> 00:16:35.237
We didn't behave any differently
than we always do.

00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:39.809
Besides, Boruto realized what I
was trying to do in order to win
the challenge.

00:16:42.812 --> 00:16:46.348
[chuckles] One fool just
multiplied into two.

00:16:46.382 --> 00:16:48.985
[Grunts] How was
that, Shino Sensei?

00:16:49.018 --> 00:16:50.086
Where'd he go?

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:52.855
Sarada, where's the Sensei?

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:57.894
I don't know. He mumbled
something about the Class Rep
and then rushed off.

00:16:57.927 --> 00:17:00.262
Huh, I wonder.

00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:02.131
Do you know what happened?

00:17:02.164 --> 00:17:05.101
What? Oh no! It's just...

00:17:05.134 --> 00:17:09.305
The Class Rep? Maybe he
found out she's transferring
to another school.

00:17:09.338 --> 00:17:10.807
What the hell did you just say?

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.442
This is the first time I've
heard anything about it.

00:17:13.475 --> 00:17:15.978
I wonder what's gonna
happen to her now.

00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:17.179
[grunts]

00:17:17.213 --> 00:17:19.515
Wait, Boruto!

00:17:19.548 --> 00:17:21.650
Shut up! While we're wasting
time here the Class Rep...

00:17:21.684 --> 00:17:22.819
Look!

00:17:22.852 --> 00:17:23.419
[grunts]

00:17:26.655 --> 00:17:27.824
Sensei?

00:17:51.513 --> 00:17:53.683
[takes a deep breath]

00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:56.318
[deep breath]

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:04.293
[nervous breath]

00:18:04.827 --> 00:18:08.698
I'm back. Hi, everybody.

00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:11.834
[grunts]

00:18:11.868 --> 00:18:13.936
Sumire! Class Rep!

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.471
[laughing]

00:18:15.504 --> 00:18:17.139
Wow, you look great!

00:18:17.173 --> 00:18:18.240
You had us so worried!

00:18:18.274 --> 00:18:19.308
How are you, Sumire?

00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:21.043
Hold on, you guys. Just let
me...

00:18:22.378 --> 00:18:24.914
Hey, now, you're not acting like
the Class Rep we know!

00:18:27.183 --> 00:18:31.688
I certainly didn't imagine this
outcome. Another unpredictable
choice.

00:18:31.721 --> 00:18:34.323
Does this mean everything's
back to normal?

00:18:34.356 --> 00:18:38.294
Hmm, who knows? Maybe things
just got a lot worse.

00:18:38.327 --> 00:18:48.337
[whispered talking]

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:55.044
[whispered talking]

00:18:55.778 --> 00:18:56.946
[chuckles]

00:18:58.848 --> 00:18:59.949
[inhales]

00:19:00.817 --> 00:19:02.719
Hmm.

00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:07.389
[exhales]

00:19:07.423 --> 00:19:09.225
<i>(Namida) What's wrong, Sumire?</i>

00:19:09.258 --> 00:19:10.860
(Wasabi) Hey, what did you do to
<i>her?</i>

00:19:10.893 --> 00:19:14.363
<i>(Iwabe) Why are you looking at</i>
<i>me? I didn't do anything!</i>

00:19:14.396 --> 00:19:16.398
(Denki) [chuckling] Just cut it
<i>out!</i>

00:19:26.475 --> 00:19:31.681
[heavy breathing]

00:19:32.181 --> 00:19:33.515
Sasuke!

00:19:35.985 --> 00:19:37.553
You got here late.

00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:43.192
[grunts] Oh really? Well it took
a while for a clone like me to
get all the way out here!

00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:46.462
I don't even know the way home
now, damn it!

00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:48.064
<i>(Naruto) Where are we, anyway?</i>

00:19:48.097 --> 00:19:51.834
<i>(Sasuke) Don't ask me. So</i>
<i>where's the scroll?</i>

00:19:51.868 --> 00:19:54.136
<i>(Naruto) [grunts]</i>

00:19:58.474 --> 00:20:03.445
It's so hard to believe that
Danzo got this close to Kaguya's
Hidden Jutsu.

00:20:03.479 --> 00:20:05.414
That's what it is?

00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:09.118
I don't understand any of this.

00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:14.456
Using this, I may be able to get
closer to the Time‐Space where
Kaguya existed.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.759
What's that? Are you leaving
already?

00:20:16.793 --> 00:20:19.796
How about coming back to the
village for a while?

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.898
Naruto.

00:20:25.835 --> 00:20:29.505
Take a message back to Sakura
for me.

00:20:32.574 --> 00:20:35.544
<i>(Sasuke) Tell her that I'm</i>
<i>sorry. For everything.</i>

00:20:39.982 --> 00:20:44.486
The problem is...I'm the one who
should apologize.

00:20:50.727 --> 00:20:53.062
The gate that Nue opened has
been sealed.

00:20:53.095 --> 00:20:57.266
The Jougan's turn won't be
coming up for a while.

00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:01.938
However, this is only a
temporary delay.

00:21:11.547 --> 00:21:15.985
In time the gods will descend
upon this land.

00:21:22.792 --> 00:21:24.193
[chewing]

00:21:28.798 --> 00:21:33.836
Hmm, finally, an adequate
harvest.

00:21:35.237 --> 00:21:37.807
How did it go?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.813
I found tears in Kaguya's world.
The space curvature exceeds 16.

00:21:43.846 --> 00:21:49.485
Oh? We were supposed to wait to
harvest that world.

00:21:51.053 --> 00:21:55.591
The law states we must report
anything over ten in the space
curvature...

00:21:55.624 --> 00:21:58.194
immediately to the clan.

00:21:58.227 --> 00:22:04.000
The fact that she's chosen to
disobey is very out of
character.

00:22:04.834 --> 00:22:06.703
Or rather...

00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:12.975
Kinshiki, make
preparations to depart.

00:22:13.009 --> 00:22:14.210
Right.

00:23:48.738 --> 00:23:52.141
(Boruto) Denki, don't you think
<i>you're being just a little</i>
<i>impatient.</i>

00:23:52.174 --> 00:23:55.945
<i>(Denki) I've never flunked a</i>
test before! I've always been a
<i>great student.</i>

00:23:55.978 --> 00:23:59.248
<i>If I fail ninjutsu, I'll be a</i>
<i>repeater just like Iwabe is!</i>

00:23:59.281 --> 00:23:59.949
<i>(Iwabe) Huh?</i>

00:24:01.718 --> 00:24:03.185
<i>(Boruto) Actually, you were</i>
<i>already being called Iwabe the</i>
<i>Repeater!</i>

00:24:03.219 --> 00:24:03.920
<i>(Iwabe) Huh?!</i>

00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:06.288
(Boruto) At this rate, I'll end
<i>up being your senior!</i>

00:24:06.322 --> 00:24:07.623
<i>(Iwabe) Huh!?</i>

00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:12.294
(Denki) Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:
"Crisis: The Threat of Failing!"

00:24:12.328 --> 00:24:15.497
<i>(Denki) But I'm depending on</i>
<i>your help, Iwabe!</i>

00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:17.734
<i>(Iwabe) Oh...</i>
