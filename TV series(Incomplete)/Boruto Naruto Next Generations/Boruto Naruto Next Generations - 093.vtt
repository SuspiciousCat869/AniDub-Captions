[NARUTO] <i>Today's the day of our</i>

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.480
It's "Family Day!"

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.249
So everyone...

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.987
get out there together and have
a great time, ya know!

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.523
(UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGHTER)

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.959
That's gonna air all over the
village on Family Day, huh?

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.594
Listen, it is what it is.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.796
This is just part of the
duties that come...

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.598
with being a great Hokage.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:34.268
People wanting to have a brand
new holiday...

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:37.237
<i>Back in the day, when mostly</i>
<i>everyone here was a shinobi...</i>

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.406
<i>the thought never crossed our</i>
<i>minds, ya know.</i>

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.442
Look, there are more non-shinobi
than ever these days.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.510
For shinobi...

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.079
a holiday could just mean a day
without a mission.

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.748
Civilians expect more...

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.919
like having an annual day of
rest or something like that.

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:54.988
"To deepen bonds between parent
and child," huh?

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.258
Go and spend some time with your
family!

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:00.260
I bet that even when you go
home...

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:03.096
you only sleep and rarely
talk to your kids, right?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.166
<i>I'll do what I can to free up</i>
<i>your schedule here.</i>

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.470
Shikamaru... (LAUGHTER)
Wow, thank you!

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.943

You'll find time, right?

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.924
Uh... Y-Yeah...

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.595
I think that it'll be just
fine...

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:38.098
Family Day, huh...? (CHUCKLE)
Sounds good to me!

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.967
I'm definitely gonna make it
home...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.970

a great day, ya know!

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.746
But I wonder if Daddy can come
home...

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.083
Earlier today he said that he'd
be able to make it.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.252
Well, he has a lot going on,
but..

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.921
he'll definitely come home, ya
know!

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.456
Yeah...

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.490
I'm sure you're right!

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.960
Okay...!

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:48.762
...I'm going to visit your
grandpa.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.466
I think that your Dad should be
home any minute but...

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.101
Look after Hima, okay?

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.470
Yeah! Relax, I've got this!

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.472
See you soon, Mommy!

00:03:58.972 --> 00:03:59.973

Smooth move. You're finally
home, huh?

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:18.091
Boruto? W-Well, today's Family
Day, right?

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.927
Sorry, I had a ton of merchants
come in...

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.595
to ask me for food stalls...

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.097
and eating contests and
all kinds of stuff like that...

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.265

Huh?!

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.103
Forget it. Anyway...

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.906
Hima's been waiting. I'll leave
her to you.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.943
Hey, wait, Boruto. Aren't you
gonna join us?

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.979
Sorry, I'll be busy training!
See ya!

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:42.983

when he said she's been waiting?

Oh... Hey, daddy... Welcome
home.

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:15.015
So... what are you doing
sleeping down here, anyway?

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.151
I have a request for today!

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:19.920
[NARUTO] <i>A request?</i>

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.255

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.928

Uh... (CHUCKLE)

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.908
Yeah, sorry, um... Listen,
let me take a little nap first.

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:43.977
After that, then we can go
out, okay?

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.446
Oh... (CONFLICTED)

we really oughta go soon because
they might sell out of them!

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:08.769
Hima, let's go right now!

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:09.970
(EXCITED) Yeah!

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.944
It's a Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit
toy...

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.112
and you haveta take really
good care of it.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:22.082
And the name of this fox is
Kuraa-ma, is that right?

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:25.252
Yeah! At first, it's still
inside of an egg.

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:28.589
So you have to pet it and say
really nice things to it...

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:30.958
and that's what makes it hatch
and come out!

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:34.261
Oh! So the fox hatches from
an egg?

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:37.931
And once it does then it gets
suuuper happy when you feed it

00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:39.967
this stuff they call Food Pills!

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.902
So... it hatches out of an
egg...

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:43.737
and then you haveta feed it,
huh?

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.241
In that case, this Kuraa-ma
sounds just like a little baby.

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:49.910
<i>Hey, who're you calling a</i>
<i>baby?</i>

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:54.014

Daddy?

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:56.984
Oh, uh, it's nothing!

00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:59.953

Kuraa-ma just now!

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:12.933
Oh, boy, if they realize that
I'm here...

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.768
there's gonna be a huge riot!

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.769
Excuse me, bud!

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.905
Yeah, you're in the way!

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.908

I gotta say, I never thought I'd
see you here.

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:40.727
I could say the same about you!

00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.964
I never thought I'd see you
out shopping with your daughter.

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.999
Going shopping with your Dad
today, are ya?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.236
Oh, um... Well, I...

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:52.906
Oh! Back in the day, Kiba here
was on Team 8 together with your

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.275
mom. He's a Ninja Hound user.

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:56.944
With Mommy?

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.246
(CHUCKLE) So you really don't
remember me, huh?

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.782
Well, it's true that the last
time I saw you...

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.951
you were just about Akemaru's
size...

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.485
Oh! How cute!

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.621

(CHUCKLE) Nice to meet you!

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.998
Wait, if you're here then...

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:20.267
that must mean you're after a
Kuraa-ma too?

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.936
Yeah. Hima said that she
really wants one.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.072
So what are you doing here?

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:26.740
Huh? Oh, Uh...

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:29.776
An acquaintance of mine asked
me to come pick one up for her.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.944
(CURIOUS)

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:33.981
Although... she didn't
actually ask me.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.250
She just saw the poster for
it...

00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:39.486
<i>...and she was all like, "The</i>
<i>fox is sooo cute!"</i>

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:42.589
So I just figured that she'd be
happy...

00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:45.092
if I secretly went and got
one for her...

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:46.426
Lemme get this straight...

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.296
this is a surprise present for
your girlfriend then?

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:53.433
(PLEASED CHUCKLE) I think that's
great! And besides...

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:56.236
Hinata would be worried if you
and Shino never met anyone!

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.239
This has nothing to do with the
old Team 8!

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:02.309
Kuraa-ma's really cute! I'm sure
she'll love it.

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:03.977
You think so?!

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:07.147
All right then! I'm totally
gonna go get her one now!

00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:08.482
Okay!

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:16.323
See you later!

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.093
Huh? Right!

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:22.029
Akamaru, watch Hima for me!

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:31.238
Hm?

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:34.942
Aw, man, damn it! It's
completely sold out!

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:37.311
Huh? I wonder if Daddy got
one...

00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:40.981
(CHUCKLE) All right!

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:44.718
Daddy, you bought one?!

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.955
That's right! They had a whole
bunch of them in there...

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:50.791
so it was pretty easy to get my
hands on one.

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:51.792
Huh?!

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:53.126
C'mon, I wanna see it!

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.261
(chuckling) Okay, okay.

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:56.797
Here's the toy you waited so
long for...

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.031

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:00.968
Oh, man!

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.937
What's up? I don't get it.
What's the matter?

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:06.306
Uh, Naruto... that toy you
got...

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:08.208
(CURIOUS)

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:15.716
I- It's Shukaa-ku? You mean
it's not Kuraa-ma?!

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:18.952
It's a similar toy that's made
in the Hidden Sand Village.

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:20.621
I didn't get fooled.

00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:21.955
I mean, I'm just saying...

had it with you!

Damn it! All right, then...
Since it's come to this...

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.002
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.072
(SNORING)

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:41.742
Hey! Wake up! What are you
doing?!

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.978
Fewer than Big Brother... And
they're both asleep.

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:46.480
Uh, yeah, but, uh...

00:10:47.648 --> 00:10:48.949
(EMBARRASSED)

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.919
Good grief... Listen, I'll help
you guys out.

00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:55.255
Seriously?! Are you sure?

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:57.090
Well, how else could we live
with ourselves...

00:10:57.124 --> 00:10:59.960
when she gives us that sad look?

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.795
I'll check the new part of town.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.931
And you can search the old
section.

00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:05.265
Thanks, Uncle!

00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.768
Yeah, Kiba! Thanks so much!

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:09.937
(CHUCKLE) Sure, no problem!

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.306
Okay, guys! Let's get going!

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:16.910
Right!

00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:18.312
We oughta go, too Hima.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.481
(SURPRISED)

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:24.985
Hurry. Climb on up. Daddy's
really fast, ya know.

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.255
(EXCITED) Yeah!

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:30.724
Your Daddy's the kind of person
who never gives up!

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:34.461
No matter what I'm gonna get
you one of those Kuraa-ma!

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:35.495
Hurray!

00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:43.036
[INO] <i>You really thought you'd</i>
<i>find a Kuraa-ma here?!</i>

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.739
We already checked out a whole
bunch of shops

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:47.140
and we couldn't find anything!

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:49.910
(ANNOYED) So you thought you
should go to a flower shop?!

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:50.911
(EMBARRASSED)

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:53.213
I mean honestly! How ridiculous!

00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:55.282
Right. Sorry to bug you at
work.

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:57.985
Oh, Naruto! Wait a second!

00:11:58.285 --> 00:11:59.052
Huh?

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:00.687
This is for you, Himawari.

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:04.424
It's a little "thank you" for
all you did for Inojin.

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:06.927
Oh! It's so pretty!

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.464
You are just the cutest!
Aww, you're so adorable!

00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.000
Here, have another one!

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:15.836
Thanks so much!

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:19.206
You know, you might get tired of
holding those all day long.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.742
Wanna stop by home and drop
them off?

00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:24.278
(CONSIDERING) It's fine!!

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.048
There, now they won't be in the
way.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.983
Did ya haveta put 'em there?!

00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:34.755
(NOTICING)

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:36.223
(CURIOUS)

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.258
This is a good look huh?

00:12:38.292 --> 00:12:39.259
Yup!

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:40.294
(LAUGHTER)

00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:44.765
(TOWN CHATTER)

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:47.868
<i>Welcome! Come on in!</i>

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:50.037
<i>You know, I'm kinda hungry!</i>

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.740
Ooh, cotton candy! I want some!
<i>Please?</i>

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:55.876
(sad)

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:57.244
<i>Ahhh...</i>

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:58.245
(NOTICING)

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.546
Ahh!

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.583
[KURAA-MA] It's so yummy! Give
me more!

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:04.685
(CHUCKLE) Now, don't rush!

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:08.055
You're an important part of my
family, after all!

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:09.756
What... are you doing?

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.058
(STARTLED)

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.393
[SHINO] <i>(busted) B- Boruto?!</i>

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:17.064
Oh... Uh, this? It's just
something called Kuraa-ma.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:18.765
It's really popular with the
kids...

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:22.536
so I bought one so I could
see what all the fuss is about.

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.538
The reason is because it's
kinda like research...

00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:26.907
to understand how a student
might feel.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.741
Uh huh?

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.546
But in the end, it's a toy,
and nothing more. I mean...

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:35.048
...it's really not even that
cute at all! Right?

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:36.750
(UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGHTER)

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:38.051
It's funny...

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:40.053
'cause it sure looked like you
were doting on it...

00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:41.388
Never mind about that!

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:44.391
Anyway, why aren't you with
Naruto and Hinata today?

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:49.296
I'm busy training, all right? So
I gotta go now! Bye, Sensei!

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:53.133
How strange...

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.903
Maybe kids at that age find it
embarrassing...

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.538
to spend time with family?

00:13:57.571 --> 00:14:01.708
Oh, and I'm so sorry I said
that you weren't cute!

00:14:01.742 --> 00:14:05.045
You're so much smarter and cuter
than Naruto's Kurama is!

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:08.849
Yes you are! (BABY TALK)

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:12.753
[NARUTO] <i>I can't believe how</i>
<i>hard it is to find a Kuraa-ma.</i>

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:14.555
Hey, Daddy, how about this
store?

00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:17.291
(CURIOUS) I could'a
sworn this place was...

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.293
(CURIOUS)

00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:22.062
Naruto, is that you?

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:24.932
Hey! Tenten! It's been
awhile.

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.967
Don't tell me that's Himawari!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.036
Oh my goodness, look how
you've grown!

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.604
(SHY CHUCKLE)

00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:36.977
What about this?

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:38.912
Wait, what is it?

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:40.247
Since it's "Family Day..."

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.750
I stocked some kunai that look
like a parent and child.

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:45.686
But no one wants one.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.889
The long side is the parent, the
short one is the child. See?

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:51.225
Like a parent and child, right?

00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:52.893
That's kind of a stretch...

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:55.729
Anyway, do you have the
Kuraa-ma -?!

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:59.299
That is the fourth time
someone's asked that today.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.934
(SWALLOWING)

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.369
You think it's an omen...

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.705
telling me that I oughta just
close up...

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.875
this outdated tool shop and open
up a toy shop instead?

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:09.109
Uh...

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.247
So you do think that?! Even
you think so, Naruto?!

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.215
(SOBBING)

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.584
Hey! This does look like a
parent-and-child.

00:15:17.618 --> 00:15:18.886
I'll take it!

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.921
And for you, my lady...

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:23.757
how about a little something
like this?

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.127
(UNCOMFORTABLE CHUCKLE)

00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:28.462
(GIGGLE)

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:36.670
(TOWN CHATTER)

00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:40.574
Aw, man... All that searching
and we didn't find one!

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.910
This is really not good...

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.278
<i>Hey, Naruto!</i>

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.779
Huh?

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:49.049
I managed to get one! I found
you a real deal Kuraa-ma!

00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:50.450
Seriously?!

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.689
(CONFIDENT CHUCKLE)

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:57.124
(OVERJOYED)

00:15:57.157 --> 00:16:00.060
I found it in a kiosk at the
outbound Thunder Rail Station.

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:02.596
It was the very last one
that they had.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.231
Oh, but... are you sure?

00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:06.700
Wasn't it supposed to be a
present for...?

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:10.037
(REALIZING) I never actually
told her I was gonna buy one...

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.573
so there won't be any harm done
at all!

00:16:12.606 --> 00:16:14.741
Wow, Kiba... Thank you so much!

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:17.044
Yeah, thanks, Uncle!

00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:19.379
(PROUD CHUCKLE) You're very
welcome.

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:22.115
Anyway, Akamaru's holding on to
it. I'll get it...

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.756
All right! Now here's the toy
that you've been waiting for!

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.991
(SHOCKED)

00:16:31.925 --> 00:16:33.393
[HIMAWARI] <i>That's...</i>

00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:36.730
That's a hamburger... Isn't
it?

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:40.434
(STUNNED) Hey, what happened to
Kuraa-ma, Akamaru?

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:41.869
(SHEEPISH WHINE)

00:16:41.902 --> 00:16:44.104
Hey, Kiba... Look. Isn't
that...?

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:45.606
Huh?

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:52.980
No way... You're kidding...
The bags got switched out?

00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:54.648
(BARK)

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.918
What?! It's 'cause I didn't
feed you since this morning?!

00:16:57.951 --> 00:16:59.353
(BARK)

00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:02.556
Ninja Hounds get hungry too, so
it can't be helped? What?!

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:04.892
You guys can't even eat this
kind of stuff!

00:17:04.925 --> 00:17:06.927
Kiba! Stay with Hima!

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.761
(TAKEN BACK)

00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:19.439

00:17:20.908 --> 00:17:23.043
Huh?! What?!

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:26.713
(FRUSTRATED YELL) All right,
fine!

00:17:26.747 --> 00:17:33.120
Kurama! Sorry, but will ya help
me out, here?! Hey! Kurama?

00:17:34.922 --> 00:17:36.223
Nope.

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.892
Huh? But why won't you?!

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:42.229
Mistaking me for that idiot
Tanuki?

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:46.066
I'm so disgusted, I don't even
wanna talk to you right now.

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:48.869
Come on, this isn't the time for
that kinda stuff!

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:50.571
At this rate, Himawari's gonna-

[KURAMA] <i>All the more reason!</i>

00:17:52.272 --> 00:17:53.907

It's for your daughter, isn't
it?

00:17:55.409 --> 00:18:02.716
Don't rely on me, go the
extra mile yourself, idiot!

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.986
(CHUCKLE) Okay, I get it.
You're completely right.

00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:09.289
(DETERMINED YELL)

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:12.693
Huh?! Lord Hokage!

00:18:12.726 --> 00:18:18.899
(HEAVY BREATHING) You're not
getting away from me now!

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.767
Huh? Wait, you're -!

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:26.373

investigate...

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:28.909
the state of affairs
in the borderlands, right?

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.277
(GUILTY)

00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:33.881
So why are you, uh...?

Uh, Daddy?

00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:37.117

00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:42.289

Just wait over there!

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.124
O- Okay.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.760

I hadn't seen my son in a
while...

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.870
and he wanted a Kuraa-ma, so
I...

00:18:56.904 --> 00:18:58.605
Oh, no... what've I done?

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.285
You shouldn't drop it.

00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:14.221
Huh?

00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:16.290
You got it just for him, right?

Hima?

00:19:19.092 --> 00:19:21.461
Here. You gotta take good care
of it.

00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:25.132
Uh-huh! Thanks a lot, Big Sis!

all that...

00:19:42.082 --> 00:19:44.451
(CHUCKLE) Don't worry about
it!

00:19:44.785 --> 00:19:45.986
(HAPPY)

00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:49.690
All right, then, as of today...

00:19:49.723 --> 00:19:53.427
I'm relieving you of your
mission in the borderlands.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.428
(SHOCKED)

00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:56.396
Uh... Yes, sir.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.399
You're assigned to security at
the Aun Gate starting tomorrow.

00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:02.736
I'll let Shikamaru know
about the transfer.

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:05.272
Am I... being demoted, sir?

00:20:07.074 --> 00:20:10.210
<i>No, forgive me!</i>

00:20:10.244 --> 00:20:13.580
I'll do my very best at my new
assignment, Lord Hokage!

00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:15.716
Idiot! It just means...

00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:18.752
you won't have to be away from
the village anymore.

00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:20.988
Take good care of your son, you
hear?

00:20:21.922 --> 00:20:23.123

Bye-bye!

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:39.106
(CHUCKLE)

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:57.124
I'm sorry I couldn't buy you a
Kuraa-ma.

00:20:57.457 --> 00:20:58.559
(HAPPY)

00:20:58.592 --> 00:21:01.762
I got to go to lots of places
with you, Daddy...

00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:03.931
and it was so much fun!

00:21:03.964 --> 00:21:05.966
And you got this guy for me
today...

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:07.901
and I'm gonna love him forever!

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:08.735
Hima...

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.973
Daddy... thank you so much for
today!

00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:14.875
And...

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:16.743
Huh...?

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:18.979
Keep up all the good work as
Hokage!

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.181
(GASP)

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:26.553
Now that I look, Shukaa-ku is
kinda cute, too.

00:21:26.587 --> 00:21:29.690
(CHUCKLE) Y- Yeah, right?
Honestly...

00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:34.061
I think Shukaa-ku is way cuter
than Kuraa-ma, ya know!

00:21:34.094 --> 00:21:35.295
(SURPRISED)

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:39.766
