WEBVTT

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.717
We can't see into
someone's heart.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.753
So, then... can I
truly confirm your
feelings?

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.221
Yes.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.858
You can, with my eyes
and with my lips.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:26.426
[sighing]

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.663
[groans]

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.799
That makes forty-two
times.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.435
Stop keeping tabs
on my sighing, okay?

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.173
Is what that guy told
you still bothering
you that much?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.241
Well...

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:43.744
... of course it is.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.346
Look, I'll be
blunt...

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.250
Honestly, big girls
like you, aren't
really my type.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.854
[sighing]

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.757
I can't just sit here
and ignore it...

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.626
... when you look
so sad, Cho-Cho.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.696
The Cho-Cho that I
know is full of
composure,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.933
confidence,
positivity, and
potato chips! Uh!

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.467
You can stop there.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.604
Look. Yes, you're
right.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.806
I AM cute!

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.508
Yeah! That's more
like it!

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.911
But even so, maybe
small bags are more
elegant than

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.714
a jumbo size bag
of potato chips.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.451
There's a faint-hearted part
of me that believes that's true!

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:25.519
You know?

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.388
Oh, uh... not
at all.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.391
I'm just saying that there's a
part of me that's fully
convinced

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:35.429
that being cute and slim is
better than being cute and
chubby.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:38.365
If it's such a strain
on you, then why not just
come clean?

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.534
I can't stand to
see you like this.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.604
[sighing and groaning]

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:47.541
If only I could! Then
all this wouldn't be
such a struggle.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.414
How about her?!

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.951
She's got a fresh
look that's just
perfect to play

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:39.052
the next heroine.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.655
And she's just your
type, right, Tomaru?

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.624
That's not it at all,
Director!

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:45.058
[grunting]

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.294
Uh--

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.262
Um...

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.430
Miss Ashina?

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:53.000
Here.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.670
Mm.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.474
Do you really think
that I'd wear this
now?

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:03.110
Mm. I guess not...

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.982
At last, we've
reached the story's
climax!

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:12.886
Your characters, branded as
traitors to their clan, meet at
this cliff.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.222
A place that they
remember fondly.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.592
Then, Ashina... you
meet a horribly
tragic end when you

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:19.693
slip and fall.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.963
Actually, instead of
me merely slipping
and falling,

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.732
I'd prefer something
more meaningful.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:29.269
Like maybe I could
risk my life to
protect Tomaru.

00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:31.638
Listen, you really
don't have to make
this whole thing as

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:32.573
complicated as that!

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.742
We're talking about
someone's life coming
to an end, here!

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.277
Don't take it
so lightly!

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:38.812
That just doesn't
matter.

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:41.715
What the fans really
want to see is me
grieving over the

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:44.718
loss of my lover.
Isn't that right,
Director?

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.888
Give us a memorable
performance, 'kay,
Ashina?

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:48.622
[growling]

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.757
<i>All right,</i>
<i>thirty-minute break,</i>

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:51.592
<i>then rehearsal's</i>
<i>up!</i>

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:55.762
The guy in the gas
mask hasn't returned,

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.297
not since his
earlier attack.

00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.399
Maybe he's just given
up now that he knows

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.968
the Leaf's providing
security.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.903
That sure would make
things easier...

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:04.805
But remember what
we're always told...

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:05.806
... never let your
guard down.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.107
Mm-hm.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.576
Oh, man...!

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.044
She's looking this
way...

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.679
Mm!

00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.448
Maybe she has
another errand?

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.552
Hey, you! Get me some
water! Right away!

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.455
Uh... uh-- Right!

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:24.525
Hmph!

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:28.095
She's really cranky
today. But what's new?

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:30.430
I mean, isn't she
leaving the
production soon?

00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:32.432
So she's probably
stressed out.

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:33.667
Huh?

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:39.239
[straining]

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:43.744
He's coming! Stay
alert!

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:46.413
Yeah, I know, but
that thing's just
so bright!

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.748
I can't even--

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:49.283
<i>[screaming]</i>

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.754
Hey, there
he is!

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:55.055
You won't escape!

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.294
[grunting]

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:04.698
If you want Tomaru
back, get the money
together!

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:06.300
Uh!

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:15.409
He's coming your way!
Now, Cho-Cho!

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:20.314
Damn it! Where
is she now?

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.820
<i>[panicking]</i>

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:27.688
Hm?

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:29.489
Hey!

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.157
After him!

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.058
Right!

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.468
Did you see
anything?

00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:42.970
No. Not a thing.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.939
[exhaling]
This doesn't
add up.

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:49.276
What do you mean? It
doesn't add up how,
Shikadai?

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.378
I mean, isn't this
all kinda weird?

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.281
If that guy's motive
was just money, then
why would he have

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:57.217
ever sent in those
death threats in the
first place?

00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:58.719
Hey, yeah.
You're right.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.721
That would just
increase security.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.589
Nice, you two! Great
analysis!

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:03.457
[chuckling]

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.925
Hmm?

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.227
It doesn't look like
he went to the east.

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.229
There was nothing to
the south, either.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:12.299
[grunting]
That guy's fast on
his feet, ya know?

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:24.244
Uh--

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:28.749
[panting]

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.417
Mmm.

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:34.821
Hey, Boruto, where's
Tomaru?! Is he okay?

00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:37.391
I'm sorry. But they
got away.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:40.427
Arg, but there were
two sensei right
there with you!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.830
How could this
happen?! And where is
Konohamaru Sensei?!

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:47.501
Konohamaru went back
in order to give a
progress report to

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.168
Lord Seventh.

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:50.637
Now?! When Tomaru's
life is in danger?!

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.739
I know just how
you feel...

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:55.475
But still, we have to
be strong now.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:56.410
[grunting]

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.818
This was left at the
scene?

00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:06.420
Yeah, the perpetrator
left it.

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:09.289
I will pay them any
ransom that they
want! Please, just

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.958
help us save our
production!

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:13.227
Never mind about the
money right now...

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.663
The real problem
is that they want
Ashina to exchange

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:17.631
the ransom for
Tomaru.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.765
Mm.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.537
But we've had to postpone
filming because our
lead's been kidnapped!

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.241
And if Ashina were to
get injured on top of
that, then...

00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:30.210
Yeah. That's simply
too risky.

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:33.580
Then I'll just use my
Transformation Jutsu
and take her place!

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:36.450
No! Wait! What if he
sees through your
disguise?

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:38.719
Wouldn't that make
things even riskier?

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:40.654
But, um...

00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:43.891
I'm gonna go! And
that's that!

00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:44.725
Hmm.

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:46.159
Ashina.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.728
Look, I'm an actress.

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:51.665
I can pull of a
simple money exchange
flawlessly.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.568
But, uh...
the two of you.

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:59.439
Yes, I acknowledge there's been
some distance between Tomaru and
I lately.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:02.910
However, we've known
each other since we
were child actors.

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:05.612
I beg you. Please,
just let me go!

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:06.980
But, Ashina...

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:11.018
Moegi Sensei... if
the rest of us act as
backup and have her

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.520
completely covered,
I'm sure it'll be
okay.

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:19.326
All right, fine.
However,

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.695
you must obey all
of my orders.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.230
That's
non-negotiable.

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:23.830
Okay!

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:24.831
[crowd yelling]

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:25.899
Uh!

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:28.268
<i>[crowd yelling]</i>

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:30.938
Ashina, tell us, is
it true that Tomaru's
been kidnapped?!

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:32.940
How much ransom do
they want?

00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:35.209
Do you have anything
to say about all
this?!

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.412
This whole situation
was supposed to be
kept under wraps!

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.115
Uh--

00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:52.426
I'm so sorry. We
can't say anything
right now.

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:54.127
All the same...

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:59.099
...once everything's resolved,
<i>I'll tell you all about it</i>
<i>personally. I promise.</i>

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:01.602
Wow, I had no idea at
all that she cared so

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:03.470
much about this
production.

00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:05.706
Yeah... I
misjudged her.

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:11.211
[crowd yelling]

00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:15.482
Mmm. To catch the
perp, we'll need to
be either here...

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.618
... or here!

00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:20.587
All right! Let's go give
it our all, you guys!

00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:21.622
Listen, Cho-Cho...

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.492
I hate to say it...
but just how long are
you gonna keep on

00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:26.360
looking like that?

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:28.595
If you're really
serious about getting
Tomaru back...

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:29.596
Hm?

00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:31.999
It's hopeless
unless you can use
your full power.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:33.901
That isn't the real
issue here, is it?

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.469
Yes, of course
that's the issue!

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:40.274
If you mess up like you did the
last time, our strategy will
fail this time, too.

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:42.809
Look, I'm not the
type of person that
just keeps dwelling

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:44.378
on the past
all the time.

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:46.380
[grunting]

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.414
[growling]

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:53.453
Here, Cho-Cho... have
some potato chips and
calm down.

00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:56.290
These are the
consommÃ©-flavored
ones that you like!

00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:57.424
[grunting]

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.561
Or maybe you'd rather
have the lightly
salted ones?

00:11:00.594 --> 00:11:03.430
This isn't the time
to be thinking about
eating that kinda stuff!

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:05.299
Come on, you don't
have to be so rude.

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:09.503
Ah! Stop! I can't
deal with you guys!
[grunting]

00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:14.641
Oh, Cho-Cho.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:40.701
[worried groaning]

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:47.508
I'm in position.

00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:48.742
Same goes for me.

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:50.544
Right. Stay alert,
everyone.

00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:53.981
Yeah! You don't have to keep
reminding me about that all the
time, you know.

00:11:54.014 --> 00:11:56.683
Cho-Cho! You're really on edge
right now.

00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:58.819
Huh? This is how I
always am!

00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:02.022
Mm. [sighing]

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.058
[groaning]

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:07.694
It doesn't matter if
it's consomme-flavored...

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:09.763
...or if it's lightly
salted.

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:12.466
And what's that
supposed to mean?

00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:15.235
It really doesn't
matter what you're
thinking, 'cause when

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:16.537
you involve other
people...

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:20.607
...that means it could hinder
the success of the whole
mission.

00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:22.409
Listen, I've had
enough lectures.

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.511
What's important
isn't the chip's flavor,

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:26.446
but its essence.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.147
Huh?

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:30.684
I think it's whether
the chip is made from
quality potatoes.

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:32.586
Isn't that right?

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:33.720
[groaning]

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:37.658
Whatever the flavor
might be, if the
potato itself is

00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:39.493
rotten, it's no good,
right?

00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.162
Hm.

00:12:47.568 --> 00:12:50.838
What about your true
essence? Is it rotten?

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:52.673
Or is it
pure instead?

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:54.208
[groaning]

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.010
<i>He's here!</i>

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.653
Ashina! You actually
came! Thank you
so much!

00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:08.322
Really, thank you!

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:10.157
Mm.

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.861
Take a look
around...

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:16.730
It's just like the
last scene of our
production, isn't it?

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:18.732
Huh?

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.002
In the script, I was
merely supposed to
tumble over the

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:26.340
cliff. And yet here I
am, saving you.

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:28.442
It's quite ironic,
isn't it?

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:39.152
Here's the ransom you demanded.
Now keep your end of the bargain
and let Tomaru go!

00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:46.560
[cowering]

00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:48.195
Oh, thank you,
Ashina!

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:50.264
This whole time, I
completely misjudged
you!

00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:53.534
Go on, just start
climbing. Everyone's
waiting down below.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:56.436
Oh, but I can't just
leave you here...

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.307
Listen to me! This
isn't some scene from
our show! I came here

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.875
to save your life,
remember?!

00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:03.977
Now just do as I say
and get out of here!

00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:07.414
I- I understand!
Okay, I'm going down!

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:10.517
[panicking]

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:21.428
[grunting]

00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:25.465
[panicking]

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:28.802
Oh, good grief. Just
look at him! And his
next movie's supposed

00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:30.571
to be this big
action-adventure!

00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:32.072
It's ridiculous!

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:37.377
Hold on... just what
are you doing?

00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:40.747
What if somebody gets
suspicious? Look, the
money's all yours, so

00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:42.449
you can just get
lost now!

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:46.186
I have a press
conference to do,
after all. [giggling]

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.789
I'm gonna bask in
the spotlight once
again!

00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:49.990
I see...

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:52.626
So that's how it is,
huh?

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:55.028
[gasping]
You're--

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.266
We were able to
capture your partner in
crime a little earlier.

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:03.670
But he refused tell
us the name of his
accomplice.

00:15:03.704 --> 00:15:06.607
And that's why we
didn't have any other
choice but to play

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.908
out this little
scene.

00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:11.411
Uh! Why that
useless fool!

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.780
Konohamaru Sensei?!
Are you kidding me?!

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:15.148
All of you were
in on this?!

00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:19.520
When Tomaru was kidnapped
before, you weren't at the
scene, were you?

00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:22.356
After he was taken,
we tracked down the
perp, and we captured

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:25.492
him. But still, we
never imagined that
his accomplice would

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:26.293
be Ashina!

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:28.362
I know, right?
Staging a kidnapping

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.764
just to revive your
popularity...

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:32.599
... that is
seriously sad.

00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:35.435
[panicking]

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:38.338
He can't even act,
but just 'cause he's
handsome, he thinks

00:15:38.372 --> 00:15:40.974
he's a big shot and
took over the whole
production!

00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:42.442
What was I
supposed to do?

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:44.778
I just couldn't
stand it any
longer.

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.747
Hey, are you talking
about me?

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.148
Oh, just shut up!

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.752
That's unfortunate
for you, but in real
life... things don't

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.354
always go quite the way
they might if they
were scripted.

00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:57.658
No, don't you get
it?! I have to
continue to shine!

00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:58.492
That's simply
who I am!

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.262
No matter what,
I can't afford to
lose my shine...

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:06.567
Because
otherwise, I won't
be me anymore.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.534
Miss Ashina...

00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:11.438
Heh. After
causing an incident
like this, I guess I

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.775
won't be able to bask
in the limelight again,
will I?

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:18.645
Well, if you atone
for your crime, then
maybe one day...

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:21.615
Did you really think
that I didn't consider
what I'd do

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:22.983
if my plan failed?

00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:24.218
[grunting]

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:28.055
I'll just get myself
back in the news
again with this!

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:30.424
Even if it's not
quite what I planned!

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:31.258
[grunting]

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.192
Ah!

00:16:34.528 --> 00:16:35.562
[gasping]

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:39.032
[screaming]

00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:40.300
Let me go!

00:16:42.536 --> 00:16:48.408
[screaming and grunting]

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:49.443
My back!

00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:52.980
[screaming]

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.016
Earth Style! Mud
Wall!

00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:03.290
I'll stop that
boulder! Gale Palm!

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:05.859
Cha! Got it!

00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:07.628
What a drag!

00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:13.333
[straining]

00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:14.067
Sarada!

00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:16.670
<i>Someone, please help</i>
<i>me!</i>

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:20.474
[crying]

00:17:20.507 --> 00:17:22.009
Tomaru, no!

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:31.852
Ow, that hurts...

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:32.953
Oh no!

00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:34.188
[exhaling]

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:37.558
<i>What about your true</i>
<i>essence? Is it rotten?</i>

00:17:37.591 --> 00:17:38.625
<i>Or is it pure</i>
<i>instead?</i>

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.862
Ugh, perfect. Out
of all the people in
the world, he's gotta

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:45.699
be the first one to
lecture me... I mean,
about potato chips...

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.901
Huh!

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:49.303
Better watch
out!

00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:51.972
... because once you
get a taste of me,
you'll never settle

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:53.473
for anything else!

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:56.343
Ah!

00:17:56.376 --> 00:18:00.948
This seems...
really bad, right?
[panicking]

00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:02.583
Leave this to me.

00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:04.051
What?! Cho-Cho?!

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.320
This is impossible
for someone like you!

00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:10.190
Huh?!

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.760
That's the ring.
Don't ever lose it
again, Tomaru,

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:14.995
you hear me?

00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:16.930
[grunting]

00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:18.799
The girl...

00:18:18.832 --> 00:18:20.300
...from the
soundstage!

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:26.440
Partial Expansion
Jutsu!

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.511
Mm!

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:37.017
Now that's the real
you. Freshness
itself!

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:38.852
Oh, Cho-Cho!

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:41.555
There she is! There's
our Cho-Cho!

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:42.422
That's right.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.191
[admiring]

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.134
[chatting]

00:18:54.168 --> 00:18:57.237
Well, I guess this
is gonna be it for
me, isn't it?

00:18:57.271 --> 00:18:59.773
Even if you do lose
your shine...

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:03.177
... it doesn't mean
that who you really
are has changed.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.646
What's most important
is what's inside you.

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.481
[chuckling]

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:15.022
Well, it looks like
everybody's okay now!

00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:16.456
I wonder...

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.224
Mm?

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:19.626
I think he means
wounds of the heart.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.861
That Tomaru guy
doesn't seem

00:19:20.894 --> 00:19:22.563
interested in
chubby girls.

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:31.271
So which one is the
real you, then?

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:35.776
The potato's essence
is what matters.

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:37.244
So could the
real you be--

00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:38.946
What's the point in
asking that?

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.048
What's inside is
what matters, right?

00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:45.419
Huh... Yeah,
absolutely. I guess
you're right!

00:19:45.452 --> 00:19:48.822
Oh, Cho-Cho, you're
more wonderful than
any other woman I've

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.457
ever met before, you
know that?!

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.327
I guess people can be
great, even if
they're big!

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.328
Sparkle!

00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:58.632
Hey, you know what?
It's my policy to
offer potato chips to

00:19:58.665 --> 00:19:59.967
people that I like.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.535
That makes me glad!

00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:04.004
How about we...

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.912
I don't think I can
accept that.

00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:13.914
Huh? But why?!

00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:17.784
Oh. Well, after all,
I don't really want
my life to be bound

00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:19.653
by calories
or by a man!

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:21.588
I wanna be completely
free!

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:26.293
Uh! No one's ever
turned me down
before...

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:29.363
Do you think maybe
someday I might get
another chance?

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:33.467
Stay on your toes!
Because you're gonna
have a lot of rivals!

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:40.274
Mm.

00:20:45.012 --> 00:20:48.782
It appears... that
her symptoms are
getting worse.

00:20:48.815 --> 00:20:50.951
What a turn of
events, huh?

00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:53.453
I know. The whole
thing's a real drag!

00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:55.689
[giggling]

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:59.459
All right, you guys!
Cha!

00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:16.443
[chewing]

00:21:19.313 --> 00:21:22.482
Tell me, what's made
you start eating food?

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:24.918
What's changed in
your mental state?

00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:27.054
Oh... Just stuff.

00:21:29.556 --> 00:21:31.558
[biting]

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.661
Surprisingly tasty,
aren't they?

00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:36.496
Because their true
essence is good.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.100
But still... they're
not quite to my taste.

00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:44.738
By the way... Your
question about
whether I'm your

00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:46.607
mother or
your father...

00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:50.277
Oh, yes. About that.
It's fine.

00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:56.183
<i>Because as long as I</i>
<i>know what the true</i>
<i>essence is...</i>

00:21:56.216 --> 00:21:58.986
<i>... it doesn't</i>
<i>really matter</i>
<i>either way.</i>

00:23:42.956 --> 00:23:46.460
<i>The time has come to</i>
<i>teach you the</i>
<i>ultimate technique.</i>

00:23:46.493 --> 00:23:49.863
<i>The ultimate taijutsu</i>
<i>technique... I will</i>
<i>finally be learning it?!</i>

00:23:49.897 --> 00:23:51.999
<i>Understanding this</i>
<i>technique will not</i>
<i>just be about</i>

00:23:52.032 --> 00:23:54.801
<i>enduring the harshest</i>
<i>training. You will</i>
<i>also have to face the</i>

00:23:54.835 --> 00:23:58.505
<i>very core of your</i>
<i>being! Are you truly</i>
<i>prepared to do that?</i>

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:00.574
H-Hold on a minute!

00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:03.844
<i>Next time on Boruto</i>
<i>Naruto Next</i>
<i>Generations:</i>

00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:05.913
<i>"The Other Side of</i>
<i>Anxiety"</i>

00:24:05.946 --> 00:24:11.018
Before I can start
training... I first have
to conquer my anxiety!
