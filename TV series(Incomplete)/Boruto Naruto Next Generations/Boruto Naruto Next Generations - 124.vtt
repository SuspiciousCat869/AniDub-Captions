WEBVTT

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.479
(footsteps approaching)

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.552
Oh, finally, the
scenery is beginning

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.554
to change a little bit.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.522
What do you care?

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.657
We're doing all the
work here carrying you.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.993
But you're right, we're
actually seeing some plant life

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.694
when we didn't before.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.096
And that means that--

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.598
We're getting close to
the Land of Fire now.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:32.900
I was getting worried earlier,

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.936
but it looks like we're gonna
make it to the Hidden Leaf.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.337
Don't let your guard down,

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.473
our mission still
isn't over yet.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.375
Oh, come on, I know
you've gotta be

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.077
at least a little happy
about this too Shinki.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.382
Shut up for a second.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.584
You've gotta stop
being so wound up.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.968
He's coming.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.536
(air whooshing)

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.338
So we meet again.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:16.577
(laughs)

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:19.346
Damn it, not you.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.084
(Opening Theme Music)

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:41.468
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:06.620
(suspenseful music)

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.623
What, no way, was Gaara's
Sealing Jutsu undone?

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.559
I have to admit that it
took a little more time

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:14.361
than I anticipated.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.563
Your friend's jutsu
really was quite

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:18.365
a troublesome little thing.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:22.302
But at least now I've
finally found the One Tail.

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:24.071
With the seal on the tea kettle,

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:27.274
Master Shukaku's chakra
should be undetectable.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.675
How did you?

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.210
It was easy actually,

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:33.080
I've been watching you
through my puppets.

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:36.316
(suspenseful music)

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.420
So all I had to do was
follow the two of you

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:41.588
with these eyes.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.226
The Byakugan, so
once he found us,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.961
no matter how far away he was,

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:49.630
he could just
follow us with that.

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:53.700
That's right, and that
is really annoying me.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.802
Perfect timing, now I can take

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.671
all of the chakra from Shukaku

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.740
and from the two of you as well.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.943
The chakra I got earlier
from that mother and son team

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.345
wasn't bad either.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.283
Oh, my chakra gathering
is going so smoothly.

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:10.484
Why you!

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.220
What did you do to
Shikadai and Aunt Temari?

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.623
Hold it, I told you not
to get too emotional.

00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:19.459
You don't wanna make the
same mistake again, do you?

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:24.965
Neither my father nor
Sasuke Uchiha are here now.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.500
[Boruto] Trust me, I
know the difference

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.203
between our power
and his, but still.

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:32.172
Oh, are the two of you
having a strategy meeting?

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:35.709
If you make this fun for me,
I'll be glad to wait for you.

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:39.079
Shinki, tear off
the Sealing Tag.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.480
I'll handle this.

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:44.084
Please just wait, once the
seal's off, it's off for good.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.686
But that won't matter at all

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.355
if this Urashiki
guy gets us now.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.224
I'm so sick and
tired of seeing him

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.359
get the better of us like this.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.361
How's the strategy coming along?

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:56.496
After making me wait
for all this time,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.366
I hope that you aren't
going to bore me too much.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.202
Damn it, he's totally
making fun of us.

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:05.305
Let him lower his guard,
we'll use it against him.

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:09.576
Listen, I have a
plan Master Shukaku.

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:13.547
Boruto, you buy
us a little time.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.948
Hold on, why?

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:18.452
'Cause, I'm gonna stop him.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.689
(air whooshing)

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:25.058
Are you going to be ready soon?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.830
Well then, let's have some
fun right now, shall we?

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:33.567
(Byakugan blazing)

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.801
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.071
(weapon exploding)

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:39.806
(Urashiki laughing)

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.809
Your best strategy
is a child's game?

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.678
Just shut up.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.581
(Byakugan blazing)

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:54.688
Then the real one is.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.423
(air whooshing)

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.824
Take this.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.594
(Boruto groans)

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.364
I was really hoping
you'd be able

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:06.466
to make this more fun for me.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:13.073
(weapon explodes)

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.308
Don't mess with me.

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:18.946
(Boruto thuds)

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.582
(upbeat music)

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.086
This simply isn't going to do.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:29.690
I gave you all that time
and this is all you've got?

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:30.724
Shinki!

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.832
This is, secret Black
Art, Black Iron.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:41.401
(wind rustling)

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:44.171
(upbeat music)

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:03.490
Seriously, another
sealing jutsu?

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:06.727
You people have one-track minds
when it comes to fighting.

00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.428
Let's go.

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:09.429
Okay.

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:12.065
(upbeat music)

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:18.572
I guess I'll have to wait
till later to have my fun.

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:29.950
Wow, I had no idea
you really knew

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:32.686
how to use Puppet
Jutsu like that.

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.821
My uncle taught me how to do it.

00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:36.823
Mr. Kankuro?

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:39.092
But still, even my
father's Sealing Jutsu

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:41.228
wasn't enough to
hold him for long.

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.564
He'll be coming
after us shortly.

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:44.965
So what are we gonna do?

00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:49.436
For now, we put some
distance between us, also.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:55.442
(air whooshing)

00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:07.688
What was that?

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.756
It's a Third Eye of Iron Sand.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.193
We'll be able to use it to
detect Urashiki's approach.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.362
Leaving several of them behind

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:18.098
should help us track his moves.

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:21.635
No way, your Iron Sand is
capable of doing that too?

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.805
Still, we've got to do
something about his Byakugan.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.039
I'm on it.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.677
Huh, hey, that's not
the way to the Leaf.

00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:32.045
Just come on (grunts).

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:34.314
What do you mean?

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.094
I have to admit that ninjutsu

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.830
can really be
unbelievably vexing.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:50.964
(air whooshing)

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:53.967
Now then, time to
restart our game of tag.

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.702
(air whooshing)

00:09:00.941 --> 00:09:02.709
It seems he's on the move now.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.813
(suspenseful music)

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:09.583
(air whooshing)

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.456
I knew it.

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:21.962
Hey, listen, what's
going on anyway?

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.197
Why go this way?

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.965
Why are we avoiding
the quickest route

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:27.234
to the Hidden Leaf Village?

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.470
Because right now, Urashiki
is taking the shortest route

00:09:30.504 --> 00:09:33.407
to our destination,
the Land of Fire.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.075
What, but why?

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:37.678
Can't he follow us
with his Byakugan?

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:38.946
Oh, I get it.

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:41.415
The range of his Byakugan's
vision is limited

00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:42.816
to where he looks.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.219
Yes, but if he's not watching us

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:47.454
he can't see that
we've gone off route.

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:51.558
Of course, and that
means at least for now

00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:53.460
that he's lost sight of us.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.796
So we're safe from that
annoying Byakugan of his

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:57.364
and we just have to hurry up

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:59.466
and get to the Land
of Fire, right?

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:05.539
No, we must consider every
move carefully right now.

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.341
What, why is that?

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.476
If we rush straight
to the Land of Fire,

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.747
then he might be able to find
us again with his Byakugan.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.951
Although, if we take too much
time, he'll get suspicious.

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:19.586
We have to find a way.

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:21.955
Wait, I know.

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:24.324
A guy named Gojyo
has a house up ahead.

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.362
He helped me out once before

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.731
and I'm pretty sure he
had a transmitter too.

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.367
Yes, I see.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.937
Which means that we can call
the Hidden Leaf for help.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.072
But do you really
think we can trust him?

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:41.208
Of course, I mean,
he's kinda grumpy,

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:43.177
but, he's a good guy.

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:48.448
All right, then we'll
go there (grunts).

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:53.453
Shinki, hey, what's the matter?

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.456
He's been pushing himself.

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.359
And what do you mean by that?

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:02.362
Puppet Jutsu alone
uses a lot of chakra.

00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:04.498
Plus he's been using it remotely

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.967
and he made a bunch
of Third Eyes.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.303
That's why he's
completely exhausted.

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:16.343
I'm fine, this is
nothing, come on.

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:19.046
Hey, wait, take a
little break at least.

00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:22.950
There's no time to waste.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:24.351
What, hold on.

00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:26.820
I thought you calculated
your chakra allotment

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.455
or whatever you said.

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:33.360
Gaara and Kankuro
entrusted everything to him

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:35.829
but still, he isn't a machine.

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:38.332
(soft music)

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:42.035
He's desperate to live
up to their expectations.

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:45.439
(soft music)

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:51.678
What's the big idea?

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:53.347
I can walk.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.450
Oh, come on, you can
barely even stand up.

00:11:57.985 --> 00:12:01.555
And also, I'm
sorry about earlier

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:03.924
when I called you a machine.

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:05.492
You could learn a thing or two

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:08.362
if you tried to be
more like a machine.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.597
Hey, you want me to drop you?

00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:20.574
(footsteps approaching)

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:26.213
Are you actually sure that
there's a house around here?

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.348
He wanted to avoid
more fighting,

00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:32.052
so he lives out here, along
with his only daughter Isago.

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:38.058
(wind rumbling)

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:43.230
Hey, there it is.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.432
That's Gojyo's house.

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:46.567
Hold it.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.568
What's wrong?

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.704
Something's off.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.309
(suspenseful music)

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:04.952
(footsteps approaching)

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:07.421
(suspenseful music)

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.589
What happened here?

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:11.558
Mr. Gojyo?

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:12.559
Isago?

00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:15.596
(suspenseful music)

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:19.833
Did Urashiki do this?

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:22.169
Or was something
else responsible?

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:27.674
Mr. Gojyo?

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:28.709
Isago?

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:30.444
Boruto!

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:33.947
Hey, Isago, what happened?

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.182
Where's your dad?

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:38.318
My father is, my
father is, (sobs).

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:45.726
Mr. Gojyo? (grunts)

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:50.597
Damn it, it won't budge.

00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:57.070
Can you tell us
who attacked you?

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:59.940
Hey, right now rescuing
Mr. Gojyo comes first

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.475
before anything else.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.710
He's pinned down
under all that rubble

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:06.880
so it's probably too
late to save him.

00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:11.084
Right now, we need to get a
better grasp on the situation.

00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:12.953
Are you kidding me?

00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:15.222
He's right there,
we could save him.

00:14:15.255 --> 00:14:17.491
You're really just
gonna ignore him?

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:20.961
Forget what I said,
you are a machine,

00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:23.430
and you're always
gonna be that way.

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:26.466
(suspenseful music)

00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:33.674
For Isago, Gojyo is
all the family she has.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.742
(both grunting)

00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:39.947
So how could we ever abandon
her dad right in front of her?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.716
(both grunting)

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:49.323
(suspenseful music)

00:14:58.866 --> 00:15:00.200
Dad! Oh, dad.

00:15:01.835 --> 00:15:04.671
Dad I thought (sobs).

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.707
Isago, thanks so much.

00:15:08.108 --> 00:15:09.209
Thank goodness.

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:11.178
All right, are
you satisfied now?

00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:15.048
Hey, Shinki, hold up.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.352
Attacked out of nowhere?

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.487
Dad and I were working
out in the garden

00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:22.956
when this red fireball
came hurtling down

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.591
and destroyed our house.

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:27.094
Dad told me to go and
hide in the railcar,

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:29.196
so I took cover there, but.

00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:33.100
A red fireball?

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:36.303
(Byakugan blazing)

00:15:37.237 --> 00:15:39.439
Little girl, did you
see who did this?

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:43.677
Someone with white
eyes and white clothes,

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.312
flying in the air.

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:50.350
That's Urashiki.

00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:52.953
Damn him, why would
he go after people

00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:55.355
who have nothing
to do with this?

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:59.560
Boruto, he seemed to
be looking for you two.

00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:01.361
Dad, what?

00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:04.965
He was laughing, and
hurled a red ball

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:06.466
of chakra at us (grunts).

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.937
Mr. Gojyo, take it easy.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.406
Where did Urashiki go?

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:13.707
I don't know.

00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.310
He just flew off
in the direction

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:18.045
of the Land of Fire (grunts).

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:23.450
(suspenseful music)

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:27.221
There's no way that the
transmitter's still gonna work

00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:29.089
all smashed up like this.

00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:30.958
We're simply going
to have to come up

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.459
with another solution then.

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:42.603
I just don't get Shinki, I
still can't figure him out.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:45.706
I know he's not a bad
guy, but at the same time.

00:16:46.974 --> 00:16:49.443
Hey, who are you talking to?

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:51.578
You didn't think
that was me, did you?

00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.948
Oh, uh, I'm really
sorry about that.

00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:57.217
It just looked so
much like you so I--

00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:58.952
Hey, stop messing around.

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:01.221
I'm Master Shukaku,
the One Tail.

00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:04.958
So don't confuse me with
some random tea kettle.

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:06.326
Sorry about that.

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.963
As I thought, the
issue's with the river.

00:17:09.997 --> 00:17:11.565
What was that?

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:14.568
(soft upbeat music)

00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:18.338
For us to get into
the Land of Fire,

00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:20.541
we're going to have
to use this bridge

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:22.075
to cross over the river.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.179
But it's just a bridge,
it'll be easy, right?

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:27.080
When we're near the
bridge and crossing it

00:17:27.114 --> 00:17:28.682
there's nowhere to hide.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.617
Although, as we said before,

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:33.587
it's the shortest route
available, the only one really.

00:17:34.788 --> 00:17:38.192
I'm sure Urashiki will be
lying in wait for us there.

00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:40.961
So we'll be heading
right toward a place

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:43.497
that doesn't really
have any escape route.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.699
I just don't think
that there's a way

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.035
to avoid a
confrontation with him.

00:17:50.103 --> 00:17:52.673
There is another road.

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:53.941
What's that?

00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:55.075
But where?

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.810
There's nothing
about it on the map.

00:17:56.844 --> 00:17:58.579
It's a longer way to travel.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.951
It's a route that only the
locals around here know about.

00:18:03.984 --> 00:18:06.954
So if we use that
path, Urashiki won't--

00:18:06.987 --> 00:18:09.089
Hold on, I'm sure that Urashiki

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:10.624
will be waiting at the bridge.

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:15.095
And when we don't show up,
knowing what we know of him,

00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:16.363
he'll start looking around,

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:19.099
and he'll find the other
route before too long.

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:21.168
So what are we gonna do then?

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.406
Hold on, I have an idea.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.275
There's a way.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.309
What is it?

00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:32.679
We're gonna use both routes.

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:34.047
Huh! Oh!

00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:40.220
One of us will go to the
bridge where he's waiting,

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:42.089
and that person will be carrying

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.958
this nearly
identical tea kettle.

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:47.327
At the very least,
that'll buy a little time

00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:50.230
for the other one of us who'll
be taking the longer detour

00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:52.232
with the real Shukaku.

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:54.935
I see, a decoy operation!

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.537
Exactly.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.539
But you know, right?

00:18:58.572 --> 00:18:59.940
Know what?

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:03.177
That the decoy
probably won't survive.

00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:05.579
Yeah, I know that.

00:19:06.847 --> 00:19:08.282
So I'll do it.

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:09.950
(soft music)

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.686
We'll need Shadow Clone
Jutsu and Transformation

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:13.954
for this to work.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.690
And, only I can do those.

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:18.825
You'll take Shukaku to the Leaf.

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:20.561
So what do you think?

00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:22.196
It just seems logical.

00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:26.066
(soft upbeat music)

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.804
Are you leaving now?

00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:33.073
Hey, don't look so sad.

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:35.309
We're in the middle
of a mission here.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.316
It seems that you're always
saving us, thank you.

00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:44.318
No problem.

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:47.721
And I owe you thanks as well.

00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:51.592
Although I did
nothing in particular.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.561
Don't be so shy.

00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:55.596
Let's go.

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:59.333
(water rushing)

00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:03.303
The bridge is just up ahead.

00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:08.408
Once we cross it we'll
be in the Hidden Leaf.

00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:09.943
(air whooshing)

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:12.546
[Urashiki] I've been
getting tired of waiting.

00:20:12.579 --> 00:20:14.081
There you are.

00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:18.085
Seriously, did you two take
a wrong turn or something?

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:21.321
(Byakugan blazing)

00:20:21.989 --> 00:20:25.058
(water splashing)

00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:29.229
What about you?

00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:31.598
Why did you attack
those innocent people?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.469
Oh, you that man
and his daughter?

00:20:35.502 --> 00:20:37.604
Well, since I couldn't
find the two of you

00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:41.074
I needed to do something to
kill some time, didn't I?

00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:42.943
[Boruto] Kill some time?

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:44.811
Why are you so upset about it?

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:47.080
You don't even know
them, they're strangers.

00:20:47.114 --> 00:20:48.315
[Shinki] Why you?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.818
Hey, don't forget
about the plan.

00:20:51.852 --> 00:20:53.320
(scoffs) Yeah, but--

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:57.090
Don't worry, I'm totally
gonna beat him up.

00:20:57.124 --> 00:20:58.492
But before I can do that,

00:20:58.525 --> 00:21:01.562
there's still something else
that you and I need to do.

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:04.364
(Urashiki laughs)

00:21:04.398 --> 00:21:09.570
-(suspenseful music)
-(footsteps approaching)

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:16.443
Looks like it's started, huh?

00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:21.348
So, is this what
you meant earlier

00:21:21.381 --> 00:21:24.484
when you were talking about
unavoidable sacrifice?

00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:27.955
Hey, what's with the
sad look on your face?

00:21:27.988 --> 00:21:30.090
There's no look on my face.

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:31.625
Oh well, okay then.

00:21:31.658 --> 00:21:34.361
But what's that feeling when
you leave something behind

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:36.697
but you keep turning
back to look at it?

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.966
It's called regret, isn't it?

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:42.035
(suspenseful music)

00:21:45.706 --> 00:21:48.308
(wind rustling)

00:21:55.582 --> 00:21:57.818
My chakra's, replenishing.

00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.319
I Just hope,

00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:07.594
I'm not too late.

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:13.734
(Closing Theme Music)

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.720
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:42.823 --> 00:23:45.225
Boruto, it's up to
you to buy us time.

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:47.227
[Boruto] Leave it
all to me, you know.

00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:49.963
[Urashiki] First it's tag and
now it's hide-and-go-seek?

00:23:49.997 --> 00:23:51.331
It's pointless to struggle,

00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:54.234
so why don't you just hand
the One Tail over to me now?

00:23:54.268 --> 00:23:57.337
[Boruto] Hmm, like we'd
just give him to you.

00:23:57.371 --> 00:24:01.074
[Urashiki] Such audacity
from someone so weak.

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:04.411
[Narrator] Next time on "Boruto:
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:06.079
"Boruto and Shinki."

00:24:06.113 --> 00:24:07.481
[Boruto] I gotta buy some time

00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:09.449
till Shinki reaches
the Leaf, or else.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:15.455
