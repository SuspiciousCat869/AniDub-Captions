00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:07.441
(soft classical music plays)

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.475
(grunting)

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:16.083
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe I didn't understand

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.620
what Mr. Kankuro's resolve
meant, and Shinki's either.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:26.093
But still, I can't accept
parting with a friend like that,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:30.130
in that way, is simply
saying it couldn't be helped!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:34.835
Even if that's what Mr.
Kankuro wanted. I'm not Shinki!

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.336
I can't just accept it!

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.942
For a friend or for a mission,
it's a difficult decision

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.444
that Shinobi have to
make all the time.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:50.450
Boruto, tell me, what do you
think your duty is right now?

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:54.988
To protect Shukaku with
everything I've got.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:57.191
For Mr. Kankuro's sake.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.729
(Dramatic music plays)

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.502
Shinki, you think
we have a chance?

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.839
I doubt that they're weak
enough to allow us to get away.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:17.044
Besides, I have to
avenge my uncle!

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:20.514
Master Shukaku, please
pull back for now.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.483
All right, then, go ahead
and show me what you got!

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.488
(clicking sound)

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:34.595
Hmm.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.435
(Dramatic music plays)

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:56.316
(blasting sounds)

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.308
(sword slicing)

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:27.714
(Dramatic music)

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.956
[Master Shukaku] What?!
We're running away?

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.624
I thought you were gonna fight!

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:43.363
A poison needle, eh?
Is your arm paralyzed?

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.265
I'm sure it'll wear off in time.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.468
If only Boruto were here!
Then the two of you might have

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.204
been able to do
something about that

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:52.072
tattered puppet together.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.374
What exactly are
you trying to say?

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:58.212
Ha ha ha! If you'd been able
to take it down, it wouldn't

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:01.849
be such a sore subject! If
Kankuro's dead, you would've

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.350
gotten your revenge!

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:07.387
My only goal now is to get you
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.123
I simply concluded that
it's unnecessary to fight

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:11.358
a pointless battle.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:17.064
(slow footsteps)

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.436
(grunting)

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.706
(menacing music plays)

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.180
(running footsteps)

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.214
Ahhh!

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:43.056
(Opening Theme Music)

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:57.337
(singing in Japanese)

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:14.481
(Opening Theme Music)

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.690
(sand scratches)

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:25.726
(dramatic music plays)

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.698
Boruto.

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.404
(Attack Yell)

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.575
(metal clanging)

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.145
Come on, let's go!

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:51.451
(dramatic music plays)

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:00.494
[Temari] Be careful.
After all, this one was

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:04.164
strong enough to fend
off Kankuro's attacks.

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:15.342
[Boruto] You okay?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.645
[Shinki] I'm fine. My
arm's just a bit numb.

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:20.447
It'll be fine in a little while.

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:25.285
(sighs) I owe you an apology.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:28.288
And what does that mean?

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.193
All I cared about
was how I felt.

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:36.496
I didn't take your feelings
into account at all.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.767
It was only after Temari talked
to me that I realized it.

00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:44.037
That's right. If he wins,
great. And if he doesn't,

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:47.608
then he's just going to
take them down with him.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:52.045
In this situation, any sand
Shinobi would do the same thing.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.280
What did you say?!

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:56.517
(capes whirring)

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.586
(puppets clicking)

00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:05.292
(explosion)

00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:15.068
Mr. Kankuro's just as important
to you, probably more.

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:17.571
I'm sure the situation's
really hard for you.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.408
And selfishly, I
wasn't seeing that.

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:25.412
(sighs)

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.184
What I feel doesn't
really matter.

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:33.353
As long as you don't forget
what a Shinobi's duty is.

00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:36.590
[Boruto] Sure, the mission's
the top priority for Shinobi.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.596
Even so, I say my friends
are just as important.

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:45.465
What's that?

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:48.468
And in the end, even
if it's for a mission,

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:51.071
I can't just let my
friends be sacrificed.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.507
Come on, why can't
you think rationally

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.474
about things for once?

00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.577
Does being rational
make everything okay?

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.946
Even if the mission
might be successful,

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:02.716
I will not lose any
friends on the way!

00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:07.354
You don't understand
anything at all

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:10.490
I won't do things just
'cause they're rational.

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:14.194
If I think like that,
I'll end up regretting it.

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:17.831
Up 'til now, not one time
have I ever regretted

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:21.368
thinking rationally.
And I never will!

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.071
Your naivetÃ© puts your
friends in danger!

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:26.673
Without the correct way
of thinking, you'll fail,

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.475
in missions and elsewhere!

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.445
No, they're both correct
ways of thinking.

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:36.083
That's why I'll find
a way to do both!

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.920
Ha ha ha ha! This is so
much fun; you sure are

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.956
Naruto's kid! Well,
all right then, go on.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.958
Do it the way you want.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:48.262
Of course. That's
what I plan on doing.

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:50.831
I'm gonna help Shikadai and
Temari. You can stay here

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.799
and rest up.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:56.270
(Footsteps moving away)

00:08:57.337 --> 00:09:01.175
He's so naive. He
understands nothing. Ugh!

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:05.712
Master Shukaku!

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:09.416
(sighs)

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.924
No way! He didn't go
with Boruto, did he?

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:20.060
(rock music plays)

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:29.503
An autonomous puppet, huh?
Just one annoying thing

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:30.704
after another!

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.308
Don't let your guard down,
simply because it's a puppet!

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.677
(Metal clashing)

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.146
(grunting)

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:47.955
(mist spraying)

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:48.956
What?

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:51.158
It's poison; don't breathe!

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.732
(wind roaring)

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.575
[Boruto] Need some help?

00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:14.047
Ah, dammit, had
to come back, huh?

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:16.483
Seriously, you're
hopeless, aren't you?

00:10:16.517 --> 00:10:20.487
Sorry, but this is the
way I wanna do things.

00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.756
Now come on, let's
deal with this bastard,

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.726
so we can head back to the
Leaf Village with Shinki.

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.698
(creaking sounds)

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:37.304
(whooshing sound)

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:44.645
All right. Get ready. Because
bringing that thing down

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:46.280
isn't gonna be easy at all.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.551
(rock music plays)

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:53.687
Go, go!

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.656
Master Shukaku!

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:57.057
Oh, hi Shinki.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:01.061
How can you just stand
there, calmly watching them?

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:03.363
Please, think of the
situation that you're in.

00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:06.200
Oh, just shut up! I mean,
nothing's ever really gonna

00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:07.935
get resolved if
we don't deal with

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.037
the pursuers first, right?

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:12.906
(sighs)

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.043
(Footsteps racing)

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:23.684
(grunting)

00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:26.053
(screams)

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:31.291
Are you okay?

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:32.326
I'm fine.

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:37.764
(swords clashing)

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:40.834
Their moves are rife with
inefficiencies. They should

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:43.570
coordinate their
attacks with my aunt.

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:46.373
It's not rational to charge
in with your emotions

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.141
running so high.

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:51.178
[Master Shukaku] It
doesn't seem that way.

00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:55.449
(grunting)

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:58.018
Hey Auntie!

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.523
(explosion sound)

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:03.557
I'm on it!

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:07.027
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:12:16.937 --> 00:12:18.605
[Master Shukaku] Looks
like it's gonna work out

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:23.076
quite nicely! I said he's like
Naruto! But Boruto's actually

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.413
even smarter and more
skilled. I guess he's not that

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:28.015
reckless after all!

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:31.185
(creaking sounds)

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.356
But, then again, I'm not
really an expert on logic,

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.060
emotions, how humans think,
and all that kinda stuff.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.362
Huh? Hey! Come on!

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.932
This is just about when
things are gonna start getting

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.200
really good!

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:47.935
There's no time, let's go.

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.704
Seriously, aren't
you gonna watch?

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:53.207
[Shinki] I'm sure they'll
catch up to us in time.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.443
But right now, I have
to fulfill my duty.

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:59.546
Oh come on, you're
fulfilling it just fine.

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:02.316
We have to hurry.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.420
(Footsteps racing)

00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:18.632
(Japanese rock music playing)

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.234
Come on, let's do this!

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:30.410
(gasps)

00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:36.750
Boruto, Shikadai, look out!

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:39.686
(explosion blasts)

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:44.157
Is that thing really a puppet?

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:47.427
[Shikadai] Where'd it go?

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:51.465
[Boruto] Did it just run away?

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.499
I doubt it!

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.438
Hmm?

00:13:58.472 --> 00:13:59.473
(metal clanging)

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:09.416
[Shikadai] No way, it
burrowed underground!

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.985
[Boruto] Dammit, so we
can't know where it's gonna

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.220
come from next!

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:16.256
(puppet clicking)

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.492
(grunting)

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:25.332
Dammit, it went
underground again!

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:28.402
If it's down there, mom's
wind style can't reach it!

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.737
[Temari] Oh yeah? And
who told you that?

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:32.940
But how?

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:35.542
Just you watch me! If it
slithered underground,

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:38.111
we just have to drag
it back out again.

00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:41.248
(fan opening)

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:45.385
Wind Style: Sea Dragon!

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.656
(wind whipping)

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:57.664
Amazing!

00:15:04.938 --> 00:15:08.242
Now Wind Style:
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.546
(wind whipping)

00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:18.785
(electronic shooting sound)

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:20.020
Shikadai!

00:15:27.628 --> 00:15:28.729
Mom, no!

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.763
Aunt Temari!

00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:34.635
(bomb blasts)

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:36.970
I sure messed that one up, huh?

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:38.605
(Temari groaning)

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.174
[Shikadai] Mom, are you-

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:43.110
[Temari] Oh, come on now,
don't you give me that look!

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:45.812
Those claws had some kind
of paralyzing agent on them.

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:49.550
I don't think I'll be able to
move for a bit at this rate.

00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:53.287
But that means...

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:02.796
You two go on! Just leave
me here. At least I can

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:04.198
buy you some time.

00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:06.033
You really expect me to do that?

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:08.769
You can't lose sight of
your goal, you know that!

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:11.238
[Boruto] I haven't
lost sight of anything!

00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:15.242
I'm not gonna desert my
friends! And still, I'll deliver

00:16:15.275 --> 00:16:17.344
Shukaku to the Leaf safely!

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:22.182
Boruto, think about
the situation. (groans)

00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:25.319
Yeah, I have been. And I
can't just leave you like this

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:30.257
and keep on going. There's
no way. Right, Shikadai?

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:33.427
Yeah, you're sure
right about that.

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:36.296
What? What are you two...

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.399
So, what are we gonna do?

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.502
Wait, you're saying that
you don't already have

00:16:41.535 --> 00:16:42.636
a plan in mind?

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.239
Well, I figured I'd just
kinda leave that up to you,

00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:48.976
Shikadai. I'm counting on
you, Mister Strategist!

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.745
Dammit, you're just all
talk, you know that?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.650
All right, since it's sink or
swim, let's just go for it!

00:16:57.618 --> 00:17:00.320
Yeah! Now that's more like it!

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:01.722
Shikadai...

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:04.057
Just leave this one to us, Mom.

00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:06.527
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.262
(exploding sounds)

00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:11.098
Now come at me, ya dumb puppet!

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.135
(Clicking sounds)

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.606
(Rock music plays)

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:23.110
It took the bait!

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.485
[Boruto] Shikadai!

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:34.188
There's no way that I can
equal Mom's Jutsu, but,

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.223
Wind Style: Sea Dragon!

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:40.294
(Wind roaring)

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:47.968
If we can get it
inside the vortex,

00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:49.570
then we can drag it out.

00:17:49.603 --> 00:17:50.604
Got it!

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.275
Now take this!

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:02.115
(creaking sounds)

00:18:06.887 --> 00:18:10.490
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu
complete! Go Boruto!

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:27.307
(grunting)

00:18:27.341 --> 00:18:28.342
Rasengan!

00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:32.646
(Explosion blasts)

00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:37.417
(Rock music finishes)

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:47.027
Nice one! You never
told me you could use

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.295
a Wind Style like that!

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:51.632
Well, I gotta keep some
tricks up my sleeve.

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:53.800
(clapping sound)

00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:55.202
[Temari] Tricks up your sleeve?

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.438
Hey, Mom.

00:18:58.472 --> 00:19:00.841
Using a technique that
you're not entirely ready for

00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:03.677
was quite a big
gamble. How unlike you.

00:19:05.012 --> 00:19:06.980
(laugh) Yeah, and
thanks to that,

00:19:07.014 --> 00:19:09.116
I'm practically out of chakra.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:12.653
Well, still, you did
a really good job.

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:15.255
(both laughing)

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:18.158
Boruto, we're going to need
to rest here for a while,

00:19:18.192 --> 00:19:19.993
so you go after Shinki.

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:22.196
But we need to treat your wound.

00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:25.265
Don't worry, I'm gonna be
just fine. But right now,

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:28.435
you're forgetting about the
mission that you were given.

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:31.605
We'll catch our breath a
bit, look for Uncle Kankuro,

00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:32.973
and then catch up.

00:19:33.874 --> 00:19:35.175
[Boruto] Okay.

00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:37.010
[Shikadai] Be careful.

00:19:37.044 --> 00:19:40.447
(Footsteps retreating)

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.250
Ugh. I don't think I
can take another step!

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:46.153
You didn't have to show off
in front of Boruto like that,

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.889
you know. When we return to
the Leaf, you're gonna get

00:19:48.922 --> 00:19:50.791
some intense training
in Wind Style.

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:52.025
(gasp)

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:53.660
Mom!

00:19:58.432 --> 00:20:01.668
You two are the only ones
here, isn't that right?

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:04.371
And that would mean that
Boruto and the others have

00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:06.006
gone on ahead.

00:20:07.174 --> 00:20:10.043
Hey, you're that...

00:20:10.077 --> 00:20:12.112
I've been watching
your oh-so-touching

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:15.415
mother-and-son partnership
through my puppets.

00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:18.619
And now, I'll be helping
myself to both of your chakra!

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.489
(gun shooting)

00:20:23.624 --> 00:20:26.527
It really is too bad that
Toneri's puppets were

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.196
completely demolished.
They turned out to be

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:33.166
pretty useless! It'll be quite
a problem if the One-Tail

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.469
is able to reach
the Leaf Village.

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:38.672
(swooshing sound)

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.643
And besides, I'd really
like to enjoy a little more

00:20:42.676 --> 00:20:44.545
playtime, while I still can!

00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:50.651
[Master Shukaku] Hey, Shinki!

00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:52.319
[Shinki] Yes, what is it?

00:20:52.352 --> 00:20:54.788
Wanna bet on whether
Boruto and the others

00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:56.089
beat that puppet?

00:20:58.325 --> 00:21:01.995
Are you even listening to
me? You're no fun at all,

00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:03.230
you know that?

00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:06.500
[Boruto] Shinki!

00:21:10.537 --> 00:21:15.542
(panting) Oh man, I
finally caught up with you!

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:18.478
Did ya beat the puppet?

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:20.247
Yeah, somehow.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.615
And what about the others?

00:21:21.648 --> 00:21:24.151
They'll be coming in just
a little while, after they

00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:25.485
search for Kankuro.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.757
Ah! Looks like this time,
Boruto wins, doesn't it?

00:21:33.026 --> 00:21:35.028
It's not about
winning or losing.

00:21:36.163 --> 00:21:39.399
Let's get going. We've
lost too much time already.

00:21:39.433 --> 00:21:42.503
We have to get to the Leaf
Village as quickly as possible.

00:21:43.937 --> 00:21:45.706
Hey! Wait up!

00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:47.875
(footsteps hurrying)

00:21:47.908 --> 00:21:50.978
(whistling music)

00:21:57.184 --> 00:22:00.320
Hmm. Well, well, found you.

00:22:01.688 --> 00:22:03.190
How exciting! I'll torment you

00:22:03.223 --> 00:22:06.760
to my heart's fullest content!

00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:16.103
(Closing Theme Music)

00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:46.226
(Shinki) There's no
time to waste.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.895
Urashiki's going to
catch up to us!

00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:50.731
(Boruto) Calm down! It's not
like you to be so impatient!

00:23:50.764 --> 00:23:53.934
(Shinki) This isn't the time
to say stuff like that!

00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:55.936
It's over if we
get caught!

00:23:55.969 --> 00:23:59.306
We must consider every move
carefully now.

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:02.509
(Boruto) Next time on Boruto
Naruto Next Generations:

00:24:02.543 --> 00:24:04.144
"Decision Time"

00:24:04.178 --> 00:24:07.314
Shinki, I have an idea!
There's a way!

00:24:11.051 --> 00:24:16.256
(Closing Theme Music)
