WEBVTT

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.685
Hey, Boruto! Don't be in such a
hurry, alright?

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.288
I'm not in a hurry at all!

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.025
(SARADA) <i>Just so you know,</i>
<i>Orochimaru's research lab is</i>
<i>guarded by jonin...</i>

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.394
<i>We can't rush up to it</i>
<i>recklessly.</i>

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.028
(BORUTO) <i>Yeah...</i>

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.698
Just remember, it's all over if
we get caught, okay?

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:37.271
Hey, about Mitsuki's snake...
Will we really find out more...

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.740
...just by asking this
Orochimaru guy?

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:44.645
Probably. I have a feeling that
asking him about the snake will
be the quickest route.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:49.216
Alright! Then as soon as we
learn something, we're gonna go
and look for Mitsuki!

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:49.449
Okay!

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.619
Wait for us, Mitsuki!

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:38.358
Mitsuki?...

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:39.927
...Disappeared?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.229
Yes. And he didn't just
disappear.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:45.465
He attacked some guards, and
then he just ran away.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.468
That's what happened...

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.772
You seem to be trying to express
that you're surprised...

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:53.740
but hiding things won't help you
out.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:58.078
Oh? Are you implying that I'm
the one pulling the strings from
the shadows?

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:01.315
But why would I do such a thing?

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:05.285
Listen... it's been quite a
while since I came to this place

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.288
to keep and eye on what you've
been up to here...

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:11.325
There haven't been any problems
all this time. But still...

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.493
this issue's not something we
can overlook.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:17.164
Yamato... I think you should
know by now...

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:22.903
That my only goal is to simply
unlock the truth about
everything in this world.

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.505
I've no interests beyond-

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:25.172
In any case...

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:30.644
...if he contacts you, make sure
you let me know. Remember, this
is for Mitsuki's sake, as well.

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:34.047
Hmmm...

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:40.454
What a mess... Who would've
thought that this would happen?

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:46.126
(HOMURA) <i>Naruto... I get the</i>
gist of the point that you're
<i>making.</i>

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:48.662
However...

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.764
I simply cannot accept it.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:56.470
According to this data, we don't
even know if this Mitsuki is a
human child or not.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:57.437
Isn't that right?

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.073
<i>Why'd you allow him in the</i>
<i>village?!</i>

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:01.775
Mm...

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.378
And solely at your discretion?!

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:10.617
Without a doubt, we acknowledge
that Orochimaru could well pose
a danger. All the same...

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:15.289
We believe that in time, his
research will prove very useful
to the village.

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:17.257
Naruto, is all of this true?

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.261
Even if it is, he should've
consulted with us first.

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:23.764
Just acting on your own like
this is-

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:27.701
He probably thought you'd oppose
the idea if he brought it up,
right?

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:28.602
Well, I uh...

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.705
I believe that you're all right.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:32.706
Huh?!

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.708
Kakashi Sensei...!

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.477
The way he went about it was
definitely reckless...

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.914
but I think Naruto also has a
good point.

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.417
The Hokage is the guardian of
the village.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.387
I can't imagine he'd do anything
that wouldn't be to its benefit,
right?

00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:48.121
Kakashi...

00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:51.859
And our job is to offer help and
support to the Hokage.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:56.129
Our role now is not to criticize
what has already occurred but to
assist in finding ways to...

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:59.366
resolve the situation...
Isn't that so?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.100
[sigh and groan]

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:05.105
(NARUTO) <i>That boy... Ever since</i>
<i>he came to the village...</i>

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:09.142
...Mitsuki has attended the
Academy diligently and has
always worked hard on the...

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:14.214
missions he's been assigned as
a Hidden Leaf shinobi alongside
Boruto and Sarada.

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:19.086
That's why I still want to
maintain my faith in him. I want
to believe Mitsuki.

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:25.459
[sigh] Then we have no choice...

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:29.530
Alright! Searching for Mitsuki
has to become our top priority
now.

00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:33.700
The situation will only get
worse if we keep wasting time
like this.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.903
Tsunade, you're being so--!

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:38.639
Aren't you being too easy on
Lord Seventh?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.208
Uh, Lord Seventh, sir!

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:43.710
Boruto and Sarada haven't
returned home!

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:44.511
Huh?!

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:48.248
[chattering]

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:51.485
Okay... I'll have the search
party for Mitsuki head westward.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:55.556
I assume that Boruto and Sarada
have gone after Mitsuki.

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:56.690
Probably.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.458
(SHIKAMARU) <i>Shikadai...</i>

00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:02.663
...most likely knows what Boruto
is thinking. So Team Moegi
should-

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:04.331
Hm?

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.199
Konohamaru!

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:08.468
Please, let me go along, too.

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.037
Mm...

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.475
First Mitsuki and now Boruto and
Sarada, too. This involves Team
7. It's my team's problem.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.313
Look, Konohamaru, I can imagine
how you're feeling. However...

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:22.449
Why'd you keep me in the dark
about Mitsuki?

00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:27.621
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you, Lord Seventh?!

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:31.725
Orochimaru isn't only a heinous
criminal who brought disaster
upon the Leaf Village...

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.060
he's also...

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:41.268
(NARUTO) <i>He's also the one who</i>
<i>killed your grandfather.</i>

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.638
So why did you put Mitsuki on my
team, then?

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:52.913
Mitsuki has become important to
me, and I truly do trust him as
a member of Team 7, but still!

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.982
Listen, Konohamaru...

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:59.319
What if you had known? What if I
told you about Mitsuki before
this?

00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:01.188
Would anything have
changed?

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.122
[gasp]

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:05.125
It's only natural that you can't
forgive Orochimaru.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:08.762
But Mitsuki hasn't done anything
to earn your anger.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:14.067
Just because he's the son of
your enemy, that doesn't make it
reasonable to hate him, does it?

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:17.971
Yes, I'm well aware of that,
believe me! And it's because I
know-

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:23.477
What I wanted was you to get to
know Mitsuki without any of that
getting in the way!

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.515
Although the way you found out,
having it sprung on you the way
that it was...

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:29.516
...I truly regret that.

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:33.554
Then, please sir! I'm begging
you! Let me go on the mission,
too!

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:36.490
Konohamaru... Listen, you gotta
calm down.

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.993
You can't let personal feelings
interfere with a mission. I'm
sorry...

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:42.629
but this time I can't let
you go.

00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:43.463
[quivered breath]

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:51.471
It's not like Sarada to run off
on her own like this, don't you
think?

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:54.208
I'm guessing that she couldn't
stop Boruto, so she went with
him.

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:57.911
No way! What if Sarada's the one
who came up with this?

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.980
I really doubt that's what
happened.

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:02.349
Hey, so what do you think,
Shikadai?

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:05.085
Do you think Mitsuki's
involved in this incident
somehow?

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:06.653
Huh?

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.090
Uh, Shikadai?

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:15.128
That's not the problem right
now. We gotta stop Boruto and
Sarada.

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:17.731
And soon, before the hunters
become the hunted.

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:19.132
Hmmm...

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.069
Damn it, what a drag...

00:08:23.904 --> 00:08:26.473
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:30.978
As you all know, our mission, is
for us to bring Boruto and
Sarada back.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.246
Yes, ma'am!

00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:51.665
[gasp]

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.435
So he did come back...

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.038
[gasp]

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.040
Get him!

00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:10.250
[grunt]

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:22.462
Wow, this place... I almost
can't believe Mitsuki actually
used to live here...

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:28.435
Alright, Orochimaru... where are
you, huh?

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:34.074
Uh...!

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:45.452
[gasp]

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:56.129
[gasp]

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:03.637
[gasp]

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.573
Uh...!

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.375
Omph!

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.978
<i>Mitsuki...</i>

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:13.847
No, it can't be...

00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:15.282
(SUIGETSU) <i>Don't move.</i>

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:16.583
[gasp]

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:19.086
So, sneaking in here, huh...?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.420
What a naughty kid.

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:21.588
[quivered breath]

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:24.057
You must be Boruto, right?

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:32.933
It's nice to meet you.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.170
[heavy breath] So, wait, are you
Orochimaru, then?

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:40.374
Hey! It's "Lord" Orochimaru! And
my name is Suigetsu.

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:43.443
What is all of this?

00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:45.412
He looks like Mitsuki...

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:46.580
A lot...

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:55.355
Yes, that's right. Every one of
them here is Mitsuki...

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:56.023
What?!

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:02.596
The Mitsuki I entrusted to the
Leaf is also one of my
experiments.

00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:05.866
He's one of your
experiments...?!

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:10.370
Look, what is going on here?! Is
Mitsuki your child or isn't he?!

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:15.142
Of course he's my child.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:19.079
I heard... that he has
disappeared from the Village.

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:22.249
Why are you so calm?! Aren't you
worried at all?!

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:24.651
There's no need to worry.

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:25.385
[gasp]

00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:28.856
If anyone were to get wind of
what he is...

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:33.260
...the curse mark I implanted in
him will automatically
activate...

00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:35.395
and he will simply
self-destruct.

00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:42.669
There's no need to worry that
the secrets of my research will
be revealed.

00:11:42.703 --> 00:11:46.139
What does that mean?! That's not
what I'm talking about!

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:49.409
Curse marks, secret research...
Mitsuki's not a "thing!"

00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:51.845
How can you even call yourself a
parent?!

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.013
[chuckle]

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:55.415
What's so funny, huh?!

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:56.617
Nothing...

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:59.586
Anyway, Boruto...

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.424
You didn't actually come all the
way here merely to complain to
me, did you?

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.995
[grunts]

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:17.571
I wonder if Boruto's managed to
<i>sneak inside yet.</i>

00:12:18.705 --> 00:12:19.740
[grunts]

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:22.276
[grunt] Ah!

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:23.577
[grunt]

00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:29.216
[grunts]

00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:32.052
[grunts]

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:33.587
[grunt]

00:12:34.454 --> 00:12:35.389
Boruto's waiting.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.025
You just leave Yamato to me.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.433
Miss Karin, it's you!

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:50.571
You bet'cha! I think that those
glasses look just great on you!

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:56.009
Thank you so much, Karin!

00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:04.318
This snake... what message did
it communicate to you?

00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:07.354
It just said, "this is... My
will."

00:13:07.387 --> 00:13:09.690
Hm...

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:14.394
But still... I mean, that
doesn't really tell me anything
at all, ya know?!

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.031
I figured if there's
anything...

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:21.635
...like even a small clue
in it...

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.570
I want you to check, please!

00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:30.344
Alright then... But it will take
some time, so please wait here.

00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.846
Your friend should be arriving
shortly.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.014
Uh...!

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:37.384
Sarada!

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:41.421
Hey, I heard he's going to
check. Thank goodness!

00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:44.258
Yeah... but...

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.058
Huh...?

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.630
Uhhh, Sarada. You've been here
before, haven't you?

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:51.865
Yeah. It was real quick, though.

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:53.433
Then, did you know?

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:54.368
Huh...?

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:07.080
No way... these are....

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:10.184
Yeah., they're all Mitsuki.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:13.020
[sighed moan]

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:24.031
It seems that Mitsuki's gone
into stage two.

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:25.399
[grunt]

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.037
I told you before the boy can't
become the light alone.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:31.972
However...

00:14:33.607 --> 00:14:36.410
...if the sun illuminates him,
he'll shine through the
darkness, like moonlight.

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:37.845
I see.

00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:39.713
But before he does so...

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:44.852
it's possible he'll feel the
need to understand the true
nature of that moonlight.

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:47.588
Understand the true nature of
the moonlight?

00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:49.823
That's correct.

00:14:49.857 --> 00:14:54.561
All we can really do is watch
over him so that he can
understand.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.064
Found him!

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:01.568
[chuckle]

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:08.742
You can't get away form us now,
Mitsuki.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.377
[chuckle]

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:15.649
[gasp and growl] Just what the
hell are you up to?

00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:18.418
Didn't you think that was a good
training exercise?

00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:22.356
You have to get serious now and
then or you'll grow dull!

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:24.591
[grunt and gasp]

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:28.462
Huh?!

00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:37.204
The snake had no other message
to offer aside from the one you
heard, unfortunately.

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:39.973
But why...?

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:45.045
Why don't you know?!

00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:47.581
Why did Mitsuki disappear the
way he did, then?!

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:52.252
Ask all you want, but I have no
answers for you.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:54.655
Are you Mitsuki's parent or
not?!

00:15:54.688 --> 00:15:58.892
Because you have replacements,
you aren't worried, is that it?

00:15:58.926 --> 00:16:01.161
So you're okay with knowing
nothing?!

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:05.632
Why didn't Mitsuki just let me
know what was going on so
I'd understand?

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:11.505
Why did he go off all by himself
like that? I don't get it, I
don't get it at all!

00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:15.108
After the incident, when we
found out about Mitsuki's true
identity...

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:18.245
Grandma Tsunade and
the others... every one
of them...

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:21.548
They all became suspicious of
Mitsuki!

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:24.585
But... there's no way he'd do
something like that!

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.421
Really, how can you be so sure?

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.021
What?!

00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:35.162
You saw earlier. That boy was
born in a test tube and raised
in a lab.

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:38.432
You didn't even know
that before, did you?

00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:39.399
[gasp]

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:45.639
It was his choice to leave this
place and to go to the Hidden
Leaf Village.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:50.377
I supported his decision and
asked Naruto to take him in.

00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:54.248
Let me ask you, Boruto...

00:16:54.281 --> 00:17:00.854
...if it was Mitsuki's will, his
choice, to leave the Leaf
Village... how will you feel?

00:17:00.888 --> 00:17:01.188
Uh...!

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.024
[heavy breath]

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:13.000
Boruto... You okay?

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:17.404
I'm sorry... that I got so
heated in there.

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.572
It's not like you...

00:17:19.606 --> 00:17:22.009
So uncool, right?

00:17:23.644 --> 00:17:25.646
I feel the same way as you.

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:26.380
Huh...?

00:17:27.948 --> 00:17:31.218
I don't really have a clue about
what was going through Mitsuki's
head, either.

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:35.255
I mean, he hardly told us much
about anything at all, you
know?

00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:40.027
No, you're wrong. We just didn't
try hard enough to listen to
him.

00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:41.662
At all.

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:42.996
Really.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.431
Yeah...

00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:49.036
We were always together, all the
time in the world to talk...

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.004
But I...

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:55.642
Although... you were right about
what you said.

00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:56.577
Huh?

00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:00.581
[grunt]

00:18:00.614 --> 00:18:04.017
Friends trust each other until
the very end, right?

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:08.655
That's right. But that isn't all
of it.

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:09.990
Uh...?

00:18:12.593 --> 00:18:14.494
Mitsuki being born here...

00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:18.265
And... how he lived after coming
to the village...

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:25.005
...what he was thinking, what he
was feeling... I didn't really
understand it... at all...

00:18:26.507 --> 00:18:28.575
But still... Because of all
that...

00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:32.980
I wanna see him and I really and
truly wanna get to know him.

00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:36.583
(BORUTO) I feel that from the
<i>bottom of my heart.</i>

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:40.988
Hey.

00:18:41.855 --> 00:18:43.991
What are you doing? Hurry!

00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:51.865
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:54.268
That's why I'm absolutely gonna
find him.

00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.403
But where do we even start
looking?

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:57.171
Hmmm...

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.207
(OROCHIMARU) <i>So, what'll you do</i>
<i>now?</i>

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.576
Are you all out of options?

00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:05.179
Yeah, but...

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.851
...there's one thing I know
for sure. That I still have
trust in Mitsuki, even now.

00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:14.755
Because, after all, I know he's
our friend.

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:17.424
I don't know why he
disappeared...

00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:22.362
...but I'm just gonna keep on
believing in Mitsuki. And that's
why...

00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:25.399
I have to see him again, no
matter what!

00:19:28.202 --> 00:19:33.540
You're really just like the
Naruto I knew in the past.

00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:36.577
Is this snake's message your
only clue?

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:37.411
Huh?

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:43.417
What I believe is that all
things possess their own
individual thoughts.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:48.121
And it's not only through words
that one can convey one's will.

00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:51.191
Can you please stop saying
things that make no sense?

00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:56.363
So impatient. You ought to
listen to people more closely.

00:19:56.396 --> 00:20:00.601
What I'm saying is that the
snake itself should have its own
thoughts.

00:20:02.603 --> 00:20:04.004
It's own thoughts...?

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:09.843
You mean that we can extract
detailed information about
Mitsuki from the snake itself?

00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:12.079
As I'd expect from Sasuke's
daughter.

00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:13.981
Then... can you check that out?

00:20:14.014 --> 00:20:17.851
For me, it's impossible.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:20.854
However, I know someone who can
do it.

00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:22.322
[gasps]

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:25.058
Yeah? So who is it?! And where
are they?!

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.164
I mean the White Snake Sage, who
lives in Ryuchi Cave.

00:20:31.198 --> 00:20:35.969
The Sage is far from ordinary.
And quite an eccentric.

00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:43.210
Orochimaru!

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:46.079
Well, well... What do you want
from me now?

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:49.183
I want answers! Why did you set
Karin after me?

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:51.084
What are you talking about?

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:52.719
Feigning ignorance again?

00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:57.257
Then I'll ask another question.
Has anybody else come here
recently?

00:20:57.291 --> 00:21:00.661
I'm considered a heinous
criminal by the Leaf.

00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:05.599
Now who in the world would ever
want to come here looking for
someone like me?

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:09.503
We believe that Boruto and
Sarada may have come here
looking for Mitsuki.

00:21:09.536 --> 00:21:11.171
That's news to me.

00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:14.441
I don't have a choice. I'm going
to look around.

00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:16.577
Go on. Be my guest...

00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:19.379
[gasp]

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:30.858
(OROCHIMARU) <i>Ryuchi Cave lies in</i>
the darkest, farthest reaches of
<i>the night.</i>

00:21:30.891 --> 00:21:33.627
<i>Only those seeking it</i>
<i>can find it.</i>

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.665
<i>I hope you get to meet the</i>
White Snake Sage. However, even
<i>if you do...</i>

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:42.870
<i>I wonder if you'll be</i>
<i>able to return alive...</i>

00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:48.175
Listen, Boruto... do you really
think that we're going to be
able to get to this Ryuchi Cave?

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:50.410
It isn't whether we'll be able
to.

00:21:50.444 --> 00:21:52.045
It's when!

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:53.280
(SHIKADAI) <i>Found you!</i>

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:53.714
[gasp]

00:21:57.584 --> 00:21:58.418
[grunt]

00:22:01.455 --> 00:22:04.224
You're not getting past us,
Boruto!

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:05.893
[grunts]

00:22:05.926 --> 00:22:08.395
We can't do this! We can't stop
now!

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:46.426
(SHIKADAI) <i>We're bringing you</i>
guys back to the village. That's
<i>our mission.</i>

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.530
(BORUTO) <i>Just hold on for a</i>
<i>minute, would ya, guys?!</i>

00:23:49.563 --> 00:23:53.767
I have to see Mitsuki one more
<i>time and confirm some things</i>
<i>with him!</i>

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.236
(SHIKADAI) <i>I understand you're</i>
<i>worried about your friend.</i>

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.306
But investigating the incident
isn't your mission, now, is it?

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:05.412
(BORUTO) <i>Next time on Boruto</i>
Naruto Next Generations: "The
<i>Enemy, Ino-Shika-Cho!"</i>

00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:08.749
You're saying I can't help
a friend unless it's a mission?!
