We won't lose, no matter who
they are!

Round Two features ten orders of
dry-aged sirloin from Barbe-Q!

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:37.204
The first three teams to finish
<i>eating it all...</i>

00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:40.040

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:03.764
I'll give you that. But
you're still no match for us!

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:04.765

hungry, right?

00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:12.072

<i>Finishing first is Team</i>

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:38.565
Damn it... I can't believe they
beat us!

00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:42.002
Hey, Honey! Did you see how I
wolfed all that food down...

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.037
like a real hero?!

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.340
Oh, boy, what does he think he's
doing...?!

The way things are going...

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:56.850
I think I'm definitely
gonna win back Mom's heart!

00:11:56.884 --> 00:11:59.086
Great, dad, just stay focused on
that!

00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:01.288

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.058
(SEETHING)

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:08.061
To be able to keep up with Choji
and Cho-Cho like that...

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:10.731
Man, just who are these guys?

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.704
Man, are those guys monsters or
something?!

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:21.141
Yeah, I've never seen anyone
eat like them before, Father.

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:24.178
What's going on with the two of
you?!

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:27.181
If Choji ends up winning
this contest...

00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:28.715
our shop is going to go
bankrupt!

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:32.819
That's what I'd like to ask you!
It's not just Choji Akimichi!

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:36.356
No one told us that his daughter
is just as ferocious an eater!

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.159
Come on! Where are those skills
you're so proud of?

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.096
I've no choice but to go to plan
B...

<i>Super-Hot n' Spicy Burger from</i>

The two teams that eat the most

will advance to the final round!

00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:08.589
Do we actually know for sure

00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:11.124
that it's okay for humans to eat
these things?

00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:15.195
No matter what they put in front
of me, I can't lose this!

00:13:15.229 --> 00:13:16.630
That looks so good!

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:20.334
Oh, man, now I wish I'd entered
the contest, too!

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:22.803
Eating something like that is
gonna ruin your health!

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.771
Ugh, this whole thing is so
stupid...

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:26.640
<i>All right, get ready...</i>

00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:29.643

Wait, Karui is watching.

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:40.020
I have to keep a cool expression

Getting worked up over something
like this?!

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.829
Guess Choji Akimichi wasn't a
threat to us, after all.

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:51.832
This isn't even spicy enough for
me!

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:52.666

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.509

(WOOZY)

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:19.459
How is this even considered
eating?!

00:14:19.493 --> 00:14:22.563
(STOMACH GROWLS) Watching them
eat made me so hungry!

<i>Gimme more!</i>

00:14:24.565 --> 00:14:25.465
Huh?

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:27.801
Well, then here! A piping
hot meat bun!

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:29.970
Chomp-chomp!

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:31.338
Now, slow down!

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.374
You're going to burn your mouth
if you eat so quickly!

00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:35.642
Sensei? Uh...

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:36.944
Yummy! Yummy!

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:38.579
Oh, hey there, Boruto!

00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:41.748
Fancy running into you twice in
one day, huh?!

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:45.185
Okay, for real, what is going on
with you, Shino Sensei?

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:48.622
I heard that my former students
were in the contest, so...

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:50.457
I'm supporting them as their
former teacher.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.661
No, I don't mean that! I mean,
what the heck is going on with-

00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:56.129
It appears that you're hungry.

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:59.666
I'm sorry, but I can't share
this meat bun with you.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.502
This is for Kuraa-ma- I mean...!

00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:04.805
...uh, I'm afraid that this is
all for me to eat.

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:05.973
But if you insist...

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:08.442
I suppose that I could give you
one, too...

00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:10.677
The reason is because I actually
bought two-!

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.482
(HAPPY)

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:18.819
Ugh. Oh, man... That was
horrible...

00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:20.387

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.455
Oh! Mom!

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:24.458
Hey, uh, so did the cool and
nonchalant way...

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:27.694
that I handled those Super-Hot
n' Spicy burgers make you swoon?

00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:29.463
You call that cool, huh?

00:15:29.496 --> 00:15:31.865
The next round is gonna be for
the win!

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:34.801
So get ready to watch
me triumph, okay?

00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:36.570
Oh, really? Triumph, you say?

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:40.674
An eating contest is basically a
gathering of reckless fools...

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:42.109
isn't it?

00:15:42.142 --> 00:15:44.945
Triumphing over a group like
this is a dubious win at best.

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:46.246
I- It's dubious?

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.416

a fool of yourself.

What do we do with the
leftovers?

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:08.635
Who'd ever wanna eat something
this spicy, anyway?!

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:12.472
You're right! Too bad it's such
a waste but we'll have to -

00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:14.007
(PRACTICALLY DROOLING)

00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:18.011

The Super-Hot 'n' Spicy Burger!

00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:27.788
I can't believe that I

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.857
I'm so lucky!

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.127
Thank you for the food!

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:36.597

all!

There's no way we can allow

I'lll stoop to anything to
prevent that!

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.533
So I switched their bowls to
shallower ones!

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:50.137

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:30.504
It's been thirty years, and I've
forgotten how...

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.942
Whoa! What's happening, here?!

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:36.844
(MISERABLE)

00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:38.979
Damn it! I've gotta do something
about this!

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.781
Leaf Hurricane!

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:42.683
Great Leaf Hurricane!

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:48.689
It keeps springing back! There
is no end to it!

00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:54.461
Oh, come on! A piece of food
is trying to eat ME?!

00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:58.298
Go back to being a grain of
rice! Take this!

00:19:58.332 --> 00:20:02.836
Seriously? Is this for real?!
Now I'm stuck?!

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.638
Cho-Cho, what are you doing?!

00:20:04.671 --> 00:20:05.839
(GASP) Mom!

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:10.344
(WORRIED)

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.378
Damn it.

00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:15.449
I'll use my jutsu to blast it.
Why don't you make a run for it?

00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:18.986
Forget it! I can't just leave
you here by yourself, Mom!

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:21.688
Hey! What are you doing to my
family?!

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.659
Dad!

00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:30.597
(DETERMINED EATING)

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:34.168
No, honey! If you eat that
much, your stomach'll burst!

00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:40.474
(EATING)

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:42.142
(SHOCKED)

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.778
I ate the snacks by myself,
Karui!

00:20:44.811 --> 00:20:45.979
Honey!

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:48.649
And I'm sorry!

00:20:55.189 --> 00:20:56.356
Sorry!

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.158
Whoa. Dad?

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:00.527
Good grief! Just how much can
you eat?

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:01.828
(LAUGHTER)

00:21:01.862 --> 00:21:03.163
(LAUGHTER) Well... Lots I
guess!

00:21:03.197 --> 00:21:06.667
How could it end up like this?

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.670
You've got some explaining to
do, Granny. Start talking.

00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:12.406
(NERVOUS)

00:21:13.173 --> 00:21:14.374
Winners Team Akimichi

00:21:14.408 --> 00:21:20.848
(CHEERING)

00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:22.282
Just as I expected!

00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:24.852
I can't believe that they ate
everything!

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:25.686
Hm?

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:29.156
Anyway, like they say...

00:21:29.189 --> 00:21:31.158
...all's well that ends well,
right?

00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:35.462
I'm sorry... I really am a
horrible person, aren't I?

00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:39.666
Can somebody like me have
any redeeming qualities?

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.269
Even if you don't see them...

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.938
it doesn't matter as long as I
can see them.

00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:46.740
(SHOCKED)

00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:49.943
So are you gonna tell me?
What's his redeeming quality?

00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:51.712
That's enough out of you,
Cho-Cho!

00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:53.647
(CHUCKLE)

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.650
All right!! Now that
I'm relieved, I'm hungry!

00:21:56.683 --> 00:22:00.153
Let's go eat our prize! Sweet
azuki bean soup with dumplings!

00:22:00.187 --> 00:22:02.656
Seriously, you're really gonna
eat more?!

00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:06.226
Yup, they sure do make a fine
couple! (CHUCKLE)
