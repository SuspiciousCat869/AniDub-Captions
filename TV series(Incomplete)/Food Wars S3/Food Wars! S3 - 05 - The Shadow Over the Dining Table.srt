1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,936
[URARA] And in first place is...

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,140
Soma Yukihira with              
his little stall!               

3
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,145
[RINDO] Seriously, Kuga,        
you actually LOST!              

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,916
This is unbelievable. (chuckle) 

5
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,686
[music playing]                 

6
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,647
[wails of despair]              

7
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,884
<i> Soma...</i>                        

8
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,887
<i> Dammit!</i>                        

9
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,759
<i> And I was so close!</i>            

10
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,694
[RINDO] Kuga! KUGA!             

11
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,496
Look at you! You got outsold!   

12
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,431
You loser!                      

13
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,566
Oh god! It had to be her!       

14
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,435
That's the No. 2 Seat!          
[SOMA] (huh?)                   

15
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,837
You are a hair shy of useless,  
aren't you?                     

16
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,040
Well, Kuga? Huh? Yeah?!         

17
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,241
Shut up already!                
I don't wanna hear this         

18
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,843
from someone who just           
walked around eating            

19
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,046
and didn't even participate     
in the Lunar Feast!             

20
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,048
What are you talking about?     

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,050
Walking around and eating is    
the best way of participating.  

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,586
And whatever.                   

23
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,521
Isn't staying holed up          
in your restaurant              

24
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,924
the very reason you got beaten  
by your JUNIOR over there?      

25
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,793
Shut up, shut up,               
shut up, shut up!               

26
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,062
Chef Kuga's getting a           
verbal smackdown.               

27
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,665
She seems almost like his       
older sister or something.      

28
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:16,201
[KUGA] Still, yeah,             
you're right, I lost.           

29
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,006
And I'm pretty sure it was all  
part of little Soma's devious   
master plan the whole time.     

30
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,407
Soon, we'll hold a Food War to- 

31
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,008
And why's that?                 

32
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,211
There's still one day left      
till the Feast ends, right?     

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,612
[RINDO] (hmm?)                  
[KUGA] What?                    

34
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,214
[SOMA] We're not done yet.      

35
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,283
You have to win by making       
the most money in FIVE days.    

36
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,220
This battle's just              
getting started, Kuga!          

37
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,731
[sizzle!]                       

38
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,570
[RINDO] Hard at work,           
aren't you, Soma Yukihira?      

39
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,172
Still, at this rate, I doubt    
you'll be able to sell enough   

40
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,241
to win against Kuga though.     

41
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,711
Well, at least you got close.   

42
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,913
Actually,                       
what I had in mind was...       

43
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,648
to basically duke it out        
till Day 3,                     

44
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,984
beat him silly on Day 4,        

45
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:10,389
and then win in overall sales   
on the last day, cementing his  
doom! (wicked cackle).          

46
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,925
Sounds pretty na ve,            
if you ask me.                  

47
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,794
[SOMA] I thought for sure I had 
a pretty good chance of winning,

48
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,331
and I had no intention of       
being beaten when it came       
to hospitality.                 

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,067
So this stings... for real.     

50
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,970
You have no problem speaking    
your mind, do ya?               

51
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,881
[girly squeals of excitement]   

52
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,523
[cheers and sobbing]            

53
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,698
[RINDO] (whooo!)                

54
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,300
This is even tastier            
than last year, Kuga.           

55
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,702
You remember that               
Fall Leaf-Viewing Festival?     

56
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,706
I gotta tell ya, I seriously    
almost burst out laughing!      

57
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:05,577
I never thought there'd be      
someone else who says the same  
sorts of kooky things as you.   

58
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,850
So, uh, I'd prefer to join      
the Ten, like, right now.       

59
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,919
Would one of you guys be        
interested in doing a           
Food War with me?               

60
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,523
Why would we bother to do that?!

61
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,661
[KUGA] Um....                   

62
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,064
I have no interest in           
forging any friendships         

63
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,399
or engaging in idle chitchat,   
so...                           

64
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,869
Would one of folks you mind     
doing a Food War with me?       

65
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,804
What are you talking about,     
you moron?                      

66
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,006
You can't just come in here     
and challenge the Ten-          

67
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,275
[TSUKASA] Sure.                 

68
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,610
Today even, if you like.        

69
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,545
If I will do, that is.          

70
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,714
Sound good?                     

71
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,025
[drum beats]                    

72
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,226
[KUGA]                          
I mean, come on, after all,     

73
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,564
we 2nd-years are SUPER busy     
trying to take down our         
seniors as well.                

74
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,033
As I remember,                  
at last year's school festival  

75
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:06,505
you got top sales in the Central
Area for five days straight,    
right, Tsukasa?                 

76
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:08,707
So, make me a promise           
if you would:                   

77
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,576
If I'm able to go out there and 
pull off the same thing you did 

78
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,112
in this year's Lunar Feast...   

79
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,714
You and I will do               
another Food War.               

80
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,052
But in the end, things didn't   
go as you had hoped.            

81
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,188
And Soma Yukihira didn't        
get top sales.                  

82
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:27,525
My goodness, that, my friend,   
is what they would call a war   
with no victor.                 

83
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,728
You both look so upset          
you could just DIE.             

84
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,732
Shut up. Anyway, I suspect Soma 
is only going to get better     
with time.                      

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,069
[laughing] So you've just       
accepted the inevitable?        

86
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:38,737
Like hell I have!               

87
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:42,274
I've taken an interest too,     
in our young Soma Yukihira.     

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,810
[MEGUMI] We've used up most     
of our ingredients.             

89
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,079
[SOMA] We had great sales       
on our last day as well.        

90
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,614
We were so close...             

91
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,349
[RINDO] Hey, Soma!              

92
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,885
The table's being set tonight,  
yeah?                           

93
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,953
Huh? The table?                 

94
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,623
[RINDO] In the Mountain Area.   
You're coming, aren't you?      

95
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,623
[SOMA] (ummm...)                

96
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,025
[RINDO] Huh? Where's Mimasaka?  

97
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:05,030
He had to break in somewhere    
with tighter security than      
usual, so he left earlier.      

98
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,900
Sounds like it's a lot of work  
getting to his level            
of mastery.                     

99
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,903
All right, you two,             
finish things up.               

100
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,037
Close your stall and            
we'll all go together.          

101
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,440
We'll dine at                   
Eishi Tsukasa's shop.           
[BOTH] (huh?)                   

102
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,444
[RINDO] I'm sure you're curious 
what kind of food the current   
No. 1 Seat makes.               

103
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,614
So then, let's hurry up and     
our butts to the Mountain Area! 

104
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,853
AWESOME! What is all this?!     

105
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,589
[MEGUMI] We're in the           
Mountain Area, all right!       

106
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,360
Compared to the other areas,    
it's like we're in a whole      
different world!                

107
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,665
Everyone is busy closing up     
their shops over in the         
Central Area,                   

108
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,134
but things are still up         
and running strong here, huh?   

109
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,336
It's the difference             
in clientele.                   

110
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,139
Most of them either live on     
premises or are staying at      
the Totsuki Resort.             

111
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:53,145
That's why a lot of the         
restaurants here do a prix fixe 
dinner around this time.        

112
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,613
That's going to be super        
expensive, right?!              

113
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,417
Oh, don't you worry,            
my sweet Megumi.                

114
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,086
I'll be picking up the tab      
at Tsukasa's place, all right?  

115
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,888
Oh, wait, that's right.         

116
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,023
Isn't this the area where       
Isshiki and other members       
of the Ten                      

117
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,027
usually have their shops        
set up for the festival?        

118
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,439
[EIZAN] And sales were good?    

119
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,507
Great. Go ahead and send        
my production fee               

120
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:26,111
to the usual account,           
if you wouldn't mind.           
[chuckle]                       

121
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,183
Whaaa? Chef Eizan managed       
TWENTY of the food stalls       
in the Lunar Feast?!            

122
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,252
Yep!                            
And he made a boatload of cash. 

123
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,920
That's like, way more than a    
student should be doing.        

124
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,390
So, what were YOU up to         
during all of this?             

125
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,592
[hmm] Oh, nothing much.         

126
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:49,468
[SOMA & MEGUMI] What?! You went 
to all 120 shops in five days?! 

127
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,136
Tsukasa's restaurant made the   
list complete.                  

128
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,805
It was a lot of work!           

129
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,207
But was all that "hard work"    
really worth it in the end?     

130
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:58,143
Sure enough, the Ten is made up 
of a bunch of monsters.         

131
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,012
What are you two                
doing back there?               

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,914
You're gonna get left behind!   

133
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,484
[WAITER] Welcome, Ms Kobayashi. 

134
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,753
Tonight's theme is              
"A Fall Symphony,"              

135
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:11,890
which consists of an exceptional
nine-course menu.               

136
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,159
Please,                         
make yourself comfortable.      

137
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,372
It's like he's on stage.        

138
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:29,775
Everything around Chef Tsukasa  
seems like a fantasy!           

139
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,244
So, there are only three tables 
being served?                   

140
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,245
[RINDO] Tsukasa does all of     
the cooking himself.            

141
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,315
Everyone else is just waitstaff.

142
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,717
He's gotta try and keep         
everything small,               

143
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:41,853
or else his particular          
restaurant concept would        
never work out.                 

144
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,390
You mean to say he does nine    
courses all by himself?         

145
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,658
He must be incredibly           
confident in himself,           

146
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,594
or none of this                 
would be possible!              

147
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,196
Actually, the real reason he    
does what he does is simple.    

148
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,333
[TSUKASA] The thought of leaving
the food up to someone else     
is terrifying!                  

149
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,134
When I imagine them             
making a mistake,               

150
00:08:56,203 --> 00:09:00,639
it's impossible for me to       
concentrate on my own cooking!  
[wail]                          

151
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,941
[soft music playing]            

152
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,412
[TSUKASA]                       
These are ready to serve.       

153
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,146
And PLEASE, I beg you,          

154
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,215
make sure that you preserve     
the plating exactly as it is!   

155
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,218
Whatever you do, carry it       
gently, ever so gently!         

156
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,120
Uh... understood.               

157
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,956
What the? These are...          

158
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,291
Sakura shrimp, right?           

159
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,961
But they're in season in SPRING.

160
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:26,298
Yeah, but they said this would  
use fall ingredients...         

161
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,267
[chuckle of anticipation]       

162
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,358
[MEGUMI] (huh?)                 

163
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,927
[aahhh...]                      

164
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,731
[orgasmic chuckle]              

165
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,877
[MEGUMI] (AAHHH!)               
[RINDO] (oh, yes!)              

166
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,014
That's Tsukasa for you,         
all right!                      

167
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,217
Sakura shrimp may be widely     
associated with spring,         

168
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,019
but in fact, they surprisingly  
grow larger in the fall,        

169
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,556
and develop even more depth     
of flavor than we're used to!.  

170
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,893
<i> And that's why he used them?</i>   
<i> Because he knew that!</i>          

171
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,595
<i> Unreal!</i>                        

172
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,968
<i> It's like the ingredients in</i>   
<i> all his dishes shine and "pop"</i> 

173
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,038
<i> even more than in</i>              
<i> their original state!</i>          

174
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,239
<i> And the way this menu</i>          
<i> is laid out,</i>                   

175
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,308
<i> any dish with lots of acidity</i>  

176
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:46,245
<i> is followed by something</i>       
<i> slightly sweet.</i>                

177
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,780
<i> The textures are balanced</i>      
<i> just right,</i>                    

178
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,449
<i> so that nothing</i>                
<i> loses its impact.</i>              

179
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,853
<i> He changes up temperatures and</i> 
<i> spices left and right,</i>         

180
00:10:54,922 --> 00:11:00,125
<i> always altering the rhythm</i>     
<i> without disrupting the</i>         
<i> overall flow of the meal!</i>      

181
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:04,196
<i> Making each dish complete</i>      
<i> in and of itself</i>               
<i> is just so difficult.</i>          

182
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,098
<i> The No. 1 Seat...</i>              

183
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,500
<i> is something else!</i>             

184
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,742
[TSUKASA] Soma Yukihira...      

185
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,446
And I take it, you must         
be Megumi Tadokoro.             

186
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,216
Is it, like, too cold in here?  
I can turn it up!               

187
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,752
If the air's blowing too hard,  
just let me know, okay?         

188
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,021
Are the chairs comfy enough     
enough for you guys?            

189
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,022
You don't find the lighting     
too bright, do you?!            

190
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:34,092
Look, going on and on and       
hovering is ruining our dinner. 

191
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,029
You're making everyone          
uncomfortable.                  
[TSUKASA] (waahhh!)             

192
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,231
Isn't that right,               
my sweet Megumi?                

193
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:43,234
Uh, um, well, maybe just a      
little bit weirded out.         
[TSUKASA] Oh, god!              

194
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,837
So then, what should I do       
when I come to the table?!      

195
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:49,441
Like I always tell you,         
just stand there and look       
really pleased with yourself.   

196
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,445
Your ability to determine the   
strength of each ingredient     
is second-to-none.              

197
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:56,181
You've got a great eye.         
But I want to taste something   

198
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,784
that has more of your passion   
involved on the plate,          

199
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,118
something that                  
screams your name.              

200
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,854
Oh, no.                         

201
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,923
My cooking must never be        
so self-conscious.              
[MEGUMI] Huh?                   

202
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,126
[TSUKASA] My job is to          
completely remove myself        
from the dish.                  

203
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,995
I devote myself solely to the   
quality of the ingredients,     

204
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,465
and to do my best               
in elevating them.              

205
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:18,203
And yet, conversely, that       
process ties exactly into how I 
always choose to express myself.

206
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,606
That is the essence of          
Eishi Tsukasa's cooking.        

207
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:24,409
Now then,                       
I hope you enjoy your meal.     

208
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,078
And before anyone of us knew it,

209
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,147
this is what the gourmands      
out there started to call him:  

210
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:35,020
He who stays true to the finest 
of ingredients, presenting them 
in all their pride and glory:   

211
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,257
"Der Weisse Ritter der Tafel."  

212
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:42,628
[laughter] Pretty cool, huh?    

213
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,765
The first time I saw tha        
in a magazine, I busted         
my gut laughing! [laughter]     

214
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,969
[SOMA] Hey, Megumi,             
did you happen to notice that?  

215
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,105
As timid as that guy seems,     

216
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:55,774
he never once asked us,         
"How does it taste?"            

217
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,810
That wasn't his concern.        

218
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:04,116
He has absolute pride and       
confidence in his ability to    
handle the ingredients.         

219
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,585
He's different from any chef    
I've ever met.                  

220
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:09,688
That's what makes the           
No. 1 Seat on the Ten.          

221
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,124
[HISAKO] Ms Erina,              

222
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,860
the Lunar Feast will be ending  
pretty soon, right?             

223
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,228
It will.                        

224
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,966
<i> He didn't come... yet again.</i>   

225
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,004
[YOUNG ERINA] Um, Mr Saiba?     
[JOICHIRO] Hmm?                 

226
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,741
I want to become an amazing cook
just like you when              
I grow up to be big.            

227
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,543
And then one day,               
when I do that,                 

228
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,812
would please come and eat       
what I've made for you?         

229
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,548
Yeah, well, tell you what:      

230
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,218
Once you've become a famous,    
talented chef,                  

231
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,019
I will take you up on that.     

232
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,021
And I will look forward         
to that day,                    

233
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,758
when I get to try               
your masterpiece.               

234
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,961
<i> It's all been for the</i>          
<i> day he arrives.</i>                

235
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:52,831

[BOTH] (hmmm?)                  

236
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,834
Everyone with reservations      
is already accounted for.       

237
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,635
I'll go take a look.            

238
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,805
<i> It couldn't be!</i>                

239
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,510
Um, excuse me, sir?             

240
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,045
We're by reservation only, so-  
[shocked gasp]                  

241
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,480

It's been quite a while, Erina. 

244
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,256
[ERINA] Father?                 

245
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,661
[contented sigh]                
That really was some truly      
amazing food tonight.           

246
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,596
I was blown away by all of it!  

247
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,733
I never thought a cooking world 
like that ever existed.         

248
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,401
Um, Soma?                       

249
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,204
Oh, yeah, the Mountain Area is  
a force to be reckoned with!    

250
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:33,605
He's totally on fire...         

251
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,874
[SOMA] I wanna walk around      
and see some more!              

252
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,143
[MEGUMI] But we don't have      
any Pine Tree tickets.          

253
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,413
Oh, hey, there's always         
Erina's place.                  
[MEGUMI] Uh, but...             

254
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,682
It'll be fine.                  
On the first day                
of the festival:                

255
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,418
I got some black pepper rice    
cakes. Go on, have one!         

256
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,420
I'm not eating                  
any of your trash!              

257
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,622
It's a good thing               
I got on her good side.         

258
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:53,225
I think you kind of forced that 
peppered rice cake on her.      

259
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,961
[HISAKO]                        
U-um, you can't do this!        

260
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:59,030
Erina,                          
what is all this nonsense?      

261
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,101
Your cooking is not meant for   
the likes of these people.      

262
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:03,769
[HISAKO] (frightened)           

263
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,372
You should choose only those    
involved in the business.       

264
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:09,575
Otherwise,                      
your skills will weaken.        

265
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:18,650
Excuse me! Do you have any idea 
who you have the honor of       
addressing right now, young man?

266
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,252
Who do you think you are?       

267
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,388
I've seen this man somewhere    
before, I believe. I think...   

268
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,258
He's a Nakiri!                  
[KITA] (wha?) Impossible!       

269
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,994
If I recall correctly,          
you were driven out of          
Totsuki years ago!              

270
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:33,332
You're correct.                 
I am indeed Azami Nakiri.       

271
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,467
And I'm Erina Nakiri's father.  

272
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:36,668
[frightened shudder]            

273
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,737
<i> [HISAKO] Ms Erina's father...</i>  

274
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,539
<i> Azami Nakiri!</i>                  

275
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:44,910
<i> I've only come across him</i>      
<i> once in the school archives.</i>   

276
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,749
[HISAKO'S DAD] Hisako,          
please listen to me.            

277
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,752
You must ask no one             
about Ms Erina's father.        

278
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,387
Understand?                     
[YOUNG HISAKO] (ah-huh)         

279
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,958
<i> [HISAKO] He was essentially</i>    
<i> erased from the Nakiri family.</i> 

280
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,627
<i> What business does he have</i>     
<i> with Ms Erina now?</i>             

281
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:06,231
Well, YOU talk big for someone  
who was expelled before.        

282
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,035
WE, on the other hand, have     
legitimate dealings when        
it comes to Totsuki.            

283
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,104
Very true, dear sister!         

284
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,772
So, when you insult             
us like that,                   

285
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:16,442
you've managed to also show     
contempt for Totsuki itself.    

286
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,844
I have come to Totsuki          
to fix it,                      

287
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,313
and guide it to its             
proper form once again.         

288
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,647
[BOTH] What was that again?!    

289
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,516
[AZAMI] How many people         
have you come across            

290
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:27,586
who claim to work in the        
culinary industry,              

291
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:31,056
and can actually understand     
what is truly delicious?        

292
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,459
Only those with a sense of      
dignity and sensibility,        

293
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,528
and who have received           
the proper education,           

294
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:40,132
grasp the true worth            
of great artistry.              

295
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,334
This encapsulates fine dining.  

296
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:46,405
Its value should be shared      
with only a select few          
of chosen worth.                

297
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:49,407
Only then is it worth           
being called "cuisine."         

298
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:53,211
Or else it's not true           
cooking at all; it is slop.     

299
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,281
I doubt any who would mistake   
a meal for fine cuisine         

300
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,616
just because it uses            
quality ingredients             

301
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,353
would be able to understand     
what I'm talking about.         

302
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,421
You've got some damn nerve      
saying that!                    

303
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,158
[ORIE] Thank you SO much for    
sharing your thoughts with us.  

304
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,494
But no matter what you say,     
it will change nothing.         

305
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:13,031
[NATSUME] Exactly! You no longer
have the right to make any      
changes here at Totsuki!        

306
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,367
But I have the bloodline,       
now don't I?                    

307
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,469
And don't forget                
the training as well.           

308
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,038
Now, Erina...                   

309
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,574
It's been 10 years              
since I began teaching you.     

310
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,710
You started very young.         

311
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,979
I'd like to see how far         
you've come, daughter.          

312
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,447
Um, but we can't!               

313
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,383
We don't allow customers        
in without a-                   

314
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:34,119
I think I see a table           
open right over there.          

315
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:35,754
No, that seat is for-           

316
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,457
I'd like a menu, please.        

317
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,259
Your father grows hungry.       

318
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,660
I would like to                 
eat something now.              

319
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,329
[ERINA] (shaky breath)          

320
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,198
[HISAKO]                        
You all right, Ms Erina?        

321
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,268
Um... I'm fine.                 

322
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:59,344
[SOMA] Hey, hey, Erina!         
You got an open table? (chuckle)

323
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,247
Um, Soma, you came?             

324
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,553
[laughing] Sorry for bargin'    
in without a reservation,       

325
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,154
but you think I could have      
some of your eats?              

326
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,924
I brought you a hujiao bing     
to make up for it!              

327
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,894
<i> What's going on?</i>               

328
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,230
<i> It feels like there's a lot</i>    
<i> of tension in the room.</i>        

329
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,766
[SOMA] Hey, old man,            
I didn't mean to intrude.       

330
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,101
I take it you were just about   
to order some grub.             

331
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,371
Maybe I could, uh,              
grab the seat and join ya?      

332
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,039
If you don't mind?              

333
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,844
Erina, why don't you go ahead   
and seat your friend instead.   

334
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,646
Soma Yukihira is here!          

335
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:37,649
I've suddenly lost my appetite. 

336
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,055
Hisako, who was that?           

337
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,857
That man was Ms Erina's father. 
[MEGUMI] (huh?)                 

338
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,260
What was with the               
Man in Black there?             

339
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,095
He should've stayed to eat.     

340
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,099
Um, Erina, why are you shaking? 

341
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:07,046
[AZAMI] I was just about to     
come and pay you a visit.       

342
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,750
I feel quite honored you chose  
to come to me instead.          

343
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,953
It's been a long time, Father.  

344
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,688
Begone, ingrate!                

345
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,690
You've no right to be           
on these premises!              

346
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,292
You were banished long ago!     

347
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,628
And I believe I told you:       

348
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,964
You are forbidden to use        
the Nakiri name!                

349
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,501
But it was I, her father,       
who helped Erina develope       
the "God Tongue"                

350
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,637
she was blessed                 
with at birth.                  

351
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,238
You may try to drive me away,   

352
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,174
but you cannot erase her        
bloodline nor her education.    

353
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,977
I cannot erase what has         
already been done.              

354
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:41,780
Entrusting Erina to you         
was my greatest mistake.        

355
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,583
We both have our mistakes       
we must bear.                   

356
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,653
If I had remained, I would      
never have let Totsuki          
become what it is now:          

357
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,724
an unsightly place filled with  
nothing but mediocrity.         

358
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:55,593
[exhausted sigh] Oh, Soma,      
so this is where you've been!   

359
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,595
What's the matter, Chef Rindo?  

360
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,732
I was having a little snack     
when I saw all these black      
cars go racing by,              

361
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,001
so I chased them here to        
see what was going on.          

362
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,871
We don't really know what's     
going on out here either.       

363
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,941
It looks like Erina's father    
suddenly showed up              
out of the blue.                

364
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,076
[RINDO] (oh!)                   

365
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,546
At this school, cooking is      
the only thing that will        
ever matter.                    

366
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:17,749
So long as one has the skill,   
they are free to advance.       

367
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,952
That is the heaert of           
the Totsuki's legacy.           

368
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,155
It's disgusting.                
Thinking that some lowbrow      
student would be able           

369
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:28,160
to cultivate the fine art of    
true cuisine is the height of   
fallacy, even for you.          

370
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,962
[SENZAEMON]                     
You're a fool; you know nothing!

371
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:35,167
It is the very talent and drive 
of these so called              
"lowbrow" young chefs           

372
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,968
that will decide the            
future of Totsuki!              

373
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,973
You can whine all you want,     
but it will not change anything!

374
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:46,177
[AZAMI]                         
Totsuki Council of Ten....      

375
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,514
They are bestowed with          
as much power, if not more,     
as the school director.         

376
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,316
Is that true, old man?          

377
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:55,721
For example, if a majority of   
the members enact a policy,     

378
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,790
then the school must adopt it,  
no matter what.                 

379
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:01,193
So, Soma Yukihira, which one    
would you like to choose?       

380
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,196
What? I don't have any idea     
what's going on right now.      

381
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:05,931
Oh, whoops.                     

382
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,934
I thought maybe you would've    
gotten on board instantly.      

383
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,536
Wha?                            

384
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,338
[shocked grunt]                 
What? No! This is...            

385
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:17,542
A majority of the               
Council of Ten have voted       
that a change is in order.      

386
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:20,078
They have endorsed ME as        
the new school director,        

387
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:22,715
meaning you need to             
step aside now.                 

388
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,953
A new wave in coming in         
to take over.                   

389
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,822
And the mere thought            
of riding it                    

390
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:31,457
makes my heart pound!           

391
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:43,435
The most powerful organization  
at Totsuki has managed to       
stage a secret coup?!           

392
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:47,339
[AZAMI] By this time tomorrow,  
everything will be settled.     

393
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:52,411
We will be the pride of Japan,  
a kingdom of cuisine.           

394
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:54,380
And I...                        

395
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,082
shall be its new king!
