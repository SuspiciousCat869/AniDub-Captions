00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,741
Did you say Joichiro Saiba?     

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,811
'Cause, uh, that's my father.

[AZAMI]<i> Chef Saiba...</i>           

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,163
<i> I'll finish this revolution,</i>   

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,233
<i> and change the world,</i>          
<i> without fail.</i>                  

9
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,236
<i> In order to save us</i>            
<i> from any further sacrifices,</i>   

10
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,937
<i> like yourself.</i>

00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,669
[on TV]                         
Do I really have to?            

13
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:20,072
I keep telling you I'm not      
the type who does well          
speaking in front of crowds.    

14
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,941
Oh, man-up and just start       
talking, Tsukasa.               

15
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:27,012
[sigh] If only Isshiki and      
Erina were here too...          

16
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,281
So, how many minutes until      
we have to go live?             

17
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,950
We're already live, Tsukasa.    
[TSUKASA] (waahhh!)             

18
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,819
(monotone)                      
Um, hello and welcome.          

19
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,021
I am Eishi Tsukasa from Central.

20
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,290
I'm here today to tell you      
about the big event             

21
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,026
that marks the end of the 2nd   
semester for the first years.   

22
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,829
In other words, we'll be        
discussing the Advancement Exam.

23
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,166
Last year, more than half of    
the students failed and         
left the academy.               

24
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,100
It was an incredibly            
challenging exam.               

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,969
But things are different now!   

26
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,438
Thanks to Director Azami,       
you've all been freed           

27
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,974
from the unnecessary            
traditions of failure.          

28
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,978
From now on, if you simply      
follow the methods that we've   
taught during your classes      

29
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,581
it should be possible for       
you to clear the exam.          

30
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,183
You no longer need to           
feel threatened or held back    

31
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,586
by the archaic ways             
of the old system.              

32
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,588
If you agree to abide by        
Central's exact methods,        

33
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,192
you can all become              
first-rate chefs.               

34
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,126
However...                      

35
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,998
this exam shall also make clear 
what will become of             
certain rebels,                 

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,134
those who choose not to follow  
Director Azami's new order.     

37
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,471
Well then, that's about all     
I have to say for right now.    

38
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,138
Wow, my nerves are a wreck.     

39
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,342
Next time Rindo or Nene         
should do it instead.           

40
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,277
[RYOKO] Not happening.          
[NENE] Go to Hell.              

41
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,746
Huh?                            
The Advancement Exam already?   

42
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,616
It feels early since we're      
only in the 2nd semester,       

43
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,819
but if we wanna be second years,
we'll just have to nail it.     

44
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,688
Oh god...                       

45
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,090
Hey what's up with you guys,    
why the long faces?             

46
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,425
Come on, were you even          
listening just now?!            

47
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,294
Central is aiming to            
get rid of us rebels            

48
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,763
by making sure that we fail     
in the upcoming exams.          

49
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,767
That announcement was just like 
giving us a death sentence.     

50
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:59,738
It's a warning that anyone who  
doesn't follow Azami Nakiri     
will be promptly eliminated.    

51
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,241
I'm so sorry, Mom,              

52
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,109
and everyone else               
back at the port.               

53
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,246
You worked so hard to send me   
to Tokyo, but unfortunately...  

54
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,980
I guess I'll send them          
the news in the mail.           

55
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,451
I'm having flashbacks of that   
hellish training camp...        

56
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,319
[GUYS]                          
Hellish training camp...        

57
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,056
[YUKI] ...the Stagiarie where   
we all worked so hard...        

58
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,858
[GUYS] Stagiarie...             
[SHUN] What's gotten into them? 

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,127
[RYOKO] They're falling into    
a depression spiral.            
[YUKI] The Lunar Festival where 
we all worked together...       

60
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,795
[HISAKO] Just take a            
deep breath, everyone.          
[GUYS] Lunar Festival...        

61
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,098
[MEGUMI] I suppose we all should
write letters back home.        

62
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,101
[owl hooting]                   

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,811
[TSUKASA] This exam shall       
also make clear what will       
become of certain rebels,       

64
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:42,281
those who choose not follow     
Director Azami's new order.     

65
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,549
[knock on door]

[SOMA] Who's there?             
Door's open!                    

67
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,560
[SOMA] Erina?                   

68
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,105
What's wrong?                   
You need somethin'?             

69
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,640
Um, I just...                   
I'm here to speak with you      

70
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,509
about your battle               
against Tsukasa.                

71
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,712
I want to make it absolutely    
clear you have no right         
to complain                     

72
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,914
that I didn't choose            
your dish over his!             

73
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:19,651
It's your fault for being       
reckless enough to              
accept his challenge!           

74
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,788
I won't deny there was a clear  
difference in skill between us. 

75
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,656
Huh?! What?! Oh...              

76
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,325
So as long as                   
you understand that!            

77
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,396
[SOMA] Is that all you wanted?  
[ERINA] Uh, um, no!             

78
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,732
What I really wanted to         
talk with you about is, uh...   

79
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,267
All right then, whatever.       

80
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,735
Have yourself a seat.           

81
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,740
[ERINA] Truth be told, until I  
reached a certain point...      

82
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:45,544
It's just...                    
Well, I'm quite certain that,   

83
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,248
that I never held a passion     
for cooking up until one        
particular day.                 

84
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,617
As someone who possessed        
the God Tongue,                 

85
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,688
I spent nearly every day        
tasting numerous dishes.        

86
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,024
But I never really enjoyed it.  

87
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,594
I simply spent those days       
disappointed by every bite.     

88
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,833
That was when I met Chef Saiba. 

89
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,037
[ERINA] It wasn't very long     
after Alice had left me for     
Northern Europe.                

90
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:15,707
On that day,                    
my taste testing session        

91
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,175
had been suddenly cancelled.    

92
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,178
There were no guests            
in the mansion,                 

93
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,547
so I remember that              
it was very quiet.              

94
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,049
[smells enticing aroma]

<i> Grandfather?</i>                   

97
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,057
<i> Who's that man with him?</i>       

98
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:35,294
<i> It smells so delicious.</i>        

99
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,133
Erina?!                         

100
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,935
What's going on,                
Master Senzaemon?               

101
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,003
You know this isn't             
what we agreed to.              

102
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,474
I only came 'cuz you told me    
that you'd cleared              
everybody outta here.           

103
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,276
I'm sorry,                      
my tasting job for today        

104
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,612
was cancelled due to problems   
on the other end.               

105
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,013
I see.                          

106
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,548
Well, this man behind me        

107
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,550
is an old dear friend of mine,  
Erina.                          

108
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,486
This is supposed to be a private
meal between him and me.        

109
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,621
I'm sorry.                      

110
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,756
I apologize.                    

111
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,858
I'll leave you alone,           
Grandfather.                    

112
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,763
Your name was Erina, right?     

113
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,099
I see, you must be Azami's kid. 

114
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,635
If you would like,              
stick around and have a bite.   

115
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:20,372
The dining table feels          
a little empty when it's        
only set for two.               

116
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,209

00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,745
may I please have your name?    

126
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,481
It's Saiba.                     

127
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,285
[ERINA] That was the first day  

128
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,422
that I thought cooking          
could be wonderful.             

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,757
But...                          

130
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,026
[AZAMI] An ill-prepared dish    
is unforgivable.                

131
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,695
Anything that does not          
meet my approval is...          

132
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,962
Filth!                          

133
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,031
Garbage!                        

134
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,165
Trash!                          

135
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,034
About 6 months after that,      

136
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,103
I began learning from my father.

137
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,771
I still remember how moved I was

138
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,041
after I ate Chef Saiba's        
food that day.                  

139
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,978
However, I understand the       
benefits that my father seeks,  

140
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,046
the ideal that he speaks of.    

141
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:39,050
Our society is full of          
uninspired and tasteless dishes 
that pass for "food".           

142
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,054
I've experienced the reality    
of that for as long as          
I can remember.                 

143
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,989
It's how I was raised.          

144
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,126
But I feel I've lost something, 

145
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,661
like the sense of what "cooking"
as an art really means.         

146
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,131
I'm no longer able to recognize 
the fundamentals, not anymore.  

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,533
It's left me confused.          

148
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:55,734
Uh-huh...                       

149
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,335
Uh, I'm sorry!                  

150
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,538
I came here without thinking it 
all the way through.            

151
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,340
I realize that dumping this     
on you is inappropriate.        

152
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,742
Please excuse me.               

153
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,577
Just hold on a second.          

154
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,715
I think having another taste    
will set you straight.          

155
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,418
So, I'll cook something up...   

156
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,220
Yukihira style!                 

157
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,389
Right here and now!             

158
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,193
Hang tight, Mistress Nakiri.    

159
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,361
[HISAKO] Ms Erina!              

160
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,497
Has anybody seen Ms Erina?!     

161
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,299
Ms Erina?! Ms Erina!            

162
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,100
[HISAKO] Ms Erinaaaa!!          
[YUKI]                          
What's wrong, Miss Secretary?   

163
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,302
Don't call me that!             

164
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,837
I can't seem to find            
Ms Erina anywhere!              

165
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,705
Maybe she's just in the         
bathroom or something?          

166
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,107
I looked but she wasn't there!  

167
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,908
She might have been taken away  
by Azami again!                 

168
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,644
I lost track of her             
only for a second,              

169
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,646
and yet she still fell          
into his clutches!              
I'm a failure!                  

170
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,715
[HISAKO] I should have hired    
a body double                   
[MEGUMI (hears something)       

171
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,717
[MEGUMI] It sounds like she's   
hanging out in Soma's room.     
[HISAKO] or even made a fake    
stand-in with my 3D printer!    

172
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,652
[ALL] (huh?!)                   

173
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,923
[ERINA] You're going to make    
a Yukihira dish for me to       
taste right now?                

174
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,725
What do you expect to           
accomplish with that?!          

175
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,060
Chef Saiba's dish was a         
masterpiece of perfection       

176
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,729
that your measly skills could   
never ever, ever dream          
of replicating!                 

177
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:01,266
Oh, so you're finally dropping  
the meek, little girl persona   
you had going.                  

178
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:05,136
Anyway, my dad always made sure 
to teach me about his style     
of cooking.                     

179
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,138
If I give you a taste of        
one of his recipes,             

180
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,775
it might help jog your          
memory or something.            

181
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,613
Well, then, what dish are       
you planning to make?           

182
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,281
Tempura bowl.                   

183
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,549
Tempura?                        

184
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,017
[SOMA] Just sit back.           

185
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,485
I'll give you a taste of        
something that will             

186
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:23,489
knock you off your feet.        
[mischievous chuckle]           

187
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,824
Ah! I just know he's makin'     
that face he makes              

188
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,026
before he makes something       
gross!                          
[SOMA] (evil little laugh)      

189
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,096
[RYOKO] Just what kind of       
tempura do you think he's       
going to make for her?!         

190
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,897
[ZENJI] But Erina has           
the God Tongue!                 

191
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,635
With such refined taste buds, if
she eats Soma's weird cooking...

192
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,771
[AOKI]                          
Yeah, she's totally hozed.      
[HISAKO] [scream of horror!]    

193
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,708
It's gonna be okay!             
It's not what it sounds like.   

194
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,977
Soma is cooking because he      
wants to convey something       
important to Erina!             

195
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,512
[BOTH] Megumi...                

196
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,048
[RYOKO] She suffers from his    
weird cooking the most.         

197
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,050
[YUKI] Even if she's the one    
saying otherwise...             

198
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,586
[BOTH] ...it doesn't            
sound very convincing.          

199
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,923
[HISAKO]<i> Yukihira...</i>            
[MEGUMI]<i> Soma...</i>                

200
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,126
[SOMA]                          
The bonito flakes are boiling.  

201
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,728
The batter is ready, too.       

202
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:05,463
Lucky for you, I left some rice 
already soaking in water.       

203
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:09,735
Just wait, I'll serve you up a  
super delicious bowl of tempura!

204
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,070
<i> Soma Yukihira...</i>               

205
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,939
<i> You had the same expression</i>    
<i> on that day, too.</i>              

206
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,210
<i> The day that Eishi Tsukasa,</i>    
<i> First Seat of the Council,</i>     
<i> challenged you.</i>                

207
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,481
<i> Even though you were trying to</i> 
<i> climb an insurmountable wall,</i>  

208
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,818
<i> your expression only showed</i>    
<i> how much fun you were</i>          
<i> having cooking.</i>                

209
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:32,290
<i> I was capable of the same</i>      
<i> expression when I was young,</i>   
<i> but now... now...</i>              

210
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,228
[MAN] Ms Erina, you have a      
responsibility to uphold        
the Nakiri family.              

211
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,297
[WOMAN] You must act in         
consideration of the family     
as a whole,                     

212
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,899
rather than just yourself.      

213
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,100
[MAN 2] She has the God Tongue. 

214
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,435
We should start                 
buttering her up.               

215
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:45,738
[MAN 3]                         
(Ohhh) You know that's right.   

216
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,173
[ALICE] Guess what, Erina!      

217
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,908
Someday, I'm going to be        
the best chef                   

218
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,177
that ever went to               
Totsuki Academy!                

219
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,513
If I put my heart into          
perfecting dishes,              

220
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,782
I just know cooking             
will be super fun!              

221
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,117
But I won't go easy on you just 
because you're my cousin!       

222
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,719
I'm gonna do my best!           

223
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,856
Um, okay. Sounds good.          

224
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,792
[ERINA] I'm sorry, Alice.       

225
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,529
But I just don't think any      
aspect of the cooking process   

226
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:12,297
is fun at all.                  

227
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,269
[SOMA] You've got doom and gloom
all over your face again.       

228
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,071
You're usually such a priss,    

229
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,674
but occasionally I do catch you 
looking vulnerable.             

230
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,208
Um, what's that mean?           

231
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,077
[SOMA] I need you to stay sharp.

232
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,678
I mean, after all...            

233
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,548
I'm about to get my revenge     
for that first day we met.      

234
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,251
So, I'm chomping at             
the bit over here.              

235
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:38,323
Disgusting!                     

236
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,493
[SOMA] Just you wait,           
Erina Nakiri!                   

237
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,695
I'm gonna make that             
mouth of yours                  

238
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,864
say my food is delicious!       

239
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,434
[SOMA] And today is the day     

240
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,235
I hear it straight              
from your mouth:                

241
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,638
That you think                  
my food is delicious!           

242
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,707
Order up, Erina!                

243
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,247
Your confidence knows no bounds.

244
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,250
Exactly what kind of dish do you
expect will win me over?        

245
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,386
[heh] That's easy.              

246
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:12,191
The one and only Yukihira-style,
Chicken Egg Tempura Bowl!       

247
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,259
"Chicken egg tempura" bowl?     

248
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,794
I've never heard of that.       

249
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,197
[crunch]                        
[ERINA]<i> This egg!</i>               

250
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,998
<i> The whites are firm enough</i>     
<i> to hold its shape,</i>             

251
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,468
<i> but the yolk is still</i>          
<i> incredibly runny!</i>              

252
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,803
It's perfectly soft boiled!     

253
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,873
[huh?] Does that mean           
he used a raw egg?              

254
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,475
How the heck did he fry that?!  

255
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,276
I don't think it would be       
possible for him                

256
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,612
to just take a raw egg          
and put it in oil.              

257
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,748
And you couldn't cover          
a raw egg in batter.            

258
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,083
That means he put it in         
with the shell intact!          

259
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,019
Dude, wouldn't that mean        
you'd eat the shell, too?       

260
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:43,888
<i> Wait, did he just put a</i>        
<i> soft-boiled egg in the</i>         
<i> batter and fry it?</i>             

261
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,759
<i> No, if he did that it would</i>    
<i> get thoroughly cooked by</i>       
<i> the heat of the oil.</i>           

262
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,828
<i> How is this dish</i>               
<i> even possible?!</i>                

263
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,563
It's kinda mysterious.          

264
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,232
Bet it's got you real curious.  

265
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,500
Your cocky attitude is          
annoying as ever!               

266
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,705
If you want the secret,         
it's right here.                

267
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,573
[ERINA] You put the eggs        
in the freezer?!                

268
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:04,109
This tempura was made           
from frozen eggs                

269
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,444
that were covered in batter     
and then fried.                 

270
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,047
It's what makes                 
this dish special.              

271
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,250
You remove the shell            
from the frozen egg,            

272
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,051
cover it in tempura batter,     

273
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,786
and quickly put it in the fryer.

274
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,723
Cover the freshly cooked rice   
with a healthy dose of sauce,   

275
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:21,527
and let the egg sit on top, next
to some deep-fried shiso leaves.

276
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:25,263
Then, finish it off with        
a drizzle of sauce.             

277
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,665
[ERINA] I see.                  

278
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,400
But such creative cooking       
is not nearly enough            

279
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,402
to try and win me over, is it?  

280
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,805
Dishes with egg as the main draw
are always simple,              

281
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,208
which precisely means,          
the chef's skill and            
quality of the ingredients      

282
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,877
have a direct impact            
on the end result.              

283
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,679
You offered this dish           
to my God Tongue,               

284
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,015
so it's too late                
for any regrets.                

285
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,817
Oh, dude, Erina-poo's           
actually going to eat it!       

286
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,954
Yeah, but whether it'll pass her
judgment is the question.       

287
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,956
[RYOKO] Wait...                 
[MEGUMI] What's the matter?     

288
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,425
I remember seeing something     
the other day.                  

289
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,761
I caught a glimpse of Soma      
doing some shopping.            

290
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,364
He bought up a whole bunch of   
cheap eggs at 106 a pack!       
[SOMA] (cackling)               

291
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,299
He bought eggs that             
were on sale?!                  

292
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,769
This is bad! Ms Erina was       
raised in a household           

293
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:07,773
that made it a point to partake 
in only the best and most       
carefully selected ingredients! 

294
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:10,508
There's no telling what a bunch 
of cheap ingredients will do.   

295
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,844
It could prove dangerous when   
in contact with her body.       

296
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,713
[ALL] (gasps of surprise)       

297
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,850
[dramtic music building]        

298
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,387
Erina-poo! No, don't eat it!    

299
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,123
[musical crescendo!]            

300
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,329
[ERINA] The eggs that you       
used in this dish...            

301
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,599
I could tell from one bite      
they were not from a            
high-class silkie,              

302
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,935
or even one of                  
the famous brands.              

303
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:40,406
They're completely generic      
and low level.                  

304
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,142
Far from what is                
high-class cuisine.             

305
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:44,943
And yet...                      

306
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:46,144
Peep!                           

307
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,145
Peep! Peep!                     

308
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,814
[lots of peeps]                 

309
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,550
[moans of delight]              

310
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:54,753
[ERINA]<i> How?</i>                    
[peeping continues]             

311
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,955
<i> How can it be so deep?</i>         

312
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,759
<i> Such a rich and</i>                
<i> complex flavor...</i>              

313
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:05,097
[ecstatic moan]<i> ...is coming to</i> 
<i> life right before me!</i>          

314
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,100
[chuckle] When you put eggs     
in the freezer,                 

315
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,034
they undergo multiple changes,  

316
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:13,372
and that comes with one         
major benefit, which is:        

317
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:17,375
the flavor of the yolk will then
start to become stronger        
and more concentrated.          

318
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,379
The flavor of the yolk          
will become stronger?!          

319
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,114
And by freezing chicken eggs,   

320
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,117
the protein inside becomes hard 
and thick like a jelly.         

321
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,920
Thanks to that, it has          
an overall creamier and         
more doughy texture.            

322
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:33,058
And in particular, the taste    
of the yolk becomes deeper      
and more impactful.             

323
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:37,396
The whole point of the dish     
is using frozen eggs to capture 
that delicious flavor.          

324
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:42,534
I covered the dish with the     
Yukihira special-blend of super 
umami sweet and sour sauce.     

325
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:47,072
It stays nice and rich with     
bonito dashi blended with       
soy sauce and mirin.            

326
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,142
And of course, it goes perfectly
with the rice, too!             

327
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,545
Now if I had used high-end eggs 
that are already rich in flavor,

328
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,947
it would ruin the balance       
of the whole dish.              

329
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,150
[gasp]                          
Wait, is that why you...        

330
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,553
Eggsactly, the unique texture   
and taste of frozen eggs,       

331
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,755
Plus the flavor of              
the special sauce.              

332
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,224
In order to bring them together,

333
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,160
the best choice is using        
a totally ordinary egg.         

334
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,427
I get it!                       

335
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,829
That means he chose             
those discount eggs             

336
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,297
for this specific purpose!      

337
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,766
Soma is just the best!          

338
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,634
If I think back to it now,      

339
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:19,672
the theme ingredient you chose  
on that day was also eggs,      
right?                          

340
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,241
To bring an end to              
our long-time rivalry,          

341
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,145
there's nothin' more suitable   
than this, don't you think?     

342
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,249
[ERINA] How?                    
[SOMA] (hmm?)                   

343
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:32,584
[ERINA] How do you come up      
with dishes like this?!         

344
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,921
When it comes to eggs,          
the fresher the better          
is common sense!                

345
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,190
And isn't it natural for        
chefs to strive for             

346
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,060
the rarest and highest-quality  
ingredients possible?           

347
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:43,261
But despite all of that,        
how can you just-               

348
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,864
[SOMA] Don't you think          
this way is more fun?           

349
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,666
This is my personal and         
humble opinion, but...          

350
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,202
People who believe there's      
only one way to do things       

351
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:55,140
will never be able to           
reach greater heights in        
whatever they're doing.         

352
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,176
And on top of all that...       

353
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,946
[YOUNG ERINA] Um, tell me,      
how did you come up with        

354
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,681
the ideas for your              
wonderful dishes?               

355
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,949
All of them were so eccentric   
and new to me,                  

356
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,086
but felt so refined             
at the same time.               

357
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:10,622
Did you know from the start     
that they would turn out        
so perfectly delicious?         

358
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,824
[JOICHIRO] I had no clue.       
[ERINA] What?                   

359
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,094
Whenever I try a                
new idea for a dish,            

360
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:17,829
I'm only half certain           
and gamble the rest.            

361
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:19,431
And as a matter of fact,        

362
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,300
I was using your gramps to      
test a number of new ideas.     

363
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,169
But why would you risk so much? 

364
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:25,838
Well, that is simple.           

365
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,906
[BOTH] If I already knew        
the dish's outcome,             

366
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,507
where would the fun be in that? 

367
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,577
<i> Oh, that's right.</i>              

368
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,679
<i> I just remembered.</i>             

369
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,782
[scarfing]                      

370
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:39,251
<i> This...</i>                        
[happy eating]                  

371
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:49,194
<i> This is the kind of cooking</i>    
<i> that I wanted to do!</i>           

372
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,730
<i> I finally remembered....</i>       

373
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,735
[sigh of relief]                

374
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,271
[AZAMI] Listen up, Erina.       

375
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,073
Only the food of                
which I approve,                

376
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:04,009
of which Central creates,       
is true cuisine!                
[ERINA]<i> No...</i>                   

377
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,944
[AZAMI] I will eliminate        
all slop from this school       

378
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,346
and raise every student         
to be a faithful soldier        

379
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,282
dispensing culinary greatness.  

380
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,886
That's the only way to          
make Totsuki stronger.          
[ERINA]<i> No!</i>                     

381
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,754
[AZAMI] The "true cuisine"      
of which I herald               

382
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,023
is the absolute justice         
of this world.                  

383
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:19,491
Not true!                       

384
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,361
<i> Father, both chefs</i>             
<i> and the food they create,</i>      

385
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:25,064
<i> surely must desire</i>             
<i> their freedom!</i>                 

386
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:34,706
So, what'd ya think?            

387
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:37,041
Of the Yukihira-style           
special dish?                   

388
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:41,646
Come on! I'd like to hear each  
and every one of your thoughts  
on my awesome dish, Erina.      

389
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:45,217
Delicious, right?               
Absolutely divine? Right?!      

390
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,557
I've made up my mind.           
[SOMA] Huh?                     

391
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,192
Okay, Soma, I need you to do    

392
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,995
exactly what I'm                
about to tell you.              
[SOMA] Huh?                     

393
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:02,001
At 7 AM tomorrow, I'd like you  
to go and gather everyone in the
dorm outside by the entrance.   

394
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:04,469
Uh, um, yeah,                   
sure I can do that.             

395
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,937
But what about my dish?         

396
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:07,406
Great, I'm counting on you.     

397
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,208
I have preparations that        
I must go make.                 

398
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,143
Wait! What about my dish?!      

399
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,611
Oh, and one more thing.         

400
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,546
I need you to go                
and tell Megumi...              

401
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,215
Tell her to shred up the letter 
she wrote to her family.        

402
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:20,019
She's not going to be needing   
to say that anymore.            

403
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,287
Huh?                            

404
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,689
[ALL] (confused)                

405
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:25,858
What exactly happened           
in the end there?               

406
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,296
[AOKI] It's freezing out here!  
[others shivering]              

407
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,499
[SHUN] Well, it's already winter
according to the calendar.      

408
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:38,037
Man, I guess this will be       
one of the last times we        
enjoy the view out here.        

409
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,438
We're done once                 
the Advancement Exam hits, bro. 

410
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:43,976
I wonder what Erina is planning 
for all of us to do while       
we're out here?                 

411
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,912
Well, she didn't explain        
anything to me, that's for sure.

412
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,347
Ms Erina...                     

413
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,683
Oh, Erina-poo?                  

414
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,452
[ERINA] Ahem...                 
[over bullhorn]                 

415
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,921
Greetings,                      
residents of Kyokusei Dorm.     

416
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:57,322
[AOKI] What's going on?         

417
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,191
Well!                           
From what I can see from here,  

418
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,594
you've all still got pitiful    
looks on your faces.            
[YUKI] Huh?                     

419
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,863
[ERINA] At this point,          
the end result is obvious,      

420
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,932
even without the                
Advancement Exam.               

421
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,868
Perhaps it would be easier      
if you all just left the        
academy right now.              

422
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,338
What? Did you get us all        
out here just to talk           
a bunch of smack?!              

423
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,006
We all wanna stay!              

424
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,943
And we want to continue cooking 
our own style of food!          

425
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:22,347
But we're not allowed, and you  
don't have to scold us about it!

426
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,016
Only a brief time has passed    
since I came to stay with you.  

427
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:28,420
And while I have been           
staying here at the dorm,       
I have had many...              

428
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,757
let's just say, opportunities   
to sample all of your dishes.   

429
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:34,960
The flavors were often erratic, 
and sometimes a complete mess.  

430
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:38,497
I've lost count of the number   
of times I've delivered         
my criticism.                   

431
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,566
However, I can say              
with certainty,                 

432
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,069
every dish tasted of freedom.   

433
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,373
Now look! You'll never live up  
to your true potential          

434
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,109
if you continue staying         
down in the dumps               

435
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,977
and just allow yourself         
to flunk out now!               

436
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,513
It's pathetic! Are you going    
to roll over like this?!        

437
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,648
But even if we tried            
to do it our way,               

438
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:58,717
how are we supposed to get      
through the exam?!              

439
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,919
[ERINA] It's not a question     
of getting through it!          

440
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,923
You must simply forge your      
own path with your cooking!     
[ZENJI] Woah!                   

441
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:07,192
She's starting to sound         
a lot like Soma.                

442
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,661
Ms Erina...                     

443
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,097
[ERINA] I started to            
think more seriously...         

444
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:14,867
About what I really want...     

445
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:17,369
What I want to accomplish       
as a person.                    

446
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,538
[ERINA] If all of you have      
the will to fight on            

447
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,808
and wish to continue            
staying here...                 

448
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,676
I shall use my God Tongue,      

449
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,945
and support you in              
realizing your potential!       

450
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,948
Those of you without the will to
fight should leave right now.   

451
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:34,152
I will only face this exam with 
those of you who have the       
strength needed to forge on.    

452
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:37,823
Now! If you believe you are     
truly honorable chefs,          
[music begins]                  

453
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:41,427
then step up to the plate       
and follow my lead!
