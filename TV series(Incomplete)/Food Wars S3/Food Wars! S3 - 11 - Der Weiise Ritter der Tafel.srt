00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,340
[ALICE] Nice work, Ryo!         

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,943
You followed my orders,         
therefore you were able to win. 

3
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,412
Yeah, that I did.               

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,346
Well, that's one victory        
under our belt.                 

5
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,484
Let Central have a taste of     
what defeat is like!            

6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,421
[AZAMI]                         
That was quite the spectacle.   

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,756
[STUDENT 1]                     
Whoa, isn't that, Azami Nakiri? 

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,325
[STUDENT 2] Seriously?!         

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,998
[ALICE]                         
Uncle Azami, long time, no see. 

10
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,709
Ms. Alice, what have you been   
spending so much time writing?  

11
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:47,446
[ALICE] Letters! I'm sending    
them airmail to Japan.          

12
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,716
Erina was really insistent      
that I send them to her.        

13
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,651
She's so helpless that          
I'm sending her a whole         
bunch of them.                  

14
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,356
Although I find it              
really quite a pain. [giggle]   

15
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,892
Oh, that so?                    

16
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,061
[RYO] You look excited to me.   

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,263
Goodbye, Erina.                 

18
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,865
Um, Alice...                    

19
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,568
Please be sure to always        
write me, okay?                 

20
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,137
[giggle]                        

21
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,808
[ALICE] Huh? I still            
haven't gotten anything?        

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,677
Nothing from Erina? Aww...      

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,545
Well, thanks, Mom.              

24
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,748
I'll just write her             
some more then!                 

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,419
Jeez, Erina was the one who     
insisted I send them to her     
in the first place.             

26
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,185
[AZAMI] Hello, Alice.           

27
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,821
I appreciate you                
looking out for Erina.          

28
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,526
Oh, is that so?                 

29
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,094
[music playing]                 

30
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,586
[ERINA] The Chief of the        
Cutting Edge Club?              

31
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,921
So when did Alice               
gain that position?             

32
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,192
Look, it's listed right         
here in the official            
records of past Food Wars.      

33
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,529
It's why she was a target of    
the straggler-hunters.          

34
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,798
Alice... I hope she's okay.     

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,134
Oh, you're worried about her,   
huh?                            

36
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,603
I...                            
I'm not concerned about her!    

37
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,672
It's just that she has a habit  
of being kinda reckless.        

38
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,943
Well, she is the one who went   
to the trouble of breaking you  
out of the mansion.             

39
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:36,481
Heh, I get the impression       
that Alice is as equally        
worried about you.              

40
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,417
You two have a                  
beautiful friendship.           

41
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,885
Ah, what youth!                 

42
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,487
I do wonder about that though.  

43
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,021
Huh?                            

44
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,157
I find it hard to believe       
that she would even care,       

45
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,092
not when it comes to me anyway. 

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,729
After all, I've done many       
terrible things to her          
over the years.                 

47
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,901
[AZAMI] Alice, your Cutting Edge
Club is the only one who won    

48
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,469
in today's straggler hunt.      

49
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:01,040
The other 32 groups have        
all lost their rounds.          

50
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,242
They will be                    
officially disbanded.           

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,176
Regardless of the other groups, 

52
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,312
Ryo was declared                
the victor against Central.     

53
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,916
Can you still stand there and   
tell us that your plan's        
the right thing to do?          

54
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,584
That it is the only way?        

55
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,186
I'm disappointed, Alice.        

56
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,720
I thought better of you.        

57
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,656
I thought you of all people     
would support my plan           

58
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,725
in creating one "true cuisine". 

59
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,794
Those of the Nakiri family      
have a duty                     

60
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,329
to lead the world of gourmet    
food to new horizons.           

61
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,798
And my sweeping reforms         
shall accomplish that.          

62
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,868
It's my father!                 
Alice...                        

63
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,604
I can't simply accept your      
methods in good conscience.     

64
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,939
Nor should I.                   

65
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,207
And that's final.               

66
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,742
Oh, my dear...                  
You're quite the naughty girl.  

67
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,012
Considering you kidnapped       
my beloved daughter             
right out from under me,        

68
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:43,882
I don't think you have any      
grounds to try and talk.        

69
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,218
That's neither here             
nor there, Uncle.               

70
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,153
Right now, I'm just upset.      

71
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,889
I will never forget             
your transgressions.            

72
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,226
Uncle Azami, these last few     
years have taught me something. 

73
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,794
I hate you!                     

74
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:03,234
I'll no longer allow someone    
like you, to ever...            

75
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,271
influence Totsuki, nor Erina!   
[ERINA] (samll gasp)            

76
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,306
[AZAMI] Is that so?             

77
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,908
Well, you are welcome to try.   

78
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:11,509
But as for today,               

79
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,513
I'll congratulate you           
on your one and only victory.   

80
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,787
[gasp] Erina...                 

81
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,789
Did you hear all that?          

82
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,127
[AZAMI] (irritated breath)      

83
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,532
[ALICE] If Uncle Azami hadn't   
gotten in the way, just think.  

84
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,869
For all of those lost years,    
the two of us could have been   
so much closer with each other. 

85
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,738
Now, if you'll excuse me.       

86
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,075
Um...                           
[ALICE] But first...            

87
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,343
You need to fix that            
gloomy look on your face!       

88
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:47,946
And you should focus on being   
more dignified, Erina!          

89
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,816
You've been spending all        
your time moping in the         
Kyokusei Dorm!                  

90
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,684
[ERINA] What is with this       
attitude of yours?!             

91
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,153
You're the one who took me      
from my home, Alice!            

92
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,957
[ALICE] Because, I couldn't     
stand watching you whimper      
in fear of Uncle Azami!         

93
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,294
[ERINA] (gasp)                  
[ALICE] You have to show that   
evil man what you're made of!   

94
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,096
Let that jerk know who you are, 

95
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,899
and that you're not going to    
let him push you around!        

96
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,569
You can't go hide in your shell 
all the time! You hear me?      

97
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,037
Alice...                        

98
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,039
[ALICE] Listen,                 
I need you in top form,         

99
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,442
because someday I plan to       
crush you in utter defeat!      

100
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,511
And if I plan to use you        
as a big stepping stone,        

101
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,980
it won't look good if you're    
moping around like a hot mess!  

102
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:26,185
[Grrr...] As if you even could! 
[ALICE] What did you say?       

103
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,520
[ERINA] Your cooking is         
nothing but rancid rubbish!     

104
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,322
[ALICE]                         
Did you just insult my food?!   

105
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,924
[ERINA]                         
I did, because it's terrible!   
[argument continues]            

106
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,792
I gather they must be           
really good friends then.       

107
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
Yeah, but don't ever say that,  

108
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,063
or else there'll be big trouble.

109
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,067
[AZAMI] The groups that         
have lost shall be              
immediately disbanded,          

110
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,137
and no further                  
activities allowed.             

111
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,139
If any rebellious plots         
are uncovered,                  

112
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,875
those involved shall be         
purged from the school.         

113
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,945
Have a nice day.                

114
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,552
[SOMA] The content of our       
classes have totally changed,   

115
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,088
at least, ever since Central    
was established.                

116
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:06,625
Yeah... The classes where we    
made original dishes are gone,  

117
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:09,894
and now all we do is follow     
all of Central's recipes        
to the letter.                  

118
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,831
Seems they've no intention of   
letting us cook how we want.    

119
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:17,569
SOMA Even working in            
Chef Kojiro's kitchen came      
with more freedom than this.    

120
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,770
[KOJIRO] (shudder)              
[pot clatters]                  

121
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,772
What's the matter? You okay?    

122
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,109
For some reason I just got      
REALLY annoyed.                 

123
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,045
[sliding door opens]            

124
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,914
[MAN] The teacher who was       
in charge of this class

As such, a substitute teacher   
will be coming to perform       
today's lesson.                 

129
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:45,597
Today will serve as an example  
of the "true cuisine" that      
Central is advocating.          

130
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,466
Please make sure you            
learn the recipe.               

131
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,968
Now then,                       
I'll bring in the substitute.

[TSUKASA] Hello everyone.       

137
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,882
I'm Eishi Tsukasa, first seat   
of the Council of Ten.          

138
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,084
I'm not certain if any of you   
have heard of me before.        

139
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,953
[STUDENTS]                      
(disbelieving) We have!         

140
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,022
Today I will be creating        
a number of dishes.             

141
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,024
When you make them from now on, 

142
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,227
we expect that you will follow  
my example down to the letter.  

143
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,763
Is he serious?!                 
[GIRL] He's going to            
teach us personally?!           

144
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,631
[GUY] Oh man, I'm nervous!      

145
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,701
[SOMA] We tasted his stuff      
at the Lunar Feast,             
it was high level.              

146
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,169
He was amazing.                 

147
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,638
Everything we had at his place  
was just sublime.               

148
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,641
So, um,                         
for today's recipe then,        

149
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,178
I will need one student,        
someone to act as my assistant. 

150
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,713
I need someone to               
support me up here.             

151
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,183
Is there anybody who            
would like to volunteer?

[GUY 3] Not a chance in Hell.

Uh... anyone?                   

156
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,561
Is having to cook with me       
that unpleasant?                

157
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:52,264
Huh?

even in this class.

Yeah! If it's okay, I'll do it. 

162

Sure. Then you've got the job,  
my friend.                      

163
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,149
You'll be learning 5 different  
French "amuse" dishes today.    

164
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,217
We'll be cooking them           
all at the same time.           

165
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,554
Soma, I'll have you handle all  
the necessary preparation.      

166
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:16,689
Cool!                           

167
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,024
[TSUKASA] All right,            
let's get cooking.              

168
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:23,562
Soma, first put some semi-dry   
figs into a food processor      
and ready for a quenelle.       

169
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,231
Then cut the shallots haché     
and julienne the carrots.       

170
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,900
Mix the egg yolks, sugar,       
cardamom powder and milk,       

171
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,568
then warm them up anglaise.     

172
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,438
When it's cool enough,          
drizzle it into the sorbetière. 

173
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,039
[SOMA] Gotcha!

[GIRL] My head's gonna explode! 

175
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,249
Wow! Look at 'em go!            
[TSUKASA] Then, next you'll...  

176
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,719
[SOMA] ...coat the sweetfish    
in whole wheat flour and        
friture them, right?            

177
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,455

a bit from you.

00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:43,329
Would you like to join us,      
in Central?                     

244
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:52,838
[HISAKO] Ms Erina, I heard the  
next straggler hunt was decided.

245
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,307
In about three days.            
[ERINA] I see.                  

246
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,778
[HISAKO] Another large number   
of groups will be disbanded,    
I imagine.                      

247
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,313
We can't think like that.       

248
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,382
It's very possible some of      
the groups may win,             

249
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,517
like Alice's did the other day. 

250
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,320
My Father, as well as           
those in Central                

251
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,090
are not as invincible as        
they may appear to be.          

252
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,259
Um? What are you staring at?    

253
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,728
Oh, nothing.                    

254
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,596
I just thought that the         
expression on your face         

255
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,464
was somehow different           
than usual.                     

256
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:23,168
And that maybe you were having  
a change of heart about things. 

257
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,671
Maybe so.                       

258
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,408
[ERINA] Up until now,           
I've listened to my father      

259
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,610
without ever holding any        
doubts about him.               

260
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,681
I never even considered         
another possible path.          

261
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,151
Because obeying him seemed      
perfectly natural to me.        

262
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:43,689
But now, I've seen Soma Yukihira
and the members of the          
Kyokusei Dorm                   

263
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:47,359
stand up against him without    
even yielding an inch.          

264
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,895
And even Alice spoke up         
right to his face,              

265
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,097
and let her anger               
be known to him.                

266
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,900
Having seen all of that, I...   

267
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,236
You have to show that evil man  
what you're made of!            

268
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,571
Let that jerk know who you are. 

269
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,240
I started to think              
more seriously.                 

270
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,842
About what I really want.       

271
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,977
What I want to accomplish       
as a person.                    

272
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,579
Wow, Ms Erina...                

273
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,181
But... But don't get me wrong,  

274
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,250
I mean I wasn't influenced      
by Alice or Soma in particular! 

275
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,719
I was simply acting of          
my own free will.               

276
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,321
[huh?] Soma?                    

277
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:19,158
I'm telling you that he didn't  
have anything to do with my-    

278
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,929
Is that Tsukasa with Soma?      

279
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,197
Why are those two together?!    

280
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,334
What seems to be the matter,    
Ms Erina?                       

281
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,201
Why are we hiding from them?    

282
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,071
Well, um, I'm not really sure...
[SOMA] Am I getting this right? 

283
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,741
You want me to be               
part of Central?                
[TSUKASA] That's right.         

284
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,411
You're not very good at making  
jokes, Chef Tsukasa.            

285
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,612
Why would I ever do that?       

286
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,548
I see.                          
I knew you wouldn't agree to it.

287
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,018
Whoa! You don't have to be      
THAT depressed about it!        

288
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,420
To be perfectly honest,         
I'm just pleased as punch       

289
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,356
that you've acknowledged        
my cooking skills.              

290
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,024
have no intention of ever       
letting Central get ahold       

291
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,493
of the Yukihira family          
style of cooking.               

292
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,362
[TSUKASA]                       
Oh, well we don't need that.    

293
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:57,629
What?                           

294
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,498
We don't want the               
Yukihira style.                 

295
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,366
I simply wanted your abilities. 

296
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,835
I think you would make me       
excellent support chef.         

297
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,105
I think that my cooking         
stands to get even better       

298
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:08,974
if you were by my side          
assisting me the whole time.    

299
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,443
So, um,                         
that's the gist of it anyway.   

300
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,380
Will you at least give it       
some honest consideration, Soma?

301
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,048
Perhaps for the sake?           

302
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:18,784
[sigh]                          
You're being awfully nonchalant 

303
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,053
about such a selfishly          
blatant request.                

304
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,388
You know,                       
I've never met a single chef    

305
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,458
that wasn't in some way         
obsessed with themselves.       

306
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,128
Hey, Erina and Hisako,          
whatcha doing here?             

307
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,263
[HISAKO] Hurry and get down!    
[MEGUMI] Huh?!                  

308
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,599
You stand to gain a lot         
from this too.                  

309
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,869
If you join Central             
and pair up with me,            

310
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,538
you'll be able to cook          
on a much higher level          
than you do right now.          

311
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,342
But I would still be stuck as   
being nothing more than your    
assistant, isn't that right?    

312
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,479
There's no point in me          
doing that unless I can         
serve up my own food.           

313
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:50,348
[depressed sigh] Okay...        

314
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,952
You really have no capacity     
for thought outside of yourself,
do you?                         

315
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,688
Anyway, you've never even seen a
single one of my dishes before, 

316
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,423
much less tasted one!           

317
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,026
Isn't it possible that my skills
might actually surpass yours    

318
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,495
in every conceivable way?       
[TSUKASA] Interesting.          

319
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:06,131
Then shall we go ahead          
and test that out?              

320
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,169
[TSUKASA] Which of us           
really belongs at the top?      

321
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,371
If you're up for it,            

322
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,239
I'll throw down with you        
right here and now.             

323
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,676
And even put my spot at the     
top of the Council of Ten       
on the line.                    

324
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,649
Are you serious?                

325
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,050
Definitely.                     

326
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,119
But if I end up winning         
this challenge,                 

327
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,456
you will join with Central      
and serve under me, understand? 

328
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:34,058
Do you accept my challenge?     

329
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:36,395
Soma Yukihira?                  

330
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,134
[slow exhale]                   

331
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:44,136
It would be my pleasure.        

332
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:45,737
Let's do this thing.            

333
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,307
This is a battle for            
the First Seat!                 

334
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:57,749
[hmpf]                          
Well, then that decides it.     

335
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,819
So, about the theme ingredient, 
how about venison?              

336
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,423
Apparently, it was originally   
going to be used in             
today's class,                  

337
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:06,759
so numerous cuts have           
already been prepared.          

338
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,028
I see, then.                    
Works for me.                   

339
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,363
And as for the cooking style,   
let's make it-                  

340
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:13,098
We shall make it French.        

341
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,899
Oh, yeah? Fine.                 

342
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,768
Then let's get cooking,         
shall we?                       

343
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:18,704
The battle begins.              

344
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,373
[SOMA]<i> The French cooking that</i>  
<i> Chef Tsukasa made for us</i>       

345
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,308
<i> during the Lunar Festival...</i>   

346
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,644
<i> It really was</i>                  
<i> out of this world.</i>             

347
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,848
<i> But I learned my own tricks</i>    
<i> while studying with</i>            
<i> Chef Kojiro!</i>                   

348
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,651
<i> I'll mow him down with</i>         
<i> my own French style!</i>           

349
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,986
Uh, how do you suppose          
it turned into this?            

350
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:37,522
Who knows!                      
Anything can set these two off. 

351
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,058
But now that it's come          
to a cook-off,                  

352
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,726
we MUST see it to the end.      

353
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,929
We MUST see how Soma            
faces off against Tsukasa.      

354
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:46,732
You're right, Ms Erina.         

355
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,801
But then,                       
if he loses the battle...       

356
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:51,336
<i> Now then, about that venison...</i>

357
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,005
<i> What should I make?</i>            

358
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,542
<i> What dish can beat</i>             
<i> Eishi Tsukasa?</i>                 
[TSUKASA] Soma.                 

359
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,277
I'm going to get started.       

360
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,412
[SOMA]<i> (doh!) That's a huge cut!</i>

361
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,147
<i> It must be back meat!</i>          

362
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,955
He's using a salamander to      
slowly and gently cook the meat 

363
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,224
he's infused with               
salt and pepper.                

364
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,829
[MEGUMI] He lined the bottom of 
that frying pan with cubed cuts 
of fat and muscle,              

365
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:20,766
so that the meat isn't directly 
touching the frying pan itself. 

366
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:23,702
[SOMA]<i> He's taking it off the</i>   
<i> heat periodically to arroser,</i>  

367
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:27,239
<i> using the melted fat to</i>        
<i> cover the top so that</i>          
<i> it doesn't dry out.</i>            

368
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,042
<i> His attention to detail</i>        
<i> is nearly flawless.</i>            

369
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:35,247
<i> It's as if he's quietly</i>        
<i> whispering to each ingredient</i>  
<i> with a caress of tender love.</i>  

370
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,183
That is exactly what earned him 
a seat at the top.              

371
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:42,053
Right now, he is truly          
"speaking" directly to          
the ingredients.                

372
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:46,858
[TSUKASA] Come on, come on.     
This way, darling.              

373
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,061
Just a little closer.           

374
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,730
That's right, nice and easy.    

375
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,931
Now...                          

376
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,999
If you would please...          

377
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:57,870
find your way onto my plate.    

378
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:04,743
[MEGUMI] Oh, wow!               
The juices from the meat are    
quietly swelling inside         

379
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,812
as if it were                   
actually a live deer!           

380
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:10,081
Right before us, his ingredients
are slowly working their way    

381
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,351
in to a state of                
absolute perfection!            

382
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:16,421
[MEGUMI]<i> (whimpering) We aren't</i> 
<i> even eating it, and yet...</i>     

383
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,690
[HISAKO]<i> Just the look</i>          
<i> and smell are enough to...</i>     

384
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,892
[BOTH]<i> ...send us flying!</i>       

385
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:24,162
<i> It's all so simply</i>             
<i> overwhelming!</i>                  

386
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,298
[moaning]                       

387
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,500
[moaning]                       

388
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:31,704
His level of skill              
and sensibility                 

389
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:34,372
have far surpassed those        
of any normal human.            

390
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:37,843
Eishi Tsukasa,                  
the White Knight of the Table.  

391
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:42,381
He has found his way into       
the realm of gods who           
create supreme cuisine!         

392
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,852
[TSUKASA] Don't you need        
to start cooking, Soma?         

393
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,856
As a member of Central, I can't 
afford to lose to the likes     
of a rebel first year.          

394
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,925
So I've no intention of         
going easy on you.              

395
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:57,195
Hey, Chef Tsukasa,              
what exactly does Central want  
to accomplish here anyway?      

396
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,264
Uh...                           
You should focus on your dish.  

397
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,201
Is the goal really just to get  
control over the academy        
and how it teaches?             

398
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,139
I mean, you're already an       
incredible chef placed at       
a very high caliber.            

399
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,677
Even without Central,           
you would be massively          
successful in my opinion.       

400
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,613
No, no, you're giving me way too
much credit, Soma.              

401
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,815
But you're right                
about one thing.                

402
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,284
Central's true goal has         
yet to be realized.             

403
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:23,288
And that is to obliterate all of
Japan's restaurants, pronto.    

404
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,693
[SOMA] What?!                   
[TSUKASA]                       
Oh, don't misunderstand me.     

405
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,163
Any restaurant that serve       
legitimate cuisine              

406
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,764
will be left untouched.         

407
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,701
Director Azami put it like this:

408
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,237
We must eliminate any restaurant
that serves horrid sludge,      

409
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,573
which cannot be                 
considered "food".              

410
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:46,444
It is an absolute necessity     
if we wish for Japan's cuisine  
to truly reach the next level.  

411
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,181
For that to happen, we must     
gather all the skilled chefs.   

412
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,051
In other words, we need to      
begin training our soldiers.    

413
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,519
The purge going through the     
academy right now,              

414
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,522
as well as the new classes,     

415
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,658
are all intended to enable us   
to rid Japan of                 
inferior restaurants.           

416
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,860
"Inferior restaurants"?         

417
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,263
That's right. By weeding out all
of the plebeian eateries        
that plague the area...         

418
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:09,401
It means that only those which  
offer true gourmet cuisine      
will be left standing.          

419
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,936
That is the future which        
Central is striving for.        

420
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,540
All the plebeian eateries       
in town, huh?                   

421
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:18,877
And by that do you mean places  
like "Mitamura Western Cuisine"?

422
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,415
Or better yet, my own family's  
"Yukihira Japanese Eatery"?     

423
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,551
That's right, that is           
exactly what we mean.           

424
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:28,487
You would do that, even if it   
meant maybe tearing away        

425
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,556
a place that someone holds      
close to their heart?           

426
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,757
I would, absolutely.            

427
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,860
I think that would              
be unavoidable.                 

428
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,703
[SOMA] I see... Then obviously, 

429
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:49,641
I can say with certainty        
that I'm not suited to be       
your right-hand-man.            

430
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,681
I will never join               
the likes of Central.           

431
00:21:57,118 --> 00:22:00,686
I will be the one who will      
win this battle today.          

432
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,389
