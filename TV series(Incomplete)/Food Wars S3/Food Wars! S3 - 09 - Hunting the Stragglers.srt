1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:04,169
[THUG] Get outta there!         
[screams and battle sounds]     

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,276
[ZENJI] We need more people     
over by the dining hall- [ack!] 

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,879
We gotta hold these             
fart-knockers off               
till Soma win his Food War      

4
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,214
and gets our dorm back, dude!   
[breaking glass]                

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,150
They've just broken through     
the barricade!                  

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,819
[AOKI] Oh dude! If they get in, 
then we're totally toast!       

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,288
Wait hold on!                   
Something's strange...          

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,290
[AOKI]                          
Yeah, they ain't coming in.     

9
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,462
[ZENJI] (vexed sigh)            
This is a terrible time         
to break my glasses.            

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,034
(surprised yell)                

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,169
[YUKI] What is it, Zenji?       

12
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,438
It... Check it out!             

13
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,441
[YUME] Soma Yukihira has beaten 
Etsuya Eizan in their Food War  

14
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,043
by three to zero.               

15
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,111
Soma Yukihira is the winner!    

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,713
What the... Soma won?           
[YUME] I repeat,                
Soma Yukihira is the winner...  

17
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,316
[YUKI] What?! But how?          

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,219
He did it!                      

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,324
[RINDO]                         
So he friggin' beat the         
No. 9 Seat on the Ten...        

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,326
Still, if his position was      
really on the line,             

21
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,897
Eizan probably would have       
taken it a lot more seriously.  

22
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,735
Soma Yukihira...                

23
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:13,805
[RINDO] Hey, Isshiki!           
You've been buried in paperwork 
for a while now, huh?           

24
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,673
But do you realize              
what's happening?               

25
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,144
Your dorm is about to be knocked
down by Eizan any second now.   

26
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,280
It's not the time to be holed up
here ignoring things.           

27
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:25,083
The dorm isn't in trouble of    
being knocked down.             
[RINDO] [hmm?]                  

28
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:29,687
[SATOSHI]                       
Because Soma has always known   
that the true worth of a chef   

29
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,023
lies in what's put on the plate 
in front of you.                

30
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,626
I'm not worried about our dorm  
in the least.                   

31
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,564
I have faith that Soma will     
make short work of that         
charlatan Eizan.                

32
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,966
But what's most important       
is what comes after.            

33
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,901
That is when the                
true fight will begin.          

34
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,703
And no matter what              
happens today,                  

35
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,672
we have to prepare for it.      

36
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,375
[RINDO] Dammit, once again,     
it looks like                   

37
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,545
things turned out exactly the   
way Isshiki thought they would. 

38
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,382
[RYOKO] So, we're not getting   
kicked out after all!           

39
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,183
[YUKI] Whoohoo!                 

40
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,185
[AOKI]                          
Whoa! They're all leaving!      

41
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,986
[SATO]                          
Serves you right, A-holes!      

42
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,423
[ZENJI]                         
Kyokusei isn't going anywhere!  

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,139
Hey, I'm back!                  

44
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,741
You big ol' dummy!              
[SOMA] What the?!               

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,143
How could you just ghost and    
do a Food War like that?!       

46
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,945
You shoulda come and            
talked to us first!             

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,614
You truly are irresponsible!    

48
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,483
That was nothing short of       
stupid, foolish, and moronic!   

49
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,753
We were all worried about you,  
you know that?                  

50
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,556
But thank goodness!             
I mean it!                      

51
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:42,161
Thank you, Soma,                
for saving Kyokusei! [sobbing]  

52
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,896
Ah, well...                     

53
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,097
[MEGUMI] Soma...                

54
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,098
We're happy you're back home!   

55
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,467
Me too!                         

56
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,172
But, dude, how the heck did you 
beat Eizan in a Food War?!      

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,506
[SOMA]                          
Well, you know how it goes...   

58
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,108
[SATO] I still can't            
believe you did it!             

59
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,843
[SOMA]                          
What's with those helmets?      
[MEGUMI] Um, well,              

60
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,644
they're remnants from           
the "Golden Age."               

61
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,313
[RYOKO]                         
We can go into details later,   

62
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,115
but let's just                  
get inside, first.              

63
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:07,052
[YUKI] Yeah! And we can         
celebrate Kyokusei Dorm         
being saved!                    

64
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,921
[ZENJI] (gah!) Not in my room!  

65
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,090
[music playing]                 

66
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,348
[cheers and whoops]             

67
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,587
[HISAKO]                        
You did really great, Soma.     

68
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,523
Thank you, and you too!         

69
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,658
Hey, Soma, I watched your       
Food War with Chef Eizan!       

70
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,461
It's the Aldini brothers.       

71
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,930
Takumi always seems to be in    
"lecture mode," doesn't he?     

72
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,399
Gripe, gripe, gripe, gripe,     
gripe, gripe, gripe!            

73
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,268
Wait, he's not getting mad.     

74
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,403
He's not going to complain?     

75
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,871
I knew it had to be done.       

76
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,273
They were threatening           
to take away                    

77
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,208
the very place where            
you guys live.                  

78
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,010
I probably would have done      
the same thing.                 

79
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,345
I bet you would have!           

80
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,212
Nice to see you here, Erina!    

81
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,149
Oh! I guess you really have been
here at Kyokusei Dorm.          

82
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,085
Uh, hi, I hope this means       
you're both doing well today.   

83
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,355
All right, all right, let's do  
this celebration up guys!       

84
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,491
You all grab some food          
and eat up! [laughs]            

85
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,428
He just finished an important   
battle, and look at him.        

86
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,031
It's like he doesn't have a care
in the world right now.         

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,700
Yo, Soma,                       
you are one dope-ass dude!      

88
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,436
You totally slayed the          
No. 9 Seat in a Food War!       

89
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,105
Then does that mean he could    
beat that knockers babe, too,   

90
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,707
the No. 10 Seat of the council? 

91
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,708
Do not insult me,               
you Neanderthal!                

92
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,911
And who are you calling         
"knockers babe"?                

93
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,047
Well, you let Yuki call you     
"Erina-poo," so...              

94
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,384
That crosses the line! You are  
showing no respect for me!      

95
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,587
Yeah, that's right!             
What's more, Ms Erina has shown 

96
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,457
dignity in taking the           
No. 10 Seat. Her actual skills- 

97
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:29,128
Still, it was me who decided    
on the theme for what           
we'd be cooking today.          

98
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,796
Chef Eizan just came up         
with something on the fly,      

99
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,266
but it still somehow managed    
to be refined.                  

100
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,269
Before long, I want to battle   
under those same conditions.    

101
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,004
He's still not satisfied, huh?  

102
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,274
Humph!                          
I totally understand, Soma.     
[SOMA] By the way guys,         

103
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,276
what happened to the other      
seminars and research societies 

104
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,944
that looked like                
they were done for?             

105
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,747
They're in about as much danger 
as they were before.            

106
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,349
But thanks to you, Soma,        

107
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,084
things have somewhat            
changed for the better.         

108
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,019
Is that our Isshiki             
coming home?!                   

109
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,620
Where have you been             
this whole time?!               

110
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,089
I'm so sorry, you guys.         

111
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:59,692
But I AM a member of the Ten,   
in name at least.               

112
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,761
And I was terribly afraid that  
if I wasn't careful enough,     

113
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,364
Azami would have found a way    
to bring down the hammer on us  
more than he already has.       

114
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:10,235
You know what? I thought        
Isshiki had actually sold us    
out to Central.                 

115
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,103
Yeah, it looked like you        
were gonna screw us.            

116
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,173
Whah?! No, of course I wouldn't 
do that to you guys!            

117
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,109
Do you all not get just how much
I love this dorm?!              

118
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,579
Kyokusei holds everything       
that I care about.              

119
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,115
I guess so.                     
[TAKUMI] Well, regardless,      

120
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,384
what did you mean by things     
have changed "for the better"?  

121
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,320
Well, thanks to today's horrific
Food War embarrassment,         

122
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,123
the Azami Administration        
has now heard a new voice.      

123
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:35,661
From now on, Central will       
accept Food Wars from           
societies and seminars          

124
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,596
that are facing dissolution.    

125
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,330
And of course,                  
the elected judges              

126
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
were chosen on the premise      
of being impartial!             

127
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:46,538
We still can't change the fact  
that the academy is under       
Central's control,              

128
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,009
but Eizan's cheating ways are   
no longer a factor in it.       

129
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,943
And it's because of you!        

130
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,480
You've brought back             
the Food Wars!                  

131
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,615
Thank you, Soma,                

132
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,483
for saving our dorm today.      

133
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,552
Nah, no need to thank me.       

134
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,155
You should know this place is   
really important to me too.     

135
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:06,958
Everyone, let's all be grateful 
that Kyokusei has been spared!  

136
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,695
Well, that's enough dwelling    
on the bad stuff.               

137
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,430
Tonight...                      
we're letting it all hang out!  

138
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,299
[ALL] Yeah!                     

139
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:15,968
Wait! WHAAT?!                   

140
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,635
He's got nothing on under there!

141
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,837
<i> Is this guy naked?!</i>            

142
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,839
<i> Ohmygod! How unsanitary!</i>       

143
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,443
Wha?! You mustn't look at       
such things Ms Erina! [sobs]    

144
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,012
[laughing]                      

145
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,649
Well, I see the guy's still got 
it, doesn't he?                 

146
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,186
Sure enough, that right there   
is what makes Kyokusei Dorm     
what it is.                     

147
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,587
Know what I mean?               

148
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,988
What on Earth is going on       

149
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,790
with all of the freaks          
that live in this dorm?         

150
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:42,394
How can they just accept him    
going around naked with         
an apron?!                      

151
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,863
This dorm is mysterious         
to say the least.               

152
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,399
Honestly!                       
It goes beyond "mysterious!"    

153
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,201
It's just Gross! And Unsanitary!

154
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,870
Is everything all right?        

155
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,940
Hisako, do you maybe know how   
to use a washing machine?       

156
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,342
Um, a washing machine?          

157
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,211
Yeah, I suppose so...           

158
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,146
Really? Wow!                    

159
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,616
Being able to use something     
with all those buttons is       
pretty amazing.                 

160
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,819
Um, Ms Erina?                   

161
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,221
Uh- Look, never mind the        
washing machine!                

162
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,089
The point is,                   
in this mysterious dorm,        

163
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,757
I've learned so many            
things that, up till now,       

164
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,760
I didn't know existed,          
much less how to do!            

165
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,495
O-okay.                         

166
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,897
[ERINA]                         
These people really are bizarre.

167
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,433
And at the center of            
them all is...                  

168
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,835
Soma Yukihira.                  

169
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,970
[ERINA] When Kyokusei Dorm      
came under attack               

170
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,705
the others thought, well...     

171
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,241
that somehow,                   
Soma would come through         

172
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,643
and pull off some sort of       
miracle or something.           

173
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,145
They trusted him.               

174
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,382
And, well...                    
you thought so too, Hisako.     

175
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:39,050
Huh? You think I did too?       

176
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,621
You looked as if you knew       
that Soma would somehow         
come through in the end.        

177
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,758
Why did you have that look      
on your face?                   

178
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,526
Um, I guess it's just...        

179
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,795
How can I put this?             

180
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,397
I had nothing to base it on,    
but...                          

181
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,866
I just had a feeling about it,  
you know?                       

182
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,403
If anyone can save Totsuki from 
the hand of Master Azami...     

183
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:02,775
HE would be the one capable of  
pulling it all off, right?      

184
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,347
[SATOSHI] Erina! Hisako!        
You ladies come join us!        

185
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,484
[urk!] [waah!]                  
Please put some clothes on!     

186
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,887
[SATOSHI] What? Clothes?        
Clothes are so blech.           

187
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,288
[HISAKO] I don't even know      
what that means!                

188
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,690
[SATOSHI] Wiggle, jiggle...     
[HISAKO] (waaahhh!)             

189
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,825
[AZAMI] Satoshi Isshiki,        

190
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,893
No. 7 Seat on the Ten...        

191
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,362
Effective today,                

192
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,030
I would have these men          
relinquish their positions:     

193
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,101
The No. 3 Seat,                 
Tosuke Megishima,               

194
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,837
and the No. 8 Seat,             
Terunori Kuga.                  

195
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,906
Well, that's unexpectedly       
quick of you.                   

196
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,642
And you seem unexpectedly       
unmoved by it.                  

197
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,311
I was fully aware that this was 
going to happen to them.        

198
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,514
Any members of the Ten          
who do not agree with           
Central's wishes                

199
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,783
are acting as an obstacle       
in our way, are they not?       

200
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,185
Your quick thinking is a boon.  

201
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,188
The other members of the Ten    
are in agreement.               

202
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,525
Seriously?! Where's the harm    
in them thinking that way?      
Who cares about that?!          

203
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,462
I don't think you have to boot  
them off of the Ten for         
simply disagreeing!             

204
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,864
Rindo Kobayashi quite           
vocally disagreed               
[RINDO] I mean, come on!        

205
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,665
with that particular            
ruling of mine.                 
[RINDO] They're good chefs!     

206
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,068
Are you serious?                
I mean I take it                

207
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,204
you won't be getting rid of     
your daughter, will you?        

208
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,340
I know that, in time,           
she will return to my side.     

209
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,577
I'm sure she will come around   
to agree with my thinking.      

210
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:16,148
[AZAMI] And now, thanks to you, 
there is much to do.            

211
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,083
The Food Wars, you mean?        

212
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,954
Yes. I've confirmed that you've 
made the necessary arrangements.

213
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,689
According to these rules,       
that is.                        

214
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,028
These research societies and    
Seminars we wish to abolish     
must now be challenged...       

215
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,831
by the pride that is Central's  
corps of soldiers.              

216
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,636
[MOMO] "Regarding the rules that
research societies and seminars 

217
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,305
engaging in Food Wars to        
challenge their dissolution,    

218
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,409
also now presently known as     
'The Isshiki Rules,' will..."   

219
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,644
Now wait, just a second.        

220
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,979
He's named it after himself?    
That pisses me off.             

221
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,716
Yes, well, by clearly stating   
that he will have absolutely    

222
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,650
no interaction with             
the judges at all,              

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,988
Isshiki has made sure that      
the rulings will be fair        
from here on out.               

224
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,923
And I'm glad he made            
that happen, too.               

225
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,125
I was against that sort of thing
from the start.                 

226
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:03,194
Correct me if I'm wrong here,   
but doesn't that clause state,  

227
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:07,266
"any Food War contesting        
a group's dissolution           
MUST be accepted"?              

228
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,202
That Isshiki,                   
he's covering his bases.        

229
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,672
[gah]                           
But now we're going to have to  
battle all these stupid losers, 

230
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,206
and that pisses me off, too.    

231
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,742
I did take the overall          
top-spot in the Lunar Feast,    

232
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,345
so I think I should win by      
default no matter what.         

233
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,547
Please accept this rule,        
Chef Momo.                      

234
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:27,352
Also, Chef Rindo,               
if you would please be sure     
to wear your badge from Central.

235
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,955
[RINDO] Whaaat?                 
But that thing's such a pain.   
Come on, girl.                  

236
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,158
[NENE]                          
There's no "Whaat?" about it.   
[RINDO] But still-              

237
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,627
[NENE]                          
There's no "But, still" either. 
Just do it.                     

238
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,163
Fine! Everyone, be sure to      
put your badges on,             

239
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,098
or Nene will get in             
a big 'ol tizzy.                

240
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,035
Yeah, you don't have to         
tell me twice.                  

241
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,775
[RINDO] Well,                   
I guess we should head out.     

242
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,845
It's time to go hunt            
some stragglers.                

243
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,583
[SOMA] "Hunting the stragglers"?

244
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,851
Apparently, that's what Central 
has decided to call it          

245
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,788
when someone challenges their   
disbandment through a Food War. 

246
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,722
So far, this would be           
the first instance.             

247
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,325
Really?                         
Has kind of a bad ring to it.   

248
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,462
It looks like Central's members 
will be the ones carrying       
this thing out.                 

249
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,931
Yes, the ones following Azami.  

250
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,268
As well as the Ten's            
"Reserve Army" of skilled chefs.

251
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:19,471
[SOMA]                          
Whoa, a reserve army, huh?      

252
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,674
I'd like to see what kind       
of guys they are.               
[ALL] Huh?!                     

253
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,676
It looks like he's              
up to something again.          

254
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,545
Don't go off and get            
into more trouble!              

255
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:29,615
[TAKUMI]                        
If you're going to go watch a   
Food War, I'll go with you.     

256
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,484
You being out there on your own 
will just make us all worry.    

257
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,821
Having them there will          
help us rest easy.              
[RYOKO] Yeah, well,             

258
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,490
kinda feels like they're always 
here at the dorm anyway.        
[GUYS] (arguing)                

259
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,425
U-uh, I'd like to go too!       

260
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:43,294
I mean it looks like Regional   
Cuisine is also doing           
a Food War.                     

261
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,565
My Miyazato Seminar will be     
battling today as well.         

262
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,567
It'd be a shame not to go       
and support them.               

263
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,503
Apparently, they've divided the 
Food Wars into three venues.    

264
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,239
Then, I say we should split into
groups and go watch all of them!

265
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,442
Yeah, let's do it!              

266
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,245
So, I think we should go        
and watch the A Venue.          

267
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,446
Sounds terrific!                

268
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,716
Okay,                           
I guess we take Venue B, B!     

269
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:06,451
But I'm really worried about    
leaving Ms Erina for so long... 

270
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,253
Knockers babe will be just fine!

271
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,988
I mean, Ms Fumio will be here-  

272
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,657
[HISAKO]                        
Stop calling her knockers babe! 

273
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,058
I-I'm sorry!                    

274
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,127
All right! Then that means      
we're headed to C Venue!        

275
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,064
Okay, Soma, today we're         
only going to observe.          

276
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,665
Don't take things too far,      
understand?                     

277
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,668
Yeah, yeah, I know, man.        

278
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,678
I don't know about              
"straggler hunting",            

279
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:37,416
but as long as I'm drawing      
breath, I will allow            
no tomfoolery!                  

280
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:41,086
Indeed. It's our responsibility 
to deliver an honest judgment.  

281
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,822
Whoa,                           
there's a lot going on here.    

282
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,424
Let's see, right now...         

283
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:49,294
No. 4 Chef Momo vs.             
Chocolate Research Society.     

284
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,698
[TAKUMI]                        
Chef Eizan vs. the Western      
Cuisine Research Society.       

285
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
It's looking like they're going 
to hold multiple Food Wars      

286
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,701
within the same venue,          
should be interesting.          

287
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,238
I don't see the guys from       
Bowl-Soc anywhere.              

288
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,239
Or even Akira from              
Shiomi Seminar.                 

289
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,041
Here we go, Pucchi.             

290
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,811
Help me out with my cooking,    
'kay?                           

291
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,587
[ALL] (uh...)                   

292
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,258
Okeedokee...                    
Let's see how it turned out.    

293
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,927
She just used the hands from her
stuffed doll as mittens.        

294
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,928
Is there some reason for        
her doing that?                 

295
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,665
They say that she pulls that    
move every time she's           
in a Food War!                  

296
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,868
[TAKUMI]                        
Sure enough, she moves fast.    

297
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,470
They say she's Totsuki Academy's
top patissier.                  

298
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,273
Yeah, that cake she made        
for the autumn-leaf viewing     

299
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,209
was SUPER delicious!            

300
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,878
All done!                       

301
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,079
It's beautiful...               

302
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,248
But how will it taste?          

303
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,818
[cheering]                      

304
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,822
[ANNOUNCER] Momo Akanegakubo    
and Etsuya Eizan,               

305
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:53,892
both have achieved              
flawless victories!             
[MEGUMI] Incredible!            

306
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,161
Central completely              
dominated the matches.          

307
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,629
Oh...                           

308
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,031
I'd like to battle them too.    

309
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,433
Soma, stop!                     
[TAKUMI] Um, Soma...            

310
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,102
Not to belabor the point, but   
today we're only here for recon.

311
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,304
You are NOT to cha-             

312
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,639
Yeah, yeah, I know, I get it!   

313
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,775
<i> Soma Yukihira!</i>                 

314
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:13,578
Speaking of which, I haven't    
seen what your true specialty   
is yet, Chef Eizan.             

315
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,116
We should come up with a dish   
and have a knock-down,          
drag-out Food War.              

316
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,850
Y'know one day, for real?       

317
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,452
[agh!] Dammit!                  

318
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,654
There's no way I can let        
things end like this.           

319
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:26,325
I will do whatever it takes     
to make him pay for             
embarrassing me!                

320
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,327
Goodness he's so worked up!     

321
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,797
And this coming from somebody   
who couldn't possibly hack it   
on the Ten.                     

322
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,199
Looks like it's time            
to pass the baton!              

323
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,402
Leave the Food Wars to us,      
Mr. "I Lost to a First Year."   

324
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,471
Better luck next time!          

325
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,606
[oohs and aahs]                 

326
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,142
Those guys are the troops       
of Azami Nakiri,                

327
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,878
specially brought for Central.  

328
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,548
They're on the side of those    
who'll be governing Totsuki.    

329
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:52,685
So, you're really okay          
with this? You want us          
to choose the theme?            

330
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,220
Of course. All four of us       
will gladly battle you          

331
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,956
with the cooking style in which 
you and your teammates excel.   

332
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,359
We're gonna use the genre       
you've worked so hard           
to try and perfect              

333
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,162
and annihilate you with it.     

334
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,763
Well that's not very nice.      

335
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,566
Going out of your way to try    
to humiliate your opponent...   

336
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:11,303
Oh come on, that's what         
makes winning so much FUN       
in this place!                  

337
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:13,038
Don't you think, Chef Momo?     

338
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,307
[SPANISH HEAD] You can make     
fun of us all you like.         

339
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:16,775
But you're right in one thing.  

340
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:18,843
We HAVE worked extremely hard   
here at Totsuki.                

341
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,713
We will not be intimidated.     

342
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:22,815
[cheers]                        

343
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,389
Now, choose.                    

344
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,258
Are you going to be a good boy  
and disband your little club,   

345
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,795
or do you want to get tossed    
out of Totsuki never            
to be seen again?               

346
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,198
We will disband our             
research club.

00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,400

None of these guys              
are a challenge! Ha!            

349
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:46,338
Do you get it now?              

350
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,208
You are not the chosen ones.    

351
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,609
So obey us!                     

352
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,610
It's the right thing to do!     

353
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,482
All of you, bow your heads to   
those of us at Central!         

354
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,751
It's the only option you've got!

Hmm? What?!                     

358
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,358
Huh? Did you first years        
say something to me?            

359
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,028
We're saying we have a lot      
more to offer than you're       
giving us credit for.           

360
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,097
And we cannot stand here and    
allow that to happen!           

361
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,300
Now it's not just Soma,         
but Takumi too?!                

362
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,836
You're the first-year           
who defeated Eizan.             

363
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,240
And if I'm not mistaken you were
also in the Fall Selection?     

364
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:24,042
You'd do well not to take       
that nasty attitude here.       

365
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:27,713
Not with me, the ELITE who'll be
heading up the next generation. 

366
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,849
The "Elite"?                    
[KUSUNOKI] That's right.        
We are the elite,               

367
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,852
specifically chosen by the      
current director of this school.

368
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,588
It'd be in your best interests  
not to oppose us.               

369
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:39,925
I'm not getting a real sense    
of identity from you.           
[KUSUNOKI] Huh?                 

370
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,194
Stressing how you've been       
"chosen" and all that.          

371
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:45,931
It makes you sound like you're  
hiding an inferiority complex   
or something.                   

372
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:50,202
If you have to build yourself up
by repeatedly saying you're     
some kind of elite chef,        

373
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,472
doesn't that mean you don't have
much confidence in your         
cooking skills?                 

374
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:54,939
[squeal of horror]              

375
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,609
That's a pretty smart thing     
you said. Not bad.              

376
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:59,611
What do you say to that,        
huh, Chef?                      

377
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,814
Oh, you're asking for it.       

378
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,950
I'm gonna crush you,            
right here and now- [huh?!]     

379
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,752
Don't make a fool of yourself.  
It's sad.                       

380
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,955
Shige! Put me down! Hey!        

381
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,357
[KUMAI] You're making it worse. 

382
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,292
Okay, okay, I get it!           

383
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
I'll do what you say! I promise!
[BOTH] (huh...)                 

384
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:20,032
You get bent outta shape        
too easily, Renni boy!          

385
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,434
Shut up, Mea!                   
You damn 1st-Years!             

386
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,570
Just you wait!                  
You ARE going down!             
I MEAN IT!                      

387
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:27,573
Yeah, yeah, just be on your way.

388
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,009
And come up with your           
final match already.            

389
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,778
Huh? That dude?                 

390
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,579
He's doing the next battle too? 

391
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,181
Who's the challenger?           

392
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,850
[gasp]                          
[students chattering]           

393
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,587
[SOMA] Alice Nakiri... and Ryo! 

394
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:44,123
Hi!                             
Nice to see you both here today.

395
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,657
Why are you two here?           

396
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,526
[TAKUMI]                        
Did you join a research society?

397
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,661
It was quite surprising         
actually!                       

398
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,596
When I was in the               
middle school division,         

399
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,599
I did a Food War against the    
Cutting Edge Culinary           
Research Society.               

400
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:58,604
I won, of course. So I went     
ahead and took their club room  
and all their equipment.        

401
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:04,076
Then recently, I got a notice   
that I had become their         
new club's chief!               

402
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,078
An obvious choice I'm sure.     

403
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,479
That seems kinda cold.          

404
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:10,149
Oh!                             
That's why they came after you, 

405
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,550
for this hunting thing?         

406
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:13,218
[giggle] But of course!         

407
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,553
So feel free to call me "Chief  
Alice," from now on, boys!      

408
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,757
[TAKUMI] Even though you didn't 
know this whole time?           
[SOMA] But if that's the case,  

409
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,560
why don't you just disband      
the group and avoid the fight?  

410
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,897
[ALICE] (sigh) Yeah, well,      
here's the thing about that...  

411
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,966
[KUSUNOKI] So then, Cutting     
Edge-Soc will be disbanded,     

412
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,769
or I could go ahead and         
battle you in a Food War,       

413
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,704
if that's what you would        
prefer to do.                   

414
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:36,308
[ALICE] Oh, sure, do whatever   
you feel like doing.            
[KUSUNOKI] Huh?                 

415
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,310
The title of "Chief"            
is a new one for me,            

416
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,446
and I'm a little sad to see it  
go, but I don't really care.    

417
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,249
Would you please leave?         
[KUSUNOKI] (wha?)               

418
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:48,587
That's smart. Just stay quiet   
and watch the Azami             
Administration at work.         

419
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:51,123
You pansy-ass little chefs      
need to stay in your lane.      

420
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,992
WHO'RE YOU CALLIN' A PANSY ASS, 
HUH?!                           

421
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:55,927
Whoa! Hey, what got into him?   

422
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:59,330
[RYO] Anyone who comes for me,  
I'll chew 'em up and            
spit 'em out!                   

423
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,168
I got half a mind to stab you   
in your pathetic heart          
with my cooking!                

424
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,071
Okay, very well.                

425
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,540
We will accept your Food War.   

426
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:12,544
And so, now, it will be Ryo     
who does all the fighting!      

427
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,279
I think it's about time, Ryo.   

428
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,615
Go expose this elf-styled,      
wannabe "elite"                 

429
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,551
what he's gotten himself into.  
[RYO] Gotcha!                   

430
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,354
So who will be in the final     
Food War of C-Venue on          
the first day?                  

431
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:24,823
Ryo Kurokiba!                   

432
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,760
[SAOTOME] "The Despot of the    
Kitchen," Ryo Kurokiba,         

433
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:32,231
versus the rookie from Central, 
Rentaro Kusunoki!               

434
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,500
Hey, Ryo! Don't you dare lose!  

435
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:38,103
And that is a direct order from 
the Chief of the Cutting Edge   
club! Do you hear me?!          

436
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:42,174
Not today. We cannot let Uncle  
Azami do whatever he likes.     

437
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:45,444
Ryo Kurokiba...                 
I saw that you somehow made it  

438
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,245
to the finals in the            
Fall Selection.                 

439
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:50,715
There was an incident           
a bit earlier that kinda        
pissed me off.                  

440
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,051
So, I'll be sure to take        
that out on YOU today.          

441
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,587
You're not a bad opponent       
to have the pleasure of         

442
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,990
forcing into submission         
on the first day.               

443
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,926
[RYO] If you think you're gonna 
force me into submission...     

444
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:04,963
Then get ready to have that crap
thrown right back in your face! 

445
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,767
[music playing]                 

446
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,530
Good luck, Ryo!                 
We'll be here watching! Okay?!  

447
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,998
Yeah, sorry 'bout               
all the yelling.                

448
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:16,802
We hope you don't mind us here  
in the front row making         
a bunch of noise!               

449
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,004
[hmph!]                         
[SOMA] (huh)                    

450
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:21,874
[MEA] Ah, that's just           
Chef Momo's default mode,       

451
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,742
so I wouldn't worry             
too much about it.              

452
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:26,211
It takes about a month for her  
to make eye contact,            

453
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,680
or even bother to talk to you.  

454
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:31,683
Huh? So, then, how in the       
world did you make it           

455
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,018
through the training camp,      
or even through the Stagiaire?  

456
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:37,422
What reason would I ever have   
for discussing something        
like that with YOU?             

457
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,825
You're pathetic.                
[SOMA] Huh? What's that?        

458
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:42,293
Soma! You're being too          
forceful with her!              

459
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,297
[ANNOUNCER]                     
The theme ingredient is salmon! 

460
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:47,633
Oh, that's some good salmon.    

461
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:49,968
The color and the luster        
are first-rate.                 

462
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,169
So fish?                        

463
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:53,572
C'mon Ryo!                      
Just concentrate and do it!     

464
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,776
[ANNOUNCER]                     
It's Rentaro Kusunoki           
versus Ryo Kurokiba!            

465
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,911
This friggin' Food War battle...

466
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,847
starts NOW!
