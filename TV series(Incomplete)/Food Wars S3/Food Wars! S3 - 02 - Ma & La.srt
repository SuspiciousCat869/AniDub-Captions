00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:04,669
[MITSURU] Just in folks:        
the Lunar Feast guidebook!      

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,872
Brand new and hot off           
the presses.                    

3
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,640
Come and get yours today!       

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,476
Here!                           

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,344
[MALE STUDENT A]                
Hey... Look at this!            

6
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,813
[MALE STUDENT B]                
Soma Yukihira? For real?!       

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,748
<i> Chef Yukihira...</i>               

8
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,884
<i> I did exactly what</i>             
<i> you asked of me,</i>               

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,554
<i> I put the write-up about</i>       
<i> your stall just where</i>          
<i> you wanted it...</i>               

10
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,356
<i> next to the one</i>                
<i> about China Society!</i>           

11
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,692
His stall is right next         
to China-Soc?                   

12
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:30,095
AND he's doing Chinese cuisine, 
as well?!                       

13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,031
He even placed his advertising  
right next to theirs.           

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,167
That boy's a firecracker,       
I tell ya.                      

15
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,770
I had a feeling he would try    
to pick a fight with one of     
the Ten, but...                 

16
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,907
I never thought he would go     
after one of them head-on       
like this.                      

17
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,177
[TAKUMI]Soma Yukihira,          
you're something else.          

18
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,180
You're antics never fail        
to get me all fired up!!        

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,449
Watch it, Takumi, you're        
wrinkling the guidebook.        

20
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,583
Oh, sorry.                      

21
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,785
That's notfair!                 

22
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,719
He's getting all the attention! 
Ah!                             

23
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,321
[delighted laughter]            

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,325
Soma, that "Whatever" look on   
your face is priceless!         

25
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:04,196
Here's to hoping you don't      
come to regret the choices      
you'vet made. [chuckle]         

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,699
[music playing]                 

27
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,723
[SOMA] "You know that           
if sales are in the red,        

28
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,591
you'll be kicked out of school."

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,992
It sure threw me for a loop     

30
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,729
when Erina came at me           
with that little gem.           

31
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,332
But there's no way              
I'll end up in the red.         

32
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,536
I mean, this monster draws      
500,000 people in five days,    
right?                          

33
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,805
Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.   
[LION] (roar)                   

34
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,607
[IKUMI] You know, you're not    
doing yourself any favors       

35
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,609
by putting your stall right next
to your fiercest competitor!    

36
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:25,944
What're you thinking?!          

37
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,479
[air-headed laugh]              

38
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,614
Yeah,                           
it'll work out in the end.      

39
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,550
You're going to act like        
this challenge is nothing!      

40
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,019
I mean, I bet you don't even    
have a plan in mind, do you?!   

41
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,088
[GUY] Excuse me.                
[IKUMI] (huh?)                  

42
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,289
Pardon, Ms. Ikumi?              

43
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,224
Can we look at your forms,      
please?                         

44
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,827
Sure thing.                     
Just hang on a second.          

45
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,330
[FEMALE STUDENT] Chef Ikumi     
is the absolute coolest!        

46
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,767
Whoa, Bowl-Soc sure has grown,  
hasn't it?                      

47
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,436
For sure. We've been            
flooded with applications       

48
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,172
from the Junior High Division.  

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,973
It's getting absurd.            

50
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,709
Ol' Meat-Meat has gotten        
even MORE popular.              

51
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:01,547
And she won that Food War       
against Nao Sadatsuka           
like it was nothing!            

52
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,916
So hey, Soma...                 
[SOMA] (hmm?)                   

53
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,186
I'm like really sorry, I would  
have loved to help you out      

54
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,121
with your stall and everything, 

55
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,257
but I kinda have to look out for
all these newbies nowadays.     

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,126
So, I'm sorry.                  

57
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,794
What are you talking about?     

58
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,331
I'M the one who said to give    
Bowl-Soc your all.              

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,002
Great! But let us know if you   
run into any trouble, okay?     

60
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,136
Cool.                           

61
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,871
Yeah, we're ready to help out!  

62
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,673
I mean, after all,              
you and Megumi...               

63
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,343
you'll always be honorary       
members of Bowl-Soc!            

64
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,778
<i> We are?</i>                        

65
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,148
Well, I guess the only          
thing to do is just do it.      

66
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,218
[ERINA]                         
What is this nonsense, Alice?!  

67
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,686
You don't have to get           
all pissy about it.             

68
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,423
The deadline for the Lunar Feast
has long since passed.          

69
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,826
It's way too late for you       
to just say you want            
to run a shop NOW.              

70
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,363
I may be on the Council of Ten, 
but there's nothing I can do.   

71
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,432
I doubt it.                     
For instance,                   

72
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,368
you could just take someone's   
spot by declaring a Food War.   

73
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,903
Among other ways.               

74
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,105
You were the one who decided    
to sit out last year!           

75
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,108
Hey! Whatcha fighting about,    
Nakiri girls?                   

76
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,576
Oh, hey there, Soma.            

77
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,244
It's none of your business!     

78
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,246
Ms. Erina!                      

79
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,249
Traffic is so bad now           
that the interior               
construction workers            

80
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,785
are running about an hour late. 

81
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,519
Well, I suppose it              
can't be helped then.           

82
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,122
[SOMA] Hey, you guys free?      
[ERINA] Huh?                    

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,659
I was thinking of making some   
food that we used to            
serve back home.                

84
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,527
Mind doing a little taste test? 

85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,597
What?! Why would I ever do      
something like to help you?!    

86
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,732
You can have just one hour,     
Soma.                           

87
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,735
Ms. Erina is very busy today.   
[ERINA] (gasp)

<i> you doing to me?!</i>              

89
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,338
Go ahead and count me in too.   

90
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,673
Thank you!

[sizzling]                      

92
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,747
I chopped you up some           
spring onions.                  

93
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,949
But that's all the help         
you're going to get.            

94
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,283
Cool, thanks a lot.             

95

<i> been warming up</i>                

96
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,788
<i> to Soma Yukihira recently.</i>     

97
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,624
[ahem!] Hisako...               

98
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,026
Ma'am?                          

99
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,762
Oh no, it's nothing.            
Never mind.                     

100
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,099
[SOMA] This is Yukihira-style   
Mapo Tofu Set Lunch!            

101
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,768
Go on, eat up!                  

102
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,371
To sit here and look at, it just
seems like the standard fare    

103
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,307
from some local eatery          
doesn't it, Ms. Erina?          

104
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,918
Yes, it's not bad.              

105
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,653
So spicy!                       

106
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,856
[ERINA] However, this isn't good
enough to beat Chef Kuga.       

107
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,658
The reason being...             

108
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,561
There is far too little         
ma and la in this.              

109
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,197
Did you say "Mandala"?          

110
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,999
What the heck are               
you talking about?              

111
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,867
You're so dumb,                 
you should be ashamed!          

112
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,936
Listen, in Chinese cuisine,     

113
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,205
there are two main "pillars"    
of spiciness.                   

114
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,807
Red peppers impart              
the la flavor,                  

115
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,009
a spiciness that                
burns the tongue.               

116
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:47,278
While Sichuan peppers give      
a numbing heat called ma flavor.

117
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,348
Combining the two flavors of    
the peppers is what creates     
"ma la flavor."                 

118
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,751
[uh...]                         
<i> Sichuan peppers...</i>             

119
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,421
<i> Like that spice mix</i>            
<i> Meat-Meat used during</i>          
<i> the prelim Selection.</i>          

120
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,158
Honestly, when one mentions     
"Chinese cuisine,"              

121
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,159
it covers a wide range          
of culturals.                   

122
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,563
[ERINA] The varying climates    
and customs of mainland China   

123
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,433
gave rise to a wide variety     
of cooking styles,              

124
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:10,435
called the Eight Great Cuisines.

125
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,306
Out of these, the Sichuan       
cooking that Chef Kuga          
specializes in                  

126
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,175
is known for its                
ma la flavor.                   

127
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,776
Totally rad!                    
[ERINA]<i> Oh, no!</i>                 

128
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,045
<i> I just gave him information</i>    
<i> he can use!</i>                    

129
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,714
Man, that made things           
nice and clear.                 

130
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,583
Sorry to make you explain       
all that to me.                 

131
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,251
No! Strike it from memory!      

132
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,186
Forget everything               
you have just heard!            

133
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,388
That's impossible!              

134
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,522
Impossible.                     

135
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,324
Ms. Erina, that's not possible. 

136
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,126
[gah!]                          

137
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:38,997
Okay... I remember is that      
China-Soc's mapo tofu           
is super spicy,                 

138
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:43,268
but the way Chef Kuga is able to
use all that ma la flavor       
leaves you wanting more.        

139
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,603
That's correct.                 

140
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,538
He's also a master of           
cooking techniques.             

141
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,674
but I would hazard to say       
that there's another reason     

142
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,011
for that spiciness              
being so addictive.             
[SOMA] Huh?                     

143
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,414
[ALICE]                         
Physiologically speaking,       
"spiciness" isn't a taste,      

144
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:58,216
it's more of a sensation...     
of pain.                        

145
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,219
Wait, what? So you're telling me
it's about pain?                

146
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:06,158
Yep! Spiciness is different     
from sweetness, bitterness,     
sourness, and saltiness,        

147
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,093
which are picked up by          
taste receptors.                

148
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,963
Instead, it's felt through what 
are called vanilloid receptors. 

149
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,031
To put it another way,          
extreme spiciness               

150
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,435
causes adrenaline and beta      
endorphins to be released       
within the brain.               

151
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:20,171
These are what cause one to     
transmit feelings of            
excitement or euphoria.         

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,442
It's why people can crave       
spicy foods and eat             
peppers straight.               

153
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,312
That's right! It's a phenomenon 
that's unique only to spiciness.

154
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,047
And in medicinal cooking,       

155
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,117
spicy foods are said to help    
aid in the digestive process,   

156
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,787
as well as relieve people       
from the burden of stress.      

157
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,255
I think I get it...             

158
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,725
This what makes someone who     
can manipulate it at will       

159
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,326
so formidable.                  

160
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,729
Kuga once put it like this...   

161
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,797
There comes a moment            
in my cooking,                  

162
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,667
where everyone breaks into      
a sweat and turns bright red.   

163
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,735
And yet, they keep on           
eating like crazy.              

164
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,938
Seeing that is the              
ultimate feeling for me.        

165
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:56,074
Using my food to make people    
gasp and cry out in pain        

166
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,011
is almost more fun than         
any one human can stand!        

167
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,946
I sort of get where             
Kuga's coming from.             

168
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,482
I've cooked food that was so    
good it made people laugh,      

169
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:06,685
and so disgusting that it made  
them wanna pass out and die.    

170
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,021
Both were a lot of fun for me!  
Good times!                     

171
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,423
<i> This guy has</i>                   
<i> a screw loose as well.</i>         

172
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,293
Anyway, you need flavor         
paired with incredible          
intense spice.                  

173
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,362
It has to bring people          
down to their knees.            

174
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,698
And Chef Kuga is a master at it.

175
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,835
That's how he rose through the  
ranks and made it to the Ten.   

176
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,570
He combines the powerful heat   
of Sichuan cooking              

177
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,972
with multiple layers of flavor. 

178
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,908
Unless you have a way           
of combating that,              

179
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,378
you don't stand                 
a chance against him!           

180
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,780
[MEGUMI] Oh, really?            

181
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,383
Erina said all that             
about your cooking?             

182
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,787
Is your mapo tofu really so bad?

183
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,188
I can't imagine that.           

184
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,457
It's not that it's really "bad,"
per se, but...                  

185
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:49,394
Yeah, this dish won't be enough 
against that Sichuan cooking    
he's has mastered.              

186
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,666
It's kind of like when I was    
going up against Mimasaka       
in the beef stew battle.        

187
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,335
I guess this was just a         
trial dish.                     

188
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,338
I need to learn more about      
that spiciness from             
the ground up,                  

189
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,675
till I find something that      
can actually win.               

190
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,076
[MEGUMI] Oh! You know what?     

191
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,011
I thought these might be        
somewhat useful,                

192
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,280
so I brought you some Chinese   
recipes and stuff.              

193
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,016
You did? But didn't Isshiki     
ask you to run the stall        

194
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,350
with him and the                
rest of the gang?               

195
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,486
He wants you with Kyokusei Dorm,
doesn't he?                     

196
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,688
[MEGUMI] Yeah! I was            
also asked to do one            

197
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,491
with the Regional Cuisine       
Research Society, as well.      

198
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,894
But I kinda already turned      
both of them down.              

199
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,762
What? But why?                  

200
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,363
Wha? Because, I figured you were

201
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,266
probably going to be            
shorthanded, you know.          

202
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,903
[AH!] Sure, I'll probably get in
the way a little here and there.

203
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,173
But, you know, I, uh, I do      
have some experience!           

204
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,575
I've helped with service        
at the family inn from          
time to time,                   

205
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,445
and I learned a bit at          
the Stagiaire too,              
so I'm not entirely uncertain   

206
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,246
I wouldn't be of some           
help to you in the kitchen!     

207
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,448
I mean, I'm sure there's        
something I could do!           

208
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,719
So, I could lend you a hand at  
your stall, if you want me to.  

209
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,388
You know what? If that's all    
right with you, Soma.           

210
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,791
Megumi...                       

211
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,393
That would be totally awesome!  

212
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:55,794
[happy exhale]                  

213
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,997
Okay! Whaddya say we make       
something great?!               

214
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,165
Yeah!                           

215
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,067
[ALICE] Akira?                  

216
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,070
Might I intrude?                

217
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,605
What are you doing here?        

218
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,407
I come with a message.          

219
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,409
I, Alice Nakiri, will be        
making my long-awaited debut    

220
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,678
in the ever popluar             
upcoming Lunar Feast!           

221
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm very proud of you.          

222
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,683
The thing is, they're not       
taking in any more applications 

223
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,084
at the moment.                  

224
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,087
So, let's team up and           
do our best, okay?              

225
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:25,724
The three of us can use the     
Shiomi Seminar's location       
and work together!              

226
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,162
Professor Shiomi's already      
given me her permission!        

227
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,897
HUH?!                           

228
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,431
[ALICE]                         
The thing is, Professor...      

229
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,833
Your wonderful seminar group    

230
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,235
can keep doing this sort        
of thing indefinitely,          

231
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,038
but for me, it's a              
once-in-a-lifetime chance       

232
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,306
to take part in the             
1st-years' festival.            

233
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,108
Once-in-a-lifetime?             

234
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:44,776
Yes, you heard it correct.      

235
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,779
All the two of us ever wanted   
was to be teamed up again.      

236
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,383
To be able to cook side by side 
with our dear friend, Akira.    

237
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,651
Right, Ryo dear?                

238
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:53,785
What was that?                  

239
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,587
He's a "dear friend" of yours?  

240
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,922
I'm so happy.                   

241
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,191
Akira made friends in           
the same school year?!          

242
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,561
If you don't mind, would you    
sign this form for us?          

243
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,130
Dammit, Jun!                    

244
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,998
I'm assuming you know           
what this means.                

245
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,668
Oh, and of course, I will need  
to be the team leader.          

246
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,137
Like I would ever let you       
tell me what to do!             

247
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,807
Come on, Ryo, you gotta         
say something to her!           

248
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,409
Once she's already              
made up her mind like this,     

249
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,011
it's near impossible            
to stop her.                    

250
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,012
Are you kidding me?!            
Where's your spine?!            

251
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:24,483
Now just you wait and see,      
Soma! And you too, Erina!       

252
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,219
This school festival won't have 
any idea what hit it!           

253
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,554
Okay, just so you know,         

254
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,688
my spot is in the area          
off the main road.              

255
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,425
Soma and Erina will be          
someplace else entirely!        

256
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,260
Oh! Well, this is bad.          

257
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,230
[whoosh! sizzle]                

258
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,833
<i> [SOMA] First, we fry minced</i>    
<i> pork over a high flame.</i>        

259
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:44,236
<i> Boil silken tofu for</i>           
<i> two minutes and strain it.</i>     

260
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:47,172
<i> Once the pork has become</i>       
<i> aromatic and slightly crisp,</i>   

261
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,907
<i> it's time for the spice!</i>       

262
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,642
<i> To a soup of chicken broth,</i>    

263
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,312
<i> add sweet bean sauce, chili</i>    
<i> bean sauce, black bean paste,</i>  

264
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,281
<i> garlic, and chili powder.</i>      

265
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:58,983
Well?                           

266
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,585
Nah, that's not it.             

267
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,856
It's nowhere even close to      
the spiciness of China-Soc.     

268
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,327
[SOMA] (urk!) That is SPICY!    

269
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,529
But it's still not enough.      
I need more heat!               

270
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,464
Gotta keep going! [gah!]        

271
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,866
Gotta push through it!          
[yeow!]                         

272
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,735
All done, Megumi.               

273
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,838
It's an ultra-spicy mapo tofu!  
[MEGUMI] (frightened whimper)   

274
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,140
Huh?                            

275
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:22,607
Go on, try a bite.              

276
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,643
[MEGUMI]                        
Your lips are already swollen!  

277
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,952
<screams>                       

278
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,088
Sh-sh... shpicy!                

279
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,690
That's spicy as hell, isn't it? 

280
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,761
Well, why dont we go ahead      
and try out some other          
Chinese dishes.                 

281
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,029
Twice-cooked pork...            

282
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,630
and pepper steak!               

283
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,898
[frightened whimpering]         

284
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,634
Oh, yeah, sorry, Megumi.        

285
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,702
You can take a little break     
if you need one.                

286
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,839
No, I have to taste-test these! 

287
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,241
[ow, ow, ow!]                   

288
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:57,909
I did it...                     

289
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,579
I really did it!                
I ate it, didn't I?             

290
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:04,383
It's like I get it,             
but I'm still nowhere close.    

291
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:06,919
It's spicy,                     
but that's all it is.           

292
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,186
[waah!]                         

293
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,456
Once you get past               
all the spiciness,              

294
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,791
China Soc's dish has            
something more to it.           

295
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,526
It has a depth of flavor.       

296
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,995
[frantic gulping]               

297
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,933
Oh, you know what, Soma,        
I heard something from          
Hojo earlier.                   

298
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:24,269
For their restaurant,           
China-Soc will be using         
chili bean paste,               

299
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:26,939
also sweet bean paste,          
douchi, and oyster sauce.       

300
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,408
But it's not just about         
the ingredients.                

301
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,210
It's the fact everything        
will be made special            

302
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,012
by Chef Kuga himself.           
[SOMA] "Special"?               

303
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,882
[MEGUMI] I think that's why,    
even though their food is spicy,

304
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,951
it still has lots of flavor.    

305
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,418
Oh I get it...                  

306
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,422
<i> These may be staples of</i>        
<i> Sichuan cuisine,</i>               

307
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:46,625
<i> but they've been infused with</i>  
<i> Chef Kuga's conviction.</i>        

308
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,961
<i> You can almost see the face of</i> 
<i> the chef when you taste it!</i>    

309
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:52,064
<i> Spice is the key.</i>              

310
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,046
[MEGUMI] (woow!                 

311
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,849
That's right! We're doing a meat
and potato hotpot party!        

312
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,918
Isn't that super?!              

313
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:15,587
And we'll be using              
other vegetables from           
Isshiki Farms too!              

314
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,790
The signboard sure came out     
great didn't it?                

315
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:19,792
I designed that sucker          
all by myself!                  

316
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:22,193
And we were the dudes           
that put it together!           

317
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,864
But still, is it okay for you   
to put up a tent in             
the mountain area?              

318
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,800
We were going for something that
would be simple and intimate.   

319
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,269
And we've already gotten        
a ton of reservations           

320
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:35,007
from all the elderly madams     
that participate in             
Isshiki's cooking class.        

321
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,875
Yeah, I bet, but still...       

322
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,944
Isshiki,                        
what's with that outfit?        

323
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,546
[SATOSHI[ (laughs)              

324
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,747
One normally has a hotpot       
party by the riverbank,         

325
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,550
so I was thinking...            

326
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,418
we could put one right here!    

327
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,620
<i> [SOMA] He's going to</i>           
<i> dig a whole river?!</i>            

328
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,355
[DUDE] Hey, we're out of paint! 

329
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,023
 GUY] Would one of              
you guys lend me a hand?        

330
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:53,892
Wow, things are                 
really coming along.            

331
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,761
It's going to be busy           
after school like this          

332
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,429
every day until the festival.   

333
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,897
It sure is exciting, huh?       

334
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,499
[ISAMI] Megumi!                 

335
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,368
Soma!                           

336
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,769
[MEGUMI] Isami!                 

337
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,438
A branch location of            
"Trattoria Aldini"?             

338
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:07,639
Wow...                          

339
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:08,840
You runnin' it with Takumi?     

340
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,575
Yeah, and the whole class       
is in on it.                    

341
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,644
[TAKUMI] Soma Yukihira!         

342
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,780
It seems you've decided         
to challenge Chef Kuga.         
[GIRLS] (oohs and aahs)         

343
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,382
[SOMA] Yep.                     
[TAKUMI]                        
I'll say this right off the bat:

344
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:20,919
You're not the only one         
who's grown since we            
came back from the Stagiaire.   

345
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,588
You'll find that I've changed   
since the Selection.            

346
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,724
And I will be the one to        
take you out- (woah!)           

347
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,726
[ISAMI] It's time to go         
shopping, Big Brother.          

348
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,328
You hear me, Soma Yukihira?!    
[SOMA] (uh...)                  

349
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:31,663
[AKIRA] Enough of your nonsense!

350
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:33,398
The menu's already              
been decided!                   

351
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,401
[ALICE] But WHY? It doesn't have
to be just curry, right?        

352
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,205
We're inviting heads of         
businesses that are here to     
fund the Shiomi Seminar Group!  

353
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,607
I won't let you screw things up!

354
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,408
Then, there's no point in me    
even participating,             

355
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,743
now is there?! [gah!]           

356
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,679
Here's what Professor Shiomi    
had to say...                   

357
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:50,348
Don't you worry, I'll find a way
to accommodate our sponsors     
somehow.                        

358
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,886
Do your best as you bloom       
into youth, Akira!              
[AKIRA] Oh god...               

359
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,220
And besides, Professor Shiomi   
herself told me...              

360
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,888
[SOMA] Those three              
sure are something...           

361
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,824
[MEGUMI] I wonder if they'll    
be able to work together!       

362
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:00,825
[SOMA] Say what you will:       

363
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,628
This is the prime of our lives! 

364
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,963
[MEGUMI] Yep! It's like we have 
the wind at our backs!          

365
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,167
[whip crack] All right, all     
right, move it, move it!        

366
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:11,170
<i> [SOMA] Man, look at</i>            
<i> these poor suckers.</i>            
[KUGA] One, two, one, two...    

367
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,504
Oh! Hey, Soma.                  

368
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:15,174
'Sup, dude? So, all this        
is to make your shop?           

369
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,175
[KUGA] Yeah, and it's           
a lot of work!                  

370
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,777
My place will be a big one,     

371
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:21,313
since APPEARANCE is just as     
important as well, right?       

372
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,382
At a glance,                    
it looks kinda cruel.           

373
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,585
No! It's good!                  
We are enjoying ourselves here! 

374
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,253
[SOMA]                          
Well, that's what counts.       

375
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,789
And yet, if we don't turn a     
profit, we'll be expelled!      

376
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,526
What a shame that Soma,         
the young little genius,        
will have to leave the academy! 

377
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,462
I simply can't take it anymore! 

378
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:39,064
There's no way that's what      
you're thinking right now.      

379
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:43,201
Well then, do your best not     
to get kicked out of            
the academy, okay?              

380
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,070
Now then! One, two! One, two... 

381
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,940
So "appearance is just as       
important as well," is it?      

382
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:51,810
Wait, come to think of it,      
that's what my dad              
used to do too.                 

383
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,946
That's how we got more          
customers at the festivals.     

384
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,215
[SOMA (realization!)            
[MEGUMI] (Huh?)                 

385
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,950
Oh, yeah, it's just             
like Alice said:                

386
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,620
Chinese food's more             
than just Sichuan.              

387
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,755
Could that be what she meant?   

388
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:06,891
Megumi, there's something       
I would really like             
your help with.                 

389
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,360
Do you mind?                    

390
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,062
Whadda' you need?               

391
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,033
This it?                        
Is this what Soma was after?    

392
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:19,170
Mmm! Yes! Are you sure          
it's all right?                 
You don't mind if we use it?    

393
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:23,575
Yeah, we've already gotten      
the okay from the head of the   
Chinese Cuisine Department.     

394
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:24,910
What'd I tell you?              

395
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,713
If you ever need anything,      
you just ask me.                

396
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,314
Thank you so much!              

397
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,450
I really wish I could help      
you with running your stall,    

398
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,386
but I've already committed      
to helping someone else         
with theirs.                    

399
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,922
Not at all!                     
You've already done so much.    

400
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:40,726
Also, you have your family      
restaurant that you need        
to look after, don't you?       

401
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:43,595
Yeah, it's day by day,          
but recently,                   

402
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:46,931
I feel the restaurant staff has 
started to open up to me.       

403
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,401
I hope that someday real soon,  

404
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,004
I will be a chef                
as reliable as you are.         

405
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,738
[embarrassed] Oh, come on!      

406
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,807
Megumi! You having any luck?    

407
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:58,544
Soma! We got it!                
No problem!                     

408
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,679
[laugh]                         
Thank you for this, Hojo!       

409
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:04,216
Sure thing. Now go out there    
and show Kuga what's what.      

410
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,417
Kick his ass!                   

411
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:06,785
[SOMA] Yeah!                    

412
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:08,887
Hey, Dad!                       

413
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,555
What is this?                   
It's weird.                     

414
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,758
It's a kiln I borrowed          
from a friend.                  

415
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:16,295
Just doing yakisoba every year  
gets kinda old.                 

416
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:18,563
With this little baby           
right here,                     

417
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:22,301
we'll be the festival's top     
earners AGAIN this year!        
[SOMA] Wow...                   

418
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,503
This is what we need to         
get things started.             

419
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,772
If we want to make it           
right, that is.                 

420
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,711
[URARA] Now on sale:            
500-yen "Pickled Plum" tickets,

00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:40,452

423
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,455
[YUME] They're also used        
as proof of how much            
each stall sells,

So try not to get lost          
on the way! [Tee-hee!]          

427
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,334
[ALICE] Soma Yukihira, Erina... 
[SOMA] Wha...                   

428
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,403
It seems the day                
has finally come.               

429
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,672
Your preparations are in order, 
I presume?                      

430
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,808
Yeah, I guess they're in order. 

431
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,210
Oh? Good for you.               
But it's a real crying shame    

432
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,612
that we're not going to be      
in the same area as you.        

433
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,948
Although, we'll be running      
the show from the main area,    

434
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,483
so you don't need to            
worry about us.                 

435
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,019
The two behind you seem         
to be pretty drained.           

436
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,822
Are you sure you'll be          
able to pull it off?            

437
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,957
Well, of course we'll be fine!  

438
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,294
And you do your best out there, 
and don't let anyone beat you,  
okay?                           

439
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:25,998
Oh! Well, well,                 
speak of the devil.             
[SOMA] (huh?)                   

440
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:30,235
[SOMA] (grr...)                 
[KUGA] (hmpf!)                  

441
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:35,306
[URARA] And now, we'll kick     
things off with Tohtsuki        
Academy's school song!          

442
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:38,376
School song?                    
Oh, yeah, we do have one, huh?  
[piano music playing]           

443
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,845
Hey, uh, Megumi...              

444
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:47,586
[singing] At the bosom of the   
Land of the Rising Sun          

445
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:55,660
High spirits gather             
alongside fangs                 

446
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,932
Gaze upward at the bounty       
of the harvest                  

447
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,735
And lift up your voices, aah!   

448
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:11,543
Refine (refine),                
O sacred land of haute cuisine  

449
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:19,918
Totsuki Academy is here         
[singing ends]                  

450
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,621
Tsukasa...                      

451
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,023
make sure to honor              
what you said before.           

452
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,625
Your promise...                 

453
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,562
The time has now come!          

454
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,566
[SENZAEMON]                     
I formally announce...          

455
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,302
the commencement                
of the Lunar Festival!          

456
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,037
Enjoy the feast!                

457
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:41,674
[wild cheers and applause]      

458
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,776
[pleased] Uh-hmmm!              

459
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,979
This turned out quite well,     
if I do say so myself!          

460
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:48,914
[MEMBER A] Indeed!              
[MEMBER B] By comparison,       

461
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:51,917
just look at Soma Yukihira's    
pathetic setup.                 

462
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,787
[MEMBER A] He seriously         
wants to challenge us with      
that rickety old stall?!        

463
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,790
[chuckles]                      
[music begins]                  

464
00:20:57,992 --> 00:20:59,992
All right now! This here...     

465
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,895
is the first thing I'll use     
to beat China-Soc.              

466
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,431
Hujiao bing!                    

467
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,451
[MEGUMI] Hot, fresh hujiao bing!

468
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:02,387
Who wants some hujiao bing?     

469
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,322
[WOMAN A] Huh? Hujiao bing?     

470
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:05,723
I think I've heard of that!     

471
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:07,859
It's famous at Taiwanese        
food stalls, right?             

472
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,928
[WOMAN B] Wow, look at that!    

473
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,664
They're stuck there right on    
the inside of the oven!         

474
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,133
What do you think's inside?     

475
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:16,334
Inside the buns you will find   
that the meat patties           

476
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:19,137
are made of coarse-ground pork  
with lots of black pepper.      

477
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:20,805
Wow, I wanna try one!           

478
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,875
And me too!                     
Can I get two of those, please? 

479
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:24,676
Thank you so much               
for trying them!                

480
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,277
Thank you very much!            

481
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,946
