1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:06,005
[ANNOUNCER] It's Rentaro        
Kusunoki versus Ryo Kurokiba!   

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,007
This friggin' Food War battle...

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,908
Starts NOW!                     

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,946
Amazing!                        
He cut that salmon in no time!  

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,216
He sliced it so dramatically,   
but it turned out so refined.   

6
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:20,019
How exciting, Ryo has           
developed even better skills    

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,421
than when he battled me         
at the Selection!               

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,190
[shudder]                       

9
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,293
He's really great too!          

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,029
His knife-work looks to be      
about on par with Ryo's.        

11
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,432
He's in Central.                
What do you expect?             

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,035
Of course, all those guys       
are going to be top-level chefs.

13
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,238
So, what do you think of the    
skills of your superior?        

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,907
Are you regretting your decision
to challenge me?                

15
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,476
Aww... No one likes a killjoy.  

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,112
Oh? What is this?               

17
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,114
It's rice!                      
[KUSUNOKI] (huh?)               

18
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:53,118
[OIZUMI]                        
Plus, he has two varieties.     
And what's in that bowl?        

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,586
It's bread dough!               

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,789
What does young Ryo             
intend to make for us?!         

21
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,991
[RYO]                           
What I'm gonna make now is...   

22
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,193
the absolute BEST fish dish!    

23
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,596
You cannot lose. Got it Ryo?    

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,665
What do you think now, Central?!

25
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,934
You stand there lookin'         
self-satisfied,                 

26
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,737
but you're just a poor man's    
version of ME!                  
[KUSUNOKI] (huh?)               

27
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,872
Come at me with                 
everything you've got,          

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,673
you pretentious "elite" bastard!

29
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,211
What's your problem? You looking
for an excuse to lose?!         

30
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,480
Soma and Takumi talked a whole  
lot of smack as well,           

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,818
but you have a knack for        
infuriating people, don't you?  

32
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,619
But rest easy,                  

33
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,024
for I already decided to show   
you the full extent of my skill.

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,527
And I'll even show you my cute  
little friends, while I'm at it.

35
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,363
What's that?                    
[ALICE] (small gasp)            

36
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,500
Take a look,                    
you pansy-ass of a chef.        

37
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,203
[music playing]                 

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,626
[student cheering]              

39
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,562
[ANNOUNCER B]                   
Thank you for participating.    

40
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,297
That concludes today's          
B Venue Food Wars.              

41
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,100
Central has won all matches.    

42
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,901
Hey dude, you record that?      

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,237
Yeah, man. Those were some      
awesome matches, bro.           

44
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:55,441
That's the No. 6 Seat,          
Nene Kinokuni.                  

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,643
[ZENJI] She's the next          
seat above Isshiki.             

46
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,113
They say she's the best chef    
among all the 2nd-years.        

47
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,717
[YUKI] No way!                  

48
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,319
So many clubs and seminars took 
the Food War challenge,         

49
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,921
and yet they still lost!        

50
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,856
To think, they didn't win       
a single one.                   

51
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:15,127
Damn! This is all going         
exactly the way Azami Nakiri    
wanted it to!                   

52
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,732
I've seen those things before.  

53
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,735
Alice Nakiri used them at       
the Selection finals.           

54
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,138
[ALICE]                         
It's a steam convection oven,   

55
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,939
and a cryogenic grinder.        

56
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,140
[THREE] (huh?)                  

57
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,010
But, Rentaro Kusunoki,          

58
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,279
will you be able to properly use
the very latest equipment?      

59
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,084
[KUSUNOKI] We've got a pretty   
good size crowd here today,     

60
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,286
so I hope you don't mind ...    

61
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,156
if I make you look bad          
to make me look good.           

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,891
"Steam convention"?             

63
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,893
Yeah,                           
it's a steam conVECtion oven.   

64
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,562
That's correct, Takumi.         
It uses an interior fan         

65
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,698
to evenly circulate the         
steam and heat.                 

66
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:56,034
Then the steam and heat are     
automatically and digitally     
controlled,                     

67
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:00,172
making it a revolutionary device
that let's you do all kinds     
of cooking with one unit.       

68
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,307
Also, it doesn't                
transfer any aromas,            

69
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,910
allowing you to cook different  
sorts of dishes all at once.    
[MOMO](grr...)                  

70
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,979
Oh,yeah?! That's cool!          

71
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,315
In the hands of the right chef, 
it's kind of a dream machine.   

72
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,517
But because there are           
so many different settings,     

73
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,253
it requires a deep understanding
of how it works.                
[MOMO] (grrr...)                

74
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,789
It's a device that will surely  
test your intelligence          

75
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,192
of ingredients and              
cooking methods.                

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,527
[SOMA]                          
Still, it's sort of unexpected. 

77
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,732
I mean, will that guy be        
able to properly use            
those types of things?          

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,002
Like, he's too hot-headed       
and always going off            
about something.                

79
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,537
Now, now Soma!                  

80
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,472
True, he doesn't seem           
to be that smart.               

81
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,474
I can't imagine that            
cutting-edge technologies       

82
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,742
are within his range.           
[MEGUMI] Not you too, Takumi?   

83
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,946
[MEA] (laughing)                
You just say it like it is, huh?

84
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,080
You guys are fun!               

85
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,349
[MEA] The thing is...           

86
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,617
If it bothers you that much,    
then watch.                     

87
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,922
You're about to be lucky enough 
to witness Reni's               
amazing cooking.                

88
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,491
[MEGUMI]                        
He's taken the fillets and...   

89
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,226
marinated them!                 

90
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,827
Those are long, thin cuts...    

91
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,696
[MEGUMI]                        
He's wrapped them in bacon!     

92
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,432
Doing that will make it fattier 
as well as saltier.             

93
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,135
[SOMA]                          
Oh! He's using the steam thingy!

94
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,238
For an internal temperature     
of 45 degrees,                  

95
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,775
I need to heat it at 60 degrees 
Celsius for 18 minutes.         

96
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,644
Reni is a specialist            
at gauging heat.                

97
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,314
As well as a master of          
low-temperature cooking.        

98
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,050
Now you just do your thing!     

99
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,718
Low-temperature cooking?        

100
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,053
As I'm sure you already know,   

101
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,988
when cooking,                   
the protein in fish and meat    

102
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,724
start to break down at about    
58 degrees Celsius.             

103
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,127
But when the temperature        
reaches 68 degrees,             

104
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,796
the flesh contracts even more   
and becomes stiff.              

105
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,332
So, if you cook                 
between 58-68 degrees,          

106
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,601
it doesn't put so much          
stress on the ingredients,      

107
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,138
which in turn, will then leave  
the flesh nice and tender.      

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,808
And that my friends,            
is the basic premise behind     
low-temperature cooking.        

109
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,077
[giggle] Exactamundo!           

110
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,813
The steam convection oven!      
Water baths!                    

111
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,549
Pass circulators!               
Gastro packs!                   

112
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,151
He's got it all.                

113
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,154
He's learned all of the latest  
in heating technologies!        

114
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,690
THAT is Reni,                   
Rentaro Kusunoki!               

115
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,360
[KUSUNOKI] Proper heating...    
if you can master it,           

116
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,696
you can compete in any field    
you ever dreamt of!             

117
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,296
Heat and flame...               

118
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,033
I shall reach the very pinnacle 
of these techniques!            

119
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,374
It looks like he's finally      
started to concentrate, huh?    

120
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,308
When it's time to heat          
the ingredients,                

121
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,645
he suddenly gets calm           
and composed.                   

122
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,380
It's like that                  
constant heat of his            

123
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,183
gets transferred to the food    
that he's preparing.            

124
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,718
[timer buzzes]                  

125
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,054
What the?!                      

126
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,789
Look how it glistens!           

127
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,860
It's completely different from  
when it was put in the oven!    

128
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,596
That really is quite beautiful. 

129
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,799
You can tell by looking at it,  
how tender it is!               

130
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,268
It has reached its              
peak tenderness,                

131
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,671
where a dull knife could        
slice through it as if          
it was warm butter.             

132
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
That looks so incredible.       

133
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,277
It's like his soul really has   
gone into his cooking.          

134
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:55,514
I'm shocked.                    
He's a great cook.              

135
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,483
[TAKUMI] The salamander.        

136
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,153
The salamander?                 
The heck is that?               

137
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:03,956
The name's super fun            
to say though!                  

138
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:08,493
[ALICE] It comes from a kind of 
fire lizard that appeared in    
medieval European folklore:     

139
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,029
the salamander.                 

140
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,830
That's the origin of the name.  

141
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,432
In cooking, it's a blanket term 

142
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,900
for an oven that heats from     
above rather than below.        

143
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,437
Oh, I get it.                   
I bet I could use that.         

144
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,838
[ALICE]                         
It's used to cook the surface,  

145
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,641
so as to give it                
more depth of flavor.           

146
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,078
He's now browning it            
because he's reached            
the final stage of his dish.    

147
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,316
[KUSUNOKI] Finished.            

148
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,185
I call this beauty,             
"Saumon confit flamme."         

149
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,122
"Flamme" if you don't know      
is French for "flame."          

150
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,125
Now then, enjoy the artistry    
that comes through fire.        

151
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,460
This is the dish                
that made him "chosen".         

152
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,530
It's the one that caught        
Central's attention             
in the first place.             

153
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,266
[KUSUNOKI] Oh, that's right.    

154
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,268
Chef Momo, would you please     
try my cooking as well?         

155
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:51,870
Why are you giving it to me?    

156
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,206
[KUSUNOKI] This plate contains  
a gimmick, if you will,         

157
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,141
something made using sweets.    

158
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,342
There's sweets?                 

159
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,411
I think you'll find             
that you like it.               

160
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,080
Is that supposed to be          
some sorta challenge?           

161
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,216
I'm very picky when             
it comes to sweets.             

162
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,152
[ANNOUNCER] Our first tasting is
Rentaro Kusunoki's offering.    

163
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,787
At last!                        

164
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,256
Oh...                           

165
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,425
It's sparkling!                 

166
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,294
And the delectable rich aroma   
of the roasted fats!            

167
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:22,167
True, the plating and aroma     
are nice, but what matters      
is TASTE.                       

168
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,905
[OIZUMI] (rising yell)          
[MOM] (delighted squeal)        

169
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:29,975
[ALL]<i> It is delicious!</i>          
[OIZUMI]<i> I'm dizzy!</i>             

170
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,243
The interior looks almost       
completely raw!                 

171
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,314
It has an incredibly            
mild flavor.                    
But then, the exterior!         

172
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,383
That's where the smoky,         
rich flavor from the            
salamander comes in!            

173
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,053
It shows off his mastery        
of the flame!                   

174
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,056
Yeah, well, it is pretty good.  

175
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,392
Let's try this garnish here...  

176
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,928
Okay, I see...                  

177
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,930
This garnish is actually        
salmon ice cream,               

178
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,265
and it was made without         
using any sugar.                

179
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,267
[MAN] What?!                    
Is that even possible?          

180
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,603
[WOMAN] Salmon ice cream?       

181
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,070
[MAN 2] How'd he do that?       

182
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,273
You used the cryogenic grinder, 
didn't you?                     

183
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,208
Very nicely done, Alice!        

184
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,411
I took the salmon paste I'd made
in the blender and froze it,    

185
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,614
then let it set in the          
cryogenic grinder,              

186
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,016
and since the blades move at    
extremely high speeds,          

187
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,352
it resulted in a fine,          
smooth ice cream.               

188
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,755
Once you allow your tongue to   
invite the chilling cold of     
the ice cream,                  

189
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,825
it makes the heat of the        
lightly cooked salmon           
stand out even more!            

190
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,161
[OIZUMI] The different          
temperatures elevate            
the presence of the salmon      

191
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,030
dancing on your taste buds.     

192
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,565
That's thermal sense!           

193
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,034
It's a technique that           
Alice Nakiri used as well,      

194
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,302
during the Selection.           

195
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,704
Temperature, flame,             
and correct timing.             

196
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,373
All these act together          
as my special "seasoning"!      

197
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,908
[MOMO]<i> It's true!</i>               

198
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,777
<i> The differing temperatures</i>     
<i> really draw out</i>                

199
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,646
<i> the flavor of the</i>              
<i> theme ingredient.</i>              

200
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,915
<i> It's like being in the middle</i>  
<i> of a cold, clear stream,</i>       

201
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,052
<i> and then suddenly the hot,</i>     
<i> tender salmon leaps out.</i>       

202
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:50,321
<i> My body...</i>                     
<i> It's getting so worked up!</i>     

203
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:53,926
<i> No! This unending</i>              
<i> onslaught of salmon...</i>         

204
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,095
<i> It's too much!</i>                 

205
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,897
[contented sigh]                

206
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,000
[MAN] Well, that settles it.    

207
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,735
[FEMALE] Looks like this match  
is going to Central again.      

208
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,204
Rentaro nailed it.              

209
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,205
Better not decide just yet...   

210
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,942
Till AFTER you've seen what     
I've just created.              

211
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,213
Feast your eyes on MY dish...   

212
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:15,881
Coulibiac!                      

213
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:18,951
He made a Coulibiac?            

214
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,758
[ERINA] It's so quiet.          

215
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,305
[HISAKO] If anyone can save     
Totsuki from the hand           
of Master Azami,                

216
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:44,243
HE would be the one capable     
of pulling it all off, right?   

217
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:49,148
[SATOSHI] Hey! Is anyone there? 

218
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,185
Oh! How're you doin', Erina?    
[ERINA] (urk!)                  

219
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:57,589
Do you perhaps know             
where everybody went?           
[ERINA] (screams)               

220
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,128
<i> I thought my heart was going</i>   
<i> to leap out of my chest!</i>       

221
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,130
[SATOSHI] Um, you okay?         

222
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,267
[SATOSHI] Oh,                   
everyone went to go watch?      

223
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:09,868
That should be fun.             

224
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,736
The Food War Alice              
is involved with                

225
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,205
should be going on right now.   

226
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,941
[ERINA] Huh? Alice? But why?    

227
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,811
Curious about how things        
are going out there?            

228
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,814
[OIZUMI] Coulibiac!             

229
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,149
Oh, yeah...                     

230
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,550
Now I see it.                   

231
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,419
So that's why he had bread      
dough at the ready.             

232
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,220
So what kind of dish is it?     

233
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,022
It's basically salmon,          
rice, and seasoning,            

234
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:33,225
all wrapped in brioche dough    
and then baked -                

235
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:38,830
a French adaptation of a dish   
popular in the royal courts     
of 19th century Russia.         

236
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,900
The filling uses mushrooms,     
shallots, and other vegetables, 

237
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,369
then takes all of that and      
combines it with grains.        

238
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,706
The two kinds of rice are       
butter rice and kasha,          

239
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,642
which is primarily eaten        
in the Eastern European region  

240
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,644
and is made of cooked buckwheat.

241
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,915
Oh! I can smell the richness of 
both the dough and the salmon!  

242
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,851
Just look how juicy it is!      

243
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,920
You can see the butter-rice     
mixed with the kasha            
and other ingredients!          

244
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:05,057
Quit yer yappin' and eat before 
it gets cold, you old farts.    

245
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,859
The salmon is gonna EXPLODE     
with so much flavor,            

246
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:11,597
your tongue won't be able to    
fight the delicious invader     
wrestling in your mouth!

You want to try it?             

257
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,966
I went up and grabbed some      
from Ryo.                       

258
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,834
No, I couldn't!

Y... oh, yes, please.

267
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,662
Yeah, thatta way to knock it    
to 'em, Ryo!                    

268
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:20,132
It's the perfect fusion of a    
dish from the royal courts      

269
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:25,604
and the skilled hand of a chef, 
who sharpened his fangs         
living in a port town.          

270
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,807
It feels as if it could have    
been made by both of them,      

271
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,476
as they've battled              
these many years.               

272
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,678
[MAN]                           
So, who's gonna be the winner?  
[students muttering]            

273
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:35,214
[MAN 2]                         
It has to be Rentaro, right?    

274
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,015
[WOMAN]                         
I'm thinking Ryo Kurokiba!      

275
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,119
[ANNOUNCER] And now, judgment!  

276
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,092
They... they're even.           
[BOTH] (huh?)                   

277
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,428
I can't say that one's          
any better than the other.      

278
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:53,165
All I can think is that BOTH    
of them have created the        
best possible salmon dish!      

279
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,968
No need to rush.                

280
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,904
If we just taste and compare,   
we'll know.                     

281
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,174
There must be a definitive      
gap between the two.            

282
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,043
A definitive gap? It looks like 
they both put out dishes        

283
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,778
that can't possibly be topped.  

284
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,314
Don't overlook the most         
important point:                

285
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,050
to place judgment on the        
umami of the salmon!            

286
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,920
It's also highly likely that    
both dishes have some kind      
of secret hidden in them.       

287
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:20,592
[giggle] That has to be why     
Renni decided to use the        
convection oven.                

288
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:23,696
I think the judges have         
already noticed it.             

289
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,665
[KUSUNOKI] Very observant, Mea. 

290
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,000
The answer is THIS.             

291
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,936
It looks like that              
might be olive oil.             

292
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,805
[MEGUMI] Ah!                    
[SOMA] Huh...                   

293
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,607
That would be the deciding      
difference between the          
two dishes:                     

294
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,410
the succulent amount of moisture
that the salmon retains.        

295
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,878
That's a good thought, Mea.     

296
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,080
When wrapping the salmon        
to cook it over low heat,       

297
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,484
I don't apply heat until after  
I've placed them in olive oil.  

298
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:49,888
Normally, even if you take      
the time to go about carefully  
wrapping the fish securely,     

299
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,958
the sheer weight of the dish    
itself applies pressure,        

300
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,095
which in turns can cause the    
fish to lose all of             
it's moisture.                  

301
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,297
That's where the                
olive oil comes in.             

302
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,899
The buoyancy of the fat         
allows you to apply heat        

303
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,368
without having to               
apply any pressure.             

304
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,504
Now, that's juicy.              

305
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,639
Yes! Yes, that's right!         

306
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,709
I mean when I was eating this   
dish, it just completely        
fell apart in my mouth.         

307
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:13,845
Despite how long it was cooked, 
it was surprisingly             
not dry at all!                 

308
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:18,851
All of it, from corner to       
corner, was just so juicy.      
It's lost no moisture!          

309
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,587
His handling of the ingredients 
may very well have exceeded that
of Ryo Kurokiba!                

310
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,389
It can't!                       
[SOMA] Incredible...            

311
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,659
But Ryo is a true expert at     
handling his seafood!           

312
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,462
You understand yet that6        
I'm on a whole different level? 

313
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,399
What was that, that thing       
you made in the finals          
for the Selection?              

314
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,402
Ah, that's right,               
it was called a cartoccio.      

315
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,738
For that,                       
as well as this coulibiac,      

316
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:42,274
you stuffed ingredients into    
something and cooked it.        

317
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:46,211
While you did manage to come    
up with a well-rounded          
and flavorful umami             

318
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,281
that's way too simplistic,      
if you ask me.                  

319
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,420
One must perfectly preserve     
the moisture of the ingredients 
while delicately applying heat. 

320
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,890
This truly is something you     
cannot ever hope to copy,       
the ELITE art of the flame!     

321
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,494
In this Food War,               
that vast difference is obvious!

322
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,630
Isn't that so, O judges?        

323
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:07,499
Sure enough,                    
you haven't grown at all        

324
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,234
since losing at the             
Fall Selection.                 

325
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,503
Using umami so bold             
and explosive                   

326
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,839
that it overwhelms a            
person's taste buds?            

327
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:17,776
Please, there are much more     
elegant approaches than         
resorting to such tactics.      

328
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,314
Still, I wouldn't mind          
if you came over and kept       
doing your thing, under ME.     

329
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:26,118
[SOMA] The thing is,            
the match isn't over yet.       
[MEA] (huh?)                    

330
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:29,721
I haven't tasted either         
one of their dishes,            
but even I get it.              

331
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,959
There's just one problem        
with what Chef Rentaro was      
saying about his dish.          

332
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,205
There is clearly one dish here  
that elevates the salmon,       

333
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:49,074
in both deliciousness           
and in the umami.               

334
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,943
And that dish belongs to...     
[MOMO] (mmm)                    

335
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,813
the Cutting-Edge challenger,    
Ryo Kurokiba!                   

336
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:56,014
What the?!                      

337
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,417
That's right.                   
There is no mistake.            

338
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:03,422
The dish that best expresses the
salmon is Ryo Kurokiba's!       
[SOMA  Yeah!                    

339
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,358
HUUUHH?! What is this?!         

340
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,893
What are you saying, old man?   

341
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,427
My heat was applied perfectly.  

342
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,164
How could it possibly be        
inferior to THAT?               

343
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,300
[RYO] Oh, whatever.             
Just shut up already.           

344
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,302
If you can't accept it,         
[KUSUNOKI] (grr...)             

345
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:18,971
then just try some!             

346
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,674
Eat my big tasty coulibiac!     

347
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,850
<i> Wh-what?!</i>                      
<i> The umami...</i>                   

348
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,052
<i> The umami of the salmon just</i>   
<i> keeps coming,</i>                  

349
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:38,257
<i> crashing into you</i>              
<i> like the raging rapids!</i>        

350
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:42,327
I don't understand how          
this is even a possibility!     
What is in there?               

351
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,397
There's some green layer wrapped
around the inside of the bread! 

352
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:48,066
Lemme tell you something,       
Central.                        

353
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:52,137
I've changed quite a bit        
since competing in              
the Selection.                  

354
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,808
That is a crepe lined           
with spinach!                   

355
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,809
A crepe?                        
[MEGUMI] Oh, that's it!         

356
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:00,612
That's what the soft,           
delicate bite was,              
it was spinach!                 

357
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,014
I knew it tasted like           
something familiar to me.       

358
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:06,485
It really brought out the umami 
of the fattiness of the tuna.   

359
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,421
Ah, man, that looks SUPER       
delish, all right!              

360
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,557
A layer of brioche and a        
layer of crepe,                 

361
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,691
that's truly incredible!        

362
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,359
But that can't be all!          

363
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,294
There must be                   
something else behind it.       

364
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,297
Something for the               
raging flood of umami!          

365
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:22,701
It was this:                    
the crepe was flavored          
with a special seasoning.       

366
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,369
Special seasoning?              

367
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,238
Yes, it's an original blend of  
his, a mixture of spices.       

368
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:31,777
This special seasoning has      
a mixture of thyme, oregano,    
garlic, and rock salt,          

369
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,913
as well as a little something   
called dried bacon powder!      

370
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,783
Bacon?!                         
But I used that in my dish!     

371
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:42,120
Ah! Strangely, both used bacon  
as a focal point in their dish. 

372
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,457
But the application was very    
different from each other.      

373
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,193
Rentaro wrapped his bacon       
around the salmon               

374
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:52,731
and then cooked it at low heat  
to bring out the flavor.        

375
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:57,803
Much like the standard broth    
of ramen, which combines        
pork bone and seafood,          

376
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:02,941
this allows the umami of both   
to fuse while not losing        
a drop of flavor.               

377
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,611
This dish perfectly preserves   
the deliciousness of the salmon.

378
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,213
But, wait!                      
If that's the case,             

379
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,148
what could have been wrong      
with Reni's plate?              

380
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:14,019
The answer to that              
is disproportion.               
[MEGUMI] What'd he say?         

381
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:17,555
You see, it has to do with the  
way the human tongue's arranged.

382
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,625
It tends to respond more        
to flavors that are             
disproportionate                

383
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,360
rather than those that          
are uniform.                    

384
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,097
It's like how a lot of people   
like milk in their coffee.      

385
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,298
Or how some like sesame seed    
oil in their ramen.             

386
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,902
It's basically the same         
principle of mixing flavors.    

387
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,573
Yeah, totally. Putting an egg   
in your rice and stirring it    
all up is pretty delicious.     

388
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,376
Then it's all up to you to add  
however much soy sauce          
you want in it.                 

389
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,780
That's exactly what I was after 
in making this.                 

390
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,916
I added just a small amount     
of the seasoning.               

391
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,920
So, there were bites where      
you taste the umami of          
the salmon as-is,               

392
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,256
and other parts where           
it tastes much richer           

393
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:54,393
because it was mixed with the   
flavor of the added bacon.      

394
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,661
That's why each time            
you take a bite,                

395
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,197
it just keeps hitting           
your tongue,                    

396
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,532
getting more and more           
delicious every time.           

397
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:04,402
It's like a constant barrage    
of the salmon's flavor          
knocking you down!              

398
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,806
That's a world of flavor your   
salmon would never even         
hope to reach                   

399
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,876
if all you ever expect to do    
is wrap it up in some bacon!    

400
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:14,346
At first, Rentaro looks         
to be more impressive,          

401
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:19,885
but the softness of Ryo's bread 
and the crepe elevates          
the umami to a new level,       

402
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,153
pushing the salmon              
to the front.                   

403
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,424
<i> He came up with the idea to</i>    
<i> add spice to make it</i>           
<i> non-uniform on purpose?</i>        

404
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:31,497
You should've been nothing      
more than some amateur to help  
me practice new techniques.     

405
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:35,367
There's no way you came up      
with something this refined     
at the Selection!               

406
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,368
You better believe it.          

407
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:39,905
[OWNER]                         
Hey! What are you doing?!       

408
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:43,909
I allowed you to come and       
be a member of my kitchen       
as part of your Stagiaire.      

409
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,578
You need to work much harder!   
[RYO] 'kay.                     

410
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:50,249
<i> Dammit! Of all things, it</i>      
<i> had to be a curry restaurant.</i>  

411
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:54,453
<i> And now, I can't help but think</i>
<i> of that guy's ugly smug face.</i>  

412
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,488
[RYO] I'm done.                 
Can you check it?               

413
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,857
No! Awful!                      

414
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,659
You know nothing of spices      
or depth of flavor.             

415
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:05,130
I was hoping for the student who
actually WON the Selection!     

416
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,399
He was wonderful at spices, yes?

417
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:09,001
Unlike yourself!                

418
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:12,871
Yeah.                           

419
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,340
How are you doing over there,   
Ryo?                            

420
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,541
Are things going well           
with your Stagiaire?            

421
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,677
[RYO] As well as expected.      

422
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:21,613
[ALICE]                         
You haven't lost your temper    
with the shop owner, have you?  

423
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,615
[RYO] (doh!) Not yet, no.       

424
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:27,085
It doesn't seem like this       
thing will ever end.            
It's taking forever.            

425
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:30,622
But we have to get over how     
we feel about losing            
at the Selection, don't we?     

426
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,490
Yes, you're right.              

427
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,894
<i> I'll do it. Watch me.</i>          
<i> As long as I'm here,</i>           

428
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:40,499
<i> I'll learn everything there</i>    
<i> is about how to use spice.</i>     
<i> I WILL make it mine!</i>           

429
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:46,105
[chuckles] So, it's NOT like    
you haven't changed since the   
Selection have you, eh, Ryo?    

430
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:49,040
[RYO] I'm not the same as       
I was back then.                

431
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,110
To me, your damn salmon is...   

432
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:55,447
no better than frozen!          
[KUNUSOKI] (screams)            

433
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:58,183
[OIZUMI]                        
Victory goes to Kurokiba!       

434
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:01,587
Ryo Kurokiba is the winner!     

435
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:03,756
