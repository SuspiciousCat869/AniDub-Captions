1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,408
[BOTH] It's delicious! [Aaahhh!]

2
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,944
[GUY A] Oh, this is Soma        
Yukihira's Place!               

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,880
[GUY B] That's the guy who      
made it into the finals in the  
Selection, right?               

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,615
[GUY A] That sure smells great! 

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,350
[GUY B]                         
That's Hujiao Bing, right?      

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,019
They're pipping hot             
and REALLY delicious!           

7
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,489
<i> Please! Come eat some!</i>         

8
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,025
[KUGA] "Taiwan specialty,       
hujiao bing," huh?              

9
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,629
Honestly, I think that was      
a good pretty strategy.         

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,765
While it's still Chinese        
cuisine, the same as mine,      

11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:38,037
it allows you to branch out and 
try to do something different   
from my Sichuan cooking.        

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,907
After all, the lively spiciness 
of the black pepper in          
the meat's juices               

13
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,975
will hold the eater captive.    

14
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,111
But all that deliciousness      
won't mean a thing              

15
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,713
if they don't actually get      
the chance to eat it.           

16
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,582
But I'm sure you know that.     

17
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,584
Things are much different here, 
Soma.                           

18
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,920
The Lunar Feast isn't           
like a Food War,                

19
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,791
where the judges are required   
to eat everything the chef      
places in front of them.        

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,860
[WOMAN A] Wow, what's that?     
This place looks super fancy!   

21
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:05,197
[WOMAN B] They say it's a       
Sichuan restaurant run by       
someone from the Ten!           

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,333
Someone from the Ten?           
Then that's where I wanna eat!  
[MEGUMI] (gasp)                 

23
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,070
Customers only want to visit    
restaurants run by someone      
of power.                       

24
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,839
I mean, can you blame them?     

25
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,577
[music playing]                 

26
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,671
[SATOSHI] Everyone!             
At last, it's the Lunar Feast!  

27
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,007
Let's make our customers        
extremely happy,                

28
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,676
while continuing to celebrate   
the spring of our youth!        

29
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,545
[GROUP] Yeah!                   
[IBUSAKI] Sounds good.          

30
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,215
Okay then, it's time.           
[HISAKO] Of course, Ms Erina.   

31
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,285
We're gonna use our premium     
bowls to kick those guys        
to the curb!                    

32
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,420
All right, people,              
let's kick some ass!            
[MEMBERS] Yes, Ma'am!           

33
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,424
Everyone, are you all ready?    

34
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:39,958
[GIRLS] Yes!                    

35
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,626
Then here we go!                

36
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,496
[ugh] What are we supposed to do
with all this turmeric?         

37
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,764
Serioulsy!                      

38
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,499
We only have two of             
these tomatoes left.            

39
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,434
Who ordered all this stuff?!    

40
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,437
Well, uh...                     

41
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,774
Say, do we have an outlet       
anywhere so I can plug in       
the centrifuge?                 

42
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,042
This is a nightmare...          

43
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,309
It's all too real.              

44
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,511
[sizzle!]                       

45
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,513
[MEMBERS] Hya! Hya! Hya!        

46
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,915
Now then, now then...           

47
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,919
Come be bewitched by the        
taste of Sichuan cooking!       

48
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,521
And the star of the show        
is my mapo tofu!                

49
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,056
Stir-fried water spinach!       

50
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,391
Chili oil dumplings!            

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,660
Mouthwatering chicken!          

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,865
[MAN] THAT'S SPICY!             
[WOMAN] Water! Water!           

53
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:23,134
And yet...                      
I cannot get enough of it!      

54
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,537
[MEGUMI] We have hujiao bing!   
[CROWD] (buzzing excitement)    

55
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,138
Who would like some?            

56
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,208
They're fresh and pipping hot!  

57
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,142
Just one "Pickled Plum" ticket! 

58
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,879
[SOMA] Step right up,           
step right up!                  

59
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,814
[estatic sigh]                  

60
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,784
[cries of pain and delight]     

61
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,224
[KUGA] One ticket...            
two tickets...                  

62
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,158
Lots of tickets...              

63
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,294
Wow! You got so many!           

64
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,164
I'm glad you had all those      
customers today, Soma!          

65
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,833
As your senior,                 
that makes me happy!            

66
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,236
The future of Totsuki           
looks bright indeed!            

67
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,239
<i> China-Soc got THAT</i>             
<i> much more than us?</i>             

68
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,709
[KUGA] You would be wise        
not to stay near me.            

69
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,979
Just pack it up and move        
somewhere you can peddle        
your goods.                     

70
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:11,483
So much for the school festival 
that could have been a fond     
memory of your youth.           

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,586
All right, staff!               

72
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,589
Time to start getting ready     
for tomorrow's huge crowd!      

73
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,024
[MEMBERS] Sir!                  

74
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,393
[worried whimper]               

75
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,194
Wh-wh-what should we do?        

76
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,463
It's only our first day,        
and we're already in the red!   

77
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,266
At this rate, you're for sure   
gonna have to leave school!     

78
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,935
Yeah, I can't say that          
was a good effort for           
[MEGUMI] What'll we do?!        

79
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,471
our first day out of the gate.  
[MEGUMI] It's too terrible      
to even think about!            

80
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,008
Still, to think that I          
only sold THIS few! [laughs]    

81
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,876
This is no time                 
for you to laugh!               

82
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,678
Yeah...                         

83
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,147
You got that right.             

84
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,084
[chimes]                        

85
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,485
[YUME] This is an announcement  
for all our guests:             

86
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,023
Sales figures as of 6 PM on     
the first day of the Lunar Feast

87
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,826
have now been sorted out and    
tallied up for the days count!  

88
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,762
So, without further adieu,      
we will now announce the        
rankings for each area.         

89
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,832
Okay, let's start with          
the main area!                  

90
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,600
Third Place goes to...          

91
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,971
Bowl Research Society!          

92
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,439
[MEMBERS] (cheers)              

93
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,574
To think, we were on the        
verge of disbandment!           

94
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,843
Bow-Soc forver!                 

95
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,845
Third Place is nothing          
to be happy about.              

96
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,580
[URARA] Second place:           
Skewer Research Society.        

97
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,182
And coming in first is...       

98
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,518
the "Trattoria Aldini"          
branch restaurant!              

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,520
We came in first, Takumi!       
[GIRLS] (cheers and squealing)  

100
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,056
I guess having it run by someone
who was in the Selection        

101
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,325
managed to get a lot of         
people talking!                 

102
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,261
No, this is thanks to the hard  
work everyone put in.           

103
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:33,198
[YUME] And now, the results     
for the central area.           
[GIRLS] (renewed squeals)       

104
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,266
How'd he do?                    

105
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,601
[URARA] In third:               

106
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,403
Japanese Research Society       
with "Yoyo Ken."                

107
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:40,472
In second: Spanish Research     
Society with "El Fuego."        

108
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,810
And in first: From China-Soc,   
it's "Kuga Chinese Restaurant"! 

109
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,614
Their outstanding results       
were more than double that      
of second or third place's!     

110
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:52,684
[IKUMI]<i> Damn,so, Soma wasn't</i>    
<i> able to take any customers</i>     
<i> away from Kuga?</i>                

111
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,454
[TAKUMI]                        
<i> I wanted him to at least</i>       
<i> make it into the top three.</i>    

112
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,023
ToSpo special edition!          

113
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:01,894
We also have sales figures      
for fourth place and under      
listed here!                    

114
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,564
[MALE STUDENT A] Hey, look!     
Two restaurants managed to      
end up in the red.              

115
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,199
What losers!                    

116
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,769
[ERINA] I cannot believe this!  

117
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:14,173
All of you participated in      
the Selection, for god's sake!  

118
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,641
Three of you made it            
to the finals,                  

119
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,308
but now you're in the           
bottom of the rankings!         

120
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,844
And if that wasn't bad enough,  
you're in the red!              

121
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,581
You've brought shame to the     
honor of the Selection.         

122
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,716
I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!      

123
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,653
[ERINA] Oh, I didn't            
necessarily mean YOU, Megumi.   

124
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,854
How do you plan to atone        
for this, Alice?                

125
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,257
You have personally ruined      
our supply order top to bottom! 

126
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,727
Correct me if I'm wrong, but    
weren't you the one who was     
supposed to do the final check? 

127
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:39,131
I got the feeling, Ma'am,       
that you said YOU would be      
doing all that.                 

128
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,200
[ALICE] Ryo, I swear!           
Whose side are you on?!         

129
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,268
[AKIRA] Dammit, Ryo, what's     
going on with your boss here?   

130
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,270
She keeps changing the          
menu every day!                 

131
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,205
That's how mistakes             
like this get made!             

132
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,274
She is completely               
out of control!                 

133
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,675
[sigh]                          

134
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,344
You better get used to it.      

135
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,013
It'll happen tomorrow           
and keep on happening.          

136
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,147
[AKIRA] (urk)                   

137
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,750
In any case, as of tomorrow,    

138
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,419
we're going to have to get      
into the black no matter what.  

139
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,221
So, let's change things!        

140
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,490
[AKIRA] This is pretty much     
all your fault!                 
[ALICE] (hm?)                   

141
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,091
[AKIRA]                         
Don't you even feel guilty?     

142
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,560
[BOTH]<i> There is ZERO</i>            
<i> sense of teamwork.</i>             

143
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,963
[IKUMI] Megumi, is this         
really a good idea?             

144
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,899
At this rate, not only          
will you not challenge          
one of the Ten,                 

145
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,701
but you'll be                   
kicked out of school.           

146
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,368
Oh, well, yes...                

147
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,571
Still, I'm sure it'll           
work itself out.                

148
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,839
Huh? Soma?!                     

149
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,574
Where the heck have             
you been anyway?                

150
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,244
Yeah, I went to go              
run a quick errand.             

151
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,378
Any of you guys work up         
an appetite yet?                

152
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:31,183
[BOTH] (grr...)                 
[SOMA] I've got leftover meat   
patties and hujiao bing!        

153
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,517
Who's hungry for dinner?!       

154
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,185
[ALICE]                         
Yeah! Don't mind if I do!       

155
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,554
How are you so calm?!           

156
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,323
[SATOSHI] (sigh) Thanks for your
hard work, everyone.            

157
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:39,792
Let's go ahead and              
close shop for the day.         

158
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,060
What?!                          
You already want to quit?       

159
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,263
But the mountain area is        
going to start getting          
much busier now.                

160
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,731
You could go on a bit longer... 

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,267
Our primary goal is just        
to have some fun.               

162
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,803
Don't you all agree with that?  

163
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,338
There's no reason to push       
ourselves just yet.             

164
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,940
Also...                         

165
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,143
There's something I want to     
get ready for tomorrow.         

166
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,012
[SOMA] (mouth full) Go ahead,   
Erina, I'm sure you'll like it. 

167
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,149
Get that thing out of my face!  
I am NOT going to eat it.       

168
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,352
I may have inadvertently helped 
you during taste testing,       

169
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,487
but I do NOT accept             
your cooking!                   

170
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,687
Huh?                            

171
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,623
Go on, Erina.                   
It's really yummy.              

172
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,225
It's quite lovely.              

173
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,894
The patty absorbed the black    
pepper and sesame oil nicely.   

174
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,697
Ya know, I could make these even
more delicious than this.       

175
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,300
Whaat?                          
[AKIRA]                         
Aside from the black pepper,    

176
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,703
there's a mixed condiment       
that's indispensable called     
Five spice powder.              

177
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:28,240
It contains star anise,         
which is often used to elevate  
the flavors in dishes.          

178
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,976
Oh! Bingo! That condiment       

179
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,845
was definitely used as an       
extra added spice all right.    

180
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:37,182
Knowing that sure helped me out 
during the curry battle         
at the Selection.               

181
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,951
And Meat-Meat helped out too!   

182
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,121
[IKUMI] Chinese cooking         
still has a whole bunch of      
other condiments.               

183
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,657
There's oyster sauce,           
XO bean sauce,                  

184
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,327
and more spices than you        
can ever think to wrap          
your head around.               

185
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,530
Cool! I guess I'll try          
a bit of everything.            

186
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm gonna mince some onions     
and bake them into the dough.   

187
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,269
Delicious! It's SO delicious!   

188
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,205
Thank you for sharing that      
with me, Meat-Meat!             
[IKUMI] (panic!)                

189
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,607
What the hell is                
wrong with you, Soma?!          

190
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,075
Why are you suddenly            
holding my hand like that?!     

191
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,210
Come on, Soma!                  
Why didn't you come and ask ME?!

192
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,479
Why don't you say something     
to him, Brother.                

193
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,881
[harumphf]                      

194
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,218
[huh] These are sales rankings  
for the first day, huh?         

195
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,855
In the mountain area,           
all the top rankings are        
people in the Ten.              

196
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,759
[MEGUMI] And right there        
at the top is Chef Momo.        

197
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:24,763
[SOMA] And the #1 Seat,         
Chef Tsukasa, is in fifth.      

198
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:30,369
What's this? The #2 Seat, Chef  
Kobayashi, and Chef Eizan,      
aren't even listed in here.     

199
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,970
Did they not participate?       

200
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,174
Hey, must be how one of you     
Nakiri girls got second place.  

201
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,975
That's way too awesome, girl!   

202
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,510
I'll drop by to eat something!  

203
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,044
If you want to eat, then come by

204
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:41,713
once you have a                 
"Pine Tree" ticket!             

205
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,249
Ms Erina's shop is by           
reservation only.               

206
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,385
We do not seat                  
unannounced customers,          

207
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,253
no matter who they are.         

208
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,990
If not for this, there's no     
doubt she would have            
reached first place.            

209
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:56,595
Unlike you, not all participants
put a priority on comparing     
sales as some achievement.      

210
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,598
There are plenty of students out
there who are simply in pursuit 
of their own cooking.           

211
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,135
Oh... It takes all types, huh?  

212
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:07,473
Honestly! You're in no position 
to be concerned with the        
other areas now.                

213
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:11,142
Why don't you just focus on     
defeating Kuga in the           
central area?                   

214
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,478
Yeah?                           

215
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,749
[phone buzzing] Yeah, what?     

216
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,752
Meat-Meat! I came back to find  
our tent all busted up!         

217
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,554
You need to come back here      
right now!                      

218
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,022
Quit sobbing,                   
you pathetic idiot!             

219
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,423
I'm on my way!                  

220
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,559
Takumi, we have to go           
and get started                 

221
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,161
on our meeting for tomorrow.    

222
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,963
Everyone is waiting for us.     

223
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,431
Yeah, let's get going.          

224
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,299
We should probably have a       
strategy meeting too.           

225
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,168
[RYO] 'kay.                     
[AKIRA] Yeah...                 

226
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,903
In the meantime, Soma,          

227
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,172
you better find a way to get    
yourself out of the red!        
And fast!                       

228
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,574
Megumi could very well find     
herself getting kicked out      
of school, you know!            

229
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,310
Yep, I'll do my best!           
[TAKUMI] You know what          
your problem is?!               

230
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,379
Okay, that's enough. Let's go!  
[TAKUMI]                        
Hey, wait just a minute, Isami! 

231
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,915
Listen here, Soma Yukihira:     
You are my rival,               
and don't you forget it!        

232
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,851
Megumi, wanna get started on    
tomorrow's prep work?           

233
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,253
Yep!                            

234
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,788
[MEGUMI] And...                 

235
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:57,789
There!                          

236
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,658
What's this?                    

237
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,327
I thought we had lots of patties
left over at the end of the day.

238
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,497
Did we eat them all up earlier  
and I just forgot?              

239
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,067
[small gasp]                    

240
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,536
Um, Soma-                       
[SOMA] Yeah...                  

241
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,271
Thanks, again.                  
And here...                     

242
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,806
I'm counting on you.            

243
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,878
Hey, Soma? Who was that?        

244
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,281
Oh, Megumi! There's something I 
want to ask your advice about.  

245
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,282
You got a minute?               

246
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,618
Uh, sure.                       

247
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,090
guys! Day 2 of the feast!       

248
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,559
Time to try something           
completely different            

249
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,228
Let's look to make              
our customers happier           

250
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,963
while still celebrating the     
spring of our youth even more!  

251
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,698
[GROUP] Yeah!                   

252
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,768
[WOMEN] (happy squeals)         

253
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,371
[WOMAN A] Oh, Daigo!            
[WOMAN B] Shoji!                

254
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:48,240
[WOMAN C] Shun!                 
[WOMAN D] Zenji!                

255
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,642
[ALL WOMEN] Isshi!              

256
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,579
[YUKI] What?                    
Is this like some host club!    

257
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,516
Well, whatever it is, it looks  
like they've figured out        
what the customers want.        

258
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,318
[YUKI] We might make it in      
the top five today!             

259
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,721
Four Super-Deluxe Bowls,        
on the double, please!          

260
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,590
If you're after something       
a little lighter,               

261
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,391
may I recommend a               
lo-cal calzone?                 

262
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,660
[AKIRA] We don't have           
a single piece of naan!         

263
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,197
I left that sole action to you  
because you said you would      
take care of it, Alice!         

264
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,732
And that's exactly what I did!  

265
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,068
I made naan into a              
concentrated candy form!        

266
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,936
How does that possibly          
go with curry?! (argh!)         

267
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,272
Although this sure does         
taste like naan.                

268
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,007
[MAN A] This stink is too much! 

269
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,276
[MAN B] I'll take five packs!   
[MAN C] I'll take two!          

270
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:30,081
[witch's cackle]                
My Dark Association of Dried    
Goods is a hit again today!     

271
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,952
Though it concerns me that      
a few of the customers          
seem to be weak-kneed.          

272
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:37,823
[STUDENT A] Can you believe     
freaking Sadatsuka wanted to put
that on the main road?          

273
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,958
[STUDENT B] That stink          
would've caused a riot.         

274
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:43,495
[RINDO] Oh, this is delicious!  
It's like a sweet fish milt.    

275
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:48,033
[ENTOPHOMAGY]                   
Indeed! Hornet's larvae are     
known to be quite the delicacy. 

276
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,902
That was tasty.                 
Thanks a lot!                   

277
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,571
Now then, what's next?          

278
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
Oh!                             

279
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,308
Figures Kuga would have         
a line out the door.            

280
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,642
[cheers and laughter]           

281
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:59,845
<i> This crowd even</i>                
<i> beats yesterday's.</i>             

282
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,847
<i> It's not letting up</i>            
<i> for an instant!</i>                

283
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,648
<i> This is all too easy...</i>        

284
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,784
<i> My flavor is to be feared!</i>     

285
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,188
Well, I guess I'll come back    
and try later.                  

286
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,193
Oh, there it is, Soma's         
rickety little stall.           
[MEGUMI] How about some fresh,  
piping hot hujiao bing?         

287
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,662
Hujiao bing, huh?               
That looks tasty.               

288
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:19,864
Oh? What's he's eating          
with chopsticks over there?     

289
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,800
(slurping)                      

290
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,202
[URARA] It's about that time!   

291
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,270
In the central area,            
today's top earner              

292
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,606
 is China-Soc's                 
"Kuga Chinese Restaurant"!      

293
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,143
Dominating for the              
second day in a row!            
[MEMBERS] (cheering)            

294
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,345
Well, it's only natural,        
I guess.                        

295
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:37,416
Still, I must admit I do feel   
increasingly bad for            
young Soma out there.           

296
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,919
Yesterday, he came in dead last 
at 40th place, the numbsk-      

297
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,422
35th place?                     

298
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,025
Well, I guess he's tried a      
little harder on the second day.

299
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,695
Huh? He's gone.                 
Hey, you guys!                  

300
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:52,364
Did any one of you see Soma     
working out there today?        

301
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,901
Actually, it looked like he had 
a lot more customers than       
he did yesterday.               

302
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,037
And he had something else       
on the menu.                    

303
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,038
It looked like some kind        
of noodle dish.                 

304
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,373
Ramen...                        

305
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,509
[NAO] Sold out today as well!   

306
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:08,847
Sure enough, cuisine made       
for people who love stinky food 
is powerful indeed!             

307
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,016
[witch's cackle] Hmm?           

308
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,721
So, what's this?                

309
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,857
[SOMA] Hello there! How about   
some hujiao bing before         
you head back?                  

310
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,259
It'll be on the house tonight!  

311
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,793
[FATHER]                        
You don't need any food tickets?

312
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,762
[SOMA] Nope! Here you go!       

313
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,133
It's so juicy and so spicy!     

314
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,401
This is great!                  

315
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,403
It's so meaty and               
full of flavor!                 

316
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,605
Could I possibly get one        
of those as well?               

317
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,340
Yes, of course!                 

318
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,342
[GUY] Oh, wow, you bake them    
in a stove oven.                

319
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,011
Can I have one too?!            
[slithering]                    

320
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,414
Just what are you pulling here? 

321
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:43,815
Sadatsuka!                      

322
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,618
[NAO] Squid tentacles in        
peanut butter? Vile!            

323
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:49,287
This thing REALLY stinks        
something fierce, Sadatsuka!    

324
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,823
It stinks, but it grows on you, 
doesn't it?                     

325
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,825
[BOTH] (witch's cackle)         

326
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,028
[MEGUMI] Those two have         
way too much in common.         

327
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,430
This is up there with kiviak    
or surstr mming                 

328
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,900
for the stinkiest but           
tastiest of all the             
foods on Earth.                 

329
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,169
My goal is to come up with      
something even more             

330
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,638
deliciously nasty               
and utterly hideous.            

331
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:08,907
Yeah, you totally get it,       
Sadatsuka!                      

332
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,644
Next time, you should have a    
taste of my ultra-disgusting    
masterpiece!                    

333
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,646
[NAO] Oh, yes, and I'll         
let you have some of            

334
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:17,715
my beautifully repulsive        
cooking too.                    
[MEGUMI]<i> I think...</i>             

335
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:19,785
<i> this was an encounter that</i>     
<i> should have never happened!</i>    

336
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,719
[BOTH] (cackling with glee)     

337
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:24,056
Yeah, so, I pulled the          
cart out last night             

338
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,058
to test some new items          
with the crowd.                 

339
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,261
I noticed that some             
of the other shops              

340
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,930
would walk around and hand out  
free samples to people.         

341
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,732
I take it that means there's    
no problem with me              

342
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,934
doing the same thing to get     
some new customers.             

343
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,736
That's rather                   
mischievous of you.             

344
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:41,473
This way, I get to see          
the customers' first            
reaction as well.               

345
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:45,077
Also, I wanted to try changing  
things up a bit.                
[NAO] Huh?                      

346
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,213
I thought maybe there was       
something out there I           
couldn't see,                   

347
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,815
not with China-Soc              
sitting right next door.        

348
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,884
Would you care for a            
free Hujiao bing?               

349
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,088
Hujiao bing, huh?               
That's a little heavy.          

350
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,691
Now, if you had something       
maybe a little lighter...       

351
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,493
Oh, yeah, I've got just         
the thing for you then!         

352
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:04,229
Give me a minute!               
Order coming right up!          

353
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,165
[MAN] Whoa!                     
[WOMAN]                         
Are those hand-cut noodles?     

354
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,767
Oh wow, he's gonna slice        
the raw dough himself!          

355
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,569
Th-this is...                   

356
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,739
He's sliced the hujiao bing     
dough into noodles!             

357
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,709
Order up, my good man!          

358
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:20,245
[MAN] Wow! I can smell it's made
from a shrimp broth             

359
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,714
with delicate hints of garlic.  

360
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,285
[blowing and slurping]          

361
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:32,658
[chuckling] Wow! It's so light, 
but with a full-bodied flavor!  

362
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,727
I've been eating all day, but   
I can just slurp this right up! 

363
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:38,463
This is the perfect way to      
finish our earlier meal.        

364
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:40,465
Is, uh...                       

365
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,868
Is that the ground pork         
from the hujiao bing?           

366
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,804
Exactly! A customer wanted      
something like this yesterday,  

367
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,273
so I made it right there        
on the spot for them!           

368
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,077
And it was thanks to this, that 
we were able to make a lot more 
sales on our second day.        

369
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:55,013
[NAO] To think, you turned      
the dough into noodles...       

370
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:58,350
And I can't believe you came    
up with this while you were     
still working!                  

371
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,219
Actually, there's a fantastic   
noodle dish in Taiwan           

372
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,355
that's pretty similar to        
what I just served.             

373
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,291
Danzi noodles!                  
[SOMA] Yeah!                    

374
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,361
[SOMA] It's a light soup        
made with shaved bonito flakes  
and shrimp shells               

375
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,564
served with "oil noodles."      
Then, all that's left to do     

376
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,300
is top it with some             
savory ground pork and          
sliced scallions,               

377
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,636
and serve it up into a          
smaller bowl.                   

378
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:22,240
In Taiwan, there's an old saying
about eating something          
and never getting tired of it.  

379
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,444
With that in mind,              
we decided to serve             
it in a smaller bowl.           

380
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:30,683
Without further adieu,          
it's "Yukihira-style Kinda Sorta
Danzi Noodles"!                 

381
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,136
We sure got a lot of customers  
tonight, didn't we?             

382
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,938
Still, we're doing              
all this for free,              

383
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,674
so it's only natural that they  
would be happy with their food. 

384
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,943
[laughing] True enough.         

385
00:17:58,012 --> 00:18:01,680
But still, when Dad brought out 
the hujiao bing at the          
summer fests,                   

386
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,682
this is how it would            
always go down.                 

387
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,485
[MEGUMI] Huh? Whadda' ya mean?  

388
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:10,288
[SOMA] At first, we'd only get  
a few customers that were       
curious about the kiln,         

389
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,759
but once they started eating,   
their reactions would draw      
a crowd.                        

390
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:17,496
Soon, there'd be no end to the  
people crowded around our stall.

391
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,165
That's kind of what I was after.

392
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:23,301
Yep, having that huge Chinese   
restaurant in front of us,      

393
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:25,904
I pretty much thought,          
this was the only way to go.    

394
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:29,308
The kiln, in and of itself,     
doesn't really have             
that much impact.               

395
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:34,379
Oh! Also, the way hujiao bing   
is cooked isn't enough to       
get people's attention,         

396
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,049
unless you see someone          
who's actually eating it,       

397
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,851
it's kind of hard to imagine    
how it really tastes.           

398
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,655
[SOMA] Yeah, and when it        
comes to Chef Kuga's            
Sichuan cooking...              

399
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:47,726
Obviously the second you        
lay eyes on it, you can         
imagine the taste, huh?         

400
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,861
The Lunar Feast isn't           
like a Food War,                

401
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,264
where the judges are required   
to eat everything the chef      
places in front of them.        

402
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,401
So then, are you going to       
come up with something          

403
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:59,204
were the customers will be able 
to imagine what the dish        
will taste like, or...          

404
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,674
Maybe, or come up with something
that's so outrageously delicious

405
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:05,544
that it'll have enough impact   
to get the customers' attention.

406
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,679
If I could put out              
something like that,            

407
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,783
I think I could get myself out  
of this rut I'm currently in.   

408
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,352
[ALICE] I've got it!            

409
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,888
We'll put the meat for our main 
dish in a bath circulator       

410
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:18,156
and apply low heat              
for two hours.                  

411
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,427
Then, we'll need to bring each  
of our vegetable to their       
optimal temperature             

412
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,561
in a steam convection oven.     

413
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,765
Akira, you'll apply the         
flavoring. It's a               
special spice blend-            

414
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,501
And? How much do you plan       
to charge for this dish?        

415
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,237
Let's see, in order to          
turn a profit...                

416
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,639
Around 20,000 yen!              
[AKIRA] That won't sell!        

417
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,241
We're in the main area,         
you idiot!                      

418
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,176
We won't know if we don't try,  
right?                          

419
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,046
We know it's obvious that       
this will just put us           
further in the red!             

420
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,716
But I'm sure it will get        
the people talking! [grr...]    

421
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:46,718
[AKIRA]                         
It's no use getting pissy.      
This is the Lunar Feast!        

422
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:51,023
If your only thoughts are about 
what YOU want and not the       
customers, then just go home.   

423
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,859
[RYO] Hey, Akira.               
[AKIRA] Yeah?                   

424
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:57,062
Try this man. You need to       
flatter her when you            
talk to her.                    

425
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:01,199
And act in a better mood too.   
Even if just your               
facial expression.              

426
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:04,469
She's become this monster       
because you coddled             
all her delusions.              

427
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,272
You need to take                
more responsibil-               
[ALICE] I take back my plan.    

428
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,676
[BOTH] Huh?                     
[ALICE] What you just said      
actually makes some sense.      

429
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,079
Let's put our brains together   
and think about what will       
make our customers happy        

430
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:16,147
when they come to               
the Lunar Feast.                

431
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,684
[SOMA]                          
What kind of dish would it be?  

432
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,153
I imagine it would be           
something pretty easy,          

433
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,222
but with enough impact          
to beat China-Soc.              

434
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:27,092
Their restaurant has an         
incredible and extensive        
menu on their signboard,        

435
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,094
starting with their             
famous mapo tofu.               

436
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,697
Mapo tofu, huh?                 

437
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:35,500
Hey, Megum, how was             
Yukihira-style mapo tofu to you?

438
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,437
[MEGUMI] Ah... I thought it     
tasted really delicious.        

439
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,639
But Erina had her own thoughts. 

440
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,709
There is far too little ma      
and la involved in this.        

441
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:47,245
Yeah, and that I don't stand    
a chance against Kuga.          

442
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,580
But still...                    

443
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,450
Our mapo tofu wasn't            
spicy on purpose.               

444
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,053
My dad did that because he was  
after the kind of flavor        

445
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,256
that our repeat customers       
enjoy the most.                 

446
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:02,327
It's true, Chef Kuga's mapo tofu
has a lot more robust flavor... 

447
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:05,130
But that doesn't mean my dad's  
cooking is inferior in anyway!  

448
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,065
Uh, yeah.                       

449
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:08,934
[SOMA] If I can use             
that dish as a base,            

450
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,937
and come up with some           
original twist on it...         

451
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,940
I could find a way to blow      
this thing wide open.           

452
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:17,509
That's great.                   
But what would that be?         

453
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,146
Megumi, sorry, but...           

454
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:24,883
Starting today, I think we      
won't be sleeping anymore.      

455
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,618
There's something I want to try.

456
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:29,888
I'm going to use the            
"Yukihira" mapo tofu            

457
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,758
to take Chef Kuga down!         
Watch out!                      

458
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:34,727
[music playing]                 

459
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:35,754
[AKI] Ah, I'm kinda hungry.     

460
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,823
[MAYUMI] Me too.                
Hey, do you wanna get           

461
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,758
a Sumire chicken-stuffed        
cabbage roll?                   

462
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,494
Yes! Totally!                   
Let's go, let's go!             

463
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,429
[giggle] What the?              

464
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:46,765
The lights are on at            
"Yukihira" eatery.              

465
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:49,435
[AKI] Hey, you're right.        
I wonder if he's back?          

466
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:51,503
<i> Soma?</i>                          

467
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,642
Um, is anybody here?            

468
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:01,380
[screams]
