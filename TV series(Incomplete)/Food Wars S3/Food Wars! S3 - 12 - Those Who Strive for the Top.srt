00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:10,408
<i> His greatest strength is that</i>  
<i> he refuses to give in.</i>         

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:15,080
<i> It's what fuels his curiosity,</i> 
<i> and his desire to learn.</i>       

3
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,815
<i> It drives him forward.</i>         

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,918
<i> It's what makes him take that</i>  
<i> one step no one else would.</i>    

5
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,621
Go get it -                     
a seat on the Ten,              

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,225
the No. 1 spot.                 
[SOMA] Sir!                     

7
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,226
[KOJIRO]<i> As it is,</i>              
<i> you're one of the few chefs</i>    

8
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,362
<i> that I've ever bothered</i>        
<i> to acknowledge.</i>                

9
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,298
<i> So, join me up here</i>            
<i> at the summit,</i>                 

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,701
<i> Soma Yukihira!</i>                 

11
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,470
I will never join with          
the likes of Central.           

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,475
I will be the one who will win  
this battle today.              

13
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,778
He can't do that.               

14
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,914
He's challenging the            
No.1 Seat on the Ten?           

15
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:51,884
That's too much!                
[ERINA]                         
Look at that protein he has.    

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,120
Okay!                           
I've trimmed off all the muscle.

17
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,256
[ERINA] I think...              
that's leg meat.                

18
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,858
He chose leg meat?!             

19
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,794
He's covered it with            
minced onion and garlic,        

20
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,330
and now he's just letting it    
sit for a bit.                  

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,000
That will make it soft,         
and give it that extra flavor   
he's been wanting!              

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,203
[HISAKO] But he's up against    
the very best,                  

23
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,005
the No. 1 Seat on the Ten,      

24
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,540
Eishi Tsukasaa!                 

25
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,608
There's no way he can fight him 

26
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,478
just by using                   
conventional methods!           

27
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,146
<i> Soma Yukihira...</i>               

28
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,149
<i> If you lose, you'll have to</i>    
<i> become a member of Central.</i>    

29
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,719
<i> And if that happens...</i>         

30
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,825
[music playing]                 

31
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,352
Oh, that's right.               

32
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,886
I have to get THAT out!         

33
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,289
Got a little secret             
up your sleeve, Soma?           

34
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,825
[SOMA] (unh) There's just one   
more ingredient my dish needs.  

35
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,293
And it's somewhere in your bag? 

36
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,296
Let's see, where did I put it?  

37
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,965
Not this. Or this.              
Definitely not.                 

38
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,701
Ah, here it is!                 
THIS'll do the trick!           

39
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,771
Some "shelled sweet chestnuts"! 

40
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,239
[BOTH] What?!                   

41
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,574
He plans to use that in         
his dish as an ingredient?!     

42
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,978
So what is that thing, Megumi?  
This "shelled" ingredient?      

43
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:04,383
W-well, um, it's a snack of     
shelled chestnuts he had        
in his bag.                     

44
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,917
[ERINA] Chestnuts?              

45
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,053
That's actually a               
good ingredient,                

46
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,389
one that is a great match       
for wild game.                  

47
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,457
It's not an uncommon pairing    
in French cooking.              

48
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,861
But all said and done,          
that's still just a             
snack bag he pulled out.        

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,831
I don't see how on Earth this   
can turn out well at all.       

50
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,602
[SOMA] (huh?)                   
[TSUKASA] What, this?           

51
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,270
Turn off the heat               
for a little bit,               

52
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,739
and cover the protein           
with a bowl and let it rest.    

53
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,541
The steam builds up             
within the bowl,                

54
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,944
and that slowly transfers       
to the meat.                    

55
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:35,747
Then, once it's re-heated in    
the oven, it will be done.      

56
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,151
Oh wow, I totally get it.       
That was really interesting!    

57
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:43,421
Thanks a lot.                   
I didn't learn anything         
like that from Chef Kojiro!     

58
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,757
Idiot!                          
This is no time for gratitude!  

59
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,827
You really are quite            
a bizarre person,               
you know that, Soma.            

60
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,162
Thanks, I guess?                

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,696
I'm not sure about your plan.   

62
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,366
Experimental ingredients don't  
always make a good dish.        

63
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,302
But what do I know, I'm just    
the No.1 seat on the Ten.       

64
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,505
[SOMA] In that case,            
I'll go ahead and apologize now.

65
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,343
Because I think I'm about       
to surprise you again,          
Chef Tsukasa.                   

66
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,712
[heh, heh, heh]                 

67
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,447
Charcoal grill!                 

68
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,116
He's using that for             
FRENCH cooking?!                

69
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,451
All right, the temperature      
is about perfect...             

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,587
Now to finish                   
everything up at once!          

71
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,457
But this is supposed to be      
about French cooking!           

72
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,992
Do you even get that?!          

73
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,460
Hisako, if you keep that up,    

74
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,994
they're going to                
hear us out here!               

75
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,329
What's he up to?                

76
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,731
I know a charcoal grill         
used like that                  

77
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,933
can give seafood                
a really decent sear,           

78
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,734
but I've never heard of         
it ever being used              

79
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,137
to cook meat all the way through
in any form of French cooking!  

80
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,939
I just don't know               
what he's thinking!             

81
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,710
And yet... Cooking with charcoal
definitely has its merits.      

82
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,080
You can get a surface           
temperature of 600 degrees.     

83
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,816
And if you fan it, that can     
get up to 1,000 degrees.        

84
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,019
What's more, the infrared       
radiation emitted by            
the charcoal                    

85
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,422
will act as a means to          
heat the meat directly.         

86
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,558
And as a result of using        
this cooking technique,         

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,562
the venison should not only turn
out crispy on the outside       
but juicy within.               

88
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,296
[HISAKO] But, Ms Erina!         

89
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,698
I know.                         

90
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,433
The charcoal brings             
about a bitterness              

91
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,702
that's difficult to incorporate 
into French cooking.            

92
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,305
Which means this                
potential dish...               

93
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:09,041
We may be, in all likelihood,   

94
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,777
seeing the birth of a dish      
that only he,                   

95
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,147
Soma Yukihira,                  
would ever be able to pull off! 

96
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,788
[SOMA] Okay, Chef Tsukasa,      

97
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,059
what do you say the two of us   
go ahead and finish this duel?  

98
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,995
Bon appetite.                   

99
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,932
[TSUKASA]                       
Fine, don't mind if I do.       

100
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,401
[SOMA] OH!                      
[TSUKASA] Huh?                  

101
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,268
You know what,                  
we never thought about          

102
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,471
how we were going to even       
judge this Food War!            

103
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,272
Well,                           
since it's just the two of us,  

104
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,676
we'll just have to taste each   
other's dishes and compare them.

105
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,012
Hey there! So, you guys wanna   
come and eat our stuff or what?!

106
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,680
[ALL]<i> He busted us!</i>             

107
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,083
Oh, my goodness!                
You were here this whole time?! 

108
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,552
Why were you ladies hiding      
from us, anyway?                

109
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,288
Uh, well, it's sorta like this, 
you know?!                      

110
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,756
Why are we here again?          

111
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,559
Well, I think it                
was regarding Ms Erina...       

112
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:01,827
[BOTH] How come, you reckon?    

113
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,829
I-I don't have an answer        
to that either!                 

114
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,433
Well then, how about we have    
you three be our judges?        

115
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,368
Yeah, that works out perfectly! 

116
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,570
Thanks for helping out,         
you girls're the best!          

117
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,572
Um, hold on a minute, Soma!     

118
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,575
We can't just go and say yes    
to something like that.         

119
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:17,710
But why not?                    

120
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:18,977
Because depending               
on the outcome,                 

121
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,245
you might end up having to      

122
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,247
become the next member          
of Central!                     

123
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,849
Listen to me...                 

124
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,385
I could never back down after   
hearing what he told me.        

125
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,587
But you're right                
about one thing.                

126
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,989
Central's true goal is          
yet to be realized.             

127
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,926
And that is to obliterate all   
of Japan's restaurants, pronto. 

128
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:39,665
So the way I see it,            
I don't have a choice but to    
settle this once and for all!   

129
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,332
But Soma...                     

130
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,734
Well if that's it...            

131
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,203
If that's how                   
it's going to be...             

132
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,538
Then I shall be the judge       
of this challenge!              

133
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,207
Soma, bring out your dish       
for me to try.                  

134
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,542
Right away!                     

135
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,277
But Ms Erina...                 

136
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:55,514
You two should judge as well,   
and cast your votes HONESTLY.   

137
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,888
Now, first off, the aroma...    

138
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,658
The charcoal has given it       
depth and a richness...         

139
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,563
[gasp]                          

140
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,967
[moans of ecstasy]              

141
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,436
[HISAKO]<i> This... this is...</i>     

142
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:21,039
[TSUKASA] Such a pleasant,      
plump-and-melts-in-your mouth   
texture...                      

143
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,376
It has the distinct, mildly     
sweet flavor of the chestnuts.  

144
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,779
When paired with the            
aroma of the charcoal,          

145
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,848
it serves to further draw out   
the juiciness of the venison.   

146
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,918
This flavor wouldn't have been  
possible with normalchestnuts.  

147
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:36,121
It's a unique flavor            
made possible by the            
CANDIED chestnuts!              

148
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,591
And the chestnuts were diced    
and added to the sauce too,     
am I right?                     

149
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,528
Yep! And before I let it        
all simmer down,                

150
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:46,665
I added cinnamon, orange zest,  
and diced chestnuts to          
the fond de veau.               

151
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,735
I call it,                      
"Yukihira-style chestnut sauce"!

152
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,803
I get it!                       
That must have been what let you

153
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,140
get that delicate sweetness     
into every morsel of            
the venison!                    

154
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,277
What a real surprise.           
But I'm missing something.      

155
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,814
The taste of charcoal shouldn't 
lend itself to French cuisine   
like this,                      

156
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:04,149
but in this dish,               
it works perfectly.             

157
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,284
Is there some other             
secret flavor?                  

158
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:07,952
He added coffee to it.          

159
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,554
Huh? It's coffee?!              

160
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,223
You nailed it. That's the       
God Tongue, all right!          

161
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,426
I learned this working          
for Chef Kojiro.                

162
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,429
Cacao apparently pairs really   
well with wild game.            

163
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,832
Honestly, I don't really        
have very much experience       
working with cacao,             

164
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,968
so I thought I'd use            
instant coffee.                 

165
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,571
The bitterness seemed like      
the perfect fit for             
pairing with wild game,         

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,642
and the deep, rich flavor       
is just the thing for           
a French-style sauce.           

167
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,644
Hence, my secret ingredient.    

168
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,315
This is my new, original take   
on French cooking:              

169
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,518
Char-grilled thigh of venison   
in chestnut sauce!              

170
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:42,520
[ERINA]<i> The protein, the sauce,</i> 
<i> and the garnishes...</i>           

171
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,257
<i> Together, these form a</i>         
<i> trifecta of harmony.</i>           

172
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,125
<i> That's the basis of</i>            
<i> French cooking.</i>                

173
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,863
<i> The dish makes no sense!</i>       
<i> It makes no sense at all!</i>      

174
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,700
<i> And yet, without a doubt,</i>      
<i> it can only be called "French."</i>

175
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,540
[moans of pleasure]             

176
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,608
[ERINA]                         
<i> I want to reject this dish,</i>    

177
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:07,680
<i> but it's as if my very common</i>  
<i> sense is being peeled away!</i>    

178
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,283
Well, for a dish that           
YOU'VE managed to put out,      

179
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,152
I suppose you could say that    
it meets the standards          

180
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,921
of being considered             
French cuisine I guess.         

181
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,825
<i> For Ms Erina, that's an</i>        
<i> incredible thing to say!</i>       

182
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,427
[MEGUMI]                        
<i> But what about Chef Tsukasa?</i>   

183
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,331
[HISAKO]<i> What's your plan,</i>      
<i> Eishi Tsukasa?</i>                 

184
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:34,039
Oh, yeah, right! I have to      
present MY dish too, don't I?!  

185
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,442
Wait just a little longer, okay?

186
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,916
I hope it's to your liking.     

187
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,755
I call it: "Two Expressions     
of Roast Venison."              

188
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,660
[HISAKO]<i> The surface of both</i>    
<i> slices is a perfect rose-red.</i>  

189
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,596
[MEGUMI]<i> It's like the</i>          
<i> meat is glistening!</i>            

190
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,066
[HISAKO]<i> The knife</i>              
<i> went right through it!</i>         

191
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,004
[ERINA]<i> Harmony...</i>              

192
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,405
[MEGUMI]<i> Harmony!</i>               

193
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,940
[HISAKO]<i> Complete and utter...</i>  

194
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,276
[ALL]<i> ...harmony!</i>               

195
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,879
It has depth,                   

196
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,413
but at the same time,           
the flavor's so light.          

197
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,149
There's no bitterness           
present at all,                 

198
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,817
and it's so incredibly juicy!   

199
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,219
THIS is the result              

200
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,887
of the care he put into         
the cooking temperature?!       

201
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,158
What's even more shocking,      
though, are these two           
beautiful sauces!               

202
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,160
[SOMA]                          
What the heck is going on?      

203
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,496
How does this sauce             
taste so incredible?            

204
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,566
The one on the right is         
commonly known as a poivrade.   

205
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,103
It uses venison stock as a base,
so it's a bit rough,            

206
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,973
but it has a fine clarity       
that lingers on the tongue.     

207
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,377
For the other sauce,            
I added different kinds of fruit
to make it sweet and refreshing,

208
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,846
but also to try and give it     
some more acidity.              

209
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,248
This one's a sauce              
poivrade au baie.               

210
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,317
If you're curious about         
what the name means,            

211
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:56,188
then poivrade comes from        
the French poivre,              
which refers to "pepper."       

212
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,924
The delicate bite of the pepper 
that's on display in the sauce  

213
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:03,328
helps to round out the subtle   
flavors that are present within 
the pairing of the venison.     

214
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,063
The fruits that I used were-    

215
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:08,133
Blueberries, redcurrants, as    
well as some blackberries, too. 

216
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:13,204
After that you added crème de   
cassis, red wine, blueberry     
vinegar, and raspberry jam.     

217
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,407
Incredible!                     
You got all those right!        

218
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,876
Still, I guess that's only      
natural for you.                

219
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,011
[ERINA]<i> It's nowhere near</i>       
<i> that simple though.</i>            

220
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,082
<i> This sauce alone incorporates</i>  
<i> several different kinds</i>        
<i> of fruits.</i>                     

221
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:29,955
<i> But of course, that's what</i>     
<i> gives this sauce such a rich</i>   
<i> and multilayered flavor to it.</i> 

222
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:34,226
[HISAKO]<i> One miscalculation,</i>    
<i> and it would have made</i>         
<i> the flavor combination bitter.</i> 

223
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,294
<i> It's like walking a tightrope.</i> 

224
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,629
[MEGUMI]

<i> each ingredient</i>

<i> but also the elegance</i>

<i> effectively brought out</i>        
<i> the flavors of the venison...</i>  

241
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,501
<i> ...is clear.</i>                   

242
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:21,806
[ERINA] All right then,         

243
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,676
I shall announce the winner.    

244
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,212
The winning dish in this battle,

245
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,181
I would say belongs to...       

246
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,390
[ERINA] Eishi Tsukasa!          

247
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,362
I take it you have no           
objection to the outcome.       

248
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,365
You do understand now,          
don't you?                      

249
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,233
There's a huge gap between us.  

250
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:51,036
[MEGUMI]<i> Soma's dish was</i>        
<i> really astounding, too.</i>        

251
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,905
<i> He created a whole new</i>         
<i> perspective of flavor!</i>         

252
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:57,709
[HISAKO]<i> Eishi Tsukasa's dish</i>   
<i> was the ultimate pinnacle</i>      
<i> of deliciousness,</i>              

253
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,778
<i> like something from Eden.</i>      

254
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,714
[MEGUMI]                        
<i> But if Soma loses here...</i>      

255
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,650
[HISAKO]<i> Soma...</i>                
<i> he'll end up at Central!</i>       

256
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,921
[ERINA]<i> Tsukasa's dish was</i>      
<i> undeniably superior.</i>           

257
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,025
<i> Soma Yukihira has lost.</i>        

258
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,795
Well, Soma...                   

259
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,198
You're way too much of a wild   
card to be of any use to me.    

260
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,666
[ALL] (gasp)                    

261
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:24,536
I knew it the moment I          
tasted your dish today.         

262
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,473
If I brought you into Central,  

263
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,408
Any "support" you gave would    
be no help to me at all!        

264
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,945
I think I'd collapse from       
you causing me anxiety!         

265
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:36,015
I feel you wouldn't follow      
directions and just make        
whatever you want!              

266
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:38,216
I think I understand            
what you mean.                  

267
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,018
Don't take it                   
the wrong way though.           

268
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,221
I just don't think I'm          
able to control you.            

269
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,025
That being the case,            
I'm inclined NOT to make you    
become a member of Central.     

270
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:48,426
[SOMA] Huh?                     
[MEGUMI] You're okay with that? 

271
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,762
That's right. Since this        
wasn't an actual Food War,      

272
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,231
I don't mind if we just         
forgot the whole thing.         

273
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,501
So, why don't we just           
call this one a draw?           

274
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,236
That okay with you, Soma?       

275
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,305
Well, it was fun.               
See ya.                         

276
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:01,674
No way.                         

277
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,909
I LOST FAIR AND SQUARE!         

278
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,844
[HISAKO] HUH?!                  
[MEGUMI] No, Soma!              

279
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,579
A loss is a loss.               

280
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,648
The difference in our skills    
is crystal clear.               

281
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,851
If you concede this as a loss,  
you'll end up having to         
join Central!                   

282
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,187
[growly] Yeah well,             
I don't want that to happen.    

283
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,322
You make no freakin' sense      
at all, you know that?!         

284
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,257
Soma,                           
please just rein yourself in!   

285
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,193
[SOMA] Whatever!                
[HISAKO] Stop complaining!      

286
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:23,394
[SOMA] But I lost!              
[HISAKO] Stop being an idiot!   

287
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,431
[SOMA] I don't deserve to-      
[HISAKO] Stop talking!          

288
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,833
[ERINA] Tsukasa...              

289
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,869
Are you taking pity on him      
or what?                        

290
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,270
[TSUKASA] "Pity"?               

291
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,139
If anything, the opposite.      

292
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,609
His cooking will never budge,   
nor will it ever compromise.    

293
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,346
And there's nothing             
I could do to change that.      

294
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:44,282
It's the reason I think he would
be dangerous if I were to       
have him at my station.         

295
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:45,950
He's not a good fit.            

296
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,519
Later guys.                     

297
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:52,624
[SOMA] Dammit, I lost again.    
[HISAKO] Huh? Ms Erina?!        
Where did you go?               

298
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:55,427
[MEGUMI] Come on,               
he's the No. 1 Seat, Soma.      
[HISAKO] You're not in the      
salamander, are you?            

299
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,029
Yeah, I didn't come             
anywhere close to him.          

300
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:02,301
But that doesn't mean he's      
so far ahead that I             
can't reach him!                

301
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:10,509
Next time, Tsukasa,             
I am GOING TO reach that summit!

302
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,851
[STUDENT A] Holy crap!          
[STUDENT B] What's going on?!   

303
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,920
Central has been out there      
beating all the groups          
left and right.                 

304
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,191
[STUDENT]                       
But these guys are unstoppable! 

305
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,194
[FEMALE STUDENT]                
(squeal) Ikumi Mito!            

306
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,396
Megumi! Go and get 'em!         

307
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:32,864
You can do it, Megumi!          

308
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,135
Meat-Meat!                      
You're a total rockstar!        

309
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,536
[GUY] DO IT!                    
[GIRL  You got this!            

310
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,874
[MEGUMI]<i> It was Soma who went</i>   
<i> out there and protected our</i>    
<i> dorm all by himself.</i>           

311
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,345
<i> And I won't let them take the</i>  
<i> place where I belong either!</i>   

312
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,279
<i> So watch out Central!</i>          

313
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:52,017
[IKUMI]<i> After all, it was Soma</i>  
<i> who told me to join Bowl-Soc.</i>  

314
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:55,020
<i> So there's no way I'll let</i>     
<i> anyone shut it down!</i>           

315
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,422
That settles it...              

316
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,958
I felt enough will              
in that cooking,                

317
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,094
to see this battle              
through to the end!             

318
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:06,098
[OIZUMI] The Regional Cuisine   
Research Society wins!          
[MEGUMI] (shocked gasp)         

319
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,833
[OIZUMI] It shall continue!     

320
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:11,369
Noooo! It can't be!             

321
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,506
Way to go Meat-Meat and Megumi! 

322
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,842
And Kenji too!                  

323
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,645
Yeah, eat that in the face,     
Central!                        

324
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,480
You did it, Zenji!              

325
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,182
Come to think of it...          

326
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,419
What's going on with Akira      
and the Shiomi Seminar?         

327
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,525
I'm finding there's something   
much different about this       
batch of 1st-years.             

328
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,660
And it seems to me              
that Soma Yukihira              

329
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,997
is the person right at the      
center of all that              
rebellious chaos.               

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,201
Huh! Soma Yukihira, you say?    

331
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,139
I believe he's one of the       
residents of Kyoksei Dorm,      
is he not?                      

332
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:48,940
Okay dudes!                     

333
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,943
To celebrate Megumi's           
victory today,                  

334
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,680
let's kick off the seventh "God 
Tongue" Taste-Testing Festival! 

335
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,081
[GIRLS] Yay!                    

336
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:57,616
You want to do this AGAIN?!     

337
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,018
[ALL] Yes, we certainly do,     
thank you!                      

338
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,553
Fine, then.                     

339
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:05,491
Ms Erina has certainly settled  
in here, hasn't she?            

340
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,558
[doorball rings]                

341
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,360
Who could it be at this hour?   

342
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,962
I don't suppose it's            
Master Senzaemon                

343
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:13,032
dropping by to pay us           
another visit.                  

344
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:14,365
Yeah, what's up?                

345
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:17,536
Whoa, it's the NEW director...  

346
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,439
Azami Nakiri!                   

347
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,842
Well, hello, Soma Yukihira.     

348
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,845
I happened to be in the area,   
so I stopped by.                

349
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,651
Father! It's you!               

350
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:35,854
What do you want, ya d-bag?!    

351
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:38,190
Sonofa... Just stay back you!   

352
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,925
[SATOSHI]                       
The new director, I see.        

353
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:41,727
And what may we help you with?  

354
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,529
I've come to see my daughter,   
of course.                      

355
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:45,864
Is that okay?                   

356
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,466
We were in the middle           
of a rather fun                 

357
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,468
and pleasant celebration        
this evening.                   

358
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,937
May I ask that you go away?     

359
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,473
[AZAMI] Erina, come here.       

360
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,141
[ERINA] (scared breaths)        

361
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,346
[RYOKO] Erina!                  
[YUKI]                          
No, Erina-poo! You can't go!    

362
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,281
[FUMIO]                         
I thought I heard a ruckus.     

363
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:06,218
Do you seriously think you can  
just waltz back in here         

364
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,686
like nothing ever happened?     

365
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,623
It is truly astonishing         
how much nerve you have,        

366
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,158
Nakamura.                       

367
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,226
[MEGUMI] What?                  
[RYOKO] "Nakamura"?             

368
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,297
[chuckles]                      
Now, now, Ms Fumio.             

369
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,766
Haven't you heard               
I go by "Nakiri"?               

370
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,567
What's more,                    

371
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,704
that's no way to speak to a     
former dorm member, now is it?  

372
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:26,905
[ALL] (shocked gasps)           

373
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:27,906
No way!                         

374
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,708
He's a Kyokusei alumn?!         

375
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:34,646
I'll have you know that I've    
done a little bit of            
research on you, my friend,     

376
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:38,117
Master Azami - Azami Nakamura.  

377
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,319
As a 1st-year in the high school
division,                       

378
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,521
you took the No. 3 Seat         
on the Ten,                     

379
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,790
and the No. 1 Seat              
the following year.             

380
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,993
Some years later, you married   
into the Nakiri family,         

381
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:52,130
the famous clan of the so-called
Demon King of Food.             

382
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,801
From there you became a top     
star of the culinary world,     

383
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:59,337
until you were exiled           
by Master Senzaemon.            

384
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:01,473
He was a former No. 1 Seat?     

385
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:06,478
So when he was our age,         
he was already the No. 3 Seat   
on the Council of Ten.          

386
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,881
However, there's one thing      
I simply cannot abide.          

387
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,817
This man standing right here    

388
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,286
was planning to destroy         
his former dorm                 

389
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:15,821
without a second thought.       

390
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:18,890
I wasn't really trying to       
destroy it exactly.             

391
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,959
It simply became involved       

392
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,762
because of the groups           
I was trying to destroy.        

393
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,431
In any case,                    

394
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,034
you are not welcome in          
this dorm now or ever.          

395
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,003
Get out, Nakamura.              

396
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,572
Have it your way.               

397
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,374
Until next time.                

398
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:38,510
I'm glad to see that you're     
looking well, Erina.            

399
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:41,847
[AZAMI] Nothing to worry about. 

400
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,249
Erina will return to            
my side before long.            

401
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,852
I'll give her a little bit      
of freedom for now,             

402
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,654
until the time comes            
for the great revolution.       

403
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:51,256
[door opening]                  

404
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,060
Um, excuse me.                  

405
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,529
Yeah?                           
Have you come to see me off?    

406
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,663
[SOMA] Nah, it's just...        

407
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,866
Something's been                
really bugging me.              

408
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:03,068
You stayed in this dorm         
for a long time.                

409
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,137
Do you not feel anything for it?

410
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,139
Don't you have memories of      
this place, Chef Nakamura?      

411
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,876
Have I earned your scorn        
for thinking that?              

412
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:14,145
The world that I seek does not  
lie with this dorm.             

413
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,082
[AZAMI] Well, at least, not now.
[SOMA] Not now?                 

414
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:20,619
I was living here back during   
the golden age of Kyokusei.     

415
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:22,954
There was one chef that         
I looked up to, then.           

416
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,623
He was unprecedented,           
and refined.                    

417
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,626
A genius, beyond all doubt.     

418
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:30,161
He was a chef for whom I have   
the fondest of memories         

419
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,898
that only continue              
to warm my heart:               

420
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,234
Joichiro Saiba!                 

421
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:38,837
He was there at the start,      
in the bloom of my youth.       

422
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,173
His technique and skill were    
such that he made you think     

423
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,043
he was different on some        
other genetic level.            

424
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,011
So, uh...                       

425
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:50,115
You may not know this about me, 
but...                          

426
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,850
Did you say Joichiro Saiba?     

427
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,787

You mean, you're actually       
Chef Saiba's son?               

430
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,934
Yeah.                           
You knew each other, right?     

431
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,336
That's pretty cool,             
Chef Nakamura.

Who's Saiba?                    

436
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,721
Saiba is Soma's famous father.  

437
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,458
He attended Totsuki and         
was the former No. 2.           

438
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:07,659
The No. 2?!

Oh! I have a photo.             

440
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,463
We took one of him              
when he came by the dorm once.  

441
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,400
Someone that incredible         
is HIS father?

444
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29,414
[AZAMI] Well now, how much      
of this was a coincidence,      

445
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:31,683
and how much of it was          
actually planned out?           

446
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,086
[MEGUMI (gasp)                  
[SOMA] What?                    

447
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:37,823
[AZAMI] This concerns you       
as well, Soma Yukihira.         

448
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:41,493
The great revolution I've set in
motion here at Totsuki Academy, 

449
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,295
ALL of it!                      

450
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,564
Is nothing more                 
than the salvation              

451
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:49,301
of the corrupt culinary world   
that once ruined the great

soon be complete.               

455
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:58,577
I find that I'm quite lucky.

Joichiro Saiba's son            
will see it.                    

457
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:04,483
He will see what the great      
revolution will finally         
look like.
