1
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,537
[VENDOR A] Have a taste!        
[VENDOR B] Step right up!       

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,673
Hya! Hya! Hya! Hya!             

3
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,141
[YUKI] Whoa!                    

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,609
It's just like I've heard!      

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,013
China-Soc looks pretty          
formidable over there.          

6
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,948
How about some hujiao bing?     

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,817
I've got "Kinda Sorta           
Danzi Noodles" too.             

8
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,486
Hey, Yuki and Ryoko!            
Why are you here?               

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,021
What about the hotpot party?    

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,756
We're supposed to take our      
breaks in shifts now.           

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,892
More importantly, are you guys  
still in the red?!              

12
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,762
Well, um, we have a new item,   
"Kinda Sorta Danzi Noodles"     
on the menu,                    

13
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,898
so our sales are                
definitely up now.              

14
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,100
But we lost so much our first   
day that we still haven't-      

15
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,769
Are you for real?!              

16
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,437
[KUGA] Hey, Soma!               
[SOMA] Huh?                     

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,905
Oh, what's up, Chef Kuga?       

18
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,307
Care to try out a hujiao bing?  
[KUGA] No thanks!               

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,111
So, hey, I hear you've been out 
and about scurrying around      
at all hours.                   

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,580
It's nice that you've           
fleshed out the menu a bit,     

21
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,448
but it's already day three.     

22
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,185
Your struggling business out in 
front of my establishment       

23
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,254
is proofing to be               
a bit of an eyesore.            

24
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,590
Would you mind just             
closing up your shop?           
Like just close it up right now!

25
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,659
My whole life, I'll never forget
that you were here!             

26
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,195
So, c'mon! Don't just walk,     
run and close up shop.          

27
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,663
Do it! Just get out!            
Beat it, right now!             

28
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,665
C'mon, c'mon! You can do it!    
It's not hard!                  

29
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,400
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!     

30
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,001
That's making me so angry!      
[KUGA] Shutter those doors!     

31
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,404
[MAN] Whoa, look at this line!  
What kinda shop is this?        

32
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:14,473
I heard it's Sichuan cusine.    
You wanna try?                  

33
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,207
Oh? Hello there!                

34
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,410
Sorry, but please move to the   
very back of the line, 'kay?    

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,214
We at Kuga Chinese Restaurant   
are waiting to serve you        
with all our heart!             

36
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,416
I don't know why Soma           
would do this to himself        

37
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,818
and take on a challenge he's    
got no chance of winning?       

38
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,089
He's just way too reckless.     
Not that this is anything       
new of course.                  

39
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,292
You know, Soma said             
something yesterday.            

40
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,561
[Both] (huh)                    
[MEGUMI] About China-Soc:       

41
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:40,099
Do you think EVERYTHING about   
their shop is 100% perfect      
all of the time?                

42
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,633
So, you know...                 

43
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,034
But I mean...                   

44
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,569
Look at how much traffic        
they're getting!                

45
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,171
Even so...                      

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,541
Soma keeps going.               
He hasn't given up.             

47
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,612
[music playing]                 

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,240
Hya! Hya! Hya! Hya!

[whoops of delight]             

50
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,247
[SOMA] For real?                

51
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,183
[laughing]                      
That's a big help!              

52
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,451
Yeah, thanks for doing this,    
Tomita!                         

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,920
Okay, he's agreed to            
get things ready for us.        

54
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,124
Next, I think I'd like to get a 
whole bunch of you know what,   

55
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,526
because what we have isn't      
gonna cut it anymore.           

56
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,728
I might be able to do           
something about that.           

57
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,264
You just keep working           
on your dish, all right.        

58
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,432
Yeah!                           

59
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,471
Ah! Hello, Master?              
That you?                       

60
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,539
I have a favor to ask, if I can.

61
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,883
I'm finished.                   

62
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,284
Soma, you're amazing!           

63
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,619
With this,                      
you might be able to...         

64
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,154
Yeah! Let's go do this!         

65
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,690
Tomorrow's Saturday.            

66
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,958
We're gonna have more           
visitors than ever.             

67
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:48,560
It's perfect!                   

68
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,433
[KUGA] Good morning, gentlemen! 

69
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:58,771
Yesterday, we of China-Soc      
once again got first place      
in earnings!                    

70
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,371
You have my gratitude.          

71
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,640
Let's give it our all           
again today!                    

72
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,975
We got this!                    

73
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,644
[MEMBERS] Sir!

Stand back, mysterious men      
of foul cuisine!                

80
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,531
Gastron, yeah! You're so cool!  

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,668
So awesome! They've the         
legendary cooking manga         
"Knife-kun Akiro"!

The whole series,               
in first editions!              

83
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,072
That's SUPER rare!              

84
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,540
[WOMAN] That smells wonderful!  
[MAN] Oh, I love this!          

85
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,342

[MAN] That's awesome!

[WOMAN 2] Me too!

[WOMAN 4] What an aroma!

[WOMAN] So spicy!               

90
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,350
But it's incredible!            

91
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,685
Hya! Hya! Hya! Hya!             

92
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,687
[MEMBER] Um, Master Kuga!       
You should see this.            

93
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,122
Hmm?                            

94
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,359
[MEGUMI] Wow...                 
[SOMA] (chuckling) All right!   

95
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,361
Thanks! Sorry for all           
the trouble, man.               

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,430
No problem,                     
happy to do it for you.         

97
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,900
Besides, they were just         
sitting in the arcade's         
storage room anyway.            

98
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,371
But you know, that shop over is 
on a whole different level.     

99
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,439
You really think benches        
will do the trick?              

100
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,907
Totally!                        
These are great!                

101
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,909
In fact, let me make you        
something to eat!               

102
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,377
It's my way of saying thanks!   

103
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,845
Oh, you mean it?!               

104
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,581
It's been so long since         
I've had your food!             

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,051
I'm always ready for the flavors
of some "Yukihira" cooking!     

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,188
Not too creative,               
is it, Soma?                    
[SOMA] (huh?)                   

107
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,125
THIS is the best you could come 
up with when challenging me?    

108
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:30,329
Expecting guests to come just   
because you've put out more     
chairs is a little too naive,   

109
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,397
even for you, don't you think?  

110
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,601
You will never be able to       
equal me in pure taste.         

111
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,071
Although it may be true,        
this is my first Lunar Fest.    

112
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,407
After all, I just barely        
transferred here                
six months ago.                 

113
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,544
But when it comes to setting up 
shop and running a business,    

114
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,982
you better believe I'm YOUR     
senior by about a good          
10 years, Chef Kuga!            

115
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:55,154
What?                           
Is this guy really doing this?  
[MEMBER 2] Mapo tofu!           

116
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,591
I can't believe he's actually   
challenging Terunori Kuga       
head-on with mapo tofu?!        

117
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,029
Hey, Soma! Here ya go!          
[SOMA] Okay!                    

118
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,830
[MEMBER 3]                      
He added NOODLES to it!         

119
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,034
Mapo noodles? Well, he may have 
changed things up a little bit, 

120
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,969
but I mean, that hardly         
makes it a new dish!            

121
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,306
If he really thinks THAT has    
enough impact to take on        
China-Soc,                      

122
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,308
he's in for a rude awakening.   

123
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,909
[MEMBER]  <gah!>                
[MEMBER 4] What's that?!        

124
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,378
[MEMBER 2]                      
It's a giant meatball!          

125
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,046
It's like I told you earlier... 

126
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,981
I'm going to beat               
you with my cooking!            

127
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,783
[humphf!] Let's go.             

128
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,785
There's nothing special about   
some ball of meat!              

129
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,655
It may have lots of style       
but it garners no substance!    

130
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,923
It's ridiculous!                

131
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,591
<i> That meatball...</i>               

132
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,858
Here you go, Tomita.            

133
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,593
Thank you very much!            

134
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,063
Oh wow!                         
What did you make here, Soma?   

135
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,532
Oh, you'll see. First,          
I want you to try some of it    

136
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,000
without breaking up             
the meatball.                   

137
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,502
[TOMITA] Oh, okay.              

138
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,005
[slurping]                      

139
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,008
[shocked]<i> Now this is the</i>       
<i> "Yukihira," I've been missing!</i> 

140
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,410
<i> Their mapo tofu!</i>               

141
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,679
<i> The flavor's so good,</i>          
<i> so balanced,</i>                   

142
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,147
<i> I could eat it every day!</i>      

143
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,416
<i> These noodles make</i>             
<i> the perfect addition.</i>          

144
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,484
<i> That Soma's a genius!</i>          

145
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,053
<i> But...</i>                         

146
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,223
[KUGA] Sorry for the wait!      
Here's your Kuga                
Chinese Restaurant              

147

148
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,762
[MAN] SO SPICY!                 
[MAN 2] My face is on fire!     

149
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:11,430
[WOMAN] Help! I can't stop!     

150
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,699
There's no way he can           
go up against THAT.             

151
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,366
That guy is unbeatable!         

152
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,503
His cooking style is            
just too powerful!              

153
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,904
[SOMA] I'm not so sure...       
[TOMITA] What?                  

154
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,442
Keeping your customers 100%     
satisfied is hard to do.        

155
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,912
Something can go wrong even for 
a pro with decades under him.   

156
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,717
[MAN] I'm tired of waiting...   
[WOMAN] We haven't moved yet.   

157
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,386
How much longer until we were   
finally able to go inside?      

158
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,456
Excuse me, sir, when the        
restaurant is this crowded,     

159
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,325
we ask that you please give up  
your seat within                
20 minutes of eating.           

160
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,795
What? But I just barely         
finished eating my meal!        

161
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,529
The line just keeps going.      

162
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,466
I wanted to try some authentic  
Sichuan cuisine, but geez...    

163
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,067
I'm hungry, mama!               

164
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,470
[MAN] Still nothing?!           
[WOMAN] I'm tired of waiting!   

165
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,540
[BOY] Mom, I'm starving!        
[WOMAN 2]                       
I'm just about done with this!  

166
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,541
[MAN] I wanna EAT!              
[WOMAN 3] I have had it!        

167
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,009
[TOMITA] Ah...                  
[discontented crowd]            

168
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,677
[SOMA] I've been watching       
this whole time,                

169
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,814
but until today, I wasn't       
able to find it:                

170
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,417
the flaw of                     
Kuga Chinese Restaurant.        

171
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,222
Hey, Tomita, would you please   
dunk that meatball into the     
mapo tofu and break it up.      

172
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,358
Oh, yeah, okay.                 

173
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,359
I'll just smoosh this a little, 
and...                          

174
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,229
[whoosh!]                       
[BOTH] (shocked!)

176
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,266
[evil chuckle]                  

177
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,705
[TOMITA] It's the Moon!         
I see the MOON!                 

178
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,512
This heavenly aroma...          
I'm absolutely positive!        

179
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:37,916
It's curry! That savory         
fragrance that always brings    
a smile to everyone's face!     

180
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,384
What kind of dish is that?      

181
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,120
Is that curry in mapo tofu?!    

182
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,721
I've never tried                
anything like that!             

183
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,390
[TOMITA]                        
That "Moon" continues to melt,  

184
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,725
blending with the mapo tofu.    

185
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,861
Well, that should               
just about do it.               

186
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,063
I'd say it's the best time      
to eat, if I were you.          

187
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,531
Enjoy, my friend!               

188
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,366
[slurping]                      

189
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,737
[joyous laughter]               

190
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,805
<i> What is this deliciousness?!</i>   

191
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,943
<i> It's aromatic and spicy,</i>       
<i> stimulating but with</i>           
<i> a gentle smoothness.</i>           

192
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,080
<i> It's enveloping my body</i>        
<i> and seeping into my bones!</i>     

193
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:12,550
<i> It's like Soma has invented</i>    
<i> a whole new style</i>              
<i> of Chinese food!</i>               

194
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,619
The soup is made                
with beef bones,                

195
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,222
along with select spices        
of garlic and ginger,           

196
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,225
which are put into a broth      
to ultimately make that         
curry flavor                    

197
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,427
creating the "Moon" inside.     

198
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,430
The broth is thickened with     
gelatin and wrapped in          
a hujiao patty                  

199
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,299
that's delicately fried.        

200
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,767
The meat won't fall apart,      

201
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,903
and the curry flavor slowly     
seeps into the mapo.            

202
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:36,775
This is the "Yukihira No. 2,

203
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,777
That sounds                     
freakin' awesome, man!          

204
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,647
All this aroma...               
I can't take it!

more than half of them!         

210
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,466

of high demand!

<i> That meat patty, from the</i>

215
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:18,349

two mapo curries, please.       

236
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,023
[MAN 3] Can I get one           
of those danzi noodles?         

237
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,160
I bet you're just about to      
break, my little, Soma.         

238
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,895
[MEGUMI] Oh, god!               
[clamoring for food]            

239
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:39,498
I don't think I can keep up with
all the orders anymore, Soma!   

240
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,166
I'd say it's about that time.   

241
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,235
Huh? Time for what?             

242
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,305
[MEGUMI] (startled gasp)        

243
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,441
So, on that day,                
when everything counts,         

244
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,043
I'd like to enlist your help.   

245
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,045
It doesn't look like you'll     
be putting up your own shop,    

246
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:54,579
so can I count on you for this? 

247
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:58,050
I'll need to do some type       
of visual training.             

248
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:01,053
That will speed things up a lot 
for when the time comes.        

249
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:02,987
It's far more effective         
for me to do it                 

250
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,790
in the same environment as      
the person I'll be copying.     

251
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,126
I'll need to borrow             
your kitchen.                   

252
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,063
That's just like you, Mimasaka. 
Sure.                           

253
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,599
Thanks, again.                  
And here ya go.                 

254
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,702
[SOMA] I'm counting on you.     

255
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,606
[MAYUMI] Um, is anybody here?   

256
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,407
[frightened]                    

257
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,543
Order is up!                    

258
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,944
Thank you!                      

259
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,680
One mapo tofu?                  
Sure, coming right up!          

260
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,482
Soma Yukihira's the name.       

261
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,218
I'm gonna have to show          
Chef Kuga what's what!          

262
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:37,022
And I'm 10 years more senior    
than that Chef Kuga twerp!      

263
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,158
Why didn't you just             
say that from the start?        

264
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,228
That guy's the No. 4 best       
from the Fall Selection!        
[MEMBER 2] It's Mimasaka!       

265
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,432
[scoffing] So he has one more   
person helping him, so what?    

266
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,702
You made sure to memorize that  
recipe I gave you yesterday,    
yeah?                           

267
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:53,505
Don't start questioning my      
perfect copying abilities now.  

268
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:57,976
I'm about to show you the       
results of ALL MY YEARS         
of dedicated visual training.   

269
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,845
Okay! In that case...           

270
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,848
[BOTH] Kuga Chinese Restaurant  
eat your words!                 

271
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,917
Hya! Hya! Hya! Hya!             

272
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:11,056
I need an order of              
Mapo Curry Noodles for 10!      
[BOTH] Yeah! Got it!            

273
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:15,694
[TOMITA] Amazing! That big guy  
over there is able to move just 
as lightening quick as Soma!    

274
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:18,663
[BOTH] Order is up!             

275
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,799
I don't believe it!             
It's as if...                   

276
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,601
there are now TWO               
Soma Yukihiras!                 

277
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,338
[MAN] This is great!            
[WOMAN] It's delicious!         

278
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,074
You really helped me out,       
big time, Mimaska.              

279
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:31,210
I appreciate you getting        
me through all this.            

280
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:36,481
It's because I have a           
great debt that I owe you.      
[SOMA] Wait, what was that?     

281
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,752
It's nothing. This is no for us 
time to stand around and talk!  

282
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:42,087
We've got more customers coming!

283
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,756
[WOMAN] Hujiao Bing             
looks tasty, doesn't it?        

284
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,558
[BOY] Mommy, let's get this!    
[OLD MAN] I'll take three!      

285
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,961
Megumi, help me out.            
[MEGUMI] Sure!                  

286
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,163
[MEGUMI]                        
Please have a seat over here.   

287
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:53,165
[OLD MAN] Oh, thank you.        

288
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,566
[MEGUMI]                        
Would you prefer to use a spoon?

289
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,102
[MOM] Ah, yes, I would.         
Thank you very much!            

290
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,838
[MEGUMI] There should be plenty 
of room for your stroller here. 

291
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,840
[MAN                            
Ah, thank you. That's great!    

292
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,109
[TOMITA]<i> She's so good</i>          
<i> with the customers!</i>            

293
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,511
<i> This girl's incredible!</i>        

294
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,781
Thanks for everything.          
That was yummy!                 

295
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,716
That looks wonderful.           

296
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,986
<i> What the customers want</i>        
<i> is to know which</i>               
<i> dishes are heavy</i>               

297
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,922
<i> and which are light before</i>     
<i> deciding on which one to order.</i>

298
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,258
<i> I'm using everything</i>           
<i> I learned at the Stagiaire!</i>    

299
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,860
[BOTH] OH, YEAH!                

300
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,261
And then it just hit me!        

301
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,730
It's going to be great!         

302
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,865
[hm?]                           
What, exactly, just "hit" you?  

303
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,867
I will need to do               
some prep work.                 

304
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,537
Ryo, come with me. Come on!     
[RYO] Okay.                     

305
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,272
Ah, where are you going?        

306
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,940
Go ahead and make the curry,    
Akira!                          

307
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,944
And use some spices that are    
a good fit for cacao!           

308
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,280
[AKIRA] What? Cacao? But...     
Hey, Alice!                     

309
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,216
[exasperated sigh]              

310
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,885
Get a move on, Ryo.             
[RYO] 'kay.                     

311
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,759
[SOMA] It should be             
getting dark pretty soon.       

312
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:57,028
Yeah, sorry.                    
I don't think it'll be too long.

313
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,165
[MASTER] Megumi!                
Sorry to keep you waiting.      

314
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,235
[MEGUMI] Master!                
[MASTER] Go ahead and set       
them all up, please.            

315
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:05,970
The Regional Cuisine Society    
is proud to bring you           

316
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,173
our prized collection of        
lanterns from across Japan!     

317
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,975
[MEMBERS] (cheering)            

318
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,779
[GIRL] So pretty...             
[WOMAN] They're lovely,         
aren't they?                    

319
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,848
[GIRL 2] Wow!                   
[crowd approves]                

320
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,585
Look at that one! It says       
"Jiufen," like in Taiwan.       

321
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,320
Oh my gosh, it totally makes me 
want to eat some hujiao bing!   

322
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,724
Thank you for setting           
all of this up for us.          
They're so beautiful!           

323
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,661
Even after I said I couldn't    
help with your own booth.       

324
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:31,997
I must admit I was very         
surprised to hear you           
passed on helping us out.       

325
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,867
But I knew there must be a      
pretty good reason              
for you to do so.               

326
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,735
I know you take this            
seriously,                      

327
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,803
and you're not the type to      
back out of something lightly.  

328
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,540
Thank you, sir!                 
I appreciate that.              

329
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,208
[WOMAN] What's with             
all those lanterns?             

330
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,343
[WOMAN 2] Let's go take a look. 
[MAN] Something smells good!    

331
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,612
[OLD LADY] Is one "Pickled Plum"
ticket enough?                  

332
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,948
[MEGUMI]                        
Yes, but you'll have to wait    
a bit for the hujiao bing.      

333
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,951
[MAN]                           
One order of noodles, please!   
[MEGUMI] Okay, coming up!       

334
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:56,755
I'll have a mapo curry noodle.  
[OLD LADY] One Kinda Sorta Danzi
Noodle bowl, please.            

335
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,958
[MEGUMI] Sure!                  
Everyone please stay in line.   
I'm really sorry!               

336
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,827
Sure enough, it's gotten        
kinda tough with just the       
three of us working.            

337
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,897
But we have to                  
keep going, or else             

338
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,232
China-Soc will roll right       
over us like we're nothing.     

339
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,767
Hey, hey, hey!                  

340
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,370
What seems to be the trouble    
over there, little Soma?        

341
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:13,038
Come on, don't you get it?      

342
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,106
No matter how many              
customers you get,              

343
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,042
at that pace,                   
you'll never beat me!           

344
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,244
Hya! Hya! Hya! Hya!             

345
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,513
Excuse me, please!              

346
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,582
Can someone come over here      
and clear this table?           

347
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,983
Okay, I'll be right there!      

348
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:26,518
Two mapo curry noodles, please! 

349
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,587
I'm still waiting on            
my hujiao bing?                 

350
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,322
[MEGUMI] Ah! One moment, please!

351
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,124
Megumi's doing too much.        

352
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,326
I'll have to go cook up         
the hujiao bing.                

353
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:35,928
I've gotta leave this to you!   

354
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,462
You big dumb idiot!             

355
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,398
If you step away from           
that stove now,                 

356
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
you're throwing away            
your chance at winning!         

357
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,136
Megumi, you tend to             
the customers.                  

358
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,472
As for the hujiao bing...       

359
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,673
I'll handle that.               
[MEGUMI] Wait, what?!           

360
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,742
Meat-Meat!                      
What about Bowl-Soc?            

361
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,411
I left that to the youngsters.  

362
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,012
And when it comes               
to hujiao bing,                 

363
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,214
I've tasted one of these        
things before.                  

364
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,051
So you don't have to            
explain the recipe to me!       

365
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,490
[IKUMI]                         
When cooking the hujiao bing,   

366
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:08,026
you need to make sure the       
exterior is crispy              
but not burned.                 

367
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,898
That's the best way to have all 
the meaty juices rest in the    
face of that flickering flame.  

368
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,367
It's where the flavors          
come together.                  

369
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,302
That way you can                
do it perfectly,                

370
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:20,572
even with your eyes closed.     
[gasp]                          

371
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,842
Some fresh baked hujiao bing!   
Eat up!                         

372
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,712
Meat-Meat, thanks a lot!        
[MEGUMI] Thanks so much         
for your help!                  

373
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:31,850
[gleeful laugh]<i> These two have</i>  
<i> worked together before,</i>        
<i> in our shopping arcade!</i>        

374
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:36,054
<i> When she joins the fight,</i>      
<i> she's a force you know</i>         
<i> you can count on!</i>              

375
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:39,991
[TAKUMI] AHEM! It would seem    
you're having a little          
trouble, Soma.                  

376
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,260
I cannot sit idly by!           

377
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,596
Very well!                      
I mean, if you insist.          

378
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,399
I am not averse to lending you  
this winning hand of mine!      

379
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,001
Yeah, and I'll go boil          
the noodles for you.            

380
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,136
That'd be a big help to me!     

381
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,005
Now, hold on, Isami!            

382
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,406
Listen to me, Soma.             

383
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:57,409
This is Terunori Kuga           
you've just challenged.         

384
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:59,945
And there's no way I can allow  
you to go down like this,       

385
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:02,281
not without a fight.            
[SOMA] (chuckles)               

386
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:04,816
Well then, it's                 
do-or-die time, Takumi.         

387
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,285
You wanna come with?            

388
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,153
[TAKUMI] A foolish question!    

389
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,091
<i> Aldini...</i>                      

390
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,760
<i> It took me a long time</i>         
<i> to be this fast.</i>               

391
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,097
<i> But look at him.</i>               
<i> He's doing it so easily.</i>       

392
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,098
What's wrong over there,        
Mimasaka?                       

393
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,233
You're looking pretty slow!     

394
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,369
Shut up!                        
I'm just getting started!       

395
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,006
Huh!                            
I'll believe it when I see it!  

396
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,917
<i> In the end, THIS has become</i>    
<i> a GREAT restaurant.</i>

00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:41,386
[happy chatter]                 

398
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,055
<i> I get it.</i>                      

399
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,858
<i> So then, Soma Yukihira,</i>        

400
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,993
<i> it took you four days,</i>         

401
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,262
<i> but you've finally</i>             
<i> completed your restaurant?!</i>    

402
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:52,464
It's almost time to             
tally up the sales.             

403
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,132
Just one hour left.             

404
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,868
It's the last spurt, guys!      

405
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,135
Let's do this!                  

406
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,804
[ALL] Yeah!                     

407
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,540
Just watching is such an        
emotional experience...         

408
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:04,743
[KANICHI] (gaaah!)              
They got me all emotional!      

409
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,678
[TOMITA] Hm?                    
[KANICHI] Hm?

412
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,892
[YUME] And now, the sales       
rankings for the Central Area.  

413
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:28,033
In third place, from the Spanish
Cuisine Research Society,       
is "El Fuego."                  

414
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,102
In second place...              

415
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:33,272
China-Soc's                     
"Kuga Chinese Restaurant."

[grrr...] Damn you, Soma,       
you WILL PAY FOR THIS!          

417
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,849
[URARA] And in first place is...

418
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:48,454
Soma Yukihira with his          
little stall!

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,457
You did it, Soma!               

421
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,392
I can't believe it, Soma!       

422
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,527
Guess this means you're not     
in the red anymore.             

423
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,129
You were pretty great           
out there, Mimasaka.            

424
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:01,467
Yeah, right back at ya, Aldini. 

425
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,338
[ALL] You're welcome, everyone! 

426
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,774

427
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,580
[music playing]                 

428
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,408
[WOMAN] Wow, so pretty!         

429
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,476
What is that on top of          
the curry there?                

430
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,879
Is that really chocolate?       

431
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:23,215
[giggle] Yes, it is!            

432
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,818
And it was made using these     
3D food printers over here!     

433
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,555
[WOMAN]                         
Huh? Food from a printer?       

434
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:34,292
Yes! It's 80% cacao chocolate   
mixed with spices and           
rendered in the machines.       

435
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:36,561
Let me explain how              
the chocolate works.            

436
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,032
When used as a topping,         
it slowly melts into the curry, 

437
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,901
changing the flavor profile to  
give it more "brightness"!      

438
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,305
[WOMAN 2] It smells so          
wonderful, like the curry       
itself is going to melt!        

439
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,973
[GIRL] Daddy! Buy me one!       

440
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:49,575

[MAN 2] Give me a bowl!

[MAN 3] I'll take three!        

442
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:55,380
People like it, and a wide      
range of customers too.         

443
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,917
[giggle] This single item has   
totally turned things around.   

444
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,919
And we'll be going up           
in the rankings.                

445
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,988
At this rate,                   
we'll turn a profit.            

446
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:06,458
Yes! But more than anything,    
we've actually made the         
customers happy.                

447
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:07,992
Thank goodness, right?!

Oh, it's coming right up!

Sorry for the wait, madam.      

451

Oh, Akira, you're smiling!

You're getting along            
with your friends.

That makes me so very           
happy to see!

456
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,746
All the guests have             
arrived, correct?               

457
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:31,083
Yes, Ms Erina.                  
All but one, of course.         

458
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:34,553
I made sure to once again       
leave one of our tables         
empty for tonight,              

459
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,621
and in a prime location.        

460
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:38,090
Thank you.                      

461

[ERINA] It's "just-in-case."
