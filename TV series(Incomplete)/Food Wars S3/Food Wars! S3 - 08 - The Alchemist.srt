1
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:06,004
[EIZAN] I've assembled          
50 loyal soldiers.              

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,340
And in less than an hour's time,

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,410
I'll receive word that they've  
cleared out your whole dorm.    

4
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,744
So, you see, Soma,              

5
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,681
your friends are in a           
real tight pinch right now.     

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,815
Vexing, isn't it?               

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,550
Your beloved dorm               
will be torn down               

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,684
right in front of you.          

9
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,286
And there's nothing you can do. 

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,089
Whether you win this Food War   
or not, it's all pointless.     

11
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,192
Yet you STILL want to do this?  

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,265
Go get 'em, guys! Force those   
worthless nobodies out!         

13
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,569
[ALL] (gasps)                   

14
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,438
[ALL] (concerned noises)        

15
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,574
[MEGUMI] No... No!              
They can't win!                 

16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,577
If we do nothing, they're       
gonna tear down our dorm!       

17
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,446
And that can't happen!          

18
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,718
[music playing]                 

19
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,309
[TAKUMI] Etsuya Eizan...        

20
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,112
Truly despicable!               

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,379
Come on, Soma!                  

22
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,915
[SOMA] Hey, uh, Chef Eizan?     

23
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,452
If I win this Food War,         
that twisted idea of yours,     

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,056
to knock down Kyokusei Dorm     
will SURELY be cancelled.       

25
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,324
[SOMA] Right?                   
[EIZAN] Huh?                    

26
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,459
Well, yeah,                     
of course it will, but...       

27
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,728
That's all that                 
actually counts then.           

28
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,597
I'll just focus on cooking!     

29
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,266
Oh? Well...                     

30
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,135
Then what do you intend         
to make for us?                 

31
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,869
I'll be doing gyoza.            

32
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,671
Did you say gyoza?              

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,673
Hah! Gyoza, huh?                

34
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,075
So, he'll be taking             
quality ingredients             

35
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,476
to make us a commoner's dish?   

36
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,745
It is quite a novel idea,       
though.                         

37
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,880
It's something, I guess.        

38
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,281
But if you don't do it right,   

39
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,149
the Satsuma chicken's           
all-important back flavor       

40
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,817
will end up lost.               

41
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,419
Well, you just wait and see!    

42
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,955
You need to quit hovering around
the place, Rindo!               

43
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,022
[RINDO] Hmm?                    

44
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,424
I meant Chef.                   

45
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,226
[SOMA]<i> Now that the</i>             
<i> chicken's broken down,</i>         

46
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,695
<i> it needs to be covered</i>         
<i> and allowed to rest.</i>           

47
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,165
<i> In the meantime, I'll mince</i>    
<i> scallions, cabbage,</i>            
<i> and shiitake.</i>                  

48
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,167
<i> Then do the same to</i>            
<i> ginger and garlic.</i>             

49
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:54,572
<i> For seasoning, I'll mix soy</i>    
<i> sauce, black pepper,</i>           
<i> and oyster sauce.</i>              

50
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,910
This little jerk doesn't        
have a chance in Hell.          
[SOMA] (hmm?)                   

51
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,847
Okay, Soma, you can go ahead    
and drop the act, all right?    

52
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,049
We already know who's           
going to win today.             

53
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,918
Your home is about to be gone.  

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,855
This is what happens when you   
play the hero and challenge     
me to a Food War.               

55
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,190
So just admit it!               

56
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,325
Your will to cook has           
already been broken!            

57
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,459
You have nothing left to offer! 

58
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,662
You hear what he                
just said to you?               

59
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,000
Tell me. Have they all been     
forced out of the dorm, yet?    

60
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,935
[EIZAN'S THUG]                  
Uh, no, see, the thing is...    
[EIZAN] Huh?                    

61
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,604
Hose 'em down!                  

62
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,538
[ALL] (waah!)                   

63
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,073
They're like super prepared!    

64
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,275
[screams coming from phone]     

65
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,479
[MEGUMI] They can't win!        
If we do nothing,               

66
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,280
they're gonna tear              
down our dorm!                  

67
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,815
And that can't happen!          

68
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,952
[FUMIO] I figured you kids      
would say something like that.  

69
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,587
Ms Fumio!                       

70
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,958
So, um... what are these?       

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,628
They are the great remnants of  
the Golden Age of Kyokusei Dorm.

72
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,097
Back then,                      
students always came after us.  

73
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,966
They were angry at the          
progress we were making.        

74
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:58,503
We were constantly under attack 
by those of weaker              
culinary talent.                

75
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,238
I didn't know that at all!      

76
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,907
B-but,                          
no matter how much we endure,   

77
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,176
the results of a Food War       
won't ever change.              

78
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,513
[mmh]                           
But right this very minute,     

79
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,182
Soma's out there fighting       
for us, all alone.              
So at least...                  

80
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,252
[ZENJI] Even if it's just until 
he finishes his challenge...    

81
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,789
We must protect this dorm,      
no matter what it takes.        

82
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:21,192
We cannot sit back and allow    
Soma to fight this battle for   
us all on his own.              

83
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,995
Kyokusei!                       

84
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,663
FIGHT!                          

85
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,965
[ALL] Yeah!                     

86
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,601
[bombs whistling]               

87
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,503
[screams]                       

88
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,541
<i> What's going on?!</i>              

89
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,208
<i> Why will none of them yield?!</i>  

90
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,810
Hey, Chef Eizan.                

91
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,347
You seem the type who doesn't   
like to confront people head on.

92
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,616
You like to sneak around,       
talk in the shadows.            

93
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,219
But if you wanna say something, 

94
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,722
could you just put it           
on a plate?                     

95
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,690
[EIZAN] As you wish, Soma.      

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,893
In the end,                     
it has to be cooking, right?    

97
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,029
Is that what it's going         
to take to break you.           

98
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,833
Oh yes! We get to eat something 
Chef Eizan has perfected!       

99
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,670
That'll actually  make it worth 
playing along with this charade.

100
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,105
Good, I've decided the menu.    

101
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,308
I'll make a Satsuma dish so     
succulent it can't be denied.   

102
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,578
One that makes full use of      
all its flavors.                

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,913
Be sure you taste this, Soma.   

104
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,248
You'll love it!                 

105
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,119
Then you'll know how great the  
divide between us really is.    

106
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,589
Given the ingredients and       
seasonings he's chosen,         

107
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,525
is he making what               
I think he's making?            

108
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,595
[JUDGE] Ooooh! He put the       
whole bird in ths pot!          

109
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,831
This is all so exciting!        

110
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,002
I'll let it sit like this       
for about 30 minutes.           

111
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:41,473
The residual heat will gently   
warm the chicken's interior.    
Slow and low!                   

112
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:46,812
Using this method, it allows for
the Satsuma chicken's inherent  
softness to stay nicely intact, 

113
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:50,282
while working to develop a mild 
yet exquisite flavor.           

114
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,417
When you're using               
a whole bird like this,         

115
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,419
knowing exactly how much        
heat must be applied            

116
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,821
really wuestions your skill set.

117
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,423
While it's cooking, you can take
the skin and pan-fry it,        

118
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,292
slowly drawing out the juices.  

119
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,227
Yeah, and you can take          
that grease,                    

120
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,096
which has a smooth and          
delicate richness,              

121
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:08,400
add some garlic and ginger, and 
stir-fry it with uncooked rice. 

122
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,104
What the hell are you           
looking at, Soma?               

123
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,905
[SOMA] Well, you know,          
it's kinda like,                

124
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:18,109
"Wow, look at that, Chef Eizan's
actually made something."       

125
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,980
[laughing] Sure enough, Soma,   
you are just the absolute best! 

126
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,715
And I know how you feel.        

127
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:27,585
Eizan looks more like an        
intellectual gangster than      
anything, huh?                  

128
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,123
But this guy, he's way more     
fearsome than you would think.  

129
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,392
If he wasn't nose-deep in       
his consulting business,        

130
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,862
he could probably take out      
a few members of the Ten        

131
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,064
If y'know what I'm              
talkin' about?                  

132
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,937
[KAGEURA] First off, please     
state why you decided to take   
the exam for this school.       

133
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,206
If you would, please?           

134
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,641
To make some money, of course.  

135
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,744
[KAGEURA]                       
<i> From his first year at school,</i> 

136
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,746
<i> the money Eizan made from</i>      
<i> his consulting business</i>        

137
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,016
<i> far outstripped the income</i>     
<i> of any other student.</i>          

138
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,085
<i> He made full use of</i>            
<i> Totsuki's connections,</i>         

139
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:03,689
<i> and went on to be involved</i>     
<i> in over 5,000 dealings!</i>        

140
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,025
<i> Differing cases,</i>               
<i> differing fields...</i>            

141
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,560
<i> His delivery on everything</i>     
<i> was beyond perfection.</i>         

142
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:13,031
<i> Without a mastery of</i>           
<i> countless cooking styles,</i>      
<i> or a deep sense of "taste,"</i>    

143
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,234
<i> such a feat would be</i>           
<i> utterly impossible.</i>            

144
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,904
<i> He has brought to this school</i>  
<i> an enormous amount of profit.</i>  

145
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,374
<i> And his acceptance into</i>        
<i> the Ten was unanimous.</i>         

146
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,843
<i> Chef Eizan is indeed</i>           
<i> "The Alchemist"!</i>               

147
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,180
<i> No other man is more suited</i>    
<i> for such a title!</i>              

148
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:36,789
[ISAMI] Look, he's making the   
soup at the same time that      
he's cooking the rice.          

149
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,592
The leftover broth from the     
chicken has a subtle            
and refined umami.              

150
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,727
he's using that to              
cook the Jasmine rice.          

151
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,063
You may be a lousy              
restauranteur,                  

152
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,866
but today, at least,            
you will not be judged on sales!

153
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,203
Lest you forget, Soma Yukihira, 
you challenged ME.              

154
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,939
How can you come out here having
planned nothing in advance!     

155
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,209
Know your folly, boy, and begone
from this school forever!       

156
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,079
[SOMA] Sure, I've got nothing   
you could call a "strategy,"    

157
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:03,681
but it's not like I challenged  
you without at least SOME       
chance of winning.              

158
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,151
[EIZAN] Huh?                    
[SOMA] As it so happens,        

159
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,287
I'm using this Food War to      
show you something.             

160
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,756
And on that note...             

161
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,958
If you judges could please wait 
a bit, you'll see it too!       

162
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,161
That should do it!              

163
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,095
What's he doing?                

164
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,563
That is no ordinary gyoza!      

165
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,832
He didn't make his              
gyoza skins out of flour!       

166
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,236
He's used the skin from         
the chicken itself!             

167
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,505
[RINDO] Oh, I see.              

168
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,041
So he removed the large         
and small bones,                

169
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:34,379
then added his gyoza filling    
in there to make a Satsuma      
Chicken Gyoza. Is that it?      

170
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:35,581
You got that right, chef!       

171
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,917
Yummy! What a lovely aroma!     

172
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,719
Ground pork, scallions,         
cabbage, and shiitake...        

173
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,323
All that umami gets added       
to diced pork jowl.             

174
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,925
Hurry it up, Soma!              
Start frying that stuff already!

175
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,194
You plan on eatin' some too,    
Chef Rindo?                     

176
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,997
Well, I guess I could go ahead  
and put some aside for you.     

177
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,733
Listen here, little boy,        
you don't need to bother        

178
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,068
making any of that stuff        
for us, all right?              

179
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,805
We try to avoid eating          
second-rate cuisine.            

180
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,607
That should be obvious.         
[JUDGE 3]                       
We have standards, you know.    

181
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:05,077
Who are these judges?           
I've never seen them before.    

182
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
They all do business with Eizan 
in one way or another.          

183
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,882
They carry weight in            
the culinary world,             

184
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,084
as well as being involved       
with Central.                   

185
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:15,087
So make no mistake, you've      
got your hands full today.      

186
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,621
Yeah?                           

187
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,156
Just so you know,               

188
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,692
this dish here was popular      
with the customers back home.   

189
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:25,364
Rindo Kobayashi! You, too,      
are one of the core members     
of Central are you not?         

190
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,433
Would you say a dish of this    
level is even worth our time?   

191
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,034
Cause I'm not sure it is.       

192
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,170
Listen, I'm the type            
who will eat anything,          

193
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,773
and then make up my mind        
after it's all said and done.   

194
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:37,709
Hah! But using pork jowl        
as an ingredient?               

195
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:42,581
Don't you see that simply kills 
the delicate and sublime flavor 
of the Satsuma chicken?         

196
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,183
I can tell without trying.      

197
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,452
THIS IS A USELESS EXERCISE!     

198
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,120
Do you get it now, Soma?        

199
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,789
That's sadly the full extent    
of your cooking.                

200
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,725
Go on, just leave already.      

201
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,327
Sorry for making you            
a part of this farce.           

202
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,729
Please, enjoy.                  

203
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,598
[JUDGE] It's Hainan jifan!      

204
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,467
It's also known as "kao mangai,"

205
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,136
or "Singapore chicken rice."    
It's made all over the world.   

206
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:08,340
[JUDGE 2] It's a very popular   
dish in southeast Asia,         
a standard menu item!           

207
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,309
This one is just for you.       

208
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,812
Thanks very much.               

209
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,015
[shock!]                        
[JUDGES] (estatic moans)        

210
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,751
<i> The umami is both delicate</i>     
<i> and overwhelming!</i>              

211
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,754
<i> The meat is perfectly cooked</i>   
<i> and SO tender!</i>                 

212
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:26,091
<i> It has a sublime aftertaste</i>    
<i> that stays on the palate!</i>      

213
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,495
[EIZAN] I've also prepared three
dipping sauces for you to use.  

214
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:34,032
There's a chili sauce made using
the juices from the chicken,    

215
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,768
a ginger sauce that blends      
ginger and chicken fat,         

216
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:41,840
and last but certainly not      
least, a staple of Thai         
cuisine, see yu dam.            

217
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:46,578
So these little guys will be a  
perfect match for the meat, huh?

218
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,780
[TAKUMI] He used ideas          
and seasonings                  

219
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,515
to make the most of             
the chicken.                    

220
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,583
Eizan's impressive              
cooking pedigree                

221
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,919
is coming through in all        
aspects of his dish.            

222
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,722
His cooking has taken an        
ultra-high-quality chicken      

223
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,590
and elevated it even further.   

224
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,925
He is, indeed, an alchemist!    

225
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,696
Well, let's see. Yoink!         
[JUDGE 3] (whaa?!)              

226
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,597
[estatic moan]                  

227
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,999
Um, that's not too bad.         

228
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,136
Guess that's to be expected     
from tha Alchemist, I suppose.  

229
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,204
[JUDGE 2]                       
You hear that, Soma Yukihira?   

230
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:17,208
Your cooking is a far cry       
from what we expect             
here at Central!                

231
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,810
You don't have a chance!        

232
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,746
[SOMA] The thing is, well...    

233
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,215
My dish still isn't close       
to being finished.              

234
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:27,886
It'll take every last minute    
we have to get my gyoza         
just right.                     

235
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,889
Your meager cooking "techniques"
are pathetic at best.           

236
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,825
The difference between          
our dishes is clear.            

237
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,761
Master Eizan,                   
this is a waste of time, yes?   

238
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,829
Please, just leave              
the ruling to us now.           

239
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,165
Of course,                      
I trust your judgment, sir.     

240
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,102
Do as you like, and this will   
be the end of the Food Wars.    

241
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:47,172
Easy there! You don't have      
to take things that far         
to the extreme, do you?         

242
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,975
I've said I'd be happy          
if you tasted it.               

243
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,844
Oh, wait, could it be that...   

244
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,314
Maybe you're AFRAID             
of my cooking?                  

245
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,982
It's okay to admit it.          

246
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:01,453
Huh?!                           

247
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:02,921
If you're not too afraid,       

248
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,190
I'd really like to know what    
you think of my dish.           

249
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,525
Cause, I mean, if you leave here
without even a bite,            

250
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,397
I just think that would be      
a real crying shame,            
now wouldn't it?                

251
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,599
[EIZAN] You... you bastard!     

252
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,468
[SOMA] Oh, looks like you're in 
an eatin' mood after all!       

253
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:18,203
[laughs] Thank goodness.        

254
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,073
All right, step right up,       
everyone!                       

255
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,210
The time has finally come       
for me to show you...           

256
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,013
Yukihira Gyoza!                 

257
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,949
ma?                             

258
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,484
Even if your dish               
goes to the judges,             

259
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:35,888
Eizan has already bought off    
every single one of them!       

260
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:39,091
Show me what sort of trash      
you've made, Soma.              

261
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,826
But after that, it's all over!  

262
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:44,429
I hope you've enjoyed your last 
dish here on campus!            

263
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,898
What?                           

264
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,433
He was working on that          
Satsuma chicken bone-broth soup 

265
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,901
before the competition.         

266
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,637
But what are those              
two containers?                 

267
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,238
[SOMA]                          
They should be hot enough now.  

268
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,641
The skin on the wings           
looks just about right.         

269
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,111
Here's where we add all         
the juicey goodness!            
[sizzle]                        

270
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,481
[pleased chuckle]               
[RINDO] (huh?                   

271
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,984
[RINDO] Cheese?                 

272
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,053
Parmesan?                       
[TAKUMI] I get it now.          

273
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,756
Soma's dish is                  
"gyoza-with-wings" style!       

274
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,792
It's usually done using flour,  

275
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,794
after it's already been         
reduced in water.               

276
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:19,965
But it looks like he came up    
with the idea to use            
parmesan cheese instead.        

277
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,801
[JUDGE] (derisve chuckle)       

278
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,870
Are you guys seeing this?       

279
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,406
This guy's big surprise         
for his B-grade idea            

280
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,474
is going to make this           
travesty even WORSE!            

281
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:33,412
Can you imagine mixing that     
splendid chicken with pork jowl,

282
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:36,348
then adding cheese?!            
And parmesan no less!           

283
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:39,885
Seriously, this kid is          
destroying all the              
natural flavors                 

284
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,553
with these unnecessary          
ingredients.                    

285
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:44,422
[JUDGE 2] It is worlds apart    
from the expertly executed dish 

286
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,158
Master Eizan created!           

287
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,961
This has just become a waste    
of our precious time.           

288
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,230
[EIZAN]                         
<i> That chicken-bone soup...</i>      

289
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:55,233
Fine, then! Let's do the tasting
and get this Food War over with!

290
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,301
Shh!                            

291
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,404
[sizzling]                      

292
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:04,309
<i> There! That's the sound of</i>     
<i> the juices coming out</i>          
<i> from the wings.</i>                

293
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,978
<i> NOW!</i>                           

294
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:11,717
A soup?!                        

295
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:12,718
I had to take all this time,    

296
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,053
down to the last minute.        

297
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:16,055
I'll use the chicken-bone       
broth I've saved                

298
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:19,858
and add cornstarch to make      
a rich ankake sauce.            

299
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,326
This one's for you.             

300
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,028
Order up, Chef!                 

301
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:27,532
[EIZAN] Pitiful.                

302
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,135
Is this "ankake" supposed       
to mean anything?               

303
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,938
You've simply used a byproduct  
of the cooking process.         

304
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,272
Well, this settles it.          

305
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:37,876
You have absolutely no place    
being here at Totsuki.          

306
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,916
[ALL] (hmm?)                    

307
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,885
[EIZAN] (struggling)            

308
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,354
[angry bliss]                   

309
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:52,223
Huh? Is something the matter    
with your face, Chef Eizan?     

310
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,159
Could it possibly be because    

311
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,962
you think my gyoza is awesome.  
[JUDGE] Surely not.             

312
00:14:57,031 --> 00:15:00,232
That is no more than            
peasant's food he's serving.    
[JUDGE 3] Inconceivable!        

313
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,901
If you're that passionate about 
being offended by it,           

314
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:05,504
shouldn't you at least try some?
[sizziling]                     

315
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,272
Please, go on!                  

316
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,175
[SOMA] Well, Chef Eizan?        

317
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,512
You did think my cooking        
was good, didn't you?           

318
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,381
Come on, why not just come      
right out and say it?           

319
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,317
Tell us which one you think     
tastes better.                  

320
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,852
This is absurd!                 
We've told you!                 

321
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,921
There's no need for us          
to eat your slop!               

322
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,923
The decision's been made-       

323
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:26,925
It's just, well...              

324
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,727
Wouldn't it be best for us      
to save our judgement           

325
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,864
until after we've at least      
had a bite or two?              
[JUDGE] Huh?                    

326
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:35,267
I mean, after all, we've already
decided who the winner will be. 

327
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:38,003
What on Earth are you           
going on about, you dolt?       

328
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,671
I'm not eating that garbage!    

329
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,474
[JUDGE 3] Yeah, well, sorry,    
but I'm taking a bite.          

330
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:45,678
Well, I guess I'll try it too.  
[JUDGE] (huh?!)                 

331
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,414
[crowing]                       

332
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,583
[food-gasms!]                   

333
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,153
[SOMA] Here you go.             
Sorry for the wait!             

334
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,556
Oh! Yeah, there it is!          

335
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:01,159
Yum, okay, don't mind if I do!  
[sternly] Rindo Kobayashi!      

336
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:04,896
Come on, Eizan served a dish    
that looked super delicious,    
right?                          

337
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,166
How can I ever pass this up?    

338
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,635
[crowing]                       

339
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,538
[estatic gasps]                 

340
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,243
This is so delicious,           
Soma Yukihira!                  

341
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:21,112
But how?                        
[JUDGE 3] His prep was          
pedestrian at best,             

342
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,381
so how did he bring so much     
flavor out of the protein?      

343
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,118
[SOMA  The answer to that       
lies in the ankake sauce.       

344
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:31,323
To the soup, I added soy sauce, 
sake, vinegar, sugar,           
and some sesame oil.            

345
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,192
And then I added a certain      
secret ingredient.              

346
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,095
A secret ingredient?!           

347
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,931
A bit of ketchup.               

348
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,866
I used it to kick               
my sauce up a notch,            

349
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:44,602
making it a sweet and sour      
ankake sauce.                   
[EIZAN] Some ketchup?!          

350
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,006
Sweet-and-sour sauce gets       
used for pork and other         
Chinese dishes!                 

351
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,342
It cleanses the palate in       
Chinese cuisine,                

352
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,144
which of course, is well known  
for including a lot of oil.     

353
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,547
The acidity of ketchup is a     
perfect counterbalance,         

354
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:59,885
adding richness to the pork jowl
and parmesan cheese while       
retaining the juiciness         

355
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:03,155
and being able to push the      
refined flavor of the chicken   
to the forefront.               

356
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:07,959
And since tomatoes meaty flavor 
comes from the heavy load of    
glutamic acid that it carries,  

357
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,563
it becomes the perfect pairing  
for the parmesan cheese         
encrusted gyoza.                

358
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:15,033
[TAKUMI] When combined with     
shiitake and fresh chicken,     

359
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,835
the flavors just build          
off of one another!             

360
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:20,172
What at first seemed to be      
a second-rate, haphazardly      
thought-out dish                

361
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,375
was in fact brilliantly refined!
Dear Lord!                      

362
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:25,644
Once you have tasted this,      
it is utterly impossible        

363
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,780
to imagine a better             
flavor combination!             

364
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,182
Tell me, how in the Hell,       
did you think up something like 
this?                           

365
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,520
[amused] Nah, it's not like I   
came up with it all on my own,  
you know?                       

366
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,322
I thought it'd be right time    
to throw you a curve ball.      

367
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:41,593
My dormmates at Kyokusei        
had the same thought.           

368
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,995
[screams and sobs]              

369
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,398
Take that you mongrels,         
eat it all up!                  

370
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,734
I won't let one member of this  
rabble touch you, Ms Erina!     

371
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:50,936
Hisako...                       

372
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,137
[HISAKO] Yes?                   

373
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,006
The people of this dorm         

374
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,741
are a little strange,           
aren't they?                    

375
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:58,344
Yeah, well, I guess...          

376
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,613
Hey, Erina-poo!                 

377
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,081
We want a revenge match, yo!    

378
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,349
[exasperated sigh]              

379
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,418
I'm reallt starting to          
grow tired of this.             

380
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,220
We gave you enough of our bogus 
food yesterday, right?          

381
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,623
Today, though, we'll make       
her say it's delish!            

382
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,024
Well...                         

383
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,760
I assume you've taken           
what I said                     

384
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,161
and adjusted your recipe, yes?  

385
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,832
Then, fine. I have been taken   
into your care, after all.      

386
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,501
Today, I shall do you the       
privilege of tasting- [gah!]    

387
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,370
This is nothing like what       
I told you to do!               

388
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,505
[YUKI] Huh? Well, yeah...       

389
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,573
What'd I say?!                  
I explicitly told you           

390
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,776
Galantine should always         
be served COLD!                 

391
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,244
Warming it will only make it    
shrivel up and taste unpleasant!

392
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,648
Also, the porcini sauce should  
obviously be the rising star    
of the dish,                    

393
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,985
but you chose to pair it with   
gorgonzola for some unknown     
godforsaken reason!             

394
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,122
This is sure to be more         
reprehensible than what         
I ate last-                     

395
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:46,191
[gasp]<i> It can't be!</i>             

396
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,326
<i> As unrefined as it is,</i>         

397
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:51,330
<i> it manages to bring</i>            
<i> disparate flavors together</i>     

398
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,198
<i> and somehow elevate them!</i>      

399
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,067
So, hey!                        
What do you think, huh?         

400
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,401
[SOMA] (sigh)                   

401
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,939
So to me, this makes the        
pork fat too up-front.          

402
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,809
But you still want to have some 
flavor depth to it, right?      

403
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,477
Huh? Huh? Erina-poo! Erina-poo! 

404
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,212
[ERINA] Enough! This combination
could never work.               

405
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,814
You can't have chicken and pork 
in tandem like this.            
[YUKI] Erina-poo!               

406
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,150
You can't jump in willy nilly   
and just hope for the best.     

407
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,553
You have to know the basis of   
what you're trying to do.       
[SOMA] Oh, yeah!                

408
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,355
How about if I try and          
go more acidic with it?         

409
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,690
You should be listening to me,  
Soma!                           

410
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,960
Excellent! I'll use an acid     
to balance out the              
chicken's flavor,               

411
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:25,964
and it will also work to        
balance the pork's richness.    
[AOKI] (hmm!)                   

412
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,099
So you think some acid?         

413
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,233
[ALL] (gasps)                   

414
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:30,035
I think that totally works!     

415
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,503
Yeah, I think so!               

416
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,906
[AOKI] Okay! Let's grab some    
stuff from the garden!          

417
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:36,174
[YUKI]                          
To the Kyokusei Fields we go!   
[ERINA] Look you guys,          

418
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:39,978
I'm telling you to just         
listen to me for once!          

419
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:43,382
I've been asked to do taste     
tests more times than           
I can count,                    

420
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:46,051
and by some of the most premiere
chefs in the business,          

421
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,720
with few ever contesting me.    

422
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:52,724
Because of course, my palate    
is second-to-none.              

423
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,660
But I find through all my       
numerous spats                  

424
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:58,864
with the oddly creative people  
situated here at Kyokusei,      

425
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,599
I've come to realize something. 

426
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,934
[SOMA]                          
You came from "Central," yeah?  

427
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,736
I not sure what to expect.      

428
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:08,207
I mean, I highly doubt          
we're going to get a            
fair judgment from you.         

429
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,810
But this is the same kind of    
cooking we do every day         
at the dorm. [soft sizzling]    

430
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,346
It's the place you're trying    
so hard to get rid of,          

431
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,684
where me and my friends fight   
these battles daily!            

432
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,952
Hey, Mr. Dude in the Middle!    
[JUDGE] (hmm?)                  

433
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:24,756
[SOMA] Your backwards way       
of thinking, that there's       
only one way to do things...    

434
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,759
that basically smothers         
my way of cooking.              

435
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:29,094
But if you try it,              

436
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:32,698
it might make you rethink your  
staunch beliefs on cuisine.     

437
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,466
[seductive sizziling]           

438
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,504
Hey!                            

439
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,372
[struggling against the aroma]  

440
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,910
[estatic yell]                  

441
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:46,745
[crowing]                       

442
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,649
You gotta change up your way    
of thinking, chef.              

443
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,451
This is what you've             
been missing,                   

444
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:55,787
when you decided to throw out   
the idea of unconventional      
cooking.                        

445
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,823
[grrr!]                         

446
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,297
Huh?!                           

447
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,768
[barely controlled anger]       

448
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,971
[derisve] You're welcome!       

449
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,541
[music playing]                 

450
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:19,538
[SOMA]                          
So, this means Kyokusei Dorm    
doesn't get knocked down, right?

451
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:20,939
Humh?                           

452
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,675
[EIZAN] (grrr...)               

453
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,343
Hey, everyone at Central,       

454
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:26,812
are you guys watching this?     

455
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,814
[ahem] The thing is,            

456
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:32,084
if you go after my friends,     
or even people I know,          

457
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:33,618
you're gonna pay for it.        

458
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,021
We may be "lower class"         
to the likes of you,            

459
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:40,559
but you better think twice if   
you think we're gonna lay down  
and let you walk all over us.   

460
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:43,162
If you try it, we'll fight you. 

461
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,763
We'll come without mercy!       

462
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:45,831
So watch it,                    

463
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,634
even if you're a sitting        
member of the Ten!
