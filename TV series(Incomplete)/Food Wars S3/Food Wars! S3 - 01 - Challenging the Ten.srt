00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:05,070
[NARRATOR]                      
The Totsuki Fine Dining Academy:

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:08,474
This institution is known       
for producing a number of       
famous chefs,                   

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:13,879
as well as providing a chosen   
few with unlimited power and    
resources.                      

4
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,549
The prowess of these ten        
individuals is without equal.   

5
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,586
They are Totsuki's              
Council of Ten!                 

6
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,289
[small sigh]                    

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,157
[MEGUMI] Hey, Soma?             

8
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,359
Soma!                           

9
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,095
Oh, what's up, Megumi?          

10
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,631
Well, it's just, um...          
It's kind of dangerous          

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,634
to get lost in thought when     
you're driving, so...           

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,570
Sorry, yeah, you're right.      

13
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,438
It would be pretty lame for     
me to get in a wreck            

14
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,675
after I'd barely bought this    
thing, huh?                     

15
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,177
I know what's bothering you.    

16
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,246
The Council of Ten again, huh?  

17
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,049
Yeah, I guess so.               

18
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,183
[MEGUMI] It's understandable.   

19
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,319
After all, it was only yesterday

20
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,623
that those of us who got through
the Fall Selection had the      
honor of meeting them.          

21
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,994
The greatest chefs currently    
at Totsuki Academy:             

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,596
the Council of Ten.             

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,932
[drum beats]                    

24
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:11,937
[WOMAN] Presenting the Totsuki  
Academy Council of Ten!         

25
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,091
[MEGUMI] And then...            

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,095
In front of all these wildly    
talented upperclassmen,         

27
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,230
you had to go and be your self. 

28
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,433
So, uh, I'd prefer to join the  
Ten, like, right now.           

29
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:44,436
Would one of you guys be        
interested in doing a           
Food War with me?               

30
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,738
Soma, come on!                  

31
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,777
Yeah, but still, every          
single one of 'em said no.      

32
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,579
Talk about a letdown!           

33
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,581
Yeah, but you just about gave   
me a heart attack!              

34
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,452
Maybe I should've had them      
warm up to me a bit first       
before that.                    

35
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,255
I don't really think            
that's the issue here!          

36
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,725
Even now, just thinking about it
makes me want to curl up        
into a ball.                    

37
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,795
Those members of the Ten        
were incredible!                

38
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:14,867
The cake that Seat # 4, Chef    
Momo Akanegakubo made for us    
was just...                     

39
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,269
[ahhh!]                         

40
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,872
[SOMA] Yeah, that really was    
something else.                 

41
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,477
I got to see firsthand just how 
awesome the Ten really are.     

42
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,279
Do you finally understand now?  

43
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,414
The difference in skill between 
the average chef                

44
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,483
and those of the Ten            
is undeniable.                  

45
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,353
That's the shape of things!     
So better get used to it!       

46
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,623
I'm getting the feeling         
the nuance kinda sorta          
got through to you.             

47
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,691
You guys, totally,              
for real, no joke,              

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,095
you're not even a blip on our   
radar, speck of dust.           

49
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:47,032
That bein' said, just for       
grins, let me say this:         

50
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:51,236
If any of you newbies have      
even one thing you think        
could possibly beat me,         

51
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,707
I might consider a              
Food War with ya.               
[NENE] Their height.            

52
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,776
We're talking about food,       
you ignorant swine beast!       

53
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,245
It's cool Chef Kuga said        

54
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,647
he'd be game to do              
a Food War with us.             

55
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:06,718
But coming up with something    
that's actually good enough to  
beat him will be tough.         

56
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,388
We don't even have a proper     
place where we can battle him.  

57
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,122
Yeah, you're right.             

58
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,125
And we hardly ever have         
cooking classes                 

59
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,126
together with the second-years. 

60
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,396
What?                           
I thought you were against me   

61
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,399
challenging the Ten to          
a Food War, Megumi.             

62
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:25,337
Um, well, of course I don't want
you to end up getting expelled  
from school or anything.        

63
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,807
But I mean, you're an           
amazing chef, Soma.             

64
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:34,212
I thought, "Even if he is our   
senior, that must have stung to 
be talked down to like that."   

65
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,383
Oh, I see. Thank you.           

66
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,689
That's a really big truck.      

67
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,557
They gonna build                
something again?                

68
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,361
Well, yeah! It's about time for 
prep work to get under way.     

69
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,496
"Prep work"?                    
[MEGUMI] Yeah!                  

70
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,166
There's an event every year     
around this time.               

71
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,234
It's so we can mark             
the end of fall.                

72
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,370
It's Totsuki Academy's          
school festival!                

73
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,838
School festival?!               

74
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,574
Yup! It's called                
"The Lunar Feast"!              

75
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,110
Whoever enters gets to open up  
a mock restaurant,              

76
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,713
either individually or          
as a group-                     
[SOMA] (laughs)                 

77
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,915
Soma, what is it?               

78
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,784
That's it, Megumi!              

79
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,352
What?                           

80
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,554
[music playing]                 

81
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,381
[GIRL]                          
What are you gonna do for lunch?

82
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,582
 GIRL 2] Uh, I don't know...    

83
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,718
The Lunar Feast runs            
for five days.                  

84
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:23,722
Total sales of all restaurants  
are supposed to be announced    
daily, huh?                     

85
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,792
This is looking like just the   
thing! Huh?!                    

86
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,927
Ho! Well, hey there, Erina!     

87
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,529
Huh? Hello, Soma.               

88
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:31,797
What a surprise!                

89
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,466
What sorta class did you        
just come from?                 

90
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,402
I've told you repeatedly        
not to engage me in             
casual conversation!            

91
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,539
<i> I can't believe Hisako's not</i>   
<i> here at a time like this...</i>    

92
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,342
By the way, are you gonna do    
one of these things as well?    

93
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,278
I take it you mean              
the Lunar Feast?                

94
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,812
Well, of course.                

95
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,015
Each year, the members of the   
Ten who open up food shops      

96
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,683
draw throngs of people.         

97
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,752
Huh? Well, you don't say?       

98
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,955
In that case, Chef Kuga is      
sure to open one up too.        

99
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,491
Yeah, that is perfect!          

100
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,626
Oh God, don't tell me...        

101
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,628
Yup! You can count me in too!   

102
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,565
If I can get more sales than    
Chef Kuga at the festival,      

103
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,701
I'm sure he'll see fit to       
accept my challenge.            
[ERINA] (huh?!)                 

104
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,302
Not to brag,                    

105
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,505
but back home when we'd         
work the summer festivals,      

106
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,306
I was kind of a big deal,       
you know!                       

107
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,576
[DUDE] This is delicious!       
What'd ypu put in here?!        

108
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,579
Of course, I'll be going up     
against your restaurant too!    

109
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,447
Let us both do our best!        

110
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,982
See ya, Erina!                  

111
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,986
<i> He honestly thinks he can</i>      
<i> challenge Kuga?</i>                

112
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,522
<i> Does he even know what the</i>     
<i> Lunar Feast is about?</i>          

113
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,923
<i> He's such a dummy.</i>             

114
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,892
[COACH] Okay, one more!         

115
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,394
[MEGUMI] Oh, really?            

116
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,664
I should have known you'd       
be opening up a stall.          

117
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,533
You bet! I figured this         
was my only shot.               

118
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:45,671
So, Megumi, you happen to know  
what kinda food Chef Kuga cooks?

119
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,407
If I don't know that, I can't   
come up with a plan of attack.  

120
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:53,345
Let's see... I believe Kuga's   
area of specialty is perhaps    
Chinese cuisine.                

121
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,247
Oh, Chinese, huh?               

122
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,816
Uh...                           

123
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,018
Hmm?                            

124
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,990
Boom!                           

125
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:06,959
She's so cool!                  

126
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,094
That girl's got some bounce!    

127
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,262
Huh?                            

128
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,033
[HOJO] You wanna beat the       
#8 Seat, Terunori Kuga?!        

129
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,904
Well, you are the same idiot    
who challenged Chef Kojiro.     

130
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,906
You sure do like                
running your mouth.             

131
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:25,643
Hojo was also stationed in      
B Block with me during          
the Fall Selection.             

132
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:28,847
And her specialty is            
Chinese cooking too.            

133
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,916
Yeah? You don't say?            

134
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,986
But unlike Kuga, whose focus    
is mainly Sichuan,              

135
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,456
I've trained in a variety of    
different Chinese styles.       

136
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,859
So, how many people have you    
recruited for your staff?       

137
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,460
What staff?                     

138
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,330
It'll just be me.               
[MEGUMI] (urk!)                 

139
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,731
Whaaaat?!                       

140
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,733
Yeah, it's just a stall at      
some school festival.           

141
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,468
Uh, yeah, about that...         

142
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:54,539
(sigh) Are you by chance free   
after school?                   
[SOMA] Huh?                     

143
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,811
I'm scheduled to attend a       
study group on regional dishes  
after school today.             

144
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,413
I guess Soma alone              
will have to do.                

145
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,016
You'll understand once          
you've seen it for yourself.    

146
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,617
I'll be taking you somewhere:   

147
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,952
the Chinese Cuisine             
Research Society,               

148
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,888
Terunori Kuga's stronghold!     

149
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,056
(ah!)                           

150
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,294
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!               

151
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,098
This is nuts.                   

152
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,368
They're training to flip        
uncooked rice in a wok?         

153
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,436
There are so many of them!      

154
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,372
But they're all moving          
perfectly in sync!              

155
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,908
Are these guys cyborgs          
or something?                   

156
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,378
Okay! One, two! One and two!    

157
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,048
Yeah, good, that's it!          
Keep it up everyone!            

158
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,850
Hey, baldy!                     
You're falling behind!          

159
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,118
What are you doing?!            

160
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,852
I-I'm so sorry, Master!         

161
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:45,056
No! That won't be good enough   
for you to properly do your job!

162
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,660
And you all share               
responsibility,                 
so give me thirty more sets.    

163
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,595
Now, go!                        

164
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:50,863
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!               

165
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,733
What's up, Miyo?!               
Whatch' doin' up in here?       

166
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,868
You finally decided to come     
and join our group?             

167
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,070
Not a chance.                   

168
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,         
but still,                      

169
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,006
you know that you're            
always welcome any time.        

170
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,008
And here we have, um...         

171
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,944
Soma, if I remember correctly.  

172
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,479
What brings you here?           

173
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,615
Well, I was just curious        
what you were doing             

174
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,016
to get ready for the            
upcoming school festival.       

175
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,685
"School festival"?              

176
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,088
I was thinking about            
doing a restaurant too.         

177
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:18,824
I was just about to start       
coming up with recipes.         

178
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,160
If I rack up more sales         
than you,                       

179
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,028
would you accept my             
Food Wars challenge?            

180
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:26,098
Oh, so that's it?               
Of course I will.               

181
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,701
I always like to                
keep my promises.               

182
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,502
I'm glad to hear it, man!       

183
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,572
So, for now, you mind telling   
me what you'll be serving?      

184
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,574
This is supposed to be          
covert recon!                   

185
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,108
Do you have any idea            
what you're doing?!             

186
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,779
(laughing) You sure are a funny 
kid, aren't you, Soma?          

187
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:44,716
But well, I'm still going over  
what I want to make             
for the festival,               

188
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,919
but I'd have to say my top      
seller is always mapo tofu.     

189
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,521
Mapo tofu?                      

190
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,858
I used to do a killer mapo tofu 
set menu back home.             

191
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,194
The folks really loved          
that stuff!                     

192
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,465
Huh? So your place served up    
set menus, did it? Hmpf!        

193
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,034
Ten of you, line up!            

194
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:07,806
Make the mapo tofu we're        
all SO proud of for             
Little Soma here.               

195
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,208
Yes, sir!                       

196
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:19,251
Hey, Soma, have you ever heard  
of this famous Chinese saying?  
[SOMA] What?                    

197
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,955
It was coined by the people     
in Sichuan province             

198
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,091
as well as neighboring          
Hunan and Guizhou.              

199
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,560
"Sichuan people don't           
fear spiciness."                

200
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,896
"Hunan fear no level            
of spiciness,"                  

201
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:35,100
"and Guizhou people fear        
that which isn't spicy."        

202
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,971
In other words, it sounds like  
they freaking love spicy foods. 

203
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,172
It's not only that they         
love their food spicy.          

204
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,909
It's that it's such a part of   
the regional cuisine that it    
led to this phrase.             

205
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,579
It's been that way for          
hundreds of years.              

206
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:52,317
And yet, my cooking has         
elevated that even further      
than anyone else has.           

207
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:59,257
[MINON]                         
Presenting Terunori Kuga's      
Ultra-Refined Sichuan Mapo Tofu!

208
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,792
Eat it while it's hot!          

209
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,260
<i> Ten servings' worth,</i>           

210
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,929
<i> and they all came out</i>          
<i> at the same time!</i>              

211
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,132
<i> Talk about precision.</i>          

212
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,002
[urk!]                          

213
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:13,605
<i> What the heck is this?!</i>        
[ugh!]                          

214
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,207
<i> It's hot, but delicious!</i>       

215
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,810
<i> It's hot and delicious!</i>        

216
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,278
<i> IT'S HOT AND DELICICIOUS!</i>      

217
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,614
<i> My tongue feels like</i>           
<i> it's gonna burn off,</i>           

218
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,617
<i> but then I'm hit by wave after</i> 
<i> damn wave of flavor!</i>           

219
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,288
<i> This is totally different from</i> 
<i> the "Yukihira" mapo tofu.</i>      

220
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:31,457
<i> What's more...</i>                 

221
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,762
<i> They all taste the same.</i>       

222
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,031
<i> There's no difference!</i>         

223
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,633
<i> These guys must have</i>           
<i> trained like crazy.</i>            

224
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,970
This is true spiciness, Soma.   

225
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:48,973
That perfect combination        
of deliciousness and            
overwhelming heat...            

226
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:52,778
Your set menu doesn't even      
come close to getting that,     
does it?                        

227
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:58,383
What's more, my boys here have  
been drilled to the point where 
they can replicate it perfectly.

228
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,786
And I did the drilling!         
(giggles)                       

229
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:06,058
The Lunar Feast is a crazy      
event, one that gets            
500,000 visitors a year.        

230
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,926
If you want a chance            
at the top spot,                

231
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,796
you'll have to serve            
around 1,000 dishes a day.      

232
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:12,197
<i> A thousand?!</i>                   

233
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,398
Let's see...                    

234
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,867
You have how many people        
on your staff?                  

235
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,670
Oh, yeah, just one.             

236
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:20,205
And you don't even have         
a recipe yet, right?            

237
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,873
Tell me, Soma:                  

238
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,610
Just how are you planning on    
going about beating me?         

239
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:26,812
If you don't mind,              

240
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,313
I would like you to share that. 

241
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,156
You wanna know how I'll do it?  

242
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:40,426
That's easy! I'll do it with    
my cooking skills, of course!   

243
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,768
You get it now, right?          

244
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,370
Kuga is incredible.             

245
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,172
A while back, China-Soc used    
to be just that:                

246
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:58,043
a society made for studying     
the art of Chinese cooking.     

247
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:01,714
But he wielded those raging     
spicy flavors like a weapon,    

248
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,916
forcing them to specialize      
in Sichuan cuisine.             

249
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,986
[SOMA] I get it. So then...     

250
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,255
[horn beep]                     
What the heck am I gonna do?    

251
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,859
What happened to all the        
self-confidence you were        
waggling around back there?     

252
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,394
Say, Hojo...                    

253
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:18,263
You sure helped me out by       
taking me to that study group.  

254
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,398
Well, see ya.                   

255
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,934
Hold on! What will you do now?! 

256
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,202
That's easy.                    

257
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,870
I'm gonna go home and           
come up with a game plan.       

258
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,406
Then there's something else     
you need to keep in mind.       

259
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:34,145
Kuga also has the jump on you   
in another big way -            
and not just staff.             

260
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,415
His reputation goes             
beyond the academy.             

261
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,484
In other words,                 
he's got name value.            

262
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,087
What do you mean                
by "name value"?                

263
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,957
[SOMA] (laughing                

264
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:47,292
What's all this?                

265
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,095
"China-Soc is not only          
known for it's food,            

266
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,298
but also for its many           
dedicated repeat customers."    

267
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,034
"But this year, it's garnered   
even more attention             
from the fact that              

268
00:13:56,103 --> 00:14:00,372
it will be helmed by the one    
and only Terunori Kuga of the   
Ten."                           

269
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,177
The fight to get customers      
doesn't start the day of.       

270
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:08,246
It seems this battle has        
already started.                

271
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,982
Thanks for this, Mitsuru.       

272
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,785
I really do appreciate you      
coming to bring me this.        

273
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,386
Please let me know where        
you're gonna be setting up      
your booth,                     

274
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,456
and what you plan on            
serving the crowd!              

275
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:18,990
Huh? But why?                   

276
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,793
It's the Newspaper Club         
that publishes                  

277
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,528
the guidebook to the            
Lunar Feast!                    

278
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,330
And well,                       
if you would like me to,        

279
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:26,265
I'll save a whole page for you! 

280
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,133
Oh, that's so cool!             

281
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,601
Thanks a lot!                   

282
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:36,875
<i> Sure enough, being on the Ten</i>  
<i> makes Chef Kuga a lot more</i>     
<i> well-known than me.</i>            

283
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:40,412
<i> What can I do to break down</i>    
<i> that advantage?</i>                

284
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:41,813
[giggle]                        

285
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,282
We've been waiting for you,     
Soma!                           

286
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:44,950
All of us at Kyokusei Dorm      

287
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,285
have decided to be with you     
at the Lunar Feast!             

288
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,020
[urk!]                          

289
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,024
We will band together with a    
single dish to present as one.  

290
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:56,494
It's the most spectacular event 
of our young academic career!   

291
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,164
This is... the springtime       
of our youth!                   

292
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,499
What it means to be students!   

293
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:01,633
And so!                         

294
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,235
Let's walk this road together.  

295
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:07,439
Uh, well, the thing is, I was...

296
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,174
Hmm, I see.                     

297
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,243
You're going solo on this one.  

298
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:14,846
It's a shame we can't           
do this together,               
but we understand.              

299
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,981
Yeah, sorry!                    

300
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,916
Wait, did Soma just say         

301
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,786
he's going to challenge someone 
for a seat on the               
Council of Ten?                 

302
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:24,389
He did. It seems he's as        
impetuous as always.            

303
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,058
Yeah, well, you know...         

304
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:29,327
Anyway, I was about to start    
filling out this entry form,    

305
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,131
but what's this "Area of        
Operation" all about?           

306
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,334
Ah! The thing is,               
a section of the school grounds 

307
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:38,137
will be specifically reserved   
just for the festival.          

308
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,406
But the space is divided into   
three main areas for the shops. 

309
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:43,542
Where you set up is             
pretty important.               

310
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,812
You have to choose a spot       
that matches the concept        
of your stall.                  

311
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,214
Huh? They differ that much?     

312
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,084
They do. Each is unique         
in its own way.                 

313
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,420
[SATOSHI] The first one         
is the most famous:             

314
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,155
the area along the              
central street.                 

315
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:58,289
[RYOKO] It's the main road,     
and right when you walk in,     

316
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,092
there's row after row of        
portable tents.                 

317
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:03,429
[YUKI] They sell things         
from 500 to 1,000 yen each.     

318
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,964
[MEGUMI] It's easy              
to buy food, so it gets         
a lot of traffic.               

319
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,100
[SATOSHI]                       
Then, there's the central area: 
where you'll find               

320
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,435
most of the cooking facilities  
used in our lectures.           

321
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:13,238
[RYOKO] That's where you'll     
find the vendors that           
serve special dishes            

322
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,173
or require special equipment.   

323
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,709
[MEGUMI] If someone's in the    
mood to eat some authentic      
cuisine,                        

324
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,378
then you can find it there.     

325
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,246
[YUKI] And it's a little more   
expensive,                      

326
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,116
with items running from         
1,000 to 5,000 yen.             

327
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,386
[SATOSHI] Finally, there's the  
area in the mountains           

328
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,255
where a lot of places run by    
the Ten have tended to be.      

329
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,525
[RYOKO] The restaurants there   
have a kind of secluded,        
high-end feel to them.          

330
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,462
[YUKI] You can expect to pay    
at least 5,000 yen per item,    

331
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:40,532
but there's no telling how      
pricey things can get.          
I mean, I've ever been there!   

332
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,670
[MEGUMI] It's hard to get many  
customers there unless you      
have a reputation.              

333
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,607
Incidentally, Kuga seems to be  
setting up in the central area. 

334
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,476
Huh? Why would he do that?      

335
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,945
[SATOSHI]                       
Because in the central area,    

336
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,414
you're free to make your shop   
whatever size you like.         

337
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,282
He probably avoided             
the mountain area               

338
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:59,618
to make use of                  
China-Soc's sheer size.         

339
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,020
Still, no matter where          
he sets up,                     

340
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,224
just being a member of the Ten  
will bring customers to him.    

341
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:09,027
Yeah! Sure enough, his name     
value is certainly a            
powerful weapon.                

342
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,363
[RYOKO] Each year,              
all the differnt groups         

343
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,566
scramble like mad to get        
the best possible location      
for their shop.                 

344
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:18,369
If they end up choosing the     
wrong place, that's it for them.

345
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,306
So there's no way I can         
possibly compete with Kuga.     

346
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,841
Is that what you're saying?     

347
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:28,447
[footsteps]                     

348
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,651
Oh, Soma Yukihira.              

349
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,053
It's the last day to            
submit your application         

350
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,055
if you want to enter            
the Lunar Feast.                

351
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:40,459
Are you still under the delusion
that you'll be able to          
take out Kuga?                  

352
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,494
I hope you have                 
some sort of plan.              

353
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,265
[ha!] Judging by your dumb face,

354
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,934
it would seem you haven't come  
up with anything, have you?     

355
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,269
[SOMA] (ugghh...)               
[ERINA]                         
Hey, you need to answer me!     

356
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,339
It's not like I'm talking       
to myself, you know?            

357
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,274
<i> I have to get the best spot I</i>  
<i> can on the Main Road Area,</i>     

358
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,877
<i> because of all the</i>             
<i> foot traffic.</i>                  

359
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:03,014
<i> Otherwise, there's no way I can</i>
<i> compete with Kuga's ability</i>    
<i> to draw in customers.</i>          

360
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:04,883
<i> At least, that's how it seems.</i> 

361
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,153
<i> But is there more</i>              
<i> to it than that?</i>               

362
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,756
Hey, what's up, Erina?          
Didn't see you there.           

363
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,290
You're so rude!                 

364
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,027
You're next to me in class, huh?
Pretty cool!                    

365
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,962
Get up and                      
go find another seat!           

366
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:21,099
You and I sure do end up being  
side-by-side a lot, don't we?   

367
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,302
Like in the semifinals          
during the Selection.           

368
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,637
You chose to sit next to me,    
you piece of crap!              

369
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,573
[SOMA] Then, the time when      
we were coming home from        
our school trip.                

370
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:32,444
[ERINA] Once again,             
YOU sat by ME uninvited!        

371
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,314
Oh, and there was that time     
during class...                 

372
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,715
[gasp]                          

373
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,116
You know...                     

374
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,051
Yeah, that's it.                

375
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,421
That has to be it.  It must be! 
[ERINA] (gasp)                  

376
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,657
[KANICHI] You're out of your    
stinkin' mind!                  

377
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,127
You want me to give up          
MY space?!                      

378
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,462
Bowl-Soc uses the same spot     
every Lunar Feast!              

379
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,331
There's no way I'm givin' it up!

380
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,067
Stop hiding behind me like      
a little puppy-dog.             

381
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,603
Ask me how much I care about    
your pathetic little boy needs. 

382
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:02,073
That's the best spot for        
my cuisine of discord.          

383
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:06,278
Why don't you peddle your       
second-rate beef bowls          
somewhere else?                 

384
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,281
"Second-rate beef"?             
Is that so?                     

385
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,616
Well, how about we settle       
this with a Food War, creep?    

386
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,285
It would be my pleasure.        

387
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,820
Be careful, Meat-Meat!          

388
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,156
You could end up getting cursed!

389
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:19,091
Hello, Administration?          

390
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,493
It looks like this is leading   
to another Food War again.      

391
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,563
[ERINA] Excuse me. Would you    
mind moving aside, Ikumi Mito?  

392
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,698
WHAT?!                          

393
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,366
[gaaahhh!                       

394
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:30,302
Miss Erina, I-I-I'm so sorry!   

395
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,704
You, Nao Sadatsuka!             

396
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,572
You will stay fifty yards       
away from Erina!                

397
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:37,176
[waahhh!]                       
My beloved best-friend-ever     
just spoke to me!               

398
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,844
Thank you so very much!         
[HISAKO] (uhh...)               

399
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,448
[GUY] Okay... Your festival     
application form                

400
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,250
has been approved, of course,   
Miss Erina Nakari.              

401
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,619
Sounds good, thank you.         

402
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,489
Soma?                           

403
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,458
Oh, am I next?                  

404
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,759
Thanks a bunch.                 

405
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:57,262
[GUY]                           
Wha? A-are you sure about this? 

406
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,196
(gasp)                          

407
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,732
[GUY] This puts you...          

408
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,801
right in front of China-Soc!    

409
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,135
(gasp)                          

410
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,603
[SOMA] Yup! Is it open?         

411
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,140
Yeah...                         
but they're very popular.       

412
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:09,675
They've been there forever.     

413
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,810
No one would ever want to be    
set up next to THEM.            

414
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,681
[SOMA] (chuckle) Oh, yeah?      
Well, that's great news to hear!

415
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,816
And as for what                 
I'll be cooking...              

416
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,418
It'll be Chinese.               

417
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,487
(GASPS!)                        

418
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:26,492
Remember that training camp     
from hell where we had to cook  
200 dishes for everyone?        

419
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,295
I figured the only way I was    
going to be able to squeeze in  
some kind of a win              

420
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,565
was by mostly appealing to      
customers who were in           
line to see you.                

421
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,835
Worked out pretty well for me.  

422
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,438
When you think about it,        
in a way, I owe it all to you.  

423
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,841
It was your help that got me    
through it all.                 

424
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,110
You're the best, Erina!         

425
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,645
How dare you mock me,           
Soma Yukihira?!                 

426
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:50,182
I've had enough of you,         
your face, and your             
ridiculous insults!             

427
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,384
<i> So, I'll just do</i>               
<i> like I did back then</i>           

428
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:56,255
<i> and use Kuga's popular</i>         
<i> Chinese cooking against him.</i>   

429
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,590
<i> Unfortunately, that's the</i>      
<i> only way I can see me</i>          

430
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,726
<i> pulling a victory out of this.</i> 

431
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,629
[GUY] All right, your           
application is approved.        

432
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,532
[SOMA] (chuckle) Much obliged!  

433
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,667
<i> Now then, the stage is set!</i>    

434
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,538
<i> Looks like I'll have to</i>        
<i> wrangle that that fiery heat</i>   
<i> of his by the horns!</i>           

435
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:16,742
[ERINA] Some Yukihira, about    
these shops that we'll be       
setting up...                   

436
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,743
You do know that if your        
sales are in the red,           

437
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,446
you'll be kicked out of school? 

438
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,016
Huh? Leave school?!             

439
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,984
[music playing]                 

440
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,478
[TSUKASA] Soma Yukihira?        

441
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:28,747
[RINDO] That's right!           
He made quite the show          

442
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,684
of challenging Kuga at          
the Lunar Feast eaerlier.       

443
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:33,685
Oh?                             

444
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,487
What's with you, Tsukasa?       

445
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:38,490
Can't you look at least         
a little bit interested in this?

446
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,959
I'm not in the mood for         
that kind of stuff.             

447
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:43,962
Will the interior furnishings   
going to be ready in time?!     

448
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,497
Will everything be to spec?     

449
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:47,366
I hope nothing's going to       
collapse or anything!           

450
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,967
God, I'm so nervous!            

451
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,438
[laughing] You're the same      
worrywart as always, aren't you?

452
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,776
However! We now have one more   
thing to look forward to        
at the Feast. [chuckle]
