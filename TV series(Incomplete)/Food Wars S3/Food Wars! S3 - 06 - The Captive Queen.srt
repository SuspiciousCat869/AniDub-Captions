00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,740
[GIN] Joichiro?                 

2
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:09,942
Pardon me?                      

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,210
Gin?! What brings you here?     

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,215
Business. I have a quick meeting
today with a company I'm doing  
some work with.                 

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,084
I'm working too.                
I'm here to cook some food.     

6
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,019
What a coincidence.             

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,753
"Coincidence," my ass!          

8
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,222
Why don't you ever              
get in touch?!                  

9
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,424
I thought maybe you were        
dead in a ditch somewhere!      

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,594
I've been worried sick about    
you, do you realize that?!      

11
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,097
I met your son, Soma, you know. 

12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,631
Oh, yeah? That's cool.          

13
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,033
Listen, man...                  

14
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,503
Joichiro, it's been a while..   

15
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:38,937
Yeah.                           

16
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,983
This calls for a celebration.   
Let's drink!                    

17
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,385
I can't. I've made plans        
for this meeting-               

18
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,388
Come on, just blow it off!      
Have a cold one with your old-  

19
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,524
I can't, you pushy              
son-of-a-bitch.                 
[cell phone ringing]            

20
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,592
It's me. Is something wrong?    

21
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,261
[GIN] (shock)                   

22
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,197
Wait, you're saying             
Master Senzaemon is gone?       

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,132
Azami?!                         

24
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,535
Azami Nakamura?                 

25
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,337
HE's the new director?!         

26
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,141
[music playing]                 

27
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,534
[TSUKASA] Now then,             
as a result of our latest vote, 

28
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,403
the Totsuki Council of Ten      
shall formally support          

29
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,240
Azami Nakiri as the             
new school director.            

30
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,210
Let us consider                 
the matter closed.              

31
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,885
[YUKI] Isshiki! Is it true that 
we have a new school director?! 

32
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,554
They say it was a majority vote 
from the Council of Ten.        

33
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,825
That's right, but,              
I'm just as surprised as you.   

34
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:43,295
I mean, I can't believe the     
Ten had this scheme going,      

35
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,098
and that someone would actually 
show up to be the new director. 

36
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,568
Don't you think it's messed up  
that they can just do           
something like this?!           

37
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,971
[SATOSHI]                       
Not really. In terms of the     
process, it was by the book.    

38
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,508
The proposal was made and       
the votes were cast             
according to procedure.         

39
00:02:56,577 --> 00:03:00,579
Say, you know what,             
if I remember correctly,        

40
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,383
I heard the Totsuki's director  
was always passed down          
to the Nakiri family.           

41
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,785
[hmm] Is that so?               

42
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,054
I still think it was kinda      
freakishly sudden.              

43
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,389
Still, we don't have to         
really worry, right?            

44
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,725
It's got nothing at all         
to do with us students?!        

45
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,060
And yet...                      

46
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,996
Yeah?                           
Got something on your mind?     

47
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,465
Well, this talk of aligning     
with a new director,            

48
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,535
wouldn't it have reached YOU,   
before it happened, Isshiki?    

49
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,004
[SATOSHI] (ulp)                 

50
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,941
[SOMA] Um, Erina,               
why are you shaking?            

51
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,743
[SATOSHI] Oh, you know what?    

52
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,546
I do believe it's about to get  
underway, isn't it?             

53
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,416
The event to welcome the        
director to his new post.       

54
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,620
Welcome,                        
colleagues and friends.         

55
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,290
I would like to thank you all   
for gathering here today.       

56
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,826
By the will of the              
Totsuki Council of Ten,         

57
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,429
I, Azami Nakiri,                
will now be director,           

58
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,698
and made to serve the academy.  

59
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:56,901
The contributions to this school
of the prior director,          
Master Senzaemon,               

60
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,239
are many and varied.            
And as his successor,           

61
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:04,243
I feel a great sense of pressure
to fulfill these obligations    
as justly as he did.            

62
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:09,448
However, I know that this role  
is a pivotal one in driving     
Japan's culinary culture.       

63
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,450
I am humbled by this,           

64
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,319
and intend to push Totsuki      
to even greater heights!        

65
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,288
[applause]                      

66
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,461
Director, a car has been        
prepared for you, sir.          

67
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,931
[AZAMI  My apologies,           
have them wait a bit longer.    

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
I'd like to go for              
a little walk.                  

69
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,471
It's only proper that Totsuki's 
director turns his gaze         
toward the future.              

70
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,209
For this reason, I would like   
to take a long, hard look       
at the school as it stands.     

71
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,478
Don't you see?                  

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
It's only YOUTH that allows one 
to oppose the prior generation. 

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,017
Physical strength must make up  
for lack of experience.         

74
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,286
He's not at all what I expected.

75
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,423
Yeah, I thought he'd be a bit   
more stiff and one-sided,       

76
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,358
but he seems like he might be   
a really nice person.           

77
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,961
The hell was all that?          
It was just the other day       

78
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,297
he showed us his true colors    
with Ms Nakiri!                 

79
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:02,501
Yes! He spoke so abusively      
before a roomful of people,     
but now...                      

80
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,437
Erina,                          
what is all this nonsense?      

81
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,440
Your cooking is not meant for   
the likes of these people.      

82
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,244
This encapsulates fine dining.  

83
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,381
Its value should be shared with 
only a select few of            
chosen worth.                   

84
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,251
Only then is worth being        
called "cuisine."               

85
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:23,188
Or else it's not true           
cooking at all; it is slop.     

86
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,925
You know, he may not actually   
think he was being abusive.     
[KITA] 'xcuse me?               

87
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,327
At the restaurant,              
and now here today,             

88
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:32,865
he's simply acting on his true  
feelings and whatever he        
thinks is right.                

89
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,333
[NATSUME] Yes, very true.       

90
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:39,204
He probably does exactly what he
wants, without any hesitation.  

91
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,081
[AZAMI] Hisako Arato, yhank you 
for your service up till now.   

92
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,081
What?                           

93
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,683
You have my sincere gratitude.  

94
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,286
I appreciate you                
looking after Erina.            

95
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,023
I am quite aware that your      
presence has been               
a tremendous help.              

96
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,627
And I will always be in your    
debt for taking her on.         
[HISAKO] (shaky) Oh...          

97
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,030
As of today, you are officially 
relieved of your duties         
as her servant.                 

98
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,766
Please, wait a minute!          
I don't-                        

99
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,702
[AZAMI] I'm sure you agree.     
Yes, Erina?                     

100
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,170
No, I don't, Father.            

101
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,238
I would like Hisako to          
remain with me as-              

102
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,240
[AZAMI] But there's no need     
to worry anymore.               

103
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:19,511
Going forward you will always   
have ME by your side.           

104
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,714
Similarly, I will decide        
all of your clientele.          

105
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,317
That way, we will make          
the most of your talents.       

106
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,520
With your hand in mine,         
we will push forward together.  

107
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,988
Yes, Erina?                     

108
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,459
Yes, Father.                    

109
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,263
[FUMIO] Is Soma here?           

110
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,932
Yes, he went up to              
his room just now.              

111
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,201
Is everything all right?        

112
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,003
Yes, he has a visitor           
here to see him.                

113
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,439
At this time of night?          

114
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,610
[SOMA] (sigh) Now that we have  
a new director in place,        

115
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,013
I can't help but wonder what    
happened to the old one.        

116
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,015
[gah!] He's HERE?               

117
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,017
[SENZAEMON] (muscle flex)       

118
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,819
[SENZAEMON] Soma Yukihira,      

119
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,021
please forgive me for           
this sudden intrusion.          

120
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,891
Well, I don't mind, sir, but    
do you need me for something?   

121
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,027
Come to think of it, I believe  
this is the first time          

122
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,296
we've actually spoken           
outside of competitions.        

123
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,432
Yeah, I guess so.               

124
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,836
It was I that suggested to      
Joichiro that he should have    
you attend Totsuki.             

125
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,304
I hope you don' t mind.         

126
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,577
When your father was here, he   
was the No. 2 Seat on the Ten.  

127
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,846
A position that was held highly.

128
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,849
Things didn't always            
go smoothly,                    

129
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,385
but he truly was                
a splendid chef.                

130
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,855
So then that must mean you      
and my dad got along            
pretty well, huh?               

131
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,056
[SENZAEMON] (chuckles)          

132
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,992
Why don't we step outside       
for a bit?                      

133
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,995
[SENZAEMON] My apologies        
[SOMA] (panting)                

134
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,464
for having you join in          
my daily routine.               

135
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,932
[SOMA] No problem.              

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,334
Oddly, being relieved of        
my duties as director           

137
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,338
has been somewhat of a          
surprising weight off           
my shoulders.                   

138
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,939
[hearty laugh]                  

139
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,008
[out of breath] Oh, really?     
That's good to hear, sir!       

140
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,178
[pull up grunts]                

141
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,150
So, what was it exactly that    
you wanted to see me about?     

142
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,585
[SENZAEMON] (hyah!)             

143
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,491
Tell me, what kind of chef      
would you say Erina is?         

144
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,494
Hmh? Well, I would say...       

145
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,830
That she's super picky          
about taste.                    

146
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,499
And she's always on edge        
about something or other.       

147
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,769
Half of that is YOUR fault,     
Soma Yukihira!                  

148
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,638
When she was little,            
Erina was full of laughter.     

149
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,713
Disgusting.                     
[ALICE] (waahh)                 

150
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,181
What the heck is your problem?  

151
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,650
I made that dessert             
especially for you, Erina!      

152
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,452
Well, it just                   
doesn't taste good.             

153
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,854
[about to cry]                  

154
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,923
But, um, thank you for          
making this, Alice.             

155
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,324
Huh?                            

156
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,193
I'm not gonna finish this, okay?

157
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,261
[ALICE] You gotta be kidding me!
(grrrr!!!!)                     

158
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,830
[giggles]                       

159
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,934
[ALICE] I want to go to Europe! 

160
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,402
Please, Father!                 

161
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,404
Okay, the next time I see you,  

162
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,473
I will have learned some        
awesome cooking techniques      

163
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,675
that will make you              
want to eat my food.            

164
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,680
When I'm back from Europe,      
don't go getting all tearful    
and sobby on me, okay?          

165
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,815
What's with you?                

166
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,184
You could at least wish me      
good luck on my travels.        

167
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,219
Um, Alice...                    

168
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,989
Please be sure to               
always write me, okay?          

169
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,224
[giggles]                       

170
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,433
[AZAMI] Erina, come here.       

171
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,567
Yes, Father.                    

172
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:30,969
Where are we going?             

173
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,304
[AZAMI] Erina,                  

174
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,572
do you want to become a chef?   

175
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,640
Yes!                            

176
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,908
Good girl.                      

177
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,444
Then just follow me.            

178
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:41,113
Now then, from today onwards,   

179
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,515
I shall teach you the           
meaning of "cooking."           

180
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,786
[AZAMI] Tell me,                

181
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,588
which of these is               
seasoned correctly?             

182
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,389
The right one?                  

183
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,459
The one on the left is putting  
too much emphasis on            
animal fats.                    

184
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,994
The flavor is unbalanced.       

185
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:56,996
Very well done.                 

186
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:58,597
Now, be a good girl             

187
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,000
and throw what's on the         
other plate into the garbage.   

188
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:03,135
What? But, um...                

189
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,205
Wasting food doesn't seem like  
the right thing to do.          

190
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,474
[AZAMI] Do it.                  

191
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,208
You're hurting me!              
Please don't!                   

192
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,409
Stop it, Father!                

193
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,811
Do it, girl.                    

194
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,413
[fearful]                       

195
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,889
What a good girl you are.       

196
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,158
[shaky breathing]               

197
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:29,027
[AZAMI]                         
You must let go of sentiment.   

198
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,696
TASTE is all that matters.      

199
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,566
An ill-prepared dish            
is unforgivable.                

200
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,435
Anything that does not          
meet my approval is...          

201
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,105
Filth! Garbage! Trash!          

202
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,041
Father doesn't approve,         
so this food is nothing but...  

203
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,044
Filth! Garbage! Trash!          

204
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,246
It's nothing but trash.         

205
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,116
Disgusting! Disgusting!         
Disgusting!                     

206
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:54,786
You have some nerve serving     
a dish like this to ME!         

207
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,256
Apologize.                      

208
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,658
Azami Nakamura!                 

209
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,728
You are banned from Totsuki     
until further notice!           

210
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,931
That's quite perplexing         
of you, Father.                 

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,933
For it's thanks to MY exacting  
education that the God Tongue   

212
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,535
will soon be fully realized.    

213
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,738
[SENZAEMON]                     
This isn't education!           

214
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,006
It's brainwashing!              

215
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,608
You are far too dangerous.      

216
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,278
You are forbidden to use        
the Nakiri name ever again!     

217
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,282
[SENZAEMON]                     
And so, Azami was finally       
driven away from Totsuki        

218
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,950
and from seeing his daughter.   

219
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,953
After that, I heard he set      
up operations overseas,         

220
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:33,492
creating a community closed     
to all but the wealthy,         
his elitest followers.          

221
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:38,897
I never dreamed he would worm   
his way into the Ten and        
instigate a rebellion.          

222
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,300
He is without shame.            

223
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:46,438
Erina, though brainwashed,      
slowly began returning to her   
old self once he was gone.      

224
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,244
Hisako Arato, among several     
others, were of great           
help to her.                    

225
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,179
But somehow, Azami found out.   

226
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,917
Erina's heart, that poor child, 
is still trapped within a cage. 

227
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:08,127
His methods are the same as     
they were 10 years ago          
when he was cast out.           

228
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,928
I know him.                     

229
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,997
He will start to restrict       
Erina's contact with others,    

230
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,001
making HIM the only one         
she can ever count on.          

231
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,270
Back when Alice was in Europe,  

232
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,672
he'd shred all the              
letters she sent.               

233
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,208
Erina once again will be        
trapped in a place              

234
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,277
where no voice can reach her.   

235
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,881
And she will be forced into     
doing what he expects from her. 

236
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,816
[SENZAEMON] Soma Yukihira...    

237
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,019
I would ask just                
one thing of you:               

238
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,390
I want you to save my           
grandaughter, Erina!            

239
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:40,859
I beg you!                      

240
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,033
[AZAMI] Now then, you can       
only trust your father.         

241
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,836
All else, you must cast aside,  
Erina.                          

242
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,638
[ERINA] (pain)                  
F-Father, please stop!          

243
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,175
I don't wanna do this anymore!  
I don't like it!                

244
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,776
Is that so?                     

245
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,646
I have no use for such a child. 

246
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:02,881
[gasp]                          

247
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,588
[deep sigh]                     
Hisako's not here anymore.      

248
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,325
I have only my father           
by my side, no one else.        

249
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,062
[ALICE] Erina! ERINA!           

250
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,798
[ERINA] Alice?!                 
[ALICE] (straining)             

251
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,133
[ALICE] Ryo! Just a little more!
[RYO] 'kay.                     

252
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,402
[ALICE]                         
And keep your eyes to yourself! 
[RYO] 'kay.                     

253
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,271
What's going on, Alice?         

254
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,607
[ALICE] What's it look like?    
Well, don't just stand there!   

255
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,876
We're here to break you out     
of this stupid place!           
[ERINA] (huh?)                  

256
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,578
[HISAKO] Ms Erina...            

257
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,148
[ERINA] Hisako!                 

258
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,816
[ALL] (panting)                 

259
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:50,896
[ALICE] Well, if we've made it  
this far, seems we weren't      
being followed.                 

260
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:53,298
Alice, why are you doing this?  

261
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,301
[ALICE] Hisako looks like       
she's about to die.             
[HISAKO] Ms Erina... Ms Erina...

262
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,103
Um, are you doing all right?    

263
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:01,306
Alice, it's just, yadda-yadda,  
homina-homina, blah, blah, blah!

264
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,908
Yes, I know already.            

265
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:05,376
Uncle Azami is doing the        
same thing to Erina now         

266
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:08,046
that he did to her              
when she was growing up.        

267
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,916
I heard from Father and Mother  
what our uncle was up to.       

268
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,519
I always knew he was a          
jerk wad from the start.        

269
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:16,655
Also, my father spoke           
to me as well.                  

270
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,359
[ALICE] I wrote you all         
those letters, and yet...       

271
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,395
You never wrote me              
back even once.                 

272
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:24,997
Uh, well, that...               

273
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,200
Yes, I know.                    
That's why this time,           

274
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,436
I will not let Uncle Azami      
get away with this!             

275
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,139
Just run! That's what girls     
these days have to do           

276
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,940
when dealing with               
scumbags like this.             

277
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,609
Run away?                       

278
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,145
But I couldn't possibly go      
against Father like that.       

279
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,080
Stop sounding so pitiful        
over there!                     

280
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,483
You don't have to always        
put on a brave face, Erina!     

281
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,418
So, uh...                       
[ALICE] What is it, Ryo?!       

282
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,553
Leaving home is                 
all fine and good,              

283
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,088
but where will she even go?     

284
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,624
I think she'll need             
a place to stay, don't you?     

285
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,361
Hey, how about the              
Arato mansion?                  

286
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,431
What?! People from the          
Nakiri family are always        
coming and going,               

287
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,699
so it would be totally          
impossible to hide her there!   

288
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,104
Don't forget Alice and I        
live on the grounds of          
the Nakiri mansion.             

289
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,906
Huh? Someone's gotta be able    
to take her in somewhere?!      

290
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,843
Don't refer to Ms Erina like    
some she's abandoned cat!       

291
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,244
<i> Abandoned cat?</i>                 

292
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,713
Oh, I know!                     
You can get a room in a hotel!  

293
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:18,317
Erina doesn't know a thing      
about the outside world, she    
wouldn't last one minute!       

294
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,518
[shocked]                       

295
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,653
'K!                             
In that case, I'll go with her! 

296
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,789
If the both of you              
disappear at the same time,     

297
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,659
you'll immediately draw         
suspicion and be found          
sooner rather than later.       

298
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:31,996
[HIASKO] We can like hire a     
shadow warrior or get           
a 3D printer!                   

299
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,999
[rain begins to fall]           

300
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,475
I'll go back to the mansion.    

301
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,477
Ms Erina!                       

302
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,612
[ERINA] If any of you get more  
involved in this,               

303
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,615
it will most likely end up      
getting YOU in trouble as well. 

304
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:53,218
But! Wait! Ms Erina!            
[bushes rustling]               

305
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,753
Who is it?!                     

306
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,954
What?                           

307
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,556
Why are you here?               

308
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,894
[SOMA] Wow, it's really         
coming down now, huh?           

309
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,832
Sure enough, that's my cue      
to start heading on back        
to the dorm.                    

310
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,901
Soma Yukihira...                

311
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,907
[SOMA] Look, I know Erina is    
probably having a hard time     
at home and everything...       

312
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,576
but that doesn't                
really involve me.              

313
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,713
What I have to do right now was 
decided a long time ago.        

314
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:25,150
It's just like when I was       
told when my food               
was disgusting.                 

315
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,721
It's disgusting!                

316
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,189
[SOMA] So it's like this...     

317
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,724
I won't be able to rest         

318
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:36,327
until I find a way to make      
her say it's delicious!         

319
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:39,031
Well, if you'll excuse me!      
I'm out.                        

320
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,935
[chuckles]                      

321
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,604
<i> It's just as you said,</i>         
<i> Joichiro.</i>                      

322
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,673
<i> If Erina can be helped at all,</i> 

323
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:52,811
<i> surely it will be by this boy</i>  
<i> and his generation of</i>          
<i> classmates.</i>                    

324
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,614
Megumi Tadokoro,                
what are you doing here?        

325
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,618
I'd ask you the same.           
Why are you here?               

326
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,486
You're going to catch a cold.   

327
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:05,224
Hurry up and come with me       
to Kyokusei Dorm.               

328
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,093
[door creaking open]            

329
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,764
This is weird.                  

330
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,633
I...                            
I'll be staying here, now.      

331
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:17,236
Uh, Hisako? What's up?          

332
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,104
Well, that's actually           
quite a long story...           

333
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,506
Just run! That's what girls     
these days have to do           

334
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,508
when faced with                 
scumbags like this.             

335
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,244
[SOMA] Wow, you ran away, huh?  

336
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,114
Nice! I dig it.                 
Good job, Erina!                

337
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,381
Don't make fun of me!           

338
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:32,451
I'm not tryin' to make          
fun of you at all.              

339
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,587
But um, what happend to Nakiri  
No. 2, where is she in all this?

340
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:38,389
Miss Alice and her servant      
have already returned home.     

341
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:39,792
Well, see you later!            

342
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,059
They just took off?             

343
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,128
A bath has already              
been drawn for you.             

344
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,932
You must be cold.               
Go warm yourself up.            

345
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,867
[AIDA]                          
Ms Erina isn't in her room.     
[rain continues]                

346
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,870
And it would seem that she left 
accompanied by Miss Alice.      

347
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,672
Shall I send some men           
out after her?                  

348
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,407
[AZAMI]                         
That's Erina all right...       

349
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,075
Yes, do that.                   

350
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,411
Go ahead and find out           
where it is she has gone.       

351
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,947
I am quite busy dealing with    
some important matters          
right now.                      

352
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:06,284
Tomorrow, the curtain rises     
on our great revolution.        

353
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:09,754
[YUKI] What? We're gonna help   
Erina Nakiri hide out?          

354
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,357
Like, she'll be right           
here at Kyokusei?               

355
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,760
But she's part of the           
Nakiri family.                  

356
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:18,230
[hmm] Having someone that       
important here in our dorm...   

357
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,764
could cause some problems.      

358
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,499
[SATO] I think it's better      
to just bug out, man.           

359
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,570
Are they gonna treat us like    
vicious kidnappers or something?

360
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:27,172
So, why did she leave home      
in the first place?             

361
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,975
[RYOKO] Maybe something happened
to a member of her family.      

362
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,844
[ERINA] (sigh)                  

363
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:35,981
All right then, I guess you all 
need to be told what's going on.

364
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:40,051
Please, I ask that none of you  
share this information          
with anyone else.               

365
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,388
I want you all to know what     
Ms Erina has gone through,      

366
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,290
so you will understand.         

367
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:50,662
Um, thank you for allowing      
me to take a bath.              

368
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,398
Believe me, I am very grateful. 

369
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,401
[ALL]                           
(chaotic screaming and sobbing) 

370
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,737
This "Azami" guy sounds like    
a real dill weed!               

371
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,272
It's totally whacked, bro!      

372
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:03,542
Yeah! That's no way for         
a parent to act! Lame, dog!     

373
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:07,079
Feel free to stay here as long  
as you want, sweet little,      
Erina-poo!                      

374
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,413
Erina-poo?!                     
[sobs and cries continue]       

375
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,549
Hey, Erina, have you eaten?     

376
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,883
No, not yet.                    

377
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,686
Then the timing is just perfect.

378
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:17,756
Everyone! We have a special     
guest here visiting             
Kyokusei Dorm!                  

379
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,958
What do you say we              
hold a feast tonight?           

380
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:21,427
[ALL] Yeah!                     
[ERINA] (uuhhh!)                

381
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:24,763
[AOKI] White fish slow-cooked   
in clarified butter!            

382
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,164
Give it a little nibble!        

383
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,966
Guess I don't have a choice,    
do I?                           

384
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,035
Well, tell me whatcha           
think of it?                    

385
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,971
[ERINA] I believe you have      
made use of the ingredients'    
intrinsic flavors.              

386
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,907
I know! [chuckles]              

387
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:37,976
But the use of clarified butter 
has ended up muddling the taste.

388
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,914
The Vin Jaune and Macvin du Jura
in the sauce must be more       
harmonious than this.           

389
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:46,318
The comte cheese in the garnish 
isn't a good match for the      
soba-like flavor of the crozets.

390
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:48,787
That's a demerit. This could be 
compared to stepping outside,   

391
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:52,190
then finding yourself in        
a sudden downpour and           
falling into the mud.           

392
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,993
In summary, it's no good at all.

393
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:56,862
[urk!]                          

394
00:19:56,931 --> 00:20:00,198
WHATEVER! Who cares about some  
prissy "God Tongue" anyway?!    

395
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,599
YOU asked ME.                   

396
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,402
Let's see what you think        
of MY dish, m'lady!             

397
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,738
This is our chance to have the  
God Tongue taste our food!      

398
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,206
This is very exciting!          

399
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:09,274
I'll bring something out        
I smoked yesterday.             

400
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,011
Hold on! I can't eat possibly   
eat all that food in one night! 

401
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:15,280
Erina-poo, have a big bite      
out of my dish right here!      

402
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,615
Are you even listening to me?!  

403
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,283
Just look at her.               
[YUKI] Erina=poo...             

404
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,885
She seems to be feeling better. 
[ERINA] All right, fine!        

405
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,621
Seriously? She looks like       
she's throwing a tantrum.       

406
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,623
[HISAKO]                        
The thing is, I understand.     
(babble continues)              

407
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:28,426
When we first met each other,   
as beautiful as she was,        

408
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:31,763
it's like there was this        
dark cloud that was just        
hanging over her.               

409
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,765
But slowly, bit by bit,         

410
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,167
she was able to change.         

411
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:37,236
[excited babble]                

412
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:42,507
Oh, Soma,                       
you make something too!         

413
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,043
Yeah, like some rad delicacy.   

414
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,512
Sweet! Then just leave it to me!

415
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:49,515
[SOMA] There!                   

416
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,684
[gasp]                          

417
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,786
Huh? Is something the matter,   
Erina?                          

418
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:56,255
I'm fine. It's nothing.         

419
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,723
Incidentally, you should        
know better by now.             

420
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,125
I will not eat YOUR food!       

421
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:01,793
You never change, do ya?        

422
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:05,064
All right, then,                
I wonder what I'll make?        

423
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,101
[music playing]                 

424
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:12,598
[HISAKO] Okay, Soma, I'm asking 
that you look after Ms Erina.   
[rain continues]                

425
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, it makes no difference    
to me either way,               

426
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,802
but I think it does             
to everyboady else.             

427
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:20,406
Let's play cards!               
 ALL] Yeah!                     
[ERINA] Play cards?!            

428
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:22,941
I hope Erina's father           
learns something                

429
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,477
from her running away from home 
in the middle of the night.     

430
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,614
I doubt things will go that     
smoothly with her father.       

431
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:32,618
After all, Ms Erina is the key  
to Master Azami's plan.         

432
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,454
He won't give up that easily.   

433
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:40,425
[AZAMI] This is the method      
that I shall introduce.         

434
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:44,562
From here on out, this school   
will become a utopia            
of fine cuisine,                

435
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:48,901
where all those with true       
resolve can become the splendid 
chefs they are meant to be.     

436
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:52,371
<i> How is THIS a utopia?</i>          
<i> This is...</i>                     

437
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:56,574
<i> the Devil of Cuisine splitting</i> 
<i> the world in two!</i>              

438
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,844
<i> A dystopia!</i>                    

439
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,913
[evil chuckle]
