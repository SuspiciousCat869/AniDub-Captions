1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,410
[SOMA] A televised address?     

2
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,546
Yeah, the new director supposed 
to be holding it today.         

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,950
They say it's going to air live 
across the whole campus.        

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,084
[SOMA] Woah...                  

5
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,019
Still,                          
for Erina to leave home...      

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,155
She must have some pretty big   
reasons to do something         
like that.                      

7
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,625
But will she be okay            
staying there?                  

8
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,228
If word gets out that she's     
holed up in the school dorm...  

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,164
[hmmm]                          
Yeah, who's to really say?      

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,101
Hisako has been coming by to    
bring her fresh clothes         
and stuff every day.            

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,172
And Nakiri No. 2 and Ryo        
have been stopping by as well.  
[ALICE] Hey!                    

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,307
Still, it looks like her        
secret is safe.                 

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,043
No, I'd say it's not really     
a secret at all anymore!        

14
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,978
I'm coming to you live          
from the scene.                 

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,716
Azami Nakiri, the new director, 
has arrived to make an          
announcement!                   

16
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,403
Students of Totsuki,            
you have my thanks.             

17
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,238
I'm Azami Nakiri.               

18
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,841
[music playing]                 

19
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,600
            Students of Totsuki,
            you have my thanks. 

20
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,734
               I'm Azami Nakiri.

21
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,803
This pasty guy is Erina-poo's...

22
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,472
 Yeah! That's her piece weak nut
 father dude up there.          

23
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
           [ZENJI] He was on the
           Council of Ten, too? 

24
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,876
Allow me to be honest with you. 

25
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,345
I'm here to share my vision     
of the perfect world,           

26
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,082
one where Totsuki Academy       
is reborn, and exactly          
what that involves.             

27
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,951
The first point is this...      

28
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,954
Beginning immediately,          
all cooking-related             
lectures and seminars,          

29
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,490
as well as study groups         
and societies,                  

30
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:42,160
hereby, are stripped of all     
rights to operate autonomously! 

31
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,762
[shocked]                       

32
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,166
What?                           
He's gonna take our rights?!    

33
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,100
The dial is at zero...          

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,503
and everything ends NOW.        

35
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,904
[STUDENT] What did he say?!     

36
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,040
What the hell?                  
Are you kidding me?!            

37
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,042
On to the second point...       

38
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,312
A new organization shall be     
established on campus.          

39
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:05,050
It will be an elite corps,      
comprising of myself and the    
Council of Ten at the top,      

40
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:09,321
as well as any students         
I personally choose, with the   
goal of seeking out new cuisine.

41
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,590
It shall be a world of gods,    

42
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,592
where knowledge of all things   
delicious is exchanged:         

43
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:19,731
The Central Institution         
for Fine Cuisine: or, "Central."

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,466
"Central Institution"?          

45
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,002
Starting today and going        
forward from now on,            

46
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,406
everything you make             
will be decided by the          
members of Central.             

47
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:32,344
Which means, you no longer have 
to conceive of your own dishes. 

48
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,849
My apologies, but any who       
disagree with this method will  
be asked to leave the school.   

49
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,485
Huh? How dare you?!             
[angry students]                

50
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,286
Someone needs to                
put you in your place!          

51
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,421
[STUDENT A] What?!              
[STUDENT B] I just don't get it!

52
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,691
Come now, if you would          
just think about it.            

53
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,560
The system up until now         
has been quite illogical.       

54
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,497
Those who fail to achieve under 
the merit-based systems         
are simply let go,              

55
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:57,435
regardless of the proven fact   
that chefs are highly known     
to develop at their own speed.  

56
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,972
Do you not find that this       
is needlessly cruel?            

57
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:05,043
So just let me state, from now  
on, all cooking lectures,       
and all teaching will be        
held at Central.                

58
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,180
All will have equal opportunity 
to reap its benefits.           

59
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:12,984
In time, EVERYONE will aquire   
the techniques and skills       

60
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:15,787
to one day be on the same       
level as with the Ten.          

61
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,257
Shut your mouth! How can you    
even call yourself a chef?!     

62
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,660
It will be a new world free     
from conflict without merit.    

63
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,996
Unnecessary expulsions!         

64
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,864
Unnecessary exclusion!          

65
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,866
Unnecessary competitions!       

66
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,135
You will be freed               
from all of these!              

67
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,670
Listen up!                      

68
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,139
You are not pawns               
to be sacrificed.               

69
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:38,477
You are the all-important force 
upon which the future of        
Totsuki shall be built.         

70
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,345
Join with me.                   

71
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,882
And together we'll advance the  
culinary scope of this country. 

72
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,484
[RINDO] (hmph!)                 

73
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,018
[KABUTOYAMA]                    
He's screwing with us!          

74
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,220
There's no way we can           
accept this sort of crap!       

75
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,889
[GIRL] Y-yeah, but still...     

76
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,092
We can get the Ten's            
"leftovers," right?             

77
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,628
I mean, that's sure to be       
of some benefit in the future,  
right?                          

78
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,963
Don't you think?                

79
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,431
What the hell are you saying?!  

80
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,300
I will NOT bow to tyranny!      

81
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:05,637
Tetsuji Kabutoyama of the       
Skewered Research Society,      

82
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,639
I have a message from Central.  

83
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,043
[MAN 2] As of today,            
the Regional Cuisine            
Research Society is closed.     

84
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,746
Please clear out your room      
immediately.                    

85
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,249
[IKUMI] You... you bastards!    

86
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,650
You better leave right now      

87
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,385
if you don't want your          
asses handed to you!            

88
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,521
The matter has already          
been decided.                   

89
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,393
Please know that your           
only choice is to comply with   
Central, Prof. Miyazato.        

90
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,662
This can't be!                  
Professor!                      

91
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,631
Is the Miyazato Seminar         
really coming to an end?!       

92
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,942
[EIZAN] As I'm sure you know,   
Kyokusei is the only dorm       
on school grounds.              

93
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,345
Until today, you have managed to
support yourselves financially. 

94
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,882
But make no mistake,            
it has made you a target        
for removal.                    

95
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,351
This dormitory will be          
razed to the ground.            

96
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,288
It's no longer of any           
real use to Totsuki.            

97
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,089
"No longer of any real use"?    

98
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,425
You're taking Kyokusei          
and knocking it down?!          

99
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:05,030
Both the building and the       
property itself will be taken   
over by those in Central.       

100
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,099
So in other words,              
this place will no longer       
be yours.                       

101
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,567
I'd like to see you try, bro!   

102
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,503
[SATO]                          
You dudes suck! Like hard!      

103
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,372
Whatcha lookin' at?             
You want a piece of me, huh?    

104
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,906
Yuki, please!                   
[Yuki] You sonofa goat herder!  

105
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,644
Say, where is Isshiki?          
He's a member of the Ten.       

106
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,580
If he were here, these guys     
wouldn't be able to just        
barge in like this.             

107
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:25,384
He'd need to actually be here   
for that to happen, but he      
hasn't been here for awhile.    

108
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,720
Is Miyazato Seminar             
in trouble too?!                

109
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:30,322
[SOMA] Well, as long as we're   
standing around talking,        

110
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,058
have some tea or something,     
please.                         

111
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,193
[SHUN] Have...                  
[RYOKO] ...some...              

112
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,528
[AOKI] ...tea...                
[SATO] ...or...                 

113
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,862
[ZENJI] ...some...              
[YUKI] ...thing...              

114
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,231
[MEGUMI] ...please?             

115
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:45,003
[SOMA] Why do you even want     
to knock our dorm down?         

116
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,874
I thought heard we were         
kind of like some sort of       
an independent nation.          

117
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,144
I mean why would the school     
interfer with us now?           

118
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,613
[EIZAn] You've just answered    
your own question.              

119
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:59,350
Having an autonomous            
organization other than Central 
on campus would pose a problem. 

120
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
We don't need two               
quarreling bodies.              

121
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,155
This is our final               
decision on the matter.         

122
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:06,424
These documents state when      
you'll be expected to vacate.   

123
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,093
BUT you can rest easy.          

124
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,763
So long as you toe the line     
and do as Central says,         

125
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,364
you can all remain              
here as students.               

126
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,832
Mind if I cut in?               

127
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,701
The decision to knock           
down the dorm...                

128
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,837
It can be reversed, right?      

129
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,972
Through a Food War?             

130
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,374
<i> Soma!</i>                          

131
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,711
Absolutely! You are correct.    

132
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,245
Any decision made by Central    

133
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,915
can be overturned through       
a victory in a Food War.        

134
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,585
But that rests entirely on      
whether one of us would         
willing to accept.              

135
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,589
We are under absolutely no      
obligation to engage in         
any sort of Food War.           

136
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,125
And currently, we're being      
flooded with requests           

137
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,462
from almost every               
organization in the Academy.    

138
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:46,798
It would seem people aren't too 
happy with the new policies.    

139
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,002
Now, simply doing nothing       
would lead to their ruin,       

140
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,872
but in my case, I actually      
sympathize with their           
plight to be heard,             

141
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,940
and have decided that           
I will accept.                  

142
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,342
[ALL] (shocked!)                

143
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:01,079
Huh? Doing a Food War           
when you don't have to?         

144
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,547
That's mighty big of you.       

145
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,283
Of course, my opponent          
must also take on               

146
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,950
an appropriate amount of risk.  

147
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,421
But I'm fairly certain you      
probably realize that.          

148
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,824
I already have a Food War       
scheduled for today.            

149
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:14,293
Why don't you come see          
how it turns out?               

150
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,228
And if you still wish           
to move forward,                

151
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,897
you can come at me however      
you deem necessary,             

152
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,766
Soma Yukihira.                  

153
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,069
[drum beats]                    

154
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,508
You're mine, Eizan!             
I won't let you disband         
Skewer Society.                 

155
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,244
The theme is Largehead Hairtail-

156
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,313
Yes, I get it.                  

157
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:38,183
And I'll be sure to include     
a skewering technique           
during preparation.             

158
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:41,520
Now then, if you lose,          
you leave the school.           

159
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,988
I take it you have              
no complaints?                  

160
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,523
Yeah, whatever.                 

161
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,192
You will learn the full weight  
of the skills I've honed.       

162
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,593
Day in, and day out I've-       

163
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:50,662
Okay, enough with the           
blabbering already.             

164
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,465
I'm going to take your best dish
and destroy it.                 

165
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,068
So come on,                     
give me everything you've got!  

166
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:58,103
And now, Food War!              

167
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:00,205
So it begins!                   

168
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,075
[RYOKO] It's started.           

169
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,810
[SATO]                          
Give 'em hell, Skewer-Soc!      

170
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,412
He can do it!                   

171
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,347
Yeah! It's not over yet!        

172
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,948
If he can win this...           

173
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,418
Then, we can totally            
save this place.                

174
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,219
And I will never give up easily!

175
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,488
We can still take them down...  

176
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,857
 ALL] ...by beating them        
in a Food War!                  

177
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,027
What is he doing?               

178
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,829
He doesn't look like            
he's concentrating on           
his dish at all.                

179
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,232
Something's off...              

180
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:30,769
No matter how much he goes out  
there and crushes Kabutoyama,   

181
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,773
I don't think it's gonna make   
other research societies or     
seminars back down.             

182
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:40,045
So then, what did Chef Eizan    
mean about this being           
a "warning"?                    

183
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,783
It is now time for judgment!    

184
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,391
[hmm] What is this?             

185
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,060
What the?                       
This is weird!                  

186
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,596
Look, the readout's             
broken or something.            

187
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,198
It's showing a score even though
no one's tried anything yet.    

188
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,867
[ALL] (evil chuckles)           

189
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,268
[KABUTOYAMA] Huh?               

190
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,803
Eizen, don't tell me...         

191
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,439
You got to the judges?!         

192
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:13,144
Too bad, Skewer Boy!            
[evil laugh                     

193
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,746
[ANNOUNCER] We have a winner!   

194
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,549
Skewer-Soc is hereby dissolved! 

195
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:21,153
Hold on, Eizan!                 
Can't believe you would         
cook for bought judges!         

196
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:24,222
Cut the crap! This kind of      
"Food War" means nothing!       

197
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,892
This is simply outrageous!      
[EIZAN] Well now, Kabutoyama... 

198
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,827
Say goodbye.                    

199
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,732
[EIZAN] Looks like you're out.  

200
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,568
Can't be!                       

201
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,638
This is a whole                 
different Totsuki               

202
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:40,839
you're dealing with now.        

203
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,641
That's some evil stuff          
right there!                    

204
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,576
So the judges dudes             
are on the take?!               

205
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,512
Our safety net is now ruined!   

206
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,914
Just how dirty can that         
bastard Eizan get?!             

207
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,515
This is a losing battle.        

208
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,451
He turned every one of          
the judges against us!          

209
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,320
None of them would even         
bother tasting the food!        

210
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,256
If we can't even get a proper   
competition, then that means... 

211
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,859
Whether we challenge him        
to a Food War or not,           

212
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,260
the outcome will be the same.   

213
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,297
No matter what we do,           
Kyokusei is finished!           

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,667
Bro, you gotta be kiddin' me!   

215
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:12,137
There's nothing we can do,      
our home is gonna get torn down!

216
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:13,605
What should we do?              

217
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:16,575
Erina, you'll lose your hiding  
place if they take it!          

218
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,347
<i> Well, Soma?</i>

[SECRETARY]                     
Chief, are you all right?       

222
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:46,438
Yesterday's Food War was        
something of a shock to me.     

223
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,973
             This is a disaster.

224
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,710
    I can't believe Eizan would 
    actually buy off the judges!

225
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,845
Hey, how's it going, Chief?!    
[door slams open]               

226
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,582
Chef Eizan!                     
You can't just come barging in! 

227
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,117
What's the matter with you?     

228
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,785
I just came by to               
confirm something.              

229
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,453
[door slams]                    

230
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:03,922
I heard a rumor that we'd       
received over 100 applications  

231
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,858
challenging me to a Food War.   

232
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,193
I just wanted to see where      
that number stands now.         

233
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,794
[grrr...]                       

234
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,131
Well, they've...                

235
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,798
They've all been cancelled.     

236
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,135
[EIZAN] (maniacal chuckle)      
What a shame!                   

237
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,138
I suppose wonders never cease,  
do they?                        

238
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,477
I had my heart set on doing a   
whole BUNCH of challenges.      
[KAGEURA] (grrr...)             

239
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:28,680
[TEACHER] As of today, you'll   
be working off of this menu,    

240
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,149
which Central has decided       
was the best recipe.            

241
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:35,087
This method of cooking will     
be the standard here at         
Totsuki from now on.            

242
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:36,689
Now, let's do our best!         

243
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,294
What are you doing?             

244
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,630
Those ingredients are to be     
braised in the oven.            

245
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,032
Did you not bother to read      
what the recipe said to do?     

246
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,768
I mean, it's written right      
there in the instructions,      
isn't it?                       

247
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:53,037
As far as I know, this is       
how it's always been done,      

248
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,707
so I see no reason for us       
to change it now.               

249
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,109
You're just a student.          

250
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:58,977
There is no need for you to     
weigh in on this.               

251
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:02,047
Central's word is absolute      
for all recipes.                

252
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,516
Don't do it again.              
[SHUN] (grr...)                 

253
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:09,053
[ZENJI]                         
Oh, Regional Cuisine got the    
order to disband too, huh?      

254
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,390
[MEGUMI] (uhm)                  
And Miyazato Seminar?           

255
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,991
Yeah.                           

256
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,728
And the other groups are        
getting handed their notices.   

257
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,664
Unfortunately, we have          
no options in trying to         
repeal it, either.              

258
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:22,134
We have 10 days till            
we need to leave the dorm.      

259
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,204
There's no way out of it now.   
[sigh]                          

260
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,744
[RYOKO] Erina?                  

261
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,812
Are you okay?                   

262
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Why are you in here with        
the lights off?                 

263
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,318
It's about time for dinner,     
so let's head down.             

264
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,587
Umm, Ryoko!                     

265
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,958
Sorry, no, it's nothing.        

266
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,094
Oh, come on now.                

267
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:52,498
It's gonna get cold,            
so let's hurry up and           
get to the table, okay?         

268
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,976
Do you think they'd actually    
get rid of this dorm?           

269
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,544
Looks like it.                  

270
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,983
[dispirited sigh] Well,         
guess there's nothing we can do.

271
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,453
This old dorm is gonna be gone  
just like that, huh?            

272
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:17,723
But it's always been here       
for us. It'll be weird.         

273
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:21,059
Dude, looking back, we've sure  
been through a lot, haven't we? 

274
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:25,130
I was super surprised by        
Ms Fumio's dorm entrance test,  
ya know?                        

275
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:29,001
It took me three months to      
pass her test, but I            
remember during that time,      

276
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,271
Ms Fumio was so kind to let me  
stay in the barn while I        
kept trying.                    

277
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,672
[agog] For real?                

278
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,741
I had no idea you               
slept in the BARN!              

279
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,010
You may notlook it,             
but you're pretty tough.        

280
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,479
You know that, Megumi?          
In all ways!                    

281
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:44,749
And remember when Soma          
transferred to the              
High School Division?           

282
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,552
I might as well                 
take the top spot.              

283
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,153
See a few of you at graduation! 

284
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,223
[outraged shouts from crowd]    

285
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:54,560
Oh wow, we all have such        
fond memories here.             

286
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,328
[MEGUMI] I know, right?         

287
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:03,902
[ZENJI] Then there was the time 
we all made it through the      
training camp from Hell.        

288
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:08,974
[YUKI] I really had no idea what
would happen when Megumi had    
a Food War with Chef Kojiro!    

289
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,176
[startled gasp!]                
A Food War?!                    

290
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,644
Oh, it was nothing!             

291
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,713
[RYOKO] Summer vacation...      

292
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,715
[SHUN] The Fall Selection...    

293
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,185
[AOKI]                          
And then, the Lunar Feast!      

294
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,922
[SATO] We totally killed        
that hot pot party, huh?        

295
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,992
[YUKI] Soma and Megumi's        
Chinese food stall!             

296
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,262
[RYOKO] And we've always made   
lots of food together, huh?     

297
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,197
[MEGUMI] Yeah, we really have!  

298
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,133
[ZENJI] So many good times...   

299
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:36,669
[YUKI] There really have        
been so many things, huh?       

300
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:40,806
I mean, like, if we started     
talking about them,             
we'd never stop!                

301
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,880
So many things, I just can't... 

302
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,182
You okay there?                 

303
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,086
My heart can't take any of this!

304
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:57,956
I don't want Kyokusei to be     
taken away and gone forever!    
[BOTH] (aww...)                 

305
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,359
[YUKI] I wanna spend            
more time with you all!         

306
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,895
More... MORE time!              
[sobbing]                       

307
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,899
I wanted to spend more time     
cooking together!               

308
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,901
Yuki...                         
[MEGUMI] (beginning to sob)     

309
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,236
[begins to sob as well]         

310
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,106
[ALL] (sobbing wildly)          

311
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,577
[YUKI] It's so unfair!          

312
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,128
<i> This place,</i>                    
<i> Kyokusei Dormitory...</i>          

313
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,297
<i> What was it like for you</i>       
<i> living here?</i>                   

314
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,200
I had a blast.                  

315
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,469
Everyone brushing up on         
their cooking skills,           

316
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,472
in whatever way they liked...   

317
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,077
Huh?!                           

318
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:54,012
What the helll do you           
think you're doing?             

319
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:57,215
Come on now, don't do something 
stupid, Soma Yukihira.          

320
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:00,285
Do you still not understand     
the situation you're in?        

321
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,622
The judges are all on my side.  

322
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:07,092
It's not a matter of            
winning or losing,              
they won't even taste it.       

323
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,829
See, the minute you enter that  
ring, you're gonna be done for. 

324
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:15,968
And yet, you still want         
to have a Food War?             
[SOMA] Yep.                     

325
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,571
Did you grow tired of           
listening to the weeping        
of your dormmates?              

326
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:23,041
I understand wanting to help    
your friends and trying to      
play the hero, but...           

327
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,910
Just stop already.              

328
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,446
Foolishness and bravery         
aren't the same thing.          

329
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:33,118
That's nice, but I'm not really 
doing it for dormmates.         

330
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,319
Why then?                       

331
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,987
Easy...                         

332
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,389
It's for me.                    

333
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,257
Kyokusei is my castle,          

334
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:42,260
which I've used to              
hone my cooking.                

335
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,462
So guess what!                  

336
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:46,264
You won't knock down my dorm.   

337
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,533
Got it?                         

338
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,835
Accept this Food War.           
[EIZAN] (grr...)                

339
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,204
[SECRETARY] Chief, look!        

340
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,672
What's that?                    
An actually Food War?!          

341
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:57,809
[YUKI] "I'm off to challenge    
Chef Eizan to a Food War.       

342
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:00,345
I cooked up some curry          
and left it in the fridge.      

343
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,147
Everyone, microwave it          
and have some.                  

344
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,883
Sincerely, Soma Yukihira"       

345
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:08,687
What is he doing?               
Is he crazy?                    

346
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,489
But why?                        
Why would he go off on his own? 

347
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,625
Is he making sure               
we don't get involved?          

348
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,761
What the heck has he done?!     

349
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:17,896
He's a member of                
Kyokusei like us!               

350
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,165
So then why?                    
Why do it?                      

351
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,300
Why act as if he's              
alone in this?!                 

352
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,037
And at this rate, Soma's sure to
be expelled from...             
[front door opening]            

353
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,706
Ms Erina!                       

354
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,108
Turn on the TV!                 

355
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,110
You gotta check out             
what's on the campus feed!      

356
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:32,544
It's Soma!                      

357
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,381
Yeah, look, it's on right now!  

358
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,849
   Attention,                   
   a Food War has been accepted.

359
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,452
       I repeat,                
       there will be a Food War!

360
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:43,455
Etsuya Eizan has                
accepted the challenge.         

361
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,924
The competition will            
begin any moment!               

362
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:47,926
[EIZAN]                         
The theme ingredient is...      

363
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,395
local Satsuma chicken           
from Kagoshima.                 

364
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:54,065
It has a fair degree of fat,    
and is known for having         
an unique texture,              

365
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,333
and depth of umami.             

366
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,469
Hey, are you even               
listening to me?!               

367
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,804
What are you doing, you idiot?  

368
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,073
Just checking out the           
ingredients, dude.              

369
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,075
This is YOU, I'm dealing with.  

370
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,077
Never know when you're gonna    
try to pull some dirty trick,   
after all.                      

371
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,548
[heh!] Well, fine then.         
Do what makes you feel good.    

372
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,282
It's all for naught, anyway.    
[door flys open]                

373
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:14,219
Jerk! What you are doing, Eizan!

374
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:17,622
[urk!] What the hell are        
you doing here, Rindo?          

375
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:20,158
You will address me as          
your superior, you got that?    

376
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,760
Would you shut up               
and get outta here?!            

377
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,096
This area is for involved       
parties only, okay?! [ugh!]     

378
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:26,098
You better start showing        
some respect!                   
[EIZAN] (painful sounds)        

379
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
Hey, how ya doing Soma?         

380
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,702
Running off half-cocked         
as always, aren't you?          

381
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:34,440
Hello there, it's been quite    
a while, Chef Rindo.            

382
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,774
Yeah, that's the thing.         

383
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,776
This has turned into            
one heck of a ride!             

384
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:41,180
Thanks to Azami Nakiri's        
revolution, things are          
changing all over campus,       

385
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:45,718
and the members of the Ten are  
super busy making documents     
and doin' official business.    

386
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,585
We're practically               
dead in the water!              

387
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,053
[hmm?]                          

388
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:52,057
Well, I went ahead and          
put all that on Tsukasa.        

389
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:54,159
[SOMA] (uh...)                  

390
00:19:56,997 --> 00:20:01,567
I'm gonna start prepping,       
so I'll take the                
interior kitchen.               

391
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,543
[JUDGE] (evil laugh)            

392
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:14,079
I wouldn't think that, after    
the Food War the other day,     

393
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:16,615
there would be any one dumb     
enough to challenge Central.    

394
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,284
I take it this person must      
be quite the simpleton.         

395
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,420
Shall we just taste             
YOUR dish Eizan,                

396
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:23,288
and then leave the              
challenger's on the table?      

397
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,023
Do whatever you wish.           

398
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:27,826
I'll look forward to your       
final "judgment" today as well. 

399
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,162
[JUDGE] Of course!              
Well then, see you soon.        

400
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:32,497
[RINDO]                         
What a pity for you, Eizan.     

401
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:36,769
But as I recall, the real goal  
behind this little "warning"    
as you like to call it,         

402
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:40,572
was actually to break soma's    
fighting spirit, was it not?    

403
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:44,643
Yet not only did he NOT break,  
but he managed to come in       
right after behind you.         

404
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,044
[EIZAN] (hmph)                  

405
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,047
But don't let it                
get to you though.              

406
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,984
That's just the hardheaded      
little bratty punk he's         
grown up to be. [oh?]           

407
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Is it ready?                    

408
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:58,257
Good.                           
Then do as I've instructed.     

409
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,924
[evil chuckle]                  

410
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,561
Now, contestants,               
to your stations!               

411
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:07,032
[ALL] (nervous)                 

412
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:10,035
[SHUN] (huh?)                   

413
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,538
What? What is all this?         

414
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:17,008
[EIZAN] By the way,             
I forgot to mention.            

415
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,344
My men are headed to            
Kyokusei Dorm right now         

416
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,413
to go and pay their respects.   
[SOMA] (gasp)                   

417
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:25,417
Huh? They've got some           
business there or something?    

418
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,152
Oh, it's that little matter.    

419
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,154
You know about                  
vacating the dorm?              

420
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:32,157
The timeframe has been moved up 
just a TINY bit.                

421
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:35,027
Sorry to tell you,              
but your friends                

422
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:39,031
are about to be forcibly        
evicted from Kyokusei.          
 ALL] (huh?!)                   

423
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:43,035
I'm sure it will proceed with   
the utmost reverence with       
regards to my men.              

424
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,971
[EIZAN] Now then: the Food War. 

425
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,240
You have three hours            
to prepare your dish.           

426
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:49,975
By the time this                
match is finished,              

427
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:51,976
your dorm will just be          
sitting there empty.            

428
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:55,180
All that awaits you is the      
look of despair on your         
friends' faces                  

429
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,649
when they realize you           
let them down!                  

430
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,785
Now, let's get started!         

431
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:02,287
