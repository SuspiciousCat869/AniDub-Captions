the Axe of Marduk, huh?

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
That definitely looks like

Do you understand
your objective?

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
The target is what you see
on top of that temple.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI] That is the great
Sun Stone, the Aztec Calendar.

In other words, it is
the source of her power!

You're having a good time, too,
right, humanity's final Master?

[QUETZALCOATL]
You say the strangest things.

[QUETZALCOATL] Well then.
That must mean you understand

someone in battle!

[RITSUKA]
No, battle's a last resort

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
So, tell me what it is
you gain from battle.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
Do you like being a hero?
And saving humanity?

[RITSUKA] I don't care about
being called a hero!

between everyone after a battle,
then I will do everything I can

That's fine!

Trying to defeat me

facing her,

a pain in the butt!

What's wrong?

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center

be wrong this time, Doctor.

an empty victory!

There's more to it than that!

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.665 position:50% align:center

Oh my, this is getting exciting!

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.379 position:50% align:center
Is he going to fight a goddess

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
Stop this! It's insane!

If you fall here, everything
we've worked for is gone!

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center

...how much humans
can truly overcome!

How courageous they can be!

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
She has to know what
I've learned on this journey!

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
I'll make her see it!

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
That's such strong resolve!

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
But you still need
to reach greater heights,

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center

Mm-hm.

Height and courage?

better collect that Axe now.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, do you
need me to repeat myself?

Skinning or taxidermy,
which do you prefer?

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
Okay, those winged serpents
will be in good paws!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.001 position:50% align:center
Count on it!

You have a moment?

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what's up?

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.723 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] I think the
decision you made earlier

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
was a bit too arbitrary.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.184 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I won't deny that.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
It's true what you did
got great results.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
You earned the trust
of Quetzalcoatl,

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
and you acquired
the Axe of Marduk.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
But that's all in hindsight.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
You ignored the
direction from Chaldea

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
and were one step
away from ruining

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
the restoration of
humanity as a whole.

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Yes.

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] When I give an order,
I need you to follow it.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
And that's--

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
We lost contact. The Mana
Density is way too thick.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:21.212 position:50% align:center
600 minutes to fix.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Oh, brother.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.215 position:50% align:center
I screwed that all up.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
That's what I get for
stepping out of character

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
and getting stern.

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
Does somebody need
a shoulder massage?

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
If so, I've got the
latest model massager!

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
I think I'll be okay.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
Huh?

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
It'll be just fine.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
I think I know what I need to do
now, and how to accomplish it.

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Sounds like
we lost the connection.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Senpai?

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
I remember...

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
The Holy Grail War...

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
2004, Fuyuki, Japan...

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
It was there--the last
battle for the Grail,

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
the deciding moment for
the omnipotent wish granter.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
I'm certain you know
the winner's name.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
He is familiar to you.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Wait, you mean...?

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] The previous
director of Chaldea,

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
Marisbury Animusphere.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
He won the Holy Grail War.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.726 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
He had the Grail?

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
That's right.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
Furthermore,
he had an assistant.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
Romani Archaman.

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
Wait, Dr. Romani?

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
He was in the Grail War?

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Yes. He joined
the staff of Chaldea

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
in the following year.

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
And his personal history before
that is completely unknown.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
You should not trust him fully.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
He's hiding an important
secret from you.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
And it has to do with
the Holy Grail War

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
and the fate of humanity.

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
He and I talked before we
came to this Singularity.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Do humans...

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
Rather... does life
have any meaning at all?

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
Um... That's a pretty
complicated question.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
I mean, coming from
a god's perspective,

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
life might seem equally
meaningless to you.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:12.949 position:50% align:center
Well, really, life seemingly
has neither meaning nor merit,

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
at least not until
it's over, anyway.

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
Wait, could you explain?

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.457 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Humans are born,
grow up, and die

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
without any rhyme or reason.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
Only when a life is over
and you can see all of it

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
in its entirety can you
finally know what it meant.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
That's what life's
all about, you see?

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
We don't live life in
order to create meaning.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
We live so meaning can
be found in our lives.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
I think what you
said to Quetzalcoatl

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
in the middle of battle,
and what the Doctor said to me,

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
mean exactly the same thing.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
I'll know if I was right

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
once all of this is
played out to the end!

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
So I'm not worried.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm thinking you're right.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
If the doctor is hiding
something, he's got a reason.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Nothing to do
but trust our instincts

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
and plunge in head first!

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
You set that example, Senpai!

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA chuckles] I'd rather
not do that again, though.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
[MASH giggles]

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
It's not time to
change watch yet.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
You have good instincts.

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
Or maybe, could it be you're
becoming more sensitive

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center
to my presence perhaps?

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
I wouldn't mind.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
That means our nightly chats
about proper manners

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
when dealing with goddesses
have been paying off.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
Was that what we've
been talking about?

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
Never mind. Tonight,
I came to give you a compliment.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] It looks like you've
befriended another new goddess.

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Yep.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
That's pretty impressive.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
Although, it makes me
grumpy somehow.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
Let me pinch your cheek a bit.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's this for?!

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
Wait, you feel really hot!
Are you getting sick?

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I'm just a little tired.

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'm fine.

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] You're fine?
Are you getting enough rest?

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] I haven't had
a day off since the Rayshift.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
So, I've been working
for about a month straight.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
What? You're taking the term
hard work to the extreme!

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
Even manual labor in Kur

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
only lasts for
three days at the most!

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
It's okay,
I'm used to it by now.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
It must be hard, investigating
Singularities I mean.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
I suppose it must be taxing
on a human being after a while.

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
But it's been fun.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] All right, I'm taking
the rest of your watch, mister.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
It's time for you
to get some rest.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Thank... you...

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
I swear by the name of Irkalla,
no enemies shall come near you.

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
So, rest.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
Have sweet dreams
while I protect you.

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Better get some sleep.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
Ishtar?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
H-Huh?

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
Hello, you.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
We've finished
another nightly chat.

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
And don't forget
that you're only human.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
So make sure to get your rest.

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
All right!

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
We're almost back to Uruk!

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
You have so much energy, Senpai.

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I had a great night's
sleep in yesterday's camp!

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
We should be getting a reward
from His Majesty for this.

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
We have the Axe of
Marduk and a goddess!

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
I think we did pretty good!

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
I am also looking forward
to meeting the king, yes!

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
That's Siduri, isn't it?

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
Siduri!

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:42.552 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI]
It's awful!

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh is...

00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:34.956 position:50% align:center
Siduri? Where...

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:41.421 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes.

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.048 position:50% align:center
When the king awakens
from his slumber,

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:46.968 position:50% align:center
he finds himself in
the depths of Kur. Huh.

00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:48.720 position:50% align:center
This is no time for jokes!

00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:52.057 position:50% align:center
I'm actually dead!
What the hell is going on?!
