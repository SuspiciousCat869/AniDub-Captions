00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
Dan-no-Ura Eight-Boat Leap!

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
You cannot trick me!

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.888 position:50% align:center
Ushiwaka!

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
[GORGON groans]

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU yelling]

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
[GORGON gasps]

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA gasps]

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU]
This is farewell, Lord Fujimaru!

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
So was she able to do it?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.027 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA gasps]
It can't be!

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Two Noble Phantasms
and she's still standing!

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
[MASH] This is...
the power of a goddess!

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
Not so.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
Take a good look at that.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Is that...

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
--[MASH gasps]
--The light of the Holy Grail?

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:59.047 position:50% align:center
[GORGON] Oh? Sounds like someone
has done their research.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
The Holy Grail
gives her immortality.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.842 position:50% align:center
Don't make light of me.

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:06.596 position:50% align:center
I haven't even touched the
Holy Grail's Magical Energy yet.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
Destroying humans with
energy other than my own

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
wouldn't be nearly
as satisfying.

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
And now, I think it's time
that I rip Uruk apart.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
And then I'll kill the king.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
Demonic Beasts!
Wait no more, the time is now!

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
Unleash your hatred

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
and maul every human
that tries to escape!

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Wait a moment.

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
[GORGON]
Hm?

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
Mother, don't you think
that might be short sighted?

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
Uruk is only one
step in our plan.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center
Don't lose sight of
the bigger picture.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
The other goddesses
are the real issue,

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
not these humans before you.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
Once Uruk falls at
the hands of a goddess,

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
the alliance will be dissolved.

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
The second generation of
Demonic Beasts has been

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
reserved for those
future battles.

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
100,000 offspring await
birth in the Blood Fort.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
It is imperative that
the Three Goddess Alliance

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
continue until they're born.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center
Besides, we should take our time
and enjoy tormenting the humans.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
They killed the beasts' young
and took away their home.

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
They're despicable.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
They oppressed you, Mother.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
And had the audacity to forget.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
[GORGON] You should be
grateful for the restraint

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
my son showed today,
little humans.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
[GORGON] However, your fated
destruction still looms.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
Ten sunrises from this day,
Uruk will be destroyed.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
Mark that well.

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
Good, she's gone.
That's a relief.

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
Unreasonable parents have
a way of making life hard.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
But then we can't choose
our parents I suppose.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree,
Ritsuka Fujimaru?

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
Just what the hell do
you think you're doing?

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
What is it I think I'm doing?

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I just
saved your lives.

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Of course, we could kill

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center
all of the humans right now,

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
but then the other goddesses
would get aggressive,

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
and we're not quite
ready for that.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
So, will you tell us
who you are?

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
Because we know
you're not Enkidu.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU chuckles]

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
I am a prototype of the
beings who will replace

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
you archaic humans
as rulers of this world.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
My True Name is Kingu!

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
K-Kingu?

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
He's from Babylonian myth!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
Kingu leads the
offspring of Tiamat!

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
I'm perfection incarnate.
Humanity's next generation.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
So, don't worry.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
Humans will survive.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
I will be humanity's rebirth.

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
History will be rewritten,
starting with me.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
No, I won't let you!

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
[KINGU] The last
salvation you'll receive

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
is the relief of your soul
returning to the void.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
[KINGU chuckles]

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 8C]
Lord Leonidas...

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
Our commander defended
the North Wall till the end.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
There's no end to
the Demonic Beasts!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
Is there any hope at all?

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 8C]
Lord Leonidas...

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.717 position:50% align:center
[BENKEI]
I finally found you two.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA gasps]
Benkei!

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I must
take my leave of you.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
Please apologize to King
Gilgamesh for my failures.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
You won't come back?

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
I cannot.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
I'm not the Benkei Musashibou
that you know of, my friends.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
All right, then who are you?

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
[BENKEI]
I am a traitor who abandoned

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
Lord Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune...

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center
Kaison Hitachibou.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center
Back then, I abandoned
Lord Yoshitsune

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
and Lord Benkei
out of cowardice.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
That's why I devoted
the rest of my life

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
to telling the legend
of Lord Yoshitsune.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
Therefore, when I found out
that you knew of our legend,

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
I can't describe the
happiness that gave me.

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
Oh, Benkei...

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.347 position:50% align:center
[BENKEI]
But I am ashamed to admit

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
I committed the same
horrible mistake.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
Those Demonic Beasts
frighten me to my very core.

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I fell back,
with the rest of the troops.

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] But the troops
survived because of you.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
Don't blame yourself!

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
[BENKEI] When Lord Leonidas
jumped into the fray,

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
when Lord Ushiwakamaru
was in combat,

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
all I could do was bear
witness to their sacrifice.

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
I am a coward. The Musashibou
name is more than I deserve.

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
Any will I had to fight is gone.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50% align:center
No, you can't leave us now!

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
We need your power in battle.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
I promise,
you make a difference!

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
Kind of you to think
so highly of me.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
The only fate fit
for a fool like me

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
is to die in some ditch in the
wilds, fighting Demonic Beasts.

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
Please don't leave us...

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
We can't stop him.

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
His leaving definitely
hurts our combat strength.

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
But relying on someone
who's no more than

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
a soulless husk is foolish.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
There's no need
to look so stern.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
It's not difficult to understand
Benkei's point of view.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
It's not?

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
Just look over there.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] First, take some
bricks, and stack them here.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.684 position:50% align:center
It's training that's
accessible to anyone,

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
and that in itself
is important. [gasps]

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
If there's anything
humanity can do

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
to save ourselves at all...
then we have to try!

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he's right.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
Humans don't give up,
we find a way!

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
We always did our best before.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.786 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
to stop trying now.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 8G]
That is the pride of this land!

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 8G]
Let me help!

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 8H]
Me, too!

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS chattering]

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
Senpai...

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
Even though General
Leonidas has left us,

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
they're all standing
up to adversity

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
in spite of their fear.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
So, we can't give up.

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
We can't let them do this alone.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Yeah!

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU]
Where am I...?

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
why I haven't disappeared.

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU gasps]

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
So we just keep going this way?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
That's right. You can
exit the palace that way.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
If you follow the road,
you will find Uruk.

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
Hello, I see you've
already woken up.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
You are a strong Servant.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
I recognize your green hair.

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
You're Enkidu, are you not?

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
This is the first time
we're meeting face to face.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
[KINGU]
I guess you're right.

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
Allow me to welcome
you to our castle.

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
I know why you've taken me.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
You're going to
feed me to them, right?

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:20.071 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that you
catch on so quickly.

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
You see, this place
is a factory.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:27.370 position:50% align:center
All Tiamat's Demonic Beasts
come from one maternal body.

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
But that has its limitations.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
So, we supplement.

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
One piece of flesh creates
about three Uridimmus.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
However, one Ugallu
requires three pieces.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
You're using human corpses as if
they're expendable ingredients.

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
You call yourself
a child of a god--[groans]

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
So sorry. My hand must
have slipped, how careless.

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU groans]

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
[KINGU] Hm. It seems we've both
been a bit careless today.

00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
I mean, my hands have
a mind of their own...

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
...just like that
little mouth of yours.

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.075 position:50% align:center
You should work on that.

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
Though, soon enough,
you will be just like them.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
The best part is you get
to enjoy the entire process,

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
since the brain's
the last to change.

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:16.127 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU] It's nice to know
that you and this so-called

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:18.880 position:50% align:center
mother of yours
are complete fools.

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.591 position:50% align:center
Leaving the consciousness
intact till the end?

00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:23.635 position:50% align:center
What a stupid plan.

00:22:23.718 --> 00:22:25.220 position:50% align:center
Every person you captured

00:22:25.303 --> 00:22:27.263 position:50% align:center
must have fought
with all their might

00:22:27.347 --> 00:22:29.724 position:50% align:center
while they transformed
into Demonic Beasts,

00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:32.227 position:50% align:center
living weapons,
fighting for freedom.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.813 position:50% align:center
Feel free to resist
as much as you like.

00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:37.565 position:50% align:center
May that fantasy
bring you one last comfort.

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:38.817 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU groans]

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.195 position:50% align:center
[KINGU] We don't mind
allowing you that dream.

00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.823 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU] Why didn't
you kill the children?

00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:47.409 position:50% align:center
[KINGU]
A difference in values.

00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:50.286 position:50% align:center
I don't hold any grudges,
unlike my mother.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.289 position:50% align:center
I only kill people
who are threats to us.

00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:54.374 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU]
But there's no reason

00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:57.043 position:50% align:center
to keep them alive, either.

00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:58.586 position:50% align:center
You're just like your mother.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.047 position:50% align:center
You don't understand
warfare at all.

00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:03.883 position:50% align:center
And you're replacing humanity
as a superior race?

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:06.302 position:50% align:center
What a joke.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:07.679 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:09.597 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon.

00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:12.684 position:50% align:center
It seems you require
special treatment.

00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:16.646 position:50% align:center
I've changed my mind.
I will not plant an egg in you.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.734 position:50% align:center
You and I are going
to see Mother, instead.

00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:24.237 position:50% align:center
The Authority of Tiamat
is the "Sea of Life."

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.780 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU groans]

00:23:25.864 --> 00:23:30.118 position:50% align:center
Those who fall into that sea
become the children of Tiamat.

00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:32.454 position:50% align:center
Primordial life. In Magecraft,

00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:35.832 position:50% align:center
it is called "the mud
of the Holy Grail."

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:39.794 position:50% align:center
The King of Mages
called this the "Chaos Tide."

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
[KINGU]
This is kind of exciting.

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:45.133 position:50% align:center
Aren't you curious?

00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:48.470 position:50% align:center
Lets find out what kind of
monster you'll be.
