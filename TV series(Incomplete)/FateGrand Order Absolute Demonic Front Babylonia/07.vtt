00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
[GOETIA] The king had eyes
to see into the past

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
and the future,
and yet, he did nothing.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
The king saw the pain,
the sorrow,

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
and the strife of all the world,
and yet, he did nothing.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
Ignorance might have been
excusable, but even enlightened,

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.160 position:50% align:center
he threw back his
head and laughed.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
This man is beyond forgiveness.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
Read of our fury here
and follow our path.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
First, construct a temple!

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
Second, build a band of light!

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
You must find the path
to the Final Singularity.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
That is where the throne of
the King of Mages resides.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
The name of that
plane is Solomon.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
The final ending, the zennith
of the spiral of time.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
The glimmer of hope at
the beginning of all things.

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.947 position:50% align:center
Solomon, King of Mages!

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.082 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Master, are you all right?

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.961 position:50% align:center
You've been sound asleep

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
ever since you read the
clay tablet we retrieved.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
While I slept, I saw him.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Who?

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.474 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
The King of Mages, Solomon.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Now that you mention
it, I haven't heard this story.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
You came face to face
with Solomon and survived.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
Tell me everything.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
I remember that back in London

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
when we were trying to
retrieve the fourth Holy Grail,

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
he appeared to us
from the darkness.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
Mage King Solomon,

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
clearly life holds no value
to you whatsoever!

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
You treat humanity, no,
the planet like a toy!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
Ignorant girl, speak not of life
as a mere human would.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
Since death is
inevitable for all,

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
your opinion holds
no value to me.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
What is the point of fighting?

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
Knowing life will end,
why do you humans cling to it,

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
trying to continue to live?

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
It's true. Someday, we will die.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
Though you are nothing,
as a Grand Caster,

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
I shall give you a message.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
You shall burn and
leave no trace behind.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
That is the future
that awaits you.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
Fou.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
So, he said that he
was a Grand Caster?

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
But isn't that what you are?

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Generally, Servants are
tools for the Holy Grail War

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
where Heroic Spirits
fight each other.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
But there are also seven
Servants chosen by the Root,

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
given the rank of Grand.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
They are different.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
They're much stronger
than normal, you see.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Does that mean we're no
match against them in a fight?

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Not as you are now.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center
But listen to me. That's why
we need to find the Grail,

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
to even the playing
field. Agreed?

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Mm. We can't stop
when we've come this far!

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
--[RITSUKA groans]
--[MASH gasps]

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
That's the spirit!

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
Since we're all agreed,
we may as well get started.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
There's trouble at
the Northern Wall.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
A large scale attack
of Demonic Beasts.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
[MASH] I didn't realize that
there were so many people

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
working at the wall.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
They've been holding back
Demonic Beasts for six months.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
Of course their defensive
measures would be elaborate.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
Sir! We're ready to begin
repairs on the outer wall.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
Good, now get to it.

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
Nothing but the best from the
squad lead by King Leonidas.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
Every one of them
is ready for battle.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] So, that leads
to the northern wilderness.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
--[SOLDIERS, CIVILIANS yelling]
--[RITSUKA gasps]

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
They got in?

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
[MASH grunts]

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
--[RITSUKA] Ana!
--[ANA] Right!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS grunting]

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
King Leonidas!

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS] Stay on guard.
The second wave is incoming.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS]
Phalanx!

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS grunts]

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS]
In a defensive battle,

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
we Spartans have
no need to fear defeat!

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS cheer]

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] So that's the
hero of ancient Sparta!

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
--[ringing]
--[gasps]

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 7A] Third wave
incoming! Multiple targets!

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS]
Dingir!

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS]
Fire!

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS]
Prepare for the next wave!

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS] It's not unusual to
face an attack of this level.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
What was that weapon you used?

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS]
It's a giant cannon that uses

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh's
treasures as ammunition.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
It blows the enemy away
with Magical energy.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA gasps]
His treasures?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS] It was something
the king told me.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
Ha. Squandering wealth is
the true mark of the civilized.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
Besides, we should only gain
victory against the gods

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
using the tools of humanity
or there's no point.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
Dingir means Gods that
are recognized by humans.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
That's the cannon's name.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Classic Gilgamesh.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
They're using only human power
to stand up against the gods...

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.726 position:50% align:center
--[LEONIDAS] Exactly!
--[RITSUKA gasps]

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
And the warrior that
trains to peak condition

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
always emerges victorious!

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
Hmph. You would do well
with some more training.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
Ultimately a warrior's muscles
are their best weapon!

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS] I'm not saying
to try the impossible

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
like defying gravity.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
First, take some bricks
and pile them up right here.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50% align:center
It's training that
nearly anyone can do,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
and that in itself is important!

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH]
O-Okay!

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
[LEONIDAS]
Splendid!

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:42.712 position:50% align:center
You're included, Lady Mash.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
Stone-pile training!

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
Begin!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.181 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Ah, fresh
milk and cheese

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
after training muscles
is the best!

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
This is truly a gift
from Ares, God of War!

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
Would you like some,
Lord Fujimaru?

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
I'll take you up on it later.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
How progresses the war?

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50% align:center
Please allow me to fill you in.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.536 position:50% align:center
There's a fortress
further north of this wall.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
It's called Nippur and
it's a populated city.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
The people are stranded
in a sea of Demonic Beasts.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
We don't have enough power to
reach them with brute force,

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
so we prioritize
women and children.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
We've slowly been rescuing them
under the cover of darkness.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
However, the Demonic
Beasts have begun

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
behaving in an organized manner.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
And now, we've lost all
communication from Nippur.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.267 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
Yes I see.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
This must be why His Majesty
sent us all out here.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
If the citizens still live,

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
we must rescue them
as soon as we can.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
In order to do that, we need to
launch a full-scale attack.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Let's do it...

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Even our chances are slim,
we have to do it!

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN groans]
Ouch!

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
Don't you know it's
rude to hit people

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:08.173 position:50% align:center
for no reason, Cath Palug?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
What's bothering you, Ana?

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center
I'm just taking in
the night air.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:28.068 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Seems like there's
more to it than that.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
It may be too late...

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
...but I wonder if I should tell
them the truth about what I am.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Oh, are you sure?

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center

might be upset after that.

Even so... I should tell them...

What are you thinking?
You shouldn't be hasty.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
Emotions are disposable
by nature, you see?

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
It'd be a waste
not to cherish them.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] You're keeping
your distance from humans

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
not because you don't like them,

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
but because you
are afraid of them.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
You're afraid they'll
find out who you really are.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
And you're afraid they'll hate
you when they know the truth.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
That's an important feeling.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
You could call it
the conscience of

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
the divine being you truly are.

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
That conscience, or its lack,

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
is the greatest difference
between you and her.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
And you don't want to throw away

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50% align:center
your own good nature,
now do you?

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
So you're telling me I
should keep quiet and hide it?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
Yes. That is your best option.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
And there's nothing
wrong with a non-human

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
keeping your non-human
attributes hidden.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
But all of this applies
to me as well.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
I don't have human emotions.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
So instead I feed
off people's dreams,

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
and harvest the subtleties
of the heart from them.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.072 position:50% align:center
This is the only way
I can keep being

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
a nice big brother next door.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
By gathering the
emotions of others

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
and using them carefully
as not to run out.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
That means that
you are in-human.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's true.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
See, you and I are
literally not humans.

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
But I've never heard of
a rule that says we non-humans

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
have to be enemy of humans.
And I bet you haven't either.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
Well, no. I haven't.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
It's all right if you
want to side with them.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
Especially if it's fun.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
But to know they love you,
or if you can ever love them?

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
That's more complicated.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
Don't you have any
love for mankind?

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
We both know I'm a terrible
person and can't be trusted.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
But even if I were
to hide that fact,

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center
do you believe Fujimaru
would really care?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
I don't know...

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] He will just accept
things for what they are.

As long as we
stand by him, I mean.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
So, there's no need to
disclose your true identity.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
I'm so humiliated.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
hear this from you.

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
This is the absolute worst.

Someone wants to play with you!

[roars]

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
That beast is Ugallu!

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
It is the largest offspring
of Goddess Tiamat!

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
Lion of the Sun!

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
It will not win!

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
I might enjoy carving up
that big lump of meat.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
So strong!

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
A blade that kills immortals...

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
If this were a normal Demonic
Beast, she'd win easily.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
That too bad.

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
Merlin. Back me up!

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
Well, this really isn't
a me thing, but...

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
--Fou! Fou! Fou!
--Ouch, all right!

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
I'll take it seriously,
Cath Palug.

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
Even I know when it's
time to stop joking.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
I think we shall
call this repayment

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
for them providing me with
such beautiful dreams.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
Incubus?

[MERLIN]
We may both be inhuman,

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
but unlike you, I cannot
live without humanity.

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
We play different roles,
Fake Enkidu!

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Will something like
this do the trick?

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
This is much better.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
I did it. Just as planned.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Me, too. Just as planned!

Ana!

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
A scythe that kills immortals,
and those eyes...

00:19:56.738 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
You could be a bit troublesome
for us if I let you live.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center
Sorry about this,
but it's time for you to retire.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
You shut up!

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
Hey, Cath Palug. It's your turn.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
I know you've been
storing Magical Energy.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
Fou!

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
No, Fou!

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
Go on and use it all right now!

Fou! Fou!

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
Fou, what are you?

[FOU]
Fou! Fou!

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
She actually escaped
from the Chain of Heaven?

No, not now!

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
She has absolutely no restraint!

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
What was that?!

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
Oh no!

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
Archaman, what's your analysis?

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe,
but that's a Servant!

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
I'm already on it!

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
It's Spirit Origin is
Divine Spirit-Class

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
and it's known as an Avenger!

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
The Avenger... They only
exist to pursue revenge.

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
The eighth class
that should not be.

You humans are obnoxiously loud.

Hello, Mother,
it fills me with joy

00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
to see your
beautiful face again.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.578 position:50% align:center
Hello, Enkidu.

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] Dear Mother,
this wasn't exactly the plan.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
Were you not supposed to
rest until the Day of Rebirth?

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
Don't be so dull.

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:23.218 position:50% align:center
Is that the one they call
"humanity's final Master"?

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:24.844 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.264 position:50% align:center
He's nothing.

[SOLDIERS scream]

Such frail creatures
cower before me.

Is this all that's
left of humanity?

00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:49.661 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I can't move!

00:22:49.744 --> 00:22:51.538 position:50% align:center
Me neither!

00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:53.581 position:50% align:center
Is this a type of Mystic Eyes?

00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:56.418 position:50% align:center
At the moment,
I find myself quite hungry.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.044 position:50% align:center
You shall be sacrificed to me

00:22:58.128 --> 00:23:00.422 position:50% align:center
while you're
quaking with terror.

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:02.298 position:50% align:center
Fear may spoil your flavor,

00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:05.385 position:50% align:center
but you're a delicacy
none the less.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:08.430 position:50% align:center

Right!

Oh?

00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.119 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:33.413 position:50% align:center
Stand aside, I'll handle this.

But Mother...

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
[TIAMAT] I will crush humanity's
last hope as though I were

removing a ripe strawberry
from my harvest.

00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:47.719 position:50% align:center
It's a sweet ending for you.
Isn't this fun, little Master?
