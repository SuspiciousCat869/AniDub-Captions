We beg of you to save us

We have been waiting
for you, Goddess Ishtar!

Our troops at the Northern Wall

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.904 position:50% align:center
have been whittled down by 30%.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
General Leonidas is
defending the wall admirably,

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.535 position:50% align:center
but arrows and medical
supplies are running thin.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
30% is within projections.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
I will have the

[RITSUKA]
You called for us, Your Majesty?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Something jogged my memory

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
so I've an errand for you.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
Go and fetch the
Tablet of Destinies for me.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
Your Highness, what is
the Tablet of Destinies?

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] It is a recording
of a future that I foresaw

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
during one of my meditations.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
Well if it is something
that you wrote yourself,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you remember
what it was?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] I wrote it while I
was in a meditative dream state.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
What does that have to do
with my recalling it?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA chuckles]

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] So does this
mean that you remember

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
where the tablet is now?

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
I wrote it in Kutha, when I
was heading back to Uruk.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
I was returning from the
Underworld at the time.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] So, it wasn't
in the forest to the west.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
The fact that he can
return from the Underworld

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
is a little unbelievable to me.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hmph. In my opinion,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
your world in which
neither heavenly gods

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
nor the underworld exist
is far more peculiar.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
There is a complication.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
The city of Kutha is within
the domain of Goddess Ishtar.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
Confronting Ishtar
is certainly inevitable.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
This saves the trouble.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
Go to Kutha, get the tablet!

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50% align:center
Obey my royal command!

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Not long after the formation of

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
the Three Goddess Alliance,

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
Kutha suddenly disappeared
without a trace.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
Any and all communication from
that city immediately dried up.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
Leonidas' party rushed
there to investigate

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
and found a silent city.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
No blood,
and no signs of combat.

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
All citizens had met their end
as if they died in their sleep.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
There wasn't one
survivor in the city.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
How could that have happened?

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
We still haven't
found the reason.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Since then, people consider
Kutha to be cursed,

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
and now it's a wasteland
that no one dares to approach.

We're preparing for
a new mission.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center

for something called

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
the "Tablet of
Destinies" in Kutha.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
The best part is,
we're getting paid

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
20 Priestess Silvers to do it!

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
Wait, 20?

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50% align:center
If we get that much, we can
fill the embassy with flowers.

Please stand by!

been fun to travel together.

What in the world happened here?

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
A disaster.

Was it a bad storm?

The Goddess Ishtar.

[RANCHER 6A]
This year's Goddess is a mess.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
She blows everything up,
Demonic Beasts and all.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
She left our land like this.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
And then she took every last
gem we had in our village,

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
and said, "I'll be taking
this as payment!"

It's a miracle that
nobody has been hurt.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
She's behaving like a thief.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
What kind of Goddess is that?

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
I suspect if she was
in her original form,

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
she wouldn't do
such strange things.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean,
"original form"?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Right when the
Demonic Beasts showed up,

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
the priestesses of
Uruk held a ritual

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
to get a human girl possessed
by the Goddess Ishtar.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
They ended up with
the one you know.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
The girl's and the
goddess's identities

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
fused together and
created a new personality.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
Ishtar's hair being
black is evidence.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.605 position:50% align:center
Mesopotamian Gods
are all blonde.

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
I'm sure her black hair
has to do with

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
the girl she's possessing.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.735 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's why I can't quite
bring myself to hate her.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
I think maybe you're right.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
There's something about
Ishtar that's slightly human.

[MERLIN]
There it is!

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
That's the city of Kutha.

What Merlin told us was true,
I don't sense anyone there.

[ROMANI] There aren't any
Demonic Beasts either.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
I don't show any even
heading in that direction.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center
It's as though the beasts
are afraid of the city.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
Though we have no idea why.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's dangerous
to enter the city at night.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
It's best if we camp out here.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center

[RITSUKA] The reason I was
chosen for the Rayshift

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
is because I was
the only survivor.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
But that's all the more
reason that I want to

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center

No matter what time you're in,

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
I'm so glad!

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
You woke up...

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
And I'm so glad you're okay!

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
I'm just-- I'm so glad!

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Mash. I'm all right now.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
I really am fine.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Okay!

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Ahem, by the way,
that thing you've got clutched

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
to your chest is the
Tablet of Destinies, right?

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Uh-- Huh?

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA gasps]

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.711 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
You were in the underworld?

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Yeah. This must
be what they meant

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
by the physical and the
underworld being connected.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Y-You're being too calm!

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
I wonder if he was the one
who gave me the tablet.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Ziusu-dra, huh?

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center
Unless perhaps someone was
masquerading as Ziusu-dra.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
That's not a name
to take on lightly.

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
Still, "All is as it should
be in the underworld"?

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Then the meeting of the
Three Goddesses I saw

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
through clairvoyance
was actually...

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
--Something wrong?
--[ringing]

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Large Magical
Energy approaching fast!

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
I found you!

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Apparently, you grilled
the ranchers all about me!

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.586 position:50% align:center
Snooping about what a
goddess does on her day off?

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
Pretty insensitive and
creepy, dontchya think?

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
Ishtar!

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you
just might have something

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
you're trying to hide.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
Are you embarrassed because
we found out you're a gem thief?

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
That's not it!

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'd never stoop so low

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
as to assault humans for
money or anything of the sort!

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
But you took those gems!

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
I asked for payment

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
after saving them
from Demonic Beasts!

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
Saving you humans for free would
just corrupt you all over again!

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Huh? So you would have
saved them for free otherwise?

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, shoot!

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] A-Anyway, all of your
souls need divine punishment!

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Atone for making me
look silly not once, but twice!

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Hold on! We have
no intent of fighting!

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
I don't care!

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
I'll take that
treasure in your hand

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
as compensation
for your misdeeds!

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
You really are a thief!

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] I'll give no mercy
and leave you with nothing!

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
Not bad.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR grunts]

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.026 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Hold on!

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
This is troublesome.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR giggles]
You're pathetic.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'll give you
a tip, you can't fly,

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
don't think for a second
you can catch me!

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
That's not fair!

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
You should come down here
and fight fair and square!

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] I'm not giving up
my advantage, you dummy!

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
Now, playtime is over.
It's time to get serious...

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR gasps]

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
I'm going... to...

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Hm?

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
Why isn't she moving?

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
--[RITSUKA] Ishtar!
--[gasps]

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Bring it!

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
It's you and me!

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
You think someone like you
can actually take me on?

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
I'll never know unless
I give it a shot!

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.328 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR groans]

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
Your recklessness is equivalent
to an insult, you idiot.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
All right. If you want to die
that much, I will kill you.

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
Get to know your place
down in the underworld!

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
Now, Ana!

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
Right! On it!

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR gasps]
What?!

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
This is for the other day!

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
Flying isn't always
an advantage.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Looks like Goddess
Ishtar isn't stirring at all.

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Oh, she's up!

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
Hello there, it's evening
already? Good morning.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's going on here?

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
Did you tie me up?
Where have you brought me?

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
Who are you people?

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Huh? Well I'm Ritsuka Fujimaru.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
I'm humanity's final Master.

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Huh? Are you crazy?

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talking about,

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
but if you think you
can get away with this--

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:51.775 position:50% align:center
It's useless to resist.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Ana...

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
We want you to tell us all about
the Three Goddess Alliance.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That's all this is?

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll try to
answer whatever I can.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
That'd be great.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
Why are the goddesses
attacking Uruk?

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] We're in
competition with each other.

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
The objective is to see
who can destroy Uruk

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
and gain possession of
King Gilgamesh's Holy Grail.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
The first goddess to obtain
the Holy Grail of Uruk

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
will gain full control
of Uruk itself.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
And that's it. Simple, right?

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
What are the other
two's True Names?

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
I can't answer that question.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Why not?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
Before all this began,

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
the three of us agreed
to a pact of nonaggression.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
So I can't tell
even if you kill me.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] All right. Then,
let's forget the True Names.

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:38.530 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
It's the same as telling
your close friend's secrets

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
without their permission.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
Huh.Very perceptive.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
I do love noble humans.

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you something else
since I feel generous.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
The priestesses of Uruk
were the ones that summoned me.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
But the other goddesses
were drawn here

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
by the Holy Grail itself.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
Was the Mage King behind that?

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
Who knows? That's really
none of my concern.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the night
is no longer young.

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Perhaps you
should look around you.

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What's going on?

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] I guess all
the ancestors from Kutha

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
decided to pay a visit
to their homeland.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
We should retreat now.

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.864 position:50% align:center
We have the tablet--
our mission's complete!

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
We can escape
using the rooftops!

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
You should get out of here, too!

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:28.663 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
You protected
the people of Uruk.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving
a good person behind!

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
Stay safe. Mash!

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.338 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Right!

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
I'm not going to thank you.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
There are so many!

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
I could handle this
if I were older...

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
--[rumbling]
--[ALL gasp]

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Ishtar!

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN whistles]

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
I love divine intervention.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
Senpai, we've got to get going!

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:03.990 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Mm-hmm!

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:06.201 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] He had the presence
of mind to thank me...

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.794 position:50% align:center
Ritsuka Fujimaru...

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:19.714 position:50% align:center
You may be a sacrifice too good
for the other goddesses.
