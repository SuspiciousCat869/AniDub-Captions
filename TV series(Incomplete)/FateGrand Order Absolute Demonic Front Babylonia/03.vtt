Ana, I hate to ask you again,

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.151 position:50% align:center

giving them a hand?

Forgive me, but these
aren't the strangers

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
you spoke of, are they?

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.859 position:50% align:center
Well, they were
brought here by Merlin,

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
so most likely they are.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] King Gilgamesh!
Please, just hear us out--

[GILGAMESH]
There is no need!

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
You must learn that
I am capable of all things,

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.453 position:50% align:center
and so, possess all
knowledge as well.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
I am quite aware of what
you and Chaldea are after.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
Th-Then, that's all the
more reason to hear us out!

If we don't retrieve
the Holy Grail from this era,

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
humanity is finished!

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
We have to hurry up and--

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
It's the Grail...

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
What's wrong?

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.639 position:50% align:center
You just told me it was
imperative to find the Grail,

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
isn't that right?

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.310 position:50% align:center
Is that the Holy Grail?
Why do you have it?

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Of course it is.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
All of the riches in
this world belong to me.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
You know,
this Holy Grail is probably

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
what the Three Goddess
Alliance is after.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they'd have
no reason to attack Uruk.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case--

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Don't you dare
even dream of asking me

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
to give this Holy Grail
over to your hands.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
for me to relinquish

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
any of my treasures to you!

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Then... what if we defeat

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
the Three Goddess Alliance
for you in exchange?

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center

Defeat them?

You believe you can take on
the Three Goddesses yourselves?

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center

make me laugh myself to death!

Ah. Oh wow, that was
a real good one.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
I'm going to have it
put down in the court records.

It'll say, "The king laughed
till his belly ached."

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
However, I am the one
who will protect Uruk!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
I don't need anyone's help,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center

wrong with your eyes.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
Oh, Forgive me! It's just
that all of us heard

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
your laughter echoing
through the ziggurat.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center
Imbecile! Don't you
know that at a certain age,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
laughter comes easily?

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
Oh, never mind. What is it?

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center

for Uruk at high speed!

even I can be surprised.

Ishtar would actually

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.445 position:50% align:center
take someone else's

care about anything anymore!

it's not as though I won't
step in to save Uruk.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center
So keep a white flag
ready, all right?

attacked, but I guess not.

Hm... Well that's it then.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
Best thing to do is find
a place to stay the night.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
Don't tell him I told you,
but the king is moody today,

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center

to you tomorrow.

[SIDURI] Allow me to
offer you some advice.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
If you would like for
the king to listen to you,

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
having some noteworthy
achievements would be

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
the fastest way
for that to happen.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
Should we try making a name
for ourselves in battle?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
Instead of that,
perhaps it might be better

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
for you to help with some of
the jobs around the city.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
I will go and make the
proper arrangements for you.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
[MASH] You want us to work in
the city instead of do battle?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Yes and I will do everything
I can to help you,

has ordered me to.

for the time being.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:55.136 position:50% align:center

sufficient for your needs.

Siduri, thank you. It's great!

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
It's the Chaldean
Embassy, Master!

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
We already have a home
here to call our own!

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
I have a set of chambers
for myself in the ziggurat,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
but this place
looks a lot more fun.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
Don't you want to look, too?

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.778 position:50% align:center
No. It doesn't interest me.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Ana! Come look!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
I better make sure he
doesn't break anything.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
I think putting up curtains
by the entrance would be nice.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
Before that, we should check in.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
Round Table, deploy!

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
Anchoring all of the
Leyline coordinates!

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
Fujimaru? Did we
make connection?

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
Can you see me?

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Doctor. We totally
see you crystal clear.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
Even up your nose!

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
Aw, c'mon! Don't look up there!

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
But I've got to say I'm
glad that it's so easy

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:52.944 position:50% align:center
to prove existence in Uruk.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
It's a nice unexpected luxury

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
that we can chat
face-to-face like this.

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
But who could've imagined

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
an Alliance of Goddesses...

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
I honestly didn't expect for
you to run into any living gods.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
Ishtar's Spirit Origin was

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
amazingly close
to the real thing.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
A god's Authority is a Mystic
far beyond Magecraft.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
A "manifestation
of omnipotence."

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
As of right now,
we're still not sure

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
who your true foe
is in that era,

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
but it's pretty clear that the
goddesses aren't on your side.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
Anyway, how about we
go over protocol.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
[USHIWAKAMARU] Oh wow, this is
quite an intriguing spell.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50% align:center
[sighs] This is exactly
the kind of thing I live for!

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
This was a surprise!

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
[MASH] I had no idea
King Gilgamesh had already

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
summoned so many Servants.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
Now we have reliable
new allies, Senpai!

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Yeah.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
Each of them have
their own little quirks.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Merlin, were you summoned
by the king, too?

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I mentioned how
a powerful summoner

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
brought me here, didn't I?

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
So you were talking
about King Gilgamesh.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
I believe fate must have brought
us together, Lord Fujimaru!

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
Allow me!
I'll pour you another one!

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Thanks very much,
Ushiwakamaru.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
To Fujimaru,
humanity's final Master

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
who has journeyed from afar

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
to help heal this
very troubled land!

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
I know I can speak
for everyone when I say

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
we shall help you in every way
to the best of our abilities!

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Thank you.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
Look, Ushiwakamaru,
I believe it might be

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
in your best interest to
limit further indulgence.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
How about you, Leonidas?

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
The ale in this country
is truly tasty!

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
A little can't hurt, can it?

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
No, proper nutrition
is all my body requires!

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
Alcohol should not be enjoyed

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
until after we've wiped out
the Demonic Beasts!

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
We must have discipline...

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
All right, this one's
for you, Fujimaru.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
This looks great, thank you.

but now I'm excited

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
to try food from before
the Christian Era.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center

How is it?

Do you find Uruk cuisine

[RITSUKA]
Mm! Mm-hmm!

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to hear that.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
In Uruk, ale and mutton are the
two things that keep us alive.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
Much of our culture is
based on the happiness of

Excuse me, would it be all right
if I saved a piece for later?

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
Of course, but please
be sure to eat it

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
before lunch time tomorrow.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center

What happened?

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
Which of you poured ale into

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center
And so, you're saying
Enkidu already died,

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
just like in the legend?

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
That's right. Enkidu passed
away before the king's eyes

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
and then was buried
in the underworld.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
Nothing was as beautiful,
nor as tragic as Enkidu.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
They may have been a
puppet made by the gods,

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
but they eventually
gained a heart.

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
Then they were shattered,
heart and all.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
Enkidu gained a heart, but was
shattered along with it...

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
Is King Gilgamesh aware of this?

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
That a fake version of his lost
friend has been made his enemy?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Yes, of course he is.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:39.230 position:50% align:center
Though, those two have never
met each other in person.

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
When he found out about it,
he almost seemed uninterested.

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI]
You're right.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
And I don't think he was
pretending he didn't care

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
so that we wouldn't worry.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
We definitely want to
find out what that boy is,

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
along with everything else.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
But all of that can
start tomorrow.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
Make sure to take time
to get some rest tonight.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
And look... I think Ana has
the right idea, don't you?

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
Stupid Merlin took the
corner room all for himself.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
It will be mine when I kill him.

Good morning, everyone.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
All right, now it's
time to get started.

Here's your first assignment.

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] The king
really meant manual labor.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
[MASH] But isn't this
kind of fun in its own way?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Your next assignment is...

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
Next up...

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
[ANA] Merlin should be
helping with the rest of us.

But I don't understand,

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
why are you the one
who looks so fatigued?

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
[groans] Oh, that's right.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
I forgot you don't
have a Master.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
Once a Master makes
a contract with a Servant,

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
they are responsible
for supplying

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
part of their Magical Energy.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
I suppose that makes sense.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
I was in the Cedar Forest
on my own this whole time,

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
so I didn't know...

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
You don't know anything
about being a Servant?

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
No. When I came to,

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
I was in the forest
and in this body.

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
But somehow, I knew
what I had to do.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
My task is to kill
the Demonic Beasts.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
Eventually, it became
my routine to kill them

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
and use their souls to
maintain my Spirit Origin.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
That sounds tough.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
You wanna make
a contract with me?

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
No, thank you.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center
I understand your mission,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
but what happens to humanity
is not my concern.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN yawns]

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
Good morning, you two.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
So, have you finally gotten
used to life here in Uruk?

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center
I really wish the king
would hurry up and

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
acknowledge all our effort.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
But I'll admit,
it's kind of fun.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a relief.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately, I do have
some bad news from Siduri.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
This is from her so
don't get angry at me.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
"We have no assignments
for you today.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
Please use this surprise day off

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
to enjoy all the
wonders of Uruk!"

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
You mean we have no work today?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
But then what'll we do?

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
Fou, fou.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
That's all I had to say!

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
Oh, I just had a bold
stroke of genius.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
You should take Mash
on a date today!

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN giggles]

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
I, um...

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
Um... You know, I think
I like Uruk's clothing.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
Uh... Do I look okay?

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Y-Yeah!

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
Excuse me.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH gasp]

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
Is it true that both of you
are free for the day?

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
If so, I have a job I'd
like to ask for you to do.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
Here's all the silver
I've managed to save up.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
Would this be enough money to
hire you two to accompany me?

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. We'll come.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Please keep your silver.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
We were about to go look for
some challenging work anyway!

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
Then lets go.
I'll take you to the site.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
And just to give you a heads up,
we're going into battle.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
What?

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
We're fighting?

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
[EVIL SPIRIT 3A growls]

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
All right, good work.

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
I think we've defeated
all the evil spirits.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
Thank you both.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
I didn't know caves like
this existed under Uruk.

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
And I didn't expect
those spirits.

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
Ana, do you know what
those spirits were?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
You could say that they're
like grim reapers.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
There is a deadly disease
spreading across Uruk.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Can you tell us more?

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
[ANA] Yes. Starting
with the weak ones,

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
people fall into
an eternal slumber.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
I think those spirits have
something to do with it.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
So, if we get rid of them,

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
we might reduce the
deaths by emaciation?

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
That's right.
In the Age of Gods,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
physical death is a separate
thing from spiritual death.

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
So, even if the body is fine,

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
if the soul is taken away
by a grim reaper,

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
it means that person
will die, right?

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
[ANA] Except having
the soul taken away

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
is not quite the same
thing as "death."

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
It's sleep. Or something
that looks like it.

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
If the body's safe, returning
their soul will wake them.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Ana, how did you
find out about these spirits?

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
[ANA] I noticed there
were a lot of them

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
gathered above that flower shop.

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
You really are very kind, Ana!

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
That's not true. I'm really...

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Hm?

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
Well, um... never mind...

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why you
bother trying to interact with

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
the people of this era more
than is actually necessary.

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
After I arrived in this world,
I started to realize something

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.360 position:50% align:center
while I was eating or
working with people.

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:18.486 position:50% align:center
"Oh," I thought.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
"They're no different
from any of us."

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
People are living in
this world, just like we do.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
And that tells me
we need to do our best

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
and take this seriously.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA chuckles] That isn't
much of an answer, is it?

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
[ANA] You know,
I despise humans... but...

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:39.674 position:50% align:center
...that way of thinking...
doesn't bother me at all.

00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:21.192 position:50% align:center
[SUMERIANS screaming]

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:24.195 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN'S VOICE]
I have said before

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:28.867 position:50% align:center
that not a single human
shall survive, have I not?

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.368 position:50% align:center
I have already swallowed up

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
most of the northern
cities, one by one.

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:36.124 position:50% align:center
It is only a matter of time

00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:39.919 position:50% align:center
before we break through
that pathetic Northern Wall.

00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] Yes. The goddess
who kills the king

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:44.215 position:50% align:center
and obtains the
Holy Grail for herself

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.469 position:50% align:center
will ascend the throne
and rule this world.

00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:48.762 position:50% align:center
And of course,

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:51.765 position:50% align:center
that will be you, Dear Mother.
