[GILGAMESH]
Unreal...

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
Oh... I can't believe
this is happening...

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh?!

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
What in the world
is the matter?!

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH chuckles]

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
Well you see, my blueprint for

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
the Fangs of Napishtim
is finally done!

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
Take a look!

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
Prepare to be astounded!

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.287 position:50% align:center
My best work yet.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty,
you've outdone yourself!

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.211 position:50% align:center
This is a work of genius,
you could be an architect!

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.421 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH chuckles]

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
Don't tempt me; I would
seriously consider it.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI] All right then,
I shall take this

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
to the armory right away.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.222 position:50% align:center
Do that.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:00.101 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI] You should take this
time to go and get some rest.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
It's possible I might
have overworked myself.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
A throne is a seat of authority,

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
not a chair for taking naps.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] But it seems
I cannot help myself...

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI] And when I
returned to the chamber,

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
I found him slumped in his
throne in an eternal sleep.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
It can't be...

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
That's ludicrous!

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] He's a man
who saw the future

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
and became a mage
of his own volition!

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
He said he'd lead
from the throne

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
to avoid dying
on the battlefield.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50% align:center
That was the promise
he made to me!

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh
wouldn't die like this!

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
I agree!

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI gasps]

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
Death by overwork
of all causes?

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
If he died from
working too hard,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
then I'm probably
not far behind him!

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
You better make your point!

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
If you don't have one,

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
I'm convinced your
life's in danger, too!

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
Think about it, if it
were so easy to kill him,

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
he would've died dozens of times
by now, don't you think?!

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
That's true.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
I apologize for my outburst.
I lost my head for a second.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
Fou, fou.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
Lady Siduri, did anything
strange happen here

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
after our party left for Ur?

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
Strange...?

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
Actually, we had an
unusual amount of

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
reports of death
from weakness in Uruk.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
Death from weakness?

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
The death of the king
rather stole my attention,

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
but there's been a
staggering number of reports.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
It's as though Uruk has been
swallowed up by death itself.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
It is curious...

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
It sounds unnatural.
I mean don't you agree?

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
Which means one of
the Three Goddess Alliance

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
is likely to blame.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
But two of you are here,

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
who are you talking about?

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
It's obvious, isn't it?

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
Ereshkigal, the Queen of Kur.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've heard of her.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
Who's Ereshkigal?

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Hang on! Did you just
say Ereshkigal?

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
Uruk's filled with
the scent of death,

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
and it belongs to Ereshkigal.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
Ereshkigal's gallu spirits
habitually remove souls

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
from the weak and exhausted
first and foremost.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[ANA gasps]

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
[QUETZALCOATL] It is reasonable
for us to assume one such spirit

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
has taken King Gilgamesh to Kur.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
Oh no!

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Just a moment!

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
The Three Goddess Alliance
consists of Gorgon,

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
Quetzalcoatl, and... you, right?

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not a member.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
Right, Ishtar isn't a member.
It's Gorgon, me,

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
and Ereshkigal is the third
goddess in the alliance.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
--Wha?!
--We all thought she was!

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
Well that's a surprise.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
There seems to be some sort of
misunderstanding here.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] We should discuss
possibility that Ereshkigal

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
has been revived instead of
wasting our time right now!

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dr. Romani in Chaldea!

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Right here!

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's get our
thoughts organized.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
First of all...

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
The third and final member of
the Three Goddess Alliance,

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
who incidentally is
not Ishtar, but Ereshkigal,

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
has now shown herself...

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.090 position:50% align:center
[MASH] The only Sumerian
deity left in this era

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
should be Ishtar, right?

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Obviously!

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
In the Sumerian myths,
Ishtar is the "Queen of Heaven,"

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
adversely, Ereshkigal is
known as the "Queen of Kur."

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.395 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Ah, now I see.

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
That's the key
to this situation.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
It's you, dear.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
At precisely the time
that you were summoned,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
Ereshkigal was summoned as well.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Ishtar was summoned

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
by the priestesses
of Uruk, wasn't she?

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
That's right, but the temple
matron who summoned her

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
died after the ritual.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
Probably because
Ereshkigal killed her.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.669 position:50% align:center
Well... makes sense...

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] I see... Ishtar, the
goddess of bountiful harvest,

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
is seen as the Great Earth
Mother symbolizing human life.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
But Ereshkigal
symbolizes human death

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
and is the
Terrible Earth Mother.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
But it sounds like
that might mean

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
the goddesses are
two sides of a coin.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
It's almost as though
they're one in the same?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
If that's so,
then she might've been

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
using this body without
me knowing about it!

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
That possibility does exist.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
Ereshkigal can't
physically leave Kur.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
No!

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
So that was...

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
If Ishtar was summoned,
then it stands to reason that

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
by extension,
Ereshkigal would be, too.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, they're
technically the same deity,

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
so it makes sense
that we only counted

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
a single Sumerian
goddess before now.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
I suppose.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
I suppose...

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] But anyway...
Ereshkigal, huh? Lucky for us.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.888 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Lucky how?!

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] If she was involved
in King Gilgamesh's death,

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
there's a chance
we can bring him back.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Is that true?

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
Yes. Actually, we would
be in a lot of trouble

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
if we lost him now.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
The king's body,
do we still have it?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
Yes. He hasn't been
buried just yet.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
Do you really think the king's
soul might still be in Kur?

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
If we can defeat Ereshkigal,

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
we should be able to
liberate his soul.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
Which means that he could
be returned to his body.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
We should leave right away!

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Senpai!

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
Another fight...

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
Well, a battle does
seem inevitable.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.340 position:50% align:center
Senpai...?

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
Are you really gonna go?

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
I have to do what I can.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
But it's the underworld.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
Every Heroic Spirit and deity is
powerless in that awful place!

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think
you have a chance to win?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
Well once I meet her,
I'll find out.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
He's crazy.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
Hold it there, Ishtar,

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
you do know how to get to
the underworld, don't you?

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] If you do,
then take us there!

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
Oh, fine! I get it. Whatever!

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
I guess I have to take you.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50% align:center
You guys should stay behind.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
If the worst happens,
go to Kutha.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
Negotiate with Ereshkigal
to have Fujimaru and Mash

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
returned to the world above.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
All right, consider it done.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
I will head that
direction later.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
I'd be useless to you
in the underworld.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
So I will wait right here
for your return!

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
It's no question the underworld
is Ereshkigal's domain.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
She's supreme ruler there.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I see...

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
So in the meantime, I will
stay in the world above,

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
and investigate Uruk.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
The city?

00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
You want to look into
all of the deaths?

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
It's possible there's
another cause...

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
Or what if somebody passed
away and nobody knows yet...

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
Maybe there's something
that I can do.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.216 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Good luck.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Wait. This is
where we came to look for

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
the Tablet of Destinies.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Not to be rude,
but are you sure about this?

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
Either all of us make it back
after defeating Ereshkigal,

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
or we fail and are
trapped forever.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
There's only two ways
this can turn out.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
Ya know, I have a feeling
Ereshkigal isn't bad.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
Senpai...?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
All right. I'll trust
your gut feeling then.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Mash! You better cover me!

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.047 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Oh! Right!

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Load the
tide-convergence rounds

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
into Maanna's bow cannons!

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
Output at isosceles
of 1/3 the lapis lazuli!

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
Now, shatter Gate of Kur!

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
Let the light of An shine
through the skyless Ki!

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH scream]

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
[MASH groans]

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
Are you all right, Master?

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.836 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I think so...

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou...

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
Nice, success!

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ishtar, why are you
the way that you are?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
Excuse you?

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
I brought you to the underworld,
what more do you want?

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
So this... is the underworld?

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Aw, man.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
So, we can observe them, but we
can't communicate, is that it?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
We just have to do our best
to support from here anyway.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] I didn't expect
Kur to be beneath Kutha.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
It wasn't in another dimension.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
The two places really and
honestly are physically linked.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Of course. In the Age of Gods,

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
the heavens, the earth,
and the underworld

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
are all very closely connected.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Those are souls.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
Humans that died on
the surface are in there.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Non every soul
gets trapped in those cages.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
But the ones that are
can't move on.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
Ereshkigal makes a
habit of caging up

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
the souls of humans she favors,

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
and keeps them at
her side to enjoy

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
for tens of thousands of years.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
And the souls of humans
that withered to death

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
on Earth are here, too?

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Yes, probably.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
There are more
cages than before.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.881 position:50% align:center
They increased after she joined
the Three Goddess Alliance.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she's trying to
create a kingdom of the dead?

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
So Ereshkigal is where?

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
A bit further.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
Ereshkigal's palace
is in that direction,

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
beyond the seven gates.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
That's definitely
where we'll find her.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
You seem really well versed
about the underworld.

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
--[ISHTAR gasps]
--You knew where it was,

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
and you know all of
the rules down here...

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, you...

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, well that's just, uh--

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
Goddess power,
that's what it is.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
Didn't you say your Divinity
doesn't work down here

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
--in the underworld?
--Ugh...

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
Oh! Don't forget,
Ishtar's a goddess!

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she knows
lots of things

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
that we've never heard of!

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
I'm sure that's it!

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50% align:center
Ishtar has always
been trustworthy!

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou!

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
--[ISHTAR] Okay! Fine!
--Huh?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] I've been here before!
That's how I know!

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
I wasn't planning on
ever telling you this...

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
I, uh--feel I should apologize.

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't take my
frustrations out on you.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] I screwed up
the last time I was here.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Did you make a mistake?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Yes. I felt like there
was nothing I couldn't do

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
after conquering Mt. Ebih.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
So I got carried away and
marched into the underworld.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.580 position:50% align:center
But I was met with
a miserable defeat.

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
A complete and total loss.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
They stripped
my seven Authorities.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
And I was dragged
in front of her naked,

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
and skewered over
and over with spears.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
I can see why you...

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center
...you wouldn't want to
talk about that very much.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
Fou...

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Since then,
It's been hard for me

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
to even think about her.

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of
person we're facing.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
And she's right where
we're about to go.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GATE]
Answer me... Answer me...

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
The gate...

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GATE]
You who live and have fallen

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
into the underworld...

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what is
the state of your soul?

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
Now, you'll get questions
with two answers.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
The underworld gates
are all unbiased and logical--

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
they test if souls are evil.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
That sounds difficult.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
Yes, and there are
seven of them.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
These gates are what stripped me

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
of my Authorities
my first visit.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GATE] Now,
sinful Fujimaru, answer me...

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
By name...?

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GATE] Standards of beauty
seem diverse in nature,

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
but they are absolute.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
Darkness wins over light,
the earth wins over the heavens.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
So... Ereshkigal or Ishtar?

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
Which of these two
is more beautiful?

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Hm?

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hang on a second!
That's not what I was asked!

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
This is an extremely
difficult question!

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
Fou, fou!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GATE]
Answer me... Answer me...

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Are you hesitating?

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
for that, right?

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
Uh... M-My answer is Ishtar!

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR giggles]
Brilliant, Fujimaru!

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
It's not a hard choice when one
is a goddess of rot and decay,

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
and the other is of
beauty and bounty!

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
If it's a beauty contest,

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
one thousand out of
one hundred people

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.334 position:50% align:center
can't help but
choose me, of course!

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR screams]

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Oh no, Ishtar!

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
[MASH, RITSUKA gasp]

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
Hey! Are you all right?

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center
Fou...

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GATE]
You're so stupid...

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
My answer is Ereshkigal...

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GATE]
You may proceed!

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
L-let's go...

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I am exhausted...

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
You're doing amazing.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna play "Whose
Goddess is it anyway" anymore.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
Well, we just made it
through the sixth gate.

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] There's only
one gate left to go!

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
I ended up pocket sized,
but we still have to keep going.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
Fou...

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but Ishtar,

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
are you sure that
you're really all right?

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] It doesn't look like
I'll be joining you in battle,

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:18.937 position:50% align:center
but I knew this was going
to happen from the start.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
I'll protect myself

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
so Ereshkigal doesn't
squish me or anything.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I'm glad to hear it,

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
but please don't
be reckless. 'Kay?

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
H-Hold on...

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH laughs]

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
King Gilgamesh?!

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
Excellent work finding me!

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
[MASH] We thought you were
taken prisoner by Ereshkigal!

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hmm.

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
I relaxed my guard
and found myself dead,

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
but I know the underworld well.

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
And I evaded her minions easily.

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
Before the gallu spirits came,
I hid in the shadows meditating

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
and then I used
Presence Concealment.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
After I was sure
I had lost them,

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
I waited for just
the right moment...

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR gasps]
Hold it! Stop! Let me go!

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
This situation is
just too hilarious!

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
I may be disciplined,

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
but even I couldn't resist
a moment like this,

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
so I blew my cover over
the best joke I've ever seen.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
Fujimaru, why is
Ishtar kind of cute

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
for the first time in her life?

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
Well, you see,
Ereshkigal's been cursing her...

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Have you decided
that your insignificance

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
should be reflected
in your appearance?

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
He told you,
Ereshkigal's been cursing me!

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
She's right, Your Majesty.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
Ishtar was cursed
on her previous decent

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
into the underworld.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.639 position:50% align:center
Every time I go through
one of those stupid gates,

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
my Divinity is taken away
and I keep shrinking!

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH chuckles]
You idiot...

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR groans]

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
I knew I shouldn't have
come to help them rescue you!

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You're a fool!

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
You? Come to save me?

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
Did I somehow die again

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
and start hallucinating
this nonsense?

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
Yeah. If that's the case,

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
then maybe we should
just leave you here.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
Go crawl back into the abyss!

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
Ha! I will never do something
as boring as that!

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
There's still far too much
for me to do down here!

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Uh--

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
Don't you want to go back
to the land of the living?

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
I can't. I'm a dead man
at the moment, remember?

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to
leave the underworld

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
unless she gives me
her permission.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
I guess that's true...

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] So I'm going to
punish the wretched Ereshkigal,

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
and leave the underworld
with a smile on my face

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
and her sobbing
behind me! [laughs]

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Is this one of those "gates"?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
Forget your question!
The answer is me!

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
[SEVENTH GATE]
No, you are not the answer...

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Hm...
With Ishtar is in this state,

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
fighting Ereshkigal could
prove to be challenging...

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help with a fight
in the underworld anyway.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
Do we know exactly much strength

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
the goddess
Ereshkigal possesses?

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Why?

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Just like King Gilgamesh says,

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
we will likely enter
battle after all this.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
So, I would like to know
what kind of powers

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
we will be up against.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
Comparatively speaking,

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
she doesn't quite
reach Ishtar's level.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
Wait, Your Majesty, you know
all about Ereshkigal as well?

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Yes, marginally.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
I suppose if Ishtar
is the goddess

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
who got everything
she has ever wanted...

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR whistles]

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
...Ereshkigal is the goddess

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
that desired nothing at all.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
Nothing?

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
When the underworld
was first created,

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
she was sent here to become
its ruler and foundation.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
Someone has to stay
in the underworld

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
in order to
maintain it all times.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
Unlucky Ereshkigal
had the duty thrust upon her.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
She had only just
been born when she was

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
forced to take up the title of
Goddess of the Underworld,

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
and ruler of the dead,
and has remained

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
for tens of thousands of years.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
Her story... is so very sad.

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
Not just because she couldn't
leave this place either.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
She can never experience
other worlds or new people...

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
I think that may be
the worst part.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
Ereshkigal is invincible
in the underworld,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
in exchange for
everlasting service.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
Heroic Spirits and gods both
lose their powers in her domain.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
Things are different though

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
if she's up against
someone who's alive.

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
Then, she has to
kill them first,

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
or the laws of the
underworld won't work.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
That means Mash and
Fujimaru can deal with her.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] She's about
mid-level in terms of

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
divinity and Authority.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
We have a chance to win.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
All right, I think that's
enough chitchat for right now.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] You are looking
at Ereshkigal's palace.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
All of this?

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
Romani, where Fujimaru's
group just stopped,

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
there's a huge empty space!

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:03.346 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
No change in their status.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
I-It all looks fine... [gasps]

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
[MASH] This place...
is just a wasteland.

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
You just described
the underworld.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
Not one beautiful thing exists
anywhere within it's confines.

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right?

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
O queen of the gallu spirits

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
who gazes at the
sky of darkness!

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Barometric pressure at 500 hPa?!

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
Adiabatic cooling is
dropping the temperature.

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
It feels like minus six Celsius!

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Humans can't survive
long in temperatures that low!

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
Fujimaru! You need to
get out of there right away!

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center
[ERESHKIGAL]
Fear me, pray to me,

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center
and know despair, you humans.

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50% align:center
[ERESHKIGAL] I am the keeper of
death, ruler of the underworld,

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:15.585 position:50% align:center
the one who tramples
the sacred mountain...

00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:18.088 position:50% align:center
I am Ereshkigal.
