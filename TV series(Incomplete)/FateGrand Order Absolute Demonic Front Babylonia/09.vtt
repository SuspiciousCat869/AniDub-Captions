00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
That's all I have to report.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hmm.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.168 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Sacrifices are
unavoidable in war.

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.545 position:50% align:center
I will arrange a
memorial for the lost.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.630 position:50% align:center
That is my duty as their king,

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
and I'll compensate
the families.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
You've endured much,
Ritsuka Fujimaru.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
The name of our enemy is goddess
Gorgon, the false Tiamat!

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
We shall discuss
possible countermeasures!

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:40.118 position:50% align:center
To begin, we should review
everything we know thus far.

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
We'll start with Gorgon.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Gorgon is the monster
known for killing heroes

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.082 position:50% align:center
in Greek mythology.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
This refers to three sisters:

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.669 position:50% align:center
Stheno, the oldest,
Euryale, the middle,

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
and Medusa, the youngest.

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] She's here either
because of the King of Mages'

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.468 position:50% align:center
Holy Grail or due to
some other twist of fate.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
Whichever it is,
she has restored herself

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
to her former appearance, as
well as her former power level.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50% align:center
From the looks of when
you guys faced her,

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
the Authority to give
birth to Demonic Beasts,

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
Potnia Theron, must have
come from the Holy Grail.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.358 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of
any stories that described

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
Gorgon herself giving
birth to other monsters.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Precisely, my dear Da Vinci!

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
In the case of Gorgon,
the tragedy began

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
when the youngest sister
of the three, Medusa,

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
incurred the wrath of the great
goddess Athena of Olympus.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
Athena turned Medusa
into a monster.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
Medusa's sisters
took pity on her,

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
and they all fled to a place
called the "Shapeless Isle."

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
The people,
influenced by Athena,

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
saw all three sisters
only as monsters.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
So they sought to kill them.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
After defeating many heroes

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
who came to kill
the three sisters,

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
Medusa became a true monster,
devouring her own siblings.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
The ceaseless violence,

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
the prejudice and
persecution all drove her mad.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] That's how Gorgon,
a primordial goddess

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
who possesses the divinity
of three loving sisters,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
was created.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Those events
are probably the reason

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.205 position:50% align:center
for her deep hatred of humans.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] So an exiled
goddess wronged by humanity

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
returns as a goddess
of vengeance?

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Not only that, but
she's just one of the goddesses.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH sigh]

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Hmph. What's got
all of you so worried?

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Huh?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
There should be bold
smiles on your faces.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
She said her
ultimate adversaries

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
weren't humans, did she not?

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
That's right. She said
humans are only an obstacle

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
and all she really
needed to worry about

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
are the other two goddesses.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
That's our opening!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH laughs]
Strife among enemies

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
is the most entertaining
weakness there is to exploit!

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
I see, a clever idea indeed.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] We will win if we
face the goddesses in order.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
But what order?

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
Leave the vengeance mad Gorgon
with her stony gaze for now,

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
as well as the mysterious
goddess of the jungle

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
we know nothing about.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
And focus on Ishtar.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
Yes. That is our strongest move.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI]
My King, I'm afraid I disagree.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hm?

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI] No matter how much
damage Ishtar causes,

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
she is still Uruk's
patron deity.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
Taking her on would be unwise.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
I find this disappointing,
Priestess Siduri.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50% align:center
Even Fujimaru
understands my logic.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI]
I'm sorry but I don't follow.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] No one said
anything about defeating her.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
We'll be bringing
her over to our side.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
Like taming a wild beast.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
we'll be able to?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
Of course, if we use
the right beast tamer.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Which is you, Ritsuka Fujimaru!

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
I'm going to let you
in on my secret plan.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
Now go forth, my hero!

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
Fou?

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
Fou!

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
It's Ana!

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
Ana!

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
Hello.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I'm so glad you're up!

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry... I wasn't very
helpful at all back in Nippur.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Now Ana,
no more of that, all right?

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
But Merlin...

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
Yes, Fou?

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
saving me back there.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou! Fou!

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
It looks like you've
recovered physically.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
And that's fortunate,
since we have a new mission.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
Will you be joining us?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Looks like you guys
are headed towards Mt. Ebih.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
In the past, Ishtar used force

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
to claim that
mountain for her own.

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
after Ishtar fled Uruk,

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
she made herself a temple on
Mt. Ebih after she took it over.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
But to think you have to try to

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
persuade Ishtar to join you.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be easier
to just defeat her?

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Even I find her
tactlessness jarring.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
It's all right,
this time we have

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh's
secret plan with us.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
Right! This is far
more productive

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
than fighting would be!

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Mm. Besides,
Ishtar may be a little intense,

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
but I don't think that
she's an evil goddess.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Are you talking about
how her apparent attacks on the

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
ranches were actually to protect
them from the Demonic Beasts?

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Yeah. That,
and the impression I got

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
when we met her face-to-face.

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
But you know,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
the choice to destroy in order
to defend is a big stretch.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.315 position:50% align:center
It's quite the contradiction.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
Don't forget she also
decided to make off with

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
the rancher's life savings.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA sighs]

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
But hang on, it's almost
justified if you simply

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
think of it as a reward for
protecting them all, right?

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
What? I know you're eccentric,
but this is a stretch.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
Even for someone
like you. Really...

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI groans]

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know,
her methods are a little...

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
...awkward, to say the least...

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
But there's no denying that
she's trying to protect Uruk.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.093 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] So, I'd prefer to get
by without fighting if we can.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
Sounds good!
Good luck to all of you!

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
Something's near you.
Be careful!

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Thanks, we'll keep an eye out.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What is this place?

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
This is definitely
Ishtar's temple!

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
It might as well have
a giant sign that says,

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
"I conquered Mt. Ebih!"

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
Maybe...

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50% align:center
All right, we gain nothing
standing out here. Lets go in.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] So, you think
you can just waltz right in

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
through the front door
like a bunch of

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
clueless tourists, do you?

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Goddess Ishtar!

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
You just lost to the
Goddess of Demonic Beasts

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
and now you come to find me?

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
You really underestimate me!

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
Ishtar, we just want
to talk with you!

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
You wanna talk, huh?

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
All right then, first off,
whose permission did you get

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
to climb Mt. Ebih
and enter this temple?

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
It's your own fault--

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
how do you expect us to knock
on a door that doesn't exist?

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
Merlin, do us a
favor and shut up!

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] I guess I gave you
the wrong impression

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
in our previous encounters.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't think of
me as your friend.

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
There's a big difference
between you humans and me.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
But wait a second. You're a--

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
A goddess. And as such,

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
any further dealings with you
would be beneath me.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
I am the Goddess
of War and Venus!

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.215 position:50% align:center
Taste the power of Ishtar
the most fearsome goddess!

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
Prepare for battle, humans!

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
Maanna!

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Oh, come on!
We're not done yet!

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Goddess Ishtar is
as strong as we expected.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
It's time now. You ready to go?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Yeah.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's do it!

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
Now what?

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
Let's try it again!

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR giggles]
Now I'm getting into this!

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
Let's kick it up
another notch! [gasps]

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
Goddess Ishtar!

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
Are you seriously still trying
to protect your Servant?

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
Pretty bad habit
you've got there!

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Master!

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Flowers?

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] That goddess
is crazy for jewels.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
She loves them?

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Oh, yes.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
She loves gems but can't
seem to get her hands on any.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
She lacks the "Golden Rule,"
or the skill to acquire wealth.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
[MASH] That's a little sad.
Then how does she live?

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
She usually gets by on

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
offerings made by her followers,

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50% align:center
but lately those seem to
have dried up completely.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Then do you think if
we bring Ishtar some jewels,

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
she'll want to join our cause?

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
That won't help us at all.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
In fact, it would only
serve to feed her giant ego!

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Th-Then what?

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
Simple. You're going
to buy her off.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
That's the secret plan
I'm talking about.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
You will leave here
with a full 30%

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
of the rare jewels
in my treasury.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.944 position:50% align:center
You're going to buy me
a goddess with that.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
Wait! What is all this?

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
This is enough gems to power
my Magecraft for a long time!

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
--[RITSUKA] Oh no!
--[gasps]

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
I  spilled gems we were
going to present to Ishtar!

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
What'd you just say?

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
By the way...

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Huh?!

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
And this is merely the deposit.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
The seven-jeweled crown?

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center
All this... for me?

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Of course!
That's why we brought this here!

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Huh? No way! Are you a god?

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
It's too much! I think
I'm starting to get dizzy!

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
All right, calm down, Ishtar,
don't get carried away,

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
you know this is
way too good to be true!

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
Please listen!
We're here because

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
we'd like to hire you
for your skill in combat!

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
Yes, and we're approaching you
on behalf of all of Uruk.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh promised
the people he would

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
open the treasury
of Babylon for you.

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Is that true?

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Fujimaru, tell the lady
what we're prepared to offer.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] If you were
to join us as an ally,

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.795 position:50% align:center
we would offer you 20%
of the treasury's jewels!

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
Did I hear right?

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
Fou, fou, fou, fou.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:01.596 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR inhales, exhales]

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
I just want to make
sure I understand,

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
the treasury you're
talking about

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
is the one Giglamesh is
building for the future, right?

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
And once it's completed
it's supposed to be bottomless,

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
containing all of the treasures
known to mankind?

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
I don't know if I can do this,

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
there's gotta be a catch,
it's too perfect!

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What about 25%?

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
25%? It's still going up?

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
Wait, I'm the almighty Ishtar!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
I just can't form
back alley deals like this!

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
All right. But it's such
a shame. Let's go, Mash.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
It's kind'a unfortunate,
but now we get to keep it.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Oh, wait! Don't go!

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Don't take it away!

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
The sadness of it would kill me!

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Well then?

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
You win this time,
Lord Fujimaru!

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
I accept your proposal!

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
Really, Goddess Ishtar?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
So you'll join
with us in our fight

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
to help the people of Uruk?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Just Ishtar is fine.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
We'll be spending quite a lot
of time together after all.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
joining us, Ishta--huh?

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] First things first,
you can start by

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
kneeling down and
kissing the top of my foot.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
I mean I am still
a Servant, after all.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
And Servants need contracts!

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
N-No way! I can't allow that!

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
Besides, I've never
heard of that method of

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
contracting before, so I'm sure
it wouldn't work anyway!

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] So then, it might
only be a temporary contract,

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
but I've honored you
by becoming your Servant.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
All right?

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Goddess Ishtar...

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
I think we should discuss
what this alliance really means.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
I suppose so. I will
allow you to question me.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
First off, am I
correct to assume

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
you're what we call
a Pseudo-Servant,

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
and you occupy a human body?

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
That's right. You see,

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
Divine spirits like myself
can't normally become Servants.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
So, I'd say this is
only a pseudo-formation.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
Then, forgive me, but I
need to know the status

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
of the owner of the
body you've possessed.

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
As an agent of Chaldea...

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
No, wait. As a doctor, I find
this ethically problematic.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
Doctor...

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
But you created a Demi-Servant

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
like Mash, didn't you?

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
And now you want to
call my ethics into question?

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
My mistakes and your situation
are entirely different matters.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'm setting aside

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
my personal feelings
and asking you.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Oh? Not a bad answer.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
I may have misjudged you.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
So, I will answer you honestly.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
If you're asking me if I killed
the owner of this body, no.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
If you're asking if her
mind can override mine

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
and take control, also no.

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
She and I have merged into one.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
It's about a 70/30 ratio,
with me as the majority.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
Well, the main
personality is me,

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
but neither of us is more
important than the other.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
I am always going to be
who I am, no matter what.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.728 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
So, just think of it this way.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
It's not that this girl was

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
taken over by
the goddess Ishtar.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
It's more like she suddenly
became Ishtar herself.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
I never thought of it that way!

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
Or maybe, it's more
accurate to say

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:09.492 position:50% align:center
two personalities
merged into one.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
I mean it's not as though
this girl is asleep.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
Like with the gems earlier,

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.749 position:50% align:center
we were switching
back and forth, right?

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
That makes sense.

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.670 position:50% align:center
In any case, I'm trying
to say that I'm still me!

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50% align:center
And that's it. Okay?

00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Your Highness,
have you had any experience

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.266 position:50% align:center
sleeping out of doors?

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
What I mean is, we don't always
have the best accommodations.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
[MASH] It's true.
Our camp is going to be

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
in a ruined building tonight,

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
and probably won't be
very comfortable.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
It's quite sweet of you
to worry. But don't.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
I've spent more than
my share of nights outside.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.908 position:50% align:center
Oh, have you really?

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.076 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Yup, I used to sneak out

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
behind my father's
back all the time.

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
I don't mind keeping
watch if you want me to!

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
How thoughtful of you.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
But I'd expect no less from
our trump card against Gorgon.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Since we have
Ishtar on our side,

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
it seems like we might
have a chance of victory!

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] I don't think anything
could stand in your way!

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
She is called "the most powerful
goddess in Mesopotamia"!

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR giggles] Don't stop,
tell me more, you guys!

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.307 position:50% align:center
Flattery will get you nowhere,

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
but don't let that
stop you now...

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.144 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Ishtar?

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Wait. Come to think of it,

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
why do you have so much
confidence in me?

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Because we know
about your ultimate weapon,

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
Gugalanna the Bull
of Heaven, of course!

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:27.654 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR gasps]

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven...

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
That's the Divine Weapon that
you received from the god An!

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
Even King Gilgamesh
recognizes its strength,

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.873 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure you can
use it to destroy Gorgon.

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Even better,
since that doesn't really count

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
as fighting for herself,

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
I don't think it should violate
the pact of the alliance either!

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
Well, what I've heard
is it's a devastating weapon

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
that can even
change the terrain.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
I think the best choice
would be for us to keep it

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
as a last resort tactic.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
And that's all the more
reason we feel so reassured

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
that you decided
to join us, Ishtar.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR chuckles] That's right,
of course, you understand!

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
But yeah, that thing's
definitely a last resort!

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
By the way, I decided
I'm going to be

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
keeping a diary
starting tonight!

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
Gotta go! Have fun!

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
O-Okay! See you later!

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Fou?

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Good evening.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
You're still up keeping watch?

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
You really care about your
Servants as a Master, don't you?

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] I want Mash to get as
much rest as she possibly can.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Mash is the Servant
that has the shield, right?

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
Has it been a long contract?

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Huh? Yeah, it has.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Hmm.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What is it?

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
Um, well, can I sit next to you?

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
I'd like to have a little chat.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Huh? Oh, go ahead.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
So then, what's up?

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
U-Uh... Um, well...

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
It's just that I still
can't believe you actually

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
brought me over to your side.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Or wait...

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
Did you fall in love
with me at first sight?

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
Um, say that again?

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
You know.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's why you
brought me over to your side?

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Hm. I see.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
You're not denying it.

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
You don't understand!

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
We wanted to ask for your help

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
because we don't
have enough strength.

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
And there's no way we ever
could win against Gorgon

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
without you with us.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Ishtar, but I just--

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
I-I-It was a joke!

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
I was just teasing you.

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
Sorry for giving
you a hard time.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right!

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
I had something I wanted
to talk to you about!

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR sneezes]

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA gasps]

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
So, back to what we
were talking about...

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Oh my, are you
running away from me?

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
Oh, no I'm... uh...

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
No, you were starting to,
weren't you?

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
I saw you back away.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
I've seen it many times before.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
No, that's not it at all!

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
You can be honest.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
Are you afraid of me, too?

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to look frightened.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
If I did, then I
want to apologize.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Huh?

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
--[RITSUKA] Sorry.
--Oh, well, uh--

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
Really? So you're
not afraid of me?

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
You don't hate me
since I'm a goddess?

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't hate you
for reasons like that.

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Oh, that's right!

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
There's no time, so I have
to get right to the point!

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Hm?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
I understand your
plan is to take down

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:05.747 position:50% align:center
the Three Goddess Alliance.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
What do you really
know about them, though?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
Why do you ask?

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] It's pretty
obvious that the Goddess of

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
Demonic Beasts will never
make peace with you.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
I don't know the intentions of
the Goddess of the Jungle.

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
Our cultures are very different.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what is good
and what is evil in her eyes.

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
And then... the third
goddess in the alliance...

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
That's me, obviously.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
I can never forgive Mesopotamia
for what it's become.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:38.321 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] I refuse to accept the
idea that you humans willfully

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
abandoned the gods in order to
create your own separate world.

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
It's a mistake.

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
You'll be miserable.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
Humans can never escape
the suffering of life

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
or the terror of death.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
In order to come to grips
with how cruel the world is,

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
humanity grew more
intelligent and jaded.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
But in the Age of Gods, it's
possible to lessen that pain...

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
Because humans can
never fully understand

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
the will of the gods.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
So you can blame all
the senseless, terrible things

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
that happen in your
life on the gods.

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
it's easier to deal
with them that way.

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
I really believed that
was a good way of life.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
That's why I have been
patiently accepting blame

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
for tens of thousands of years.

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
And that's why I
joined the alliance...

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
I hope that the world
you humans live in

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
can become a world
shared by humans and gods.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
In other words, I'm not
an enemy of humanity,

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
but I am an enemy
of humanity's world.

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
Ishtar, I...

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
I just decided to
be nice and favor you

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
with this secret
no one else knows.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
But that's all I wanted to say
to you right now. So, well um...

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Thank you.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
You've been very kind to humans.

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:58.443 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
I'm going to go to bed now!

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
Y-You should think about
getting some rest soon, too!

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.324 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Good night.

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:10.914 position:50% align:center
See you.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:18.046 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Good night, Goddess.
