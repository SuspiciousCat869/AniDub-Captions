00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.974 position:50% align:center
K-King Gilgamesh!

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Lower your voice.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
I don't want Siduri to
know that I snuck out.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I-I'm sorry!

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Um...

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
So, what can we, uh,
do for you this morning?

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
Receiving a visit from you is
quite a surprise, Your Highness.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
Fou?

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
It is!

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN yawns]

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
Heh. Not at all.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
I figured it was time
to mix things up.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:42.876 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What do you mean by that?

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
I have decided to
personally give you

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
your assignment this morning.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH]
Huh?

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
You should rejoice,
Ritsuka Fujimaru.

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:26.062 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] King Gilgamesh's
direct request is

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50% align:center
"survey the water quality
of the Persian Gulf," huh?

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
Right. We are to
head to the observatory

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:33.361 position:50% align:center
at the Persian Gulf
and gather some seawater

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:34.904 position:50% align:center
to bring back for analysis.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
It's simple transport
work this time.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
It's almost too easy. And they
said the three goddesses

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50% align:center
haven't attacked this road.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
Plus, the weather's great.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
It's kind of relaxing, isn't it?

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
It is rather nice.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
But it's a shame Merlin
and Ana had to stay behind.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But we could only
get two travel passes.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's the
reason you and I are

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
the only ones on this
assignment, Senpai.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.140 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Mm. Or I guess
that was the intention...

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
Yes, this was... surprising.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Oh...

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
Take a look at those beautiful
clouds by the Zagros Mountains.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
"Far-off sea of clouds.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
Round atop the white peak hill.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
Mountain of cedar."

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.407 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. It sounded
better in my head.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
or some reason, King Gilgamesh
wanted to tag along.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS whispering]

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] In Uruk,
we use donkeys for transport.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50% align:center
We'll load the cart
with water jugs

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
and then acquire some
donkeys to pull it.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
O-Okay.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] I've already
arranged everything for you.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
The work I've put in
has been exemplary,

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
and wildly considerate.

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.887 position:50% align:center
The fact that I must
put in this much work for you

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
is troublesome, indeed.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Thank you so much!

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
Be diligent, everyone!

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.813 position:50% align:center
You are the heart of Uruk,
so you must help her thrive!

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:53.400 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS chattering]

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
What kind of game is that?

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
Oh, Your Majesty!

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Morning, Your Majesty!

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
Heh. What are you
playing there?

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
[KID 5C]
"A Hero's Race"!

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
You don't know, Your Majesty?

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
No, I've never seen this.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
Did this game show up recently?

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
[KID 5C]
Mm-hmm!

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
So, should this
piece go... here?

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
Amazing, Your Majesty!

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
It is a simple game,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
but well designed to teach you
important skills you'll need.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
Keep playing your
game. Play well!

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
You are a treasure
to our country.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
And naturally that makes you
one of my valuable treasures.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Right!

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hm. Let's not dawdle!

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
You're not allowed to be
slow today, for I am with you.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
[MASH, RITSUKA]
He's coming?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.873 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Um... So,
we'd really like to hear

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
why you decided to accompany us.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, I have a desire
to go and look at the sea.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
It's as simple as that.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
That's it?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
So does that mean
you're treating this

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
like a vacation, Your Majesty?

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
Fool! There's no time for fun.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
Why do you think I went
to such great lengths?

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
Th-That's preposterous!

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps] Then, right
about now, Siduri must be...

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] You see, deceiving
Siduri is child's play.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI sighs]

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Why are your expressions

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.032 position:50% align:center
those of hidden pain?

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to
sound intrusive,

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
but I don't think that
what you're doing is very nice.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] You have quite
the mouth, don't you?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]
I'm sorry.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
In any case, it's not like
I'm doing this because

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center
I'm exhausted from my duties,
or craving excitement.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
Now, entertain me
with your usual tales

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
of amusement and adventure!

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
He might be craving
excitement after all.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
The king sure is making
some unreasonable requests.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
Not fair! You're
hogging it, Romani!

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
I want to hear what's
going on, too!

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
So what's got you all riled up?

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
It stands to reason that

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
if the king hears
an amusing tale,

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
he may laugh himself to death,
and I don't want to miss that!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
It's my duty to monitor
those sorts of things!

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI sighs]

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
Now please, allow me,
Mash Kyrielight,

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
to tell the first tale!

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
I believe I should be
telling a tale of our journeys.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
[MASH] And for that,
I need to talk about

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.467 position:50% align:center
how I first met Senpai.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
[MASH clears throat]

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
The day that Senpai
and I first met,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
I found him asleep in
a hallway in Chaldea.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] You've got to be

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
embellishing the
story for effect.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
Not even an idiot
would sleep in a hallway!

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
Actually...

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
Fou, fou.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI laughs]
Good going, Mash!

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
You picked a good topic!

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
Also, she's completely serious.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
It's hitting the king
right in his funny bone.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
[MASH] The trouble was he kept
falling asleep after that, too.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Yeah...

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hmm.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
The director got mad,

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.543 position:50% align:center
until he was finally
kicked out of the room.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Well...

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
Either way, Da Vinci and I are

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
totally peeping on
you guys right now.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
Mash, Fujimaru, I'm sorry!

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI] Wow, you really are
a no nonsense guy, aren't you?

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
Well, don't work too much.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're the one who
spilled coffee earlier, not me.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
After all that,
we didn't have a choice

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
and ended up having to
eat wyvern meat.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
[MASH giggles]
It was really tough!

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Mm.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
That was a truly boring tale!

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Huh?

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Wait, you didn't like the story?

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
Every single story
you told me was about

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50% align:center
the two of you
enjoying yourselves.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
I guess that's true.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
Still, I can see you've
had a wonderful journey.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Tales of journeys are most fun

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
for the ones who made
the actual memories.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess you're right.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.726 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] And the ones
who did seem to be enjoying

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
the retelling, so it
must've been great.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
So do you have any,
King Gilgamesh?

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hm?

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Memories of
journeys or stories to tell?

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
I remember it all.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Brilliant tales of heroism,

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center
the endless travels,
and the warfare.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
So this is the observatory.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
The water samples
should be prepared.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
The researchers that work here

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.569 position:50% align:center
will have collected
them for you by now.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
You really are studying

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
the quality of the
water in this area.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
Water's precious in this era.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
Is that why you're
giving it such care?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Let's go.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
[OBSERVATORY CHIEF 5A gasps]
King Gilgamesh?

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
I did not expect a royal visit!

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
Are all of our government
affairs in order?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center
He's reacting just
like you did, Senpai.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.551 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I just had
a small errand to run here.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're not killing time?

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
Do you really
underestimate me that much?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
I suppose you must
think I'm a fool!

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.268 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, not at all!

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50% align:center
Listen, Senpai!

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
It's easy to mistake
His Majesty's

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
relaxed demeanor for idleness,

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
but I'm sure he's doing some
very important work! Amazing!

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH laughs]

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
Well done. One can never
glorify me too much.

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
The rest of you lot would
do well to learn from her.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course, Your Majesty!

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
If I may be so bold,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
please give advance
notice of your arrival.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
You've taken us by surprise,

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
and if we had known,
we would've prepared.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. A sudden appearance
can be bad for the heart.

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Nice to meet you.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.222 position:50% align:center
My name is Ritsuka Fujimaru.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou! Fou, fou, fou.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
Hang on, Fou!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
Make sure you don't wander
too far from the shore!

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou!

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
How about we take
a little break?

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
Oh, Senpai.
Thank you very much.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
I could really use one.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's this?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
The researchers
wanted to thank us

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
for all of our hard work today.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
I see.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
They said,
"Keeping up with the king

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
must be a full time job."
Funny, huh?

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
It-it's not like that! [gasps]

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
Hang on, I haven't seen the
king in a while. Where is he?

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Actually, he said he had a few
things he had to check out,

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
so he stayed behind
at the observatory.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] And we get to
take a little break.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Yeah.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Sounds like
a nice, peaceful day.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI sighs] If we could have
just given you the day off,

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
you could have gone
swimming in the sea.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
It's too bad.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Thank you both
for your hard work.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
How does the Persian Gulf
look to the naked eye?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it must be different
from what you experienced

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
in the Third Singularity.
Remember Okeanos?

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
Of course. When I think
that the Indian Ocean

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
is just beyond this point,
my heart begins to race.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Then I'll give you even more

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
heart-stopping information.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
The scale of this
Seventh Singularity

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
is greater than any
of the previous ones.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
What is it you mean
by "the scale"?

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] We're getting
observation data from as far as

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
the Indian Ocean,
well beyond the Persian Gulf.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
That's probably due
to the ocean being

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
an essential part of
life in Mesopotamia.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:54.881 position:50% align:center
I think that's why the mapping
data has taken shape like this.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
This is definitely turning into
one extraordinary story!

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
[MASH] No matter how far
we look into the past,

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
humans have always come face
to face with vast oceans

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.936 position:50% align:center
and found a way to conquer them.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Am I...?

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Mash?

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
Senpai, do you think that
I'm truly facing things?

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
If I see what I wish for,
when it's right in front of

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
my eyes, will I
even recognize it?

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
[DRAKE] Whether you know it
or not, you already have a wish.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
All humans have some kind of
wish, somewhere, deep inside.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
If you don't have one,
you can't go on living.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
All humans...

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
But I'm... I'm just...

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
Wrongdoers do
good deeds at times,

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
and good men end up
doing evil deeds.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
That's humans for you.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
That's just who we are.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
Does that mean... me, too?

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
I'm certain you'll
know in the end.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.247 position:50% align:center
You'll realize what
you want to do, Mash.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center
And that will tell you
why you continue to

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
raise that shield to defend
other people. For sure.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
In our travels together,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
I've been the one closest
to you, watching you grow.

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
Facing yourself sounds easy,
but it's really not.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
What should you do?
What do you wish for?

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
I want to ask you,
once you know.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
Because I'm sure
you'll find the answers.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Yeah.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
Ya know, he's right.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou! Fou, fou, fou!

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Doctor, there's
something at nine o'clock!

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.883 position:50% align:center
I don't know what it is,
but it's headed right for us!

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
Yes, I can see it from here.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
it's moving 500 kph...
in this heavy mana density?!

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
Contact in three, two, one!

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
Shield up! Now, Mash!

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
What can I say?

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
You lack the skill to
sense impending danger.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
How amusing.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] I'm surprised you'd
come to a secluded area

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
like this without an escort.

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
You've either grown
used to good luck,

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
or you greatly
underestimated us.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
It's Enkidu...

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.882 position:50% align:center
We know that you
should be dead!

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
Master, I'm sensing the
Mage King from this enemy!

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
We have to remember,
that is not Enkidu!

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
Yes. I suppose you're right.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
It would be a lie to say
I'm the actual Enkidu.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
Who in the hell are you, then?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
You're confused because
I've changed owners.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
The hopelessness of
humans astounds me.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
You're not making any sense.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
None of that matters
for it is so trivial.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Master, watch out!

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center
I'm a danger to humans
until I'm destroyed.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
Whatever happens,
that will never change.

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
I'll prove that...

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
...by putting an end
to your lives, right now.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
Careful!

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
Wait, I recognize
that fighting style!

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
They're using the specialty
of King Gilgamesh!

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Of course I am.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
I'm creating an
infinite number of blades

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
and firing them all at you.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
If I'm to fight with this body,

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
I might as well use
the best tactic.

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center
Mash, no!

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
If you would really
like to get particular,

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
when he uses all
of these tactics,

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
then he's actually imitating me!

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Oh?
I don't think that's true...

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
Or are my memories in error?

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] I seem to
recall when that tactic

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
originally flashed
from my mind,

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
it was ridiculed as
"the ultimate waste of energy."

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
You're wrong, it's because
you were-- Wait...

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh!

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You are...

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
...Gilgamesh?

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
Who else would I
possibly be, idiot?

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.261 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
What happened to
the calm efficiency

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
of the so called
'weapon' before me?

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
Enjoying the thrill
and bloodlust of battle

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
is very unlike you, Enkidu.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
King Gilgamesh!

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
That's an impostor!

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
Not the Enkidu you knew!

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] They are quite
convincing nonetheless!

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
You be quiet!

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
You have acquired
excellent Magical Energy.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
Was it a gift from
the three goddesses?

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Shut your mouth!

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Out of all of creation,

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
I am the most powerful
thing on this planet!

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
There's no need for a
defective demigod like you!

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Worthless fool of a king...

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
Enemy of my mother...

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
I will kill you here and now!

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
I will end you now!

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
Even if I must destroy
the world to do it!

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
Now tell me, what are you?

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh!

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI sighs]
They're all right.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
Enkidu is retreating
and it looks like

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
they're heading
toward Northern Uruk.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
And that's where we lose 'em.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
I can't begin to
imagine what it was

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
that made them
decide to retreat,

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
but for now, it looks like
you don't have to worry.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.651 position:50% align:center
Senpai, are you hurt anywhere?

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. You okay?

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
Thanks to King Gilgamesh.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
I knew that it was just
about time for us to meet,

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
but the timing couldn't
have been worse.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Thank you for saving us!

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Don't be naive.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
Even my help wouldn't truly be
enough to balance the scales.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center
We've only been spared
because of his whim.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
If it had been his will,
I would have died alongside you.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
Um, why did Enkidu
look like they were in pain?

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Who knows?

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
Maybe he was broken.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
Maybe some cessation of
cardiopulmonary function.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
Those kinds of things happen.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it anymore.

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
It's over now.

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
You just say,
"Don't worry about it,"

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
but he clearly looked like...

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Let's go back to Uruk.

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
I've done what
I came here to do

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
and saw what I needed to see.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
Also, something has
jogged my memory.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU groaning]

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
I'm stronger than they are.

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:03.346 position:50% align:center
I'm stronger--that damned
king is no match for me!

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
So why...

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
Why did I run away
from those weaklings?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] The recording
is out of order, too.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
It's only giving me access
to previous battles.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
I don't understand.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:30.248 position:50% align:center
What's with this
defective heart?

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
He is someone I should kill.

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
But I want to talk.

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
No, there's no room
for conversation.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
I will kill him.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.561 position:50% align:center
Kill him.

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
I must kill him!
I must kill him!

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
I must kill him!

00:21:56.691 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
For Mother's sake,
I must kill him!

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:03.865 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:05.492 position:50% align:center
I must remember.

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
I'm not the true Enkidu.
