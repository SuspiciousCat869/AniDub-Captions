[URIDIMMU 2A growls]

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Are those the
Demonic Beasts from earlier?

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Wait, there's more
to it than that.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center
There are Magical
Energy readings of

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
an even higher magnitude
to the North! Unbelievable.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] So they're keeping the
beasts at bay with the fortress?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] It's too soon
to be surprised.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
What is truly astonishing

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
is that they've held
the wall for six months.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
They've held out that long?

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.802 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] The soldiers
have been driving back

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
an endless onslaught
of Demonic Beasts.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
But between the two sides,
humans have fewer casualties.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Amazing.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Yes. There are
way more Demonic Beasts

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
than the soldiers, though.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kind of
person is in command

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.779 position:50% align:center
of the army in that fortress.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
Me, too. I'm sure they
must be a brilliant general.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Hmph.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.830 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] But they're
causing needless bloodshed.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.084 position:50% align:center
They don't need to kill
every one of them.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
They will go extinct without
even doing anything anyway.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.131 position:50% align:center
Enkidu?

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.633 position:50% align:center
Fou?

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
We're near the safe zone.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center
I estimate that we
should be able to

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
make it to Uruk by sunset.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center
Please correct me
if I'm wrong,

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
but it seems we're going
further away from Uruk.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] Ah, well there is
a wharf at the river up ahead.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
There should be a
usable boat there.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
Once we get to the wharf,
we just take it downstream.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Oh my! I didn't know that!

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, hello.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.962 position:50% align:center
Sorry to have scared you.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
I hope you know I'm not your
enemy, so please hear me out.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.678 position:50% align:center
As you can see,
we couldn't find our way

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
through these trails and
found ourselves lost.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect humans
in the territory of

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
the Goddess of Demonic Beasts.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
Your story is unfortunate.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
We are heading to Uruk,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
and you're both welcome to
join us if you would like.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Yes, please! What a relief.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
Some strange fate must
have brought us together.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
May we know the names
of our saviors?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
I am Ritsuka Fujimaru.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
And my name is
Mash Kyrielight.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
This is our guide, Enkidu.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
Enkidu, huh?

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
Well, this poses a problem.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm. A big one.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Because King Gilgamesh,

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
who is commanding
the front line in Uruk,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
is the very king who
returned from his quest

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
for the herb of immortality.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
Well, what's wrong with that?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
That can't be!
It doesn't make sense!

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
You're right. Because of
his friend Enkidu's death,

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh decided to embark
on a quest for immortality.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] And he's
returned from the quest,

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
which means Enkidu should've
been dead a long time ago.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Mash!

00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU chuckles]

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU laughs]

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
Fujimaru...

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
Ritsuka Fujimaru...

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
Incompetent fools of Chaldea.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Ah... I was so close, though.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.607 position:50% align:center
If we'd gone further,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
I would've gotten to see
something very fun.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
It's useless to try and flee.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
Can't you feel it?
You're already doomed.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Huh. The odds aren't looking
very good for the two of them.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Ana, assist our friends!

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
This isn't part of the deal,

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
but I'll protect them for now.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.025 position:50% align:center
It's useless.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Don't you get it?

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Mash!

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] Out of all
the weapons in existence,

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
you're using chains against me?

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
How amusing.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center
Watch out!

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:44.863 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
You're making me laugh...

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
...third-rate Servant!

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.745 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
You're a pathetic joke.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
Did you really think that
you would stand a chance

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.082 position:50% align:center
against me with
attacks like that?

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
Defeating you is
unnecessary at the moment.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
Having a humanlike intelligence
can backfire on you.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
[ANA] You should take this
opportunity to learn that.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
Yes, I see now...

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
I was caught in an illusion
halfway through the fight.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
Meaning that's the Mage
working for Uruk.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
I guess I must
withdraw for today.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'll get in trouble

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
if I leave her alone
for a whole day.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Uh... H-Huh?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.213 position:50% align:center
Where is Enkidu?

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN laughs] Wow,
that really worked out great!

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
I feel a little bad for
tricking him like a child.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
But Enkidu's tough to beat.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
After all, that boy is under
the employ of the King of Mages,

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
and that's no small thing.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
They're working for
the King of Mages?

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
Was that really Enkidu?

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Yes...

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
That's what he called himself

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
when he destroyed
many defenseless cities.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
Though, many people in Uruk
seem to want to believe

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.158 position:50% align:center
he isn't the real thing.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
But, all that aside, please!

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
Allow me to greet you!

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
I selflessly saved you
from the brink of death!

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
Come now, your savior
accepts your gratitude!

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
Oh, r-right!
Thank you very much!

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
Yes, thank you-- Huh?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Die, Merlin! Fou!

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN groans]
Fou!

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
Fou, why?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
You feral beast!

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
Um, is it me or are
they evenly matched?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN groans] I never
should've taken you in,

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
Cath Palug! You wicked beast!

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
Merlin, please limit your lunacy
to when you're alone at night.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, Ana.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
I must thank you for
saving our new friends.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
That battle wasn't
in our contract.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
You should be sorry
instead of grateful.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN chuckles]
That's harsh.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Now that that's settled,

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
we should properly
introduce ourselves.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
I am Merlin.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.932 position:50% align:center
The girl's name is Ana.

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
We're actually Servants.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
You may have the privilege of
calling me "Big Brother Merlin."

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
Ana? Have you picked
your nickname?

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Wha--

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
[ANA] I don't care.
Ana will be fine.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
--[ROMANI] Hold--
--[RITSUKA] Hm?

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Hold on a second!

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Huh?

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
Did you say "Merlin"?

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
The great Mage of
the Isle of Britain,

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
born of a human
and an incubus!

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
He guided Altria
Pendragon to the throne

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
and served as court mage!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
He's one of the world's
greatest kingmakers

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
and the world's
biggest scoundrel!

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
He is a Servant?

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
The Grand Mage who
shouldn't be able to die

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
until the end of the world?

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
Doctor...?

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
He sounds pretty enthusiastic.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI pants]

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN laughs]

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Thank you that grand
introduction, Romani Archaman.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
But to be honest, that Grand
title is really just a title.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
I'm only a normal Caster.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
There's no way that's true!

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
Liar! If you're Merlin,
show us your true form!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
Fou! Fou!

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
I really don't get why
the Doctor is all riled up.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
The Legend has lots of
discrepancies about Merlin.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
Merlin the Mage built a tower
in the utopia of Avalon.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
From there,
he watches over the world,

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
and will do so until it ends,
because he is unable to die.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
That's why.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
He shouldn't be a Heroic Spirit
since no one who's alive can be.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
That's my point!

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
First off, when it
comes to combat,

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
he's completely
useless, a liability!

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
Every Mage that is qualified
to have the 'Grand' title

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.065 position:50% align:center
is an excellent clairvoyant.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Solomon's eyes can see
the past and future.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:55.363 position:50% align:center
King Gilgamesh also has
the ability to see the future.

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
But that scoundrel in
front of you is the worst!

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
Although he has abilities to see
what's happening in the present,

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
seeing's all he can do!

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
Which is useful!

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
Uh... when you
think a-about it...

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
But isn't that kind of
an amazing thing?

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
--[clattering]
--Doctor?

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
Hi! Sorry for butting in!

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
First off, thank you, Merlin.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
You helped them get out of
a tough spot back there.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Don't mention it.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.934 position:50% align:center
It's part of the
services I provide.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
But I'm still
having doubts about

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
how you became
a Heroic spirit...

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Technically you're still
in Avalon, aren't you?

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Hm. I can tell
you the trick I used:

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
This Singularity
manifested in an age

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
that predates my
appearance on Earth.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
In other words, my body doesn't
exist here, or hasn't yet.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
When you put it that way,

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
it could theoretically
be said that you're dead.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
So, you used that loophole

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
to make yourself a Servant?

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.753 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
I suppose you could say that.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
I should add that the
one that summoned me

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
is extremely powerful.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
You said you were summoned.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center
Is there a Master in
this era besides Senpai?

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Yes, of course.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
I serve my Master
as his court mage.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
He summoned me, and so I am
bound to do as he pleases.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
Something else to note.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
Ana was summoned by
the influence of the Grail.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
She's a Rogue Servant
with no Master at all.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
I met Merlin two days ago.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
He and I made a contract
to work together

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
in order to achieve our goals,
but I was deceived.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA chuckles]

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
To put it lightly,
Merlin is the embodiment of

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
every kind of dishonesty

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.294 position:50% align:center
you could possibly
think of in this world.

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Oh, come on, stop it!

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
It makes me blush when
you say things like that!

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou! Fou!

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
You've got to
let it go, Romani.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
We both know that's
the real Merlin.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI sighs]
And now, my stomach hurts.

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
We know it's you now, so did you
manifest to work with Chaldea?

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
Of course. It's my only hobby.

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
Watching over
the present, I mean.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
If we lose the present
and everything in it,

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
I'll be no more than
a lonely man in a tower,

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
staring at nothing
but the Garden below.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Hm?

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
I must admit...

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
I've been watching
your whole adventure,

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
every step of the way, on the
edge of my seat, Fujimaru.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's fair
to not let me be part of

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
your team now, do you?

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
Though, I understand
if you're intimidated

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
because I'm a Grand Caster.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
In the end, all other
Caster-class Servants

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
will realize they can't beat me

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
and get shuffled off
to the backup group!

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
Now that that's settled, let's
head to Uruk in the morning.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.451 position:50% align:center
When you meet the king,

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
it'll become clear
what you're meant to do.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Mm. I'm excited
to work with you.

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:52.916 position:50% align:center
Let's all do our best.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] All right then.
What about you, Ana?

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
Will you come with us?

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
I not sure I want to
go to a human city.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.635 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
You'll come with us, won't you?

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
I don't do handshakes.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
And don't come too
close to me, please.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
[MASH] We finally have a grasp
on the situation here, Senpai.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Yeah. With the rise
of the Three Goddess Alliance,

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
the Sumerian city-states have
been dealt a devastating blow.

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
That's why people have
evacuated to Uruk.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Yes. The Demonic
Beasts' invasion up north

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
is the most serious
issue at hand.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
They're currently the major
force wiping out humanity.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
In response, Uruk's king
constructed a great fortress.

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] The Demonic
Beast Front: Babylonia.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
The final defense of
the Mesopotamian world.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
If the Beasts prevail,

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
human history is over
before it starts.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
To prevent that,
what you need to do is...

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] ...find the Holy Grail
the King of Mages sent here,

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
retrieve it...

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
[ANA] ...and take down
the Three Goddess Alliance.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Right. If we can
retrieve the Holy Grail,

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
we can uncover the
King of Mage's plot.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.578 position:50% align:center
But if we leave the
Three Goddess Alliance as is,

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
the Foundation of Humanity
can't be restored.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] In any case,
we can't take action

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
until we arrive at Uruk.

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Merlin,
is the current ruler of Uruk

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
the same King Gilgamesh
that we're familiar with?

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:29.429 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Yes, the most
tyrannical of all ancient kings.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Huh? Really?

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
He cut ties with gods,
saying they're arrogant.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
He claims all
treasure as his own,

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
as well as all beautiful women.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.522 position:50% align:center
And he won't hesitate
to kill you

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
if you disagree with him or not.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
T-Talk about
irrational behavior...

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
Gilgamesh is the King of Heroes.

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
He was a hero born of
a god and a human.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
In his youth,
he was fond of people,

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
wise beyond his years
and grounded in reason.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
But he became the opposite
in his adolescence

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
and turned into an
out-of-control tyrant.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center
To punish him for his behavior,

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
the gods created a being that
could match his power, Enkidu.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
But, as fate would have it...

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] They bonded
and became best friends.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
Enkidu...

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
More about them later.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
He brags about
possessing the originals

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
of all the Noble Phantasms,
and feels powerful.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
He's an extremely arrogant
and cold-blooded tyrant.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
That just about wraps up
Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
W-We got this!

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Yeah!

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN chuckles]

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
[MASH] That looks like
an inspection checkpoint.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
Would it be better if
we tried to sneak through?

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
Based on my experience,

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
one wrong move and
we're in a big fight.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
--[URUK SOLDIER 2A] Hey, you!
--[BOTH gasp]

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
If you stray too far
from the road,

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
you'll end up cursed
by the Ritual Sect!

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
There's a ritual ward
surrounding Uruk.

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
It holds the Demonic Beasts off.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
Take care. It has some
effects on humans as well.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
[MASH] We will!
Thank you for the warning!

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, but are you
folks refugees from Ur?

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] No they're not.
They're refugees from Girsu.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
As for myself,
I conduct my business

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
with the Ritual
Sect's permission.

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
I'm assisting them
in their evacuation.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.163 position:50% align:center
I assume everything's in order?

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
[URUK SOLDIER 2A] I know this,
it's the sigil of Lady Siduri.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
You must be tired
from your long trip!

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
I welcome you to Uruk!

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
Uh, thanks! We appreciate it!

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me, you there,
in the black...

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
What is it that you want?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
[URUK SOLDIER 2A]
Miss,

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed someone
as small as you

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
managed to walk
all the way here.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
I have something for you.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
Uh... Huh?

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
these are just sweets

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
my daughter packed for me
as an afternoon snack.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
But... But I...

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
They're your...

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
I'm not used to...

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
Ana! Say thank you
to the nice man.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
Huh?

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I appreciate it.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
[URUK SOLDIER 2A]
Be safe, I hope we all live

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
to meet again someday!

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
We are fighting to survive,
and no effort can be spared

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
if it's for the
greater good of humanity.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
Ready? We should get going.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
This is Uruk in its prime.

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
Mankind's oldest fortress city.

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH]
Amazing!

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Times may be dire, but
the city remains lively, right?

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
I imagined all sorts of things

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
when I heard "ancient city,"

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
but this is beyond
anything dreamed of.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Agreed! There have
been many modern cities

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
that modeled themselves
after this fortress.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Everyone is
smiling, and so lively!

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
About the Sumerians. They show
up in history around 4000 B.C.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
Their civilization was quite
elaborate and innovative.

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
It began when a village-based
society was abandoned

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
for city-states housing
tens of thousands of people

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
by boosting crop production
through irrigated farming.

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
With a country that big,
the invention of writing

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
and higher education
showed up quickly.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
The fertile lands
created quality mud

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
which they kneaded to make clay.

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
That, in turn, was used
to build fortresses.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
That is Mesopotamia,

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
the land of mud, clay,
wheat, and sheep.

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
Well, we'll save a tour
of the city for later.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
Let's head over to the ziggurat.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What's a ziggurat?

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
[MASH] It's a shrine and altar
used by the Mesopotamians.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Yes.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
It's time for you to finally
meet King Gilgamesh.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
[URUK SOLDIER 2B]
That is all, sir!

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Keep me updated.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
The more frequent the briefings,

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
the fresher the information,
and that can win a war.

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
[URUK SOLDIER 2B]
Yes, sir!

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
We'll shift to
bringing clay tablets

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
from the secretary
to you, every hour!

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Very well. What's next?

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Mm.

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
So the shipments from the city
of Eresh are being delayed, huh?

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.508 position:50% align:center
Send 20 men from
the eastern barracks.

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
Have them clear out
the Demonic Beasts.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.388 position:50% align:center
Temun can take command.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center
He's a local. He knows it well.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
By the way, I heard

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
Tabado's daughter
is giving birth.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
Send a midwife to
help her deliver,

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
with some fruit to
aid her recovery.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
Yes. I will do as
you command at once.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Oh, and pull
Tabado off the Northern Wall.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
Tell him he has
three days rest.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
His grandson's face
will give him courage.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
Is this the report
from the astrologers?

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
But I thought the king
would be terrifying,

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
but I... I guess
he's not that bad?

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
Maybe. But I don't know if
we can even talk to him...

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
Well, we need to work up
the courage to talk to him!

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
That's right.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
You can't just wait for the
king to have a spare moment.

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
Huh? [gasps]

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
King Gilgamesh!

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
I, Merlin, Mage extraordinaire,
have brought guests!

00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
You busy?

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
Well, I can see that
you are, so don't worry!

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Merlin!

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hm?

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI] So, you've returned,
Merlin the Mage.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
Welcome back to these halls.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
The king is happy to see you.

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
Did you find it?

00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
Did you bring back
the Tablet of Destinies?

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] No, I didn't have
any luck this time, either.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
It's not in the western forest.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
Oh well.

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
If only you could remember
where you left it, Your Majesty,

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
That would save me
a whole lot of trouble.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:47.265 position:50% align:center
Hold your tongue
and know your place, Mage.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
Now then, who are these people?

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
They don't look like Uruks.

00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
Stop. I understand
the situation here.

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
Stand aside, Siduri.

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI]
King Gilgamesh? Please wait.

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
No, I won't.

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
I'm going to cause
some chaos in here.

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
Now leave me to it!

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
My time is too precious to sit
back and listen to their story.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
Thus, to examine
your authenticity,

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:14.209 position:50% align:center
I will test your
resolve in battle!

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:18.672 position:50% align:center
Prepare yourselves,
Mages of the Observatory!
