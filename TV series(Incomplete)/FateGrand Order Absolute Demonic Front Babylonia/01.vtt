So you're on your way, Chaldea?

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:41.184 position:50% align:center
The lone candlelight which
illuminates many a star!

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center
Now, come forth!

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
To this land where
the times of gods

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.524 position:50% align:center
and deeds of humans collide!

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.027 position:50% align:center

final Master!

Good morning!

Oh, yes, good morning, Senpai.

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:46.458 position:50% align:center
Mash Kyrielight!
Reporting for duty!

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
Although, I am late
by two minutes.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry.

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, good morning.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
Good morning,
and thank you, Dr. Roman.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.886 position:50% align:center
How are you feeling,
are you sure you're okay?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
Yes. I am at 100%.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
What a relief.
That's good to hear.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry if I
worried you too much.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
Well, Fujimaru, and Mash...

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.106 position:50% align:center
Now that both of you
have arrived,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
we should get the
briefing underway.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Right!

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center

[ROMANI] As of 7 AM today,
we at Chaldea have successfully

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
completed preparations for the
Rayshift to Seventh Singularity.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
The final one...

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
This last Singularity
is the seventh Grail

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
that Solomon sent
into the past himself.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.176 position:50% align:center
My hopes for its
recovery rest with you.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
the day's finally here.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] The lost year,
2017, is fast approaching.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
No matter the cost...

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50% align:center
We must eradicate the cause of
the incineration of humanity.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
That's the goal
of the Grand Order.

...and Camelot.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
We've made all sorts of journeys
and made it this far.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
But now, we're attempting
to go even further.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center line:10%
You'll go to one of the
world's oldest civilizations

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center line:10%
in 2600 B. C., the end
of the Age of Gods.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
The land of ancient
Mesopotamia...

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
A world before
the Christian Era...

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.354 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
Exactly!

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
This singularity is
the most perilous yet.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
Because of the dangerous process
of transporting ourselves there!

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
[MASH, RITSUKA]
Da Vinci!

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
I always love
how all of you react.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
It warms my heart.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
I mean, genius always
comes with the unexpected!

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] You know,
you don't always have to make

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
a flashy entrance...

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI] How boring!
What kind of response is that?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
Anyway, listen closely.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
Time for a lecture.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Mesopotamia is an
ancient civilization that

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
flourished between the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers,

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.767 position:50% align:center
which flowed into
the Persian Gulf.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
The age of the first kings.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
That's our destination.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
According to legend,
this was when

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
the Era of Gods began to fade.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
If all of that is true,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
it's a time when gods and
monsters still coexisted.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
You're correct.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
Even so, we can't
let that stop us.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
Listen to the man!

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
You've restored six
Singularities so far.

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
You should have a little more

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
confidence in
yourself than that.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
On my honor as a genius,
I solemnly swear that

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
I will flawlessly
prove your existence.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
Wonderful, no?

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
Don't worry at all!

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Get out there, adventure awaits!

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
While Leonardo's statements
might be over the top,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
not many get to do
something like this.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
Once we finally put
an end to everything,

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
I want you both to tell me what
you've learned on this journey.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou, fou!

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
I have the perfect gift for you.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
It's something to
definitely look forward to.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Um... Dr. Roman, may I
please ask you one question?

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center

We're falling! We're falling!

We'll never survive
an impact from this height!

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
Mash! You can do this!

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Mash Kyrielight,
doing everything I can!

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
Master, your hand!

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
Now, just grab on to my waist
and hold tight as you can!

please lend me your power!

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
Master, I mean...!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
You're not hurt, are you?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
I'm good. [coughs]
Thanks to you.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
[MASH] No, I'm the one
who should say thanks.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
It all happened so suddenly
that my mind went totally blank.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
But then you said...

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
Why, uh... Why are you
still on top of me?

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH gasp]

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
Fou! Fou...

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
I'm glad you're okay, too, Fou.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
Do you think something
went wrong with the Rayshift?

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] I thought the goal
was to transport them

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
to the biggest city in the era.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.648 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
Those two were thrown
off course by a bounded field.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.489 position:50% align:center
There seems to be a bounded
field around the city of Uruk.

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
Presumably to ward off attacks.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
Both of you, did you hear that?

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Loud and clear, Doctor.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
So, we bounced off of
the city's defense mechanism.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Yes. There's no doubt
that some sort of danger

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
has Uruk on high
alert right now.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.215 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
So? Do you like my present?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Yeah! It may be
thanks to the new Mystic Code,

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
but I'm not having
any issues with this at all.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] And all three strokes
of the command spell are back.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center

That's fantastic.

Please proceed with caut--

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
Hey, Doctor? [sighs]

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
We lost connection.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
[MASH] The band of light in
the sky exists as expected.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.913 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] For now, why don't we
check out what's around here?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
I've never seen this
kind of beast before.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We haven't
encountered these.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
Unlike the Demonic Beasts
we've faced before,

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
these things were
clearly hostile.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Maybe these
monsters are the reason why

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
this city is in total ruin...

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
Mash, we'd better
get out of here.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
I don't think that was
the last of the Demonic B--

Get away of my way! Incoming!

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
Well that was a disaster.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
Huh? What the--?

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
Um... Hello there.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
You've made me your cushion.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
Wait, what in the world
are you doing?

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
Who gave you permission
be my cushion?

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
You better get out of
my way right now!

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
P-Please, you must move aside!

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
M-Master is being crushed!

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
Fou, fou!

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI] Will we be able
to resume communication

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
with Fujimaru soon?

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
No, not quite yet.
But we can still observe them.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
We got some pretty
strong energy readings,

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
but it looks like they're safe.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
It's not exactly
how we planned it,

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
but those two can
handle themselves.

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Touching my body
without permission

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
is a pretty bold move.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
Now which town are you from?

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Touching?
That was more of an accident.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
Even from my viewpoint,
that was unavoidable...

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
Please just hear us out!

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
Because... you are...

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
Miss, um...

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
Hold on a minute, do you
two mean to tell me that...

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
...you don't know who I am?

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
I'm sorry.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
He and I are members of a group
of people called "Chaldea."

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.605 position:50% align:center
We were sent here
to this Singularity

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
to correct the
course of humanity.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying you're
visiting from afar?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
Well, stuff like that happens.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
You might say we're
in the same boat.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
So... So you understand, then.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do. For future reference,

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
touching me without
permission is an offense

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
that's usually completely
out of the question.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
Won't happen again.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
My name's Ritsuka Fujimaru.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
I'm a Master who makes
contracts with Heroic Spirits.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
And she is...

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
I'm Mash Kyrielight, and my
cute little friend here is Fou.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
Fou!

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Hmph. I'm not
telling you my name.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
I won't give you
any information.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
In fact, you will
answer my questions!

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
Like, whether or not
you saw something precious

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
lying around here! Well?

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb, I mean
something that makes you think,

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
"Wow, that looks important!"
at first glance.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
Well, did you?

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
I don't know you mean...

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see, so did you
drop this item?

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR gasps]
Of course I didn't do that!

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
I didn't drop anything at all!

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Uh...

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Don't look at me
like that, say something!

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
Silence can be even crueler
than words at times, you know!

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
--[sighs]
--[roaring]

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:12.977 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
Oh, to the North?

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
--[MASH] That's not it!
--[growling]

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
That voice you heard
didn't belong to Senpai!

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
It's dangerous! Stand back!

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
[MASH] They look like the
Demonic Beasts from earlier!

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
Just who do you think
you're speaking to?

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
You two are the ones
who need to stand back.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Huh?

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
My special move!

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR giggles]

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA, MASH]
A-Amazing!

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
--[growling]
--[BOTH gasp]

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
There are more of them.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.038 position:50% align:center
Mash!

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Let's work together this ti--

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR] Don't make
decisions on your own!

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
Master Fujimaru, was it?

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50% align:center
If you have trouble dealing with
this level of Demonic Beast,

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
the restoration of humanity
is nothing but a dream.

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
Do your best with what you have!

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
[ringing]

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Finally! We're connected!

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
Doctor Romani, I'm going to
have to get right back to you!

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA gasps]

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Huh? There are
less of them that way!

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
Come on! Follow me!

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Got it!

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
There are way
too many of them...

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.929 position:50% align:center
If we fight them
alone, we'll lose!

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
Are you looking for
a little back up?

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
If so, I believe I
might be able to help.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] It is an honor
to make your acquaintance,

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
Master of Chaldea.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
My name is Enkidu.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
I have waited here
in this Age of Gods

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:47.132 position:50% align:center
for your arrival
which was foretold.

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU grunts]

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.658 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] With that attack,
I believe I've nullified

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
the Demonic Beasts in this area.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
Even so, the smell of
the blood of the fallen

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
will draw more here.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
Please tell me,
are you from this land?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
I've already introduced myself.

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
I'm sure your mage already
knows a great deal about me?

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Y-Yeah...

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
I'm assuming you are the
real Enkidu, is that correct?

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
Man oh man, that's the
Weapon of the Gods.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
What did you say?

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] If King Gilgamesh,
a mix of human and divine blood,

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
is the Wedge of the Heavens
created by the gods

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
to connect to the human world,

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
Enkidu is the
Chain of the Heavens

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
created to return
Gilgamesh to the gods.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
Not even the tyrannical
King Gilgamesh could defeat

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
the good-hearted hero
you two have just met.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
These compliments
are embarrassing.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
There's no need to flatter me.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Thanks for earlier, Enkidu.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Uh...

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
He wants to shake hands.
It's a greeting.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see... forgive me.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
I'm still not used to this.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
Please, allow me to
guide you to Uruk.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Thank you very much!

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] You said
you knew why we're here?

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Yes, to a certain extent.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
The Holy Grail disrupted time
and the alteration of history

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
was caused by those
who were given the Grail...

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
The Mage King created
Singularities from them

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
to force the collapse of
the Foundation of Humanity.

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
In order to prevent that,

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
we've journeyed through
six Singularities thus far.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
I know of that, as well.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
I was ordered to come here by
the chief priestess of Uruk,

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
to protect and guide
our guests from afar.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Then, this age is still...

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
The people in the Age of Gods

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
do not succumb that easily.

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
But I was very surprised.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
I heard that humanity's
final Master would be coming.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
So I had imagined that someone
like Gilgamesh would show up.

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
I guess I disappointed you.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
No.

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] I am glad...
that it turned out to be

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
someone like you.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] So how much farther
until we get to to Uruk?

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
I would like to take
a direct route south,

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
but that would bring us
into a different territory.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
You mean it's dangerous?

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
Yes. You see,

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Mesopotamia is currently
on the brink of extinction.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
Those ruins we saw before...
must've been...

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
Cities fell to ruin
one after another.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
All of the survivors have
evacuated to the city of Uruk.

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
All this was caused by
the owner of the Grail?

Actually, no one
is in possession of

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
the Holy Grail right now.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
The enemy of humans
are the gods.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
Go-- Did you say gods?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
The Three Goddess Alliance.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
As of now, they have taken about
60% of Mesopotamia's land.

[RITSUKA]
An alliance of goddesses...

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
I-If they're goddesses,

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
aren't they supposed
to side with humans?

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
There has never been a time

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
when gods allied with humans.

[MASH gasps]

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] The objective of
the Three Goddess Alliance

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
is the incineration of humanity.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] That means... they're
the same as the Mage King!

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU] Each of the
goddesses destroyed this land

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
using their own unique power.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
One is the Goddess
of Demonic Beasts.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.346 position:50% align:center
The powerful creatures
that she creates,

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
including those we saw before,

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
have completely covered
the northern areas.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
To counter them,

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
humanity came together
and created something.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
You will see it soon enough.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
It should be visible from here.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.130 position:50% align:center
Th-This is it?!

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
Yes. The hope of humanity
lies before you.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
[ENKIDU]
The final and largest fortress

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
to protect the four
corners of the world...

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center

Front: Babylonia!

[MERLIN]
Huh?

00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:45.759 position:50% align:center
Ah. Looks like he's here.

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:48.803 position:50% align:center
Humanity's final Master.
