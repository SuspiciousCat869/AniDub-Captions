[MAGE KING] This is the
one and only word of advice

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.352 position:50% align:center
you will receive from me.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
If wish to live,
you will abandon

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
this useless quest of yours
and surrender to me.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
There is no other way.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
Hmph. The matter of
keeping you alive or killing you

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
is of no consequence to me.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
However, if you
continue to persist,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
and manage to somehow destroy
all seven Singularities,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
I might be persuaded
to look at things anew

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
and reconsider my stance.

[MASH]
A month has already passed

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
since we arrived here in Uruk.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.751 position:50% align:center
This was my very first taste
of a normal, everyday life

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
outside of Chaldea.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA sighs] Today's work
was a little tough.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Yeah.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
But I think I've finally started

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
to grow accustomed
to the routine.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.097 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm finally getting
the hang of things myself.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
Fou, fou!

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center

That man...

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Oh my. Do you
think perhaps he's hungry?

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
Um, Senpai? Wait!

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Um... I don't mean
to be presumptuous, but here.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN 4A] When compassion
is offered mindlessly,

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
it is a sin.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
Feeling shame is
yet another violation.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN 4A]
However, I'm not so proud

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
that I do not
appreciate kindness.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
I shall give you something
in recompense for your deeds.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
Oh, there's no need, really.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN 4A]
You must guard your heart

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50% align:center
and empathize not with
the hateful one.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
Keep your wits and celebrate
not with the joyous one.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
Finally, you must
maintain a steadfast will,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
and extol not the pained one.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
If you forget all,
at least remember this:

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
Tis a fool's task to explain
the ways of humankind

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center

You can't sleep?

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking about
what that old man said.

That was awful,
but please don't forget

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
we went on to repair
six Singularities!

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
And Uruk marks the seventh.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] As long as that
belt of light is there,

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center

it'll be irreversible.

True.

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
Once in a while I wonder.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
Was becoming humanity's
Final Master the right choice?

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
In the beginning, I was
completely unprepared.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
I was working at
almost a fever pitch,

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
because I honestly thought
I didn't have any other choice.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
But I can't forget the
people I couldn't protect.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
I had a conversation
with Amadeus a while back.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
You're saying I have a choice?

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
Humans can freely choose
what it is that they love.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
Rather, they must choose
is far more accurate.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
You see, Mash?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
It's not you that
creates the world.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
It's the world that creates you.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
Just like the

absolutely certain

that all the decisions you
make are the correct ones.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
I believe in your
choices, Senpai.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
I guess we all have to
make choices, huh?

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's right.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.751 position:50% align:center
I never doubted
the decision I made

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
when I became
humanity's Final Master.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
Yes! That's the reason
I stay by your side.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
I will always be
your Servant!

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
That's my choice, and I
know that it's right!

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
Thank you for that, Mash.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.729 position:50% align:center
If you can believe
in your choice,

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.315 position:50% align:center
I should be able to
believe in mine.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50% align:center
Chances of sending backup
to Uruk look slim.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
Rayshifting to the Age of Gods

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
is the epitome of
recklessness in itself.

Nope!

If I find cause to speak

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
I mean it's only natural.

This is excellent!

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center

Sir!

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center

to Ur and investigate

what is happening
within its boundaries.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center

with your so called
"heroic deeds."

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Seems the king is in
a rather good mood today.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.868 position:50% align:center
He even showed us
the Holy Grail.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
But something about
that grail... is different...

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
I'm surprised you noticed.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
My assumption is that
the king's grail is different

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.960 position:50% align:center
from the ones that
you all collected

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
from the other Singularities.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
I'm awaiting Dr. Roman's
analysis for the details,

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
but I'm certain.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] Does that mean
the Holy Grail that's creating

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
this Singularity
is somewhere else?

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
Possibly, but I don't know
if it's in the hands

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
of the Three Goddess Alliance
or someone elses.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center

It's such a shame
we can't tell Leonidas

on a mission of his own.

received orders,

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center

Let's do our best out there!

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
We encounter more Demonic Beasts

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
the farther we get
from city limits.

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
This thing is called
a "Mushussu."

[RITSUKA, MASH]
Huh?

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center

It's one of the Demonic Beasts

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
called "the Eleven
Offspring of Tiamat."

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center
The Primordial Goddess

Ugallu the giagantic lion,

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center

Oh man. So this is a jungle.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
It's amazing to think that
this is what Earth's climate

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
was like 65 million years ago.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA] The saving grace
is that we're not

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
encountering any Demonic Beasts.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] Yeah sure, but there's
an insane level of Ether!

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center

on par with a Reality Marble!

we've almost made it to Ur.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center

we only have to be

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center

A mysterious purrretty girl!

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center

She's a big dumb idiot!

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
[JAGUAR WARRIOR]
I'm not an idiot!

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
Why is it that when
I meet new people,

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
they always think I'm an idiot?

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
What's that about?!

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
An unidentified
mysterious animal?

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
Wait, it's a UMA?

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.050 position:50% align:center
A real UMA?!

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
You can just call meow

And I am not a tiger,
I'm a jaguar!

That will be on your next test,
so you'd better remember!

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
What in the hell was that?

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center

been a hard journey

to pass through that jungle

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
If the dangers not immediate,
we'll simply go back

send a rescue party!

Not really, I was just
thinking about how

I've never seen a sunset

I heard you had something
to discuss concerning the city.

Yes. I was told that you
didn't need to be rescued.

deny His Majesty's aid.

Our city is safe!

The Demonic Beasts will not
breach the jungle to reach us!

It's the truth!

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
As long as we obey the rules

--Huh?
--That's right.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
We didn't encounter Demonic
Beasts within the jungle.

the people of Ur?

Ah. How lucky for you.

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center

other cities were in crisis,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
you didn't venture out to help
because you were safe?

No, you've got it all wrong!

00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
We would have helped
if we could have. But we...

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
It would violate the rules
set by your Forest Goddess.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] I see.

Ur is not at war,

All Eridu demands is that we
offer one sacrifice a day.

us to satisfy that devil!

your city made?

You wouldn't
judge us so harshly
