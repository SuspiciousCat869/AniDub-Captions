Ishtar is on our side, but that
is not the end of my plan.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
I mean the divine tool that was
used to rip out Tiamat's throat.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.289 position:50% align:center
The Axe of Marduk.

This is the best secret weapon
we have against Gorgon!

He ripped out Tiamat's throat?

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.013 position:50% align:center
If it's true, it might
work against Gorgon,

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
since she has Tiamat's power!

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.892 position:50% align:center
Yes. That axe will be the key

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
to defeating Gorgon
once and for all!

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center

Eridu. The divine right to rule

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
I see, it's in the jungle
to the south, beyond Ur...

The jungle city.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
So, how about it, Ishtar?

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center
Who is the goddess
of the jungle?

It's not a jaguar, is it?

It's not her.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
True she's a Divine Spirit,
but just a secondary one.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center

Yes. To be honest,

if she were one of
the three goddesses,

how we'd deal with her!

Well, I suppose I can tell you.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
The goddess that holds
dominion over the south

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
is the "Winged Snake."

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center

You mean the Toltec Sun God?

That's demiurge caliber!

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
If that's true, she could be
even more powerful than Gorgon!

Attend me, my glorious
Jaguar Underlings!

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
[JAGUAR WARRIORS yell]

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
[JAGUAR WARRIOR] Woo! Check out
these awesome apex predators!

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
Boys and girls, we're not
letting you sleep tonight!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm leaving
the rest to mew!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
[JAGUAR WARRIORS yell]

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN sighs] Well, this is
an unexpected situation.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
To think Quetzalcoatl would come
barging into the city herself...

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Outrageous!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
If she keeps
tearing up the city,

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
that'll ruin moral on the
Demonic Front vicariously!

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
[SIDURI] Sire, the craftsmen
and soldiers have evacuated

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
from the southern market.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
At this rate, the king's
side project will...

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
What side project?

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty, are you
working on making something?

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
No?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
[MASH, RITSUKA]
You totally are!

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH]
Hey, Ishtar! She's your friend!

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
Make yourself useful and
do something about her!

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
She's not my friend!

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
Well, there's no denying
that she's a nuisance.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
Picking fights with humans one
by one like that is ridiculous.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
She said she's coming tomorrow.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
Exactly one hundred
soldiers fell victim.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
And she made off
with the corpses.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
so we can't even bury them.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
Hey, Senpai, what do you...

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
[GILGAMESH] Even if we wanted to
fight, we're no match for her.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
So then, Doctor Roman?
Got any bright ideas?

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
You're really asking me?

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
You guys have Merlin over there!

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Why doesn't he just use
his clairvoyance or whatever

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
to take a peek at
what Quetzalcoatl is doing!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
I would really like to do that.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
she'd feel my presence,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
and I think discretion
would be wise.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
There are many myths that
serve as cautionary tales.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
Goddesses don't like being
peeked on without permission.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she would murder him!

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
She'd use her Authority
to blast the spy's location

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
with her Noble Phantasm.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN] You see? We can't risk
angering a goddess just yet.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm using my
Magical Energy for other things.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--I thought so.

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
I was just saying to Romani
that things seemed a bit off.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that explains some things.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
I've felt like you had
fallen behind, Merlin.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
But you've actually been doing
everything you can, haven't you?

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
I'm glad that you understand.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
So, Romani Archaman,
what do you think we should do?

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
I really hate to say this,
but we need to infiltrate.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.217 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
You mean go to her base?
Bring the fight to her?

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
But where is it?

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
I think I might know
where we can look.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
Likely her home base is a temple
dedicated to her worship.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
She isn't a goddess
affiliated with this land,

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
but we've seen her use
an enormous amount of power

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
in spite of that.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
The only reason for that
I can think of is she must

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
have a temple somewhere nearby.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] The other day, when
Fujimaru went to investigate Ur,

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
there was a strong
Magical Energy response

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
coming from the south.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
You think the temple's there?

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
Indeed.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
Not only that, we assume
it's the city of Eridu,

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
the same one King Gilgamesh
mentioned earlier.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
Yup. The one thing that's
required to truly establish

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
a structure as a temple
is a symbol for the deity.

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
[ANA]
So, if we destroy the symbol

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.887 position:50% align:center
and remove the temple's power,

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
we can diminish
Quetzalcoatl's Divinity.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Exactly. After that,
if we face Quetzalcoatl,

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
there's at least a
small chance of victory.

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
Well then, now we have our plan.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:15.610 position:50% align:center
Fujimaru, it is time
for your next mission!

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
And thus begins
phase two of my plan!

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
Go through the jungle
and head to Eridu!

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
Once there, you will
defeat Quetzalcoatl,

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
and after that,
recover the divine tool

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
from the city of Eridu!

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
The Axe of Marduk!

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mash...

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Senpai...

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
This operation...
Do you think we'll succeed?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
Quetzalcoatl's elegant smile...

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
I can't stop thinking about it!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:50.020 position:50% align:center
And... she killed those people!

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
If her true nature is like that,

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
I don't know if we
can talk with her...

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
We "talk" with her...

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center
Senpai?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
[MERLIN]
Actually, it may be possible

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.240 position:50% align:center
to avoid battle that way.

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
You remember what she said?

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
She'd destroy humanity because
her mother told her to.

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
And that implies she
doesn't actually have

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
any sort of grudge against
humanity of her own.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Do you think that's true?

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
If it is, then who is
the mother she referred to?

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
The mother of Demonic Beasts,

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
the false Tiamat is the
only one that comes to mind.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
Now...

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Good evening.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.477 position:50% align:center
On guard duty again?

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
Here you go. Something to drink?

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
You wanna sit down?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
Sure, I might as well
since I'm here.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
Actually, I came over
to talk abo--

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
Wha?

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
What?

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
I'm not the first girl
in the world to sneeze.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
I was trying to be nice
and tell you something,

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
but you just want to be rude!

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Oh, no. Sorry.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
It's fine, I guess.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
Let me tell you
about Quetzalcoatl.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
Listening?

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.550 position:50% align:center
She is a god of good.

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
The definition of good.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
So that's her true nature?

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
[ISHTAR]
Yes.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
So, think about it.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
That means nothing good
can work on her.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
Which also means the only way
to do damage is with evil.

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
So don't think you can
count on me in a fight with her!

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:22.529 position:50% align:center
That's not very helpful.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
--But...
--What?

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
Never mind. You are
an amazing goddess!

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
Of course I am!

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
Don't you know
you're sitting beside

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
the wisest goddess
in all of Mesopotamia?

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
Yes and yet, somehow
you can be pretty naive

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
when given half the chance.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess, maybe.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
I usually don't stray
outside of my temple,

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center
so all I know of the outside
world is what I've heard.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
I had my role as
soon as I was born,

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
so I didn't have any freedom.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
You're the first person
to sit and talk with me

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
freely like this. I imagine
this is what friends would do.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
Then am I your first friend?

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
Then, thank you. I'm glad.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center

Are you really? Glad, I mean?

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center

so bad together after all!
