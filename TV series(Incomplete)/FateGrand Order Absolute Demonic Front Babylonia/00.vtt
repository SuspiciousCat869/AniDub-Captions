[ROMANI] This is a story
that belongs to you,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
and it belongs to someone else.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center
It is a story of
a certain journey.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
It's a success!
We really did it!

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.431 position:50% align:center

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
[STAFFER 0B] It's too dangerous!
You've gotta get out of here!

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:00.120 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.831 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 0A] Sir, the Second
defensive boundary field

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
has been breached!

[ROMANI gasps]

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
I've got to hurry up.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] It's true.
I couldn't waste any time.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
Because I didn't even have
a single second to lose.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI panting]

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
It smells good!

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
Are you still a fan
of Darjeeling?

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS DIRECTOR]
If it's hot and drinkable,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't mind if
it was just water.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see you
looking so well, Archaman.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
Though, I'm surprised you
didn't proceed to Magecraft.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
My skills being what they are,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
and my knowledge leaving much
to be desired, I'm limited.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
They say when someone's too
humble, it sounds sarcastic.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
I think they may be
on to something.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
So where are you working?

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Well, I didn't like
the vibe anywhere I went.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
So, I have a favor to ask.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
If it's not too much trouble,

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to hire me
to work at your company.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
Thoughts?

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Okay, Romani. You got this.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
Let's get started.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
We are accessing a resource from

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
the history of humanity,
called "Heroic Spirits."

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
They're materialized
using Magical Energy

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50% align:center
and put to work as Servants.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
If a Heroic Spirit is not able
to materialize by itself,

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
we allow it to possess a human
in order to become a Servant.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
That is called a Pseudo-Servant,

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center line:10%
but the experiment
isn't as simple as that.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center line:10%
A human and
a Heroic Spirit fuse,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50% align:center line:10%
becoming a living,
breathing weapon.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
It's a Demi-Servant Project.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
You've been doing this
for ten years?

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS DIRECTOR]
Yes. We have fostered

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
countless units for the project.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
Out of all of the units,

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
she was the closest
to perfection.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] However, the Heroic
Spirit that fused with her

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
refused to assist
us and went silent.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
That girl merely put a burden
on her body for nothing

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
and hasn't manifested
any powers as a Servant.

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS DIRECTOR]
You're wrong.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
We succeeded in
activating the Relic.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
With this as the catalyst,

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
Our Heroic Spirit system
experiments will stabilize.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:10.245 position:50% align:center
Servants are imperative to
the preservation of humanity.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
Even if the Rayshift
experiment were to succeed,

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
it'd be nonsense if we didn't
have any weapons on-site.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50% align:center
But thanks to her sacrifice,

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
we can start work on a more
reliable summoning system.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
So I wouldn't say
her burden was for nothing.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Even so, she's a designer baby.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
Her cells degrade much
quicker to begin with,

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
and it's possible
that rate has accelerated

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
due to the experiment.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
Not necessarily. By fusing
with a Heroic Spirit,

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
she'll maintain her
physical body at her peak.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
There will be no aging
due to cell degradation.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
Now isn't that
something to envy?

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
She doesn't have to be able
to fight, only stay alive.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:52.454 position:50% align:center
I'll have her accompany Team A
just as a catalyst for summons.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
I don't expect any more from
her, and neither should you.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] I want to be assigned
as her primary physician.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--That all right with you?

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
Answer this question first:
is this because of sympathy?

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
It's not. I am a physician.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
I'll simply be
checking her health.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
Her condition is delicate.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
She won't last two years in
anyone else's care but mine.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
[sighs] All right.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
Senpai?

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Nope, I got posted here
at Chaldea five years ago,

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center
so I suppose technically
you would be my Senpai.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet ya.
My name's Romani Archaman.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
From now on, I'll be
your primary physician.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
You can just call me Roman
if you feel like it.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
Huh, no chair...

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
"Doctor Roman."
Sounds better, doesn't it?

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Roman... "A wishful observation

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
that tomorrow has
many possibilities."

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
That's what that
word means, correct?

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
Wow, kid. You're still
only ten years old.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
What an impressive Senpai!

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
Senpais teach, Kouhais learn.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.249 position:50% align:center
That is their relationship.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
But I haven't taught you
anything at all.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
Sheba was responsible for
inputting all of my knowledge.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
So, in this instance,
Sheba's the Senpai.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I can't
argue with logic like that.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Yes. That is the
definition of "Senpai" for me.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
You don't say?

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:42.188 position:50% align:center
Well my interpretation
differs slightly from yours.

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Hm?

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] The way I see it,
I think if there's

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
anyone out there that you could
possibly call your "Senpai,"

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
they would have to be somebody
who was very naturally human.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
[MASH] What do you mean by
"very naturally human"?

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
They'd express sadness,
and anger, and joy.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
And they would be
true to themselves,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.421 position:50% align:center
even in the midst of
other's emotions.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
Someone like that.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
Communication...

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
So that would be a Senpai
who teaches how to live?

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
That's right.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
Also they'd be someone who can
see what's beyond all of that.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
So there's more?

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Yep.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
They would be a philanthropist,
friendly, compassionate,

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
and they'd act for
someone else's sake

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
rather than their own,
for no reason.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
It's a strong virtue.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
And one that I think
is uniquely human.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
You mean they would
be altruistic,

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
rather than egotistic.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a disadvantage?

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
It goes against animal instinct.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
Yes it does.
It's what humans do.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
They're creatures that
think about their actions.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center
And they must make very
complicated decisions.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
But that's all
the more reason

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
why someone with the will to
put themselves at a loss

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
for the sake of others
is of such great interest.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Oh...

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.769 position:50% align:center
Yes, I see.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
I suppose I will add
these new conditions

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
to my meaning of Senpai.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Do you not
consider yourself a Senpai?

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
Mm.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
I'm still learning,
nothing more than a fledgling.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Now, as part of
becoming your primary physician,

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
there's something important
I've got to discuss with you.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
It's about your life span.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
Since you are a designer baby,
your cells degrade quickly.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
Even if you were to properly
keep yourself healthy,

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
you'll live to 18 at most.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
First of all, do you understand
what I'm telling you?

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Yes. All creatures
have limited life spans.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
As for me, I'll remain
functional as long as I'm able.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.951 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be more
complicated than I thought.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
Trying to maintain
my health, I assume?

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh... Mm-hmm,
well, that, too.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
But that all depends on
how much effort I put in.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna keep you in top form.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
The problem is...

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
Actually, never mind that.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
So once again,
glad we met... Mash.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
[DA VINCI]
Utterly ridiculous!

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay, calm down...
Heroic Spirit Number Three.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
I mean, Leonardo da Vinci.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
Oh, but I am calm.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.405 position:50% align:center
I'm merely speechless
at all this stupidity.

00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
Protecting the
future of humanity?

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
With so little to work with?

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
Demi-Servant
experiments to boot?

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
Inefficient and inhumane.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
Not one shred of beauty
to be found here!

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
If you had summoned
me much earlier,

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have let mediocre men

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
perform such an
imbecilic act of folly.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
I totally understand
how you feel.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
Something like this isn't just.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
Every time I look at her,
I remember the truth.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
What we're doing's a mistake.
I refuse to forget that.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
You, sir, are a very
special kind of idiot.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
Oh, Romani...

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
Do you know how tough
this path will be...

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] You don't happen
to know any Magecraft

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
that can reveal the sky,
do you, Professor Leff?

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Hmm?

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
Why the sudden curiosity?

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
I'll indulge you.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
I suppose my answer would be:

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
"There is one,
but it's meaningless."

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
Instead of making the
skies of Chaldea sunny,

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
it would be cheaper to
head out to Antarctica.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
The sky there is
more beautiful anyway.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI sighs] I see.
Well, I guess that's that.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
But why are you asking
something like this?

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
Are you, a doctor,
getting homesick?

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
No way.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
Just wondering...

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
Is it Mash?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Yeah.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
I see. That's rather intriguing.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
I was invited here to Chaldea
as a Mage in order to

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
create the Near-Future
Observation Lens: Sheba.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
During that process,
I spent time tutoring Mash.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
It was only for Magecraft,

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
but I'm sure I've spent
more time with her than you.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
She's been raised to be as
innocent and good-natured

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
as possible in both mind and
body so that she'll be able to

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
assimilate any
Heroic Spirit in due time.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Indeed, Mash's mental
activity is very stable.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
She shows no sway
in her emotions

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
because her logic is perfect.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
But there's nothing we can do

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
about the pain
she feels physically.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
The mandatory periodic
checkups cause her distress.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
Distress will turn into
terror, and soon, hatred.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
A heart that's been
continually tortured as such

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
shouldn't stay innocent.

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
But she has...

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
Somehow kept her innocence?

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
She doesn't compare her lot in
life to that of others, you see?

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.390 position:50% align:center
That's why she never harbors
any envy or hate for anyone.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
For her, every single
human she meets

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
is a "Senpai of life,"
in a sense.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
She admires every person who is

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
living their life
to the fullest.

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
No matter how much pain or
injustice she's put under,

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
Mash would only try to learn
about the good parts of humans.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:28.034 position:50% align:center
She said she liked the vibe
when someone was smiling,

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
and that it made her happy
seeing them like that.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Come to think of it,

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
the same thing can be
said for all of us.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
It's not unusual.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
It's just the way
of things, Romani.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
That said, isn't it intriguing?

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:46.011 position:50% align:center
How she'll mature
is a complete mystery.

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
It's something
no one can predict.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
"Innocent" may sound
like good thing,

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
but it also means she's
immature and naive.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center
Even after the
ugliness of humanity

00:14:55.937 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
and the dark side of history,
will she still admire mankind?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
That's the one thing
about her that worries me.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS DIRECTOR]
What is it that you desire?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS DIRECTOR gasps]

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's you.
You're five minutes late.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
It's not like you at a--

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
You want me to
"Stop Chaldeas," huh?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
Your request is
rather difficult.

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
The preservation of humanity,
or my own life.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
Which will I prioritize?

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
It goes without saying.

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! The flame of Chaldeas!

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
That day came all too soon.

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
"Humanity will cease
to exist as of 2016."

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
After finding the cause of
such abnormal phenomena,

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
Chaldeas investigated
all information

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
for the past 2,000 years.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
And so, it found
Spatial Singularity F...

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center
In 2004 AD, in a city in Japan,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
it located an
unobservable realm,

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:38.415 position:50% align:center
a foreign substance that
didn't exist up to 2015.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
Chaldea assumed
this was the cause

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
of the humanity's extinction,

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
proposed the Rayshift
experiment to the UN,

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
and the project was passed.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
Rayshift is the conversion
of humans to spiritrons

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
and transporting them to the
past to intervene in matters.

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
To be blunt,
it's time travel to the past.

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
And Mash was selected
to be in Team A,

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
in charge of the first mission.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
In any case, the director
here really hates me.

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
People slack off if
I'm on-site, she says.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
Well, nothing to do about that.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center
I may not look it,
but I'm working hard.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
[RITSUKA]
Excuse me.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI]
Er, sorry! It's occupied--

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
W-Wait a second! Who are you?

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
[MASH] I remember back then,
I never questioned anything.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
The pain they inflicted,
my limited life span,

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center line:10%
my own way of existence.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.522 position:50% align:center
You're the first one to
enter my room to examine me.

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
Oh, no kidding?

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
If you all can communicate
emotions through glass walls,

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
Chaldea's more
advanced than I thought.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
I'm still only a fledgling,
so I can't have

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
a proper conversation
unless I speak face to face.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
I want you to share with me
everything you think and feel.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
I can get to know you better
if we're in the same room,

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
not to mention,
you may feel warmer.

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
Summon Case Number Two...

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
Well, no. That doesn't fit.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.178 position:50% align:center
Hello there.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you,
"Mash Kyrielight."

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
Uh... H-Hello there.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, Doctor Romani.

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
[MASH] If you were to
say a reaction like this

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
is what you'd expect
from a human,

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
this moment may have been

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
my very first time
reacting like one.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mash, good morning.
How you feelin' today?

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Since that day,
the Doctor spent a lot of time

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
having conversations with me.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
For me, anything and everything
was a completely new experience.

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
We talked about what I felt,
what I thought, what I liked,

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
what was dear to me,
and what I felt was warm.

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
He sometimes told me amusing
tales of what happened that day.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
And I sometimes had to
listen to him complain.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
Gradually, I became
more and more drawn to

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
the temperature of
the outside world.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Mash. I have
some really good news for ya.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
Your vitals have been
quite excellent recently.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
And your brain waves
have all been stable,

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
so if this keeps up, you won't
need to stay in here anymore.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
When that happens,
you'll officially be

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
a full-fledged
researcher in Chaldea.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Romani.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
I have an idea!
When the time comes,

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
let me treat you to
something to celebrate!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
Can you think of anything
that you would want?

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
Like some sweets?
A book, or toy?

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
Isn't there anything you want?

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is,
I'll get it if I can.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'd like
to go outside.

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Going outside and
looking up at the clear sky...

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
That was the one
and only thing I desired

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
that I could think of.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
[ROMANI] Unfortunately,
Chaldea is on a wintery mountain

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
6,000 meters above sea level.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
All you can see outside
is a blizzard.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
But very rarely,
the skies will clear up,

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
and you'll see a
beautiful starry sky.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that someday,

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
you'll have a chance
to see it as well.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou, fou!

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Fou...?

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Recently,
this strange little creature

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
started snuggling up next to me.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
What about you, Fou? Have you
ever seen a starry sky?

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou?

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Looks like there are
stormy skies again today.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
[FOU]
Fou?

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
[MASH gasps]
Fou?

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute! Please wait!

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
[MASH] The first thing
I wished for was the sky.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
[FLAUROS] Our King
has taken pity on the humans

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
and declared he would release
them from the premise of death.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
But I don't know...

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.887 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Mash?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
Do you think
humans truly contain

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
that much value within them?

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.604 position:50% align:center
[AMADEUS]
What will you come to love?

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
What will you come to detest?

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
What do you feel is precious?

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:59.569 position:50% align:center
And what will you
perceive as evil?

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
Those are choices
you must make for yourself.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.534 position:50% align:center
[AMADEUS]
We learn about many things

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50% align:center
and encounter many landscapes.

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:12.874 position:50% align:center
That is how your life
becomes substantial.

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:16.878 position:50% align:center
You see? It's not that
you create the world.

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.880 position:50% align:center
The world creates you.

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.758 position:50% align:center
[NERO] An eternal empire
continues to exist.

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.510 position:50% align:center
Even though Emperors change,

00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:24.594 position:50% align:center
countries change,

00:22:24.678 --> 00:22:26.596 position:50% align:center
and names change.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.057 position:50% align:center
That is the law of
human prosperity.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.435 position:50% align:center
That is the family tree
of lives called "humanity."

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.604 position:50% align:center
[DRAKE] Wrongdoers do
good deeds at times,

00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:37.899 position:50% align:center
and good men do
evil deeds at times.

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:41.653 position:50% align:center
That's how humans are.
That's how we all are!

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:45.782 position:50% align:center
That's how you know there's
always some hope for everyone!

00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:47.826 position:50% align:center
[SOLOMON]
Why do you fight,

00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:50.245 position:50% align:center
knowing that life
will eventually end?

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
Knowing that life is
already spent and gone,

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:56.418 position:50% align:center
why do you cling to it,
trying to continue to live?

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.795 position:50% align:center
Even though you realize
that in your future,

00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:02.507 position:50% align:center
there is not one shred of
salvation waiting for you.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.717 position:50% align:center
[NIGHTINGALE]
Ms. Mash...

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.594 position:50% align:center
A dream and a desire
are different things.

00:23:06.678 --> 00:23:08.596 position:50% align:center
Have a long,
hard look at reality

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.390 position:50% align:center
and take stock of the odds.

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:12.434 position:50% align:center
Fighting with everything
they've got to the end

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:15.437 position:50% align:center
is how the path of
the wisher is paved.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.063 position:50% align:center
My advice is this:

00:23:17.147 --> 00:23:20.900 position:50% align:center
you should live your life for
your own sake from here on out.

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.448 position:50% align:center
[SANZANG] There's no logic
behind my actions.

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:30.035 position:50% align:center
I do things how I want
to do them. No, that's not it.

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.580 position:50% align:center
I hold my head high and do
what I believe must be done.

00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:36.791 position:50% align:center
[SANZANG]
You are the same as me.

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:38.460 position:50% align:center
I just know it.

00:23:39.377 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
[MASH] The first thing
I wished for was the sky.

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:44.966 position:50% align:center
But it was only a dream
where I waited at the windowsill

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.260 position:50% align:center
during an endless blizzard.

00:23:48.094 --> 00:23:50.930 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Now things are different.

00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:54.100 position:50% align:center
I experienced so much
and met so many people.

00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:58.021 position:50% align:center
I felt the vastness of the world
and the warmth of people.

00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.901 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:05.111 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Yes, that's right!

00:24:05.195 --> 00:24:07.405 position:50% align:center
I feel it!

00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:10.075 position:50% align:center
Who I am is taking shape.

00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:11.618 position:50% align:center
My true desire...

00:24:11.701 --> 00:24:13.411 position:50% align:center
What I dream about...

00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:17.082 position:50% align:center
The shape of my heart has
been created on this journey.

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:21.503 position:50% align:center
[MASH] I feel as though
I'm going to come to life.

00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:25.298 position:50% align:center
And then, it will be
my turn to show the world

00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:27.717 position:50% align:center
exactly who I've become!

00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:49.364 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Please...
may I take... your hand?

00:24:59.874 --> 00:25:04.504 position:50% align:center
[MASH]
Thank you so much, Senpai.

00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:55.031 position:50% align:center
[ringing]

00:26:56.116 --> 00:26:58.034 position:50% align:center
[MASH] Today, we're
executing our Rayshift

00:26:58.118 --> 00:27:00.328 position:50% align:center
to the Seventh Singularity.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.626 position:50% align:center
[MASH] And so... I will be
embarking on another journey!
