[laughing]

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:15.224
Tarao! You want a tomato?

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:16.725
-Oh, thanks, Kuku.
-[chuckles]

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.143
[children laughing]

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:21.188
-Let's go then! [laughs]
-[laughs] Okay. Just hold on a sec.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.731
[child] No way, slowpoke.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.529
Mimihime?

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:33.116
Don't space out too long up here.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.077
You're gonna be late for class.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.161
[sighs]

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.248
We're going to have a test today.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.959
What? There's nothing
on the schedule about that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.127
I know, but we are.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.587
<i>We have a test today.</i>

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:46.505
[all] Huh?

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.756
-You never said.
-Are you serious?

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.258
I'd like to object.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.176
Aren't you supposed to
give us time to study?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.887
Relax,
you probably would have failed anyway.

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.222
-Hey!
-[chuckles]

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.015
[robot teacher] <i>All right. Settle down.</i>

00:00:57.099 --> 00:01:01.561
<i>As long as you've been paying attention</i>
<i>in class, you'll be just fine.</i>

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:04.481
-<i>There are only ten questions.</i>
-Hmm…

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.024
[Kuku] Hmm.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.612
If it's supposed to be a fish,
why does it have arms?

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.197
Ah.

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.449
Well, they're to help it
catch other fish, of course.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.285
[Kuku] Have you seen that before?

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.370
[chuckles] Oh, no, I just made it up!

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.538
[Kuku] Oh.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.915
I like it.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm flattered.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.795
[Kuku] You always draw such weird stuff.
But this one is super funny.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:29.172
Can I have it to show the director?

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.550
-As soon as I'm done.
-[Kuku] Okay.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.261
[robot teacher] <i>Fifteen minutes remaining.</i>

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.555
[grunts] Come on.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.017
-[electronic shutdown]
-[grunts]

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.686
[sighs]

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:50.902
Outside…

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:52.654
the outside?

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.323
[rocks scattering]

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.676
[crows cawing]

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.022
Hey, you want to do
some treasure hunting today?

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.608
Hmm. Yeah, I could do that.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.361
This neighborhood
doesn't seem too trashed.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:35.197
We just gotta find houses
that haven't been broken into.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.324
Great! Then what are we waiting for?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.079
[scavenger] It's still locked.
That's a good sign.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.373
Uh, wait, Maru?

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.458
Hey, Maru! Where are ya?

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.753
Over here, Sis! I found us a way in!

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.839
[chuckles] Wonder how a place like this
was left alone for so long.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:55.133
Even the windows are barely broken.

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.927
[glass shatters]

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.848
Whoa, it's a total wreck in here.

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:05.394
Well, let's have ourselves a look around.

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:06.937
[Maru grunts]

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:10.941
[chuckles] Oh, brand-new toothbrush.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.234
[Maru shouts] Sis!

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.611
-[rustling]
-Got some unopened toilet paper here!

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:18.031
Seriously? Nice! Toss me one, I'm dying.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.534
Hmm. Okay.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.953
[grunts]

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.705
[sighs]

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:28.041
Working or not, it kind of rules
to use a normal toilet again.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:31.795
-Hey! Don't look in here! Keep walking.
-Why wouldn't you just shut the door?

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.423
-There is no door, idiot.
-[sighs]

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.968
[stairs creak]

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.720
[sighs] Take a look at the roof.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.473
No wonder this place is such a dump.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.727
-[Maru] I'm so hungry.
-[Sis] Yeah, but don't talk about it.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.188
If you talk about it,
I have to think about it.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:51.356
Oh…

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.692
I'm just saying…

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.411
Looks like they starved.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.706
A lot of people who survived the Collapse
died of starvation.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.959
So if they passed away in their own home,

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.503
I don't think we're gonna
find any food here.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.506
Come on. We should go.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.008
[Maru] Mm-hmm.

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:27.559
Sis, did you look around very much?
This place is freaking fancy, dude.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.771
[Sis] Yeah, the people who lived here
must've been super rich.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:35.233
Whoa, you finally opened the canned food?
Nice.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.819
Well, we didn't exactly
find anything new to eat.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.490
Oh, hey.
Would you go find a couple plates?

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.574
Can do.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.159
Oh, I'm so excited. [chuckles]

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.661
Huh.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.997
What's all this green stuff?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.542
Just some weeds I found growing
around here.They looked edible.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.296
Figured the extra fiber
would help us fill up a bit more.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.547
[gasps]

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.091
[crunch]

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.093
[gasps, splutters]

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.971
-[Maru] It's so bitter.
-[Sis] Make it stop. Spit it out!

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.765
[coughing, gagging]

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:10.393
Man, that crap stunk out the whole dish.
Now what do we do?

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.895
I'm sorry.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.855
That was the only canned food we had.

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.982
[Sis] I said I'm sorry!

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:19.611
[raindrops pattering]

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.332
Is that guy your boyfriend or something?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.000
What are you doing awake?

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.753
[Maru] Nothing.
I just take forever to fall asleep.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.797
You always zonk out way before I do.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.633
Wow, I suck as a bodyguard then.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:42.926
Sorry about that.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.012
You know you can quit
and go home if you want, right?

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:47.889
I'll be fine on my own.

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:49.015
[chuckles]

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:54.145
This guy is an old friend,
and the other is a doctor I'm looking for.

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.858
I thought we might run into them
or find someone who knows them.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.901
Two birds with one stone and all that.

00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.904
-So I'm good to keep going for a while.
-[sighs]

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:06.992
Sleep. I'm not just gonna take off
in the middle of the night, okay?

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.618
See you in the morning.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.417
[thunderclap]

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.751
[wind whistling]

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.338
[crow screeches]

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:27.554
HASSOU INN

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:38.668
[footsteps approaching]

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.087
[Sis] All right,
where do you want to go today?

00:06:42.213 --> 00:06:45.216
[Maru] Beats me.
It's not like we have a lead or anything.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.802
But I am sick of
wandering around aimlessly.

00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:50.972
[chuckles]
Okay, then let's find some people.

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:53.141
Look for a place that might be inhabited.

00:06:53.683 --> 00:06:55.101
[Maru] Somewhere inhabited…

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:57.187
Uh, maybe somewhere with farmland,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.273
or we can hit up some train stations
as long as we're still in the city.

00:07:00.356 --> 00:07:01.983
[Sis] Yeah, that sounds promising.

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:04.235
Let's walk down the tracks for a bit.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.154
Sound good? Whatcha think?

00:07:06.237 --> 00:07:09.282
Let's go! But I'll need to find
some new shoes out there.

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:11.910
[grunts]
We'll keep an eye out for a store.

00:07:11.993 --> 00:07:15.163
[Maru] But before that,
I'm desperate for some tasty food.

00:07:15.246 --> 00:07:18.625
What does that mean? If you're still mad
at me from yesterday, just say it.

00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:19.834
Huh?

00:07:19.918 --> 00:07:21.002
Wait, no.

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:23.046
I wasn't thinking about that at all.

00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:25.048
Well, maybe you should've been.

00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:26.925
Guys like you say dumb stuff by mistake

00:07:27.008 --> 00:07:29.427
because you don't think
before you open your big mouths.

00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:30.512
-[grunts]
-[gulps]

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:32.263
[thug snickers]

00:07:32.847 --> 00:07:34.140
[grunts]

00:07:34.682 --> 00:07:35.892
Would you look at that?

00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:39.562
-Oh, I am. And I like what I see.
-What are you ladies doing?

00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:41.940
Well, I'm being a man.

00:07:42.023 --> 00:07:44.818
[clicks tongue, sighs]
Great, the little blond brat's a guy.

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:47.570
-I am too, actually.
-You liar!

00:07:47.654 --> 00:07:51.074
Now why don't you
lay down that heavy load, little lady?

00:07:51.157 --> 00:07:53.201
Come let Big Papa take you to heaven.

00:07:53.868 --> 00:07:55.161
-[Sis sighs]
-[bag thuds]

00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.413
Cool, so you're just a gang of pervs.

00:07:57.497 --> 00:07:58.957
-[hammer cocks]
-That's a real shame.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.958
[gasps]

00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:03.002
We're almost out of bullets.
Don't waste it on them.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:05.797
Hey, you guys should scram
if you want to live.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.675
So a human life
is worth less than a couple bullets.

00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:11.803
Better not take our chances
with a couple of power-hungry punks

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:13.513
from the lawless generation.

00:08:13.596 --> 00:08:15.723
Who knows what they're capable of.

00:08:17.183 --> 00:08:19.686
Not like you could hit us anyway,
stupid girl!

00:08:20.186 --> 00:08:21.229
[grunts]

00:08:21.312 --> 00:08:22.814
Hmm.

00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:25.608
Hey! Wait a second.
Is that even a real gun?

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:27.277
[sighs]

00:08:29.362 --> 00:08:32.490
Oh, what's this now?
Whatcha dropping, dollface?

00:08:32.574 --> 00:08:35.493
I knew I'd never seen a gun
shaped like that before.

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:37.912
She's trying to bluff us
with a children's toy.

00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:40.456
[scoffs]

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:42.417
Time to go.

00:08:43.084 --> 00:08:46.713
Not so fast! My boys
won't let you get away that easily.

00:08:46.796 --> 00:08:47.797

[groaning]

00:09:21.664 --> 00:09:22.707
[Sis] Hi.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.127
One of you said something
about taking me to heaven, right?

00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:27.879
He was just joking.

00:09:27.962 --> 00:09:29.714
-[hammer cocks]
-[whimpers]

00:09:29.797 --> 00:09:32.133
We just so happen to be
looking for heaven.

00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:33.885
So lead the way.

00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:39.516
Wow, awfully big place you got here
for just the five of you.

00:09:40.183 --> 00:09:43.436
Whatcha think?
Anything around here catch your attention?

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.396
Hmm, not really.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.400
[Sis] Yeah,
this is about as anti-heaven as it gets.

00:09:50.902 --> 00:09:52.904
[chuckles] Whoa! Holy crap!

00:09:52.987 --> 00:09:54.739
You guys have a generator here?

00:09:54.822 --> 00:09:57.200
Pretty cool. Can I charge this?

00:09:57.283 --> 00:09:59.827
Why would I let you
do a thing like that? [whimpers]

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.414
I don't think you grasp
the reality of your situation, pal.

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:06.834
We may have come out on top,
but you dorks still tried to ambush us.

00:10:07.418 --> 00:10:10.630
I could kill you right now
and it would be totally justified.

00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:14.676
We'll take off as soon as
the battery is full, okay?

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:16.928
Please.

00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:18.263
[groans]

00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:21.599
[groans]

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:24.727
So, hey, as long as we're hanging around,

00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.522
any of you guys heard of
a place called "Heaven"?

00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:29.941
At this point, anywhere
with "heaven" in the name,

00:10:30.024 --> 00:10:32.944
or even just a place
you think feels "like heaven" will do.

00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:34.237
What do you think?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.156
Everything remotely close to heaven
got wiped out years ago.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.659
Yeah, I'm aware of that. Thank you.

00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:41.869
That's why I made the question simpler.

00:10:41.953 --> 00:10:44.789
Well, do you guys like tomatoes?

00:10:44.872 --> 00:10:46.708
Hey, back already?

00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:48.710
Why did you ask? You bring me some?

00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:51.004
Nope, but if you like 'em,

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:54.382
then I've heard of a place out in
the country you might consider heavenly.

00:10:54.465 --> 00:10:57.468
-You like tomatoes, don't you?
-Love 'em.

00:10:58.219 --> 00:10:59.679
Cool, give us the deets.

00:11:03.057 --> 00:11:04.350
[thug] Here.

00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:06.769
Ah! Thank you so much!

00:11:06.853 --> 00:11:09.397
What's the battery for exactly?

00:11:11.441 --> 00:11:12.442
Well, for my gun.

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:14.652
[all] You-- You brat!

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:18.406
Then you've been controlling us this whole
time with a gun that doesn't shoot?

00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:21.701
I didn't even know if it was gonna fire
out in the street earlier.

00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:22.910
I just got lucky.

00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:25.371
-This guy knows.
-[thugs groan]

00:11:25.455 --> 00:11:28.541
Morons!
I hope you both get eaten by a bear.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:30.376
Learn to respect your elders!

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.628
[thugs whimper, shout]

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.713
[chuckles]

00:11:33.796 --> 00:11:35.923
[laughing]

00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:40.637
Phew, that was close.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.598
[sighs] Those old idiots
were never any real danger.

00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:46.517
But we got this thing charged.

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:49.437
I feel way better walking around
with four shots in the tank.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.565
Yeah, I wouldn't count too hard
on that fourth shot if I were you.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:54.734
That thing misfires a lot.

00:11:55.693 --> 00:11:58.905
Fair enough. Now off to "Tomato Heaven."

00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:00.990
[both laugh]

00:12:01.074 --> 00:12:03.534
[Maru] <i>"Tomato Heaven"? So dumb.</i>

00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:09.123
[student] I don't feel like that's the
best way to hold an exam. And the teacher…

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:12.168
Mimihime, how did you know
there was gonna be a test?

00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.630
I'm not really sure.
It just kind of felt that way, I guess.

00:12:16.714 --> 00:12:19.634
But I know one thing
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

00:12:21.552 --> 00:12:24.013
Even if you do know a test is on the way,

00:12:24.097 --> 00:12:26.391
that doesn't mean
you'll know all the answers.

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:27.642
[student sighs]

00:12:27.725 --> 00:12:31.688
Well, now that we're done with class,
any of you guys want to go play ball?

00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:32.772
Huh?

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:35.983
Eh, I want to keep working on this.

00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:37.985
Anzu?

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:39.112
No, I'm out too.

00:12:39.696 --> 00:12:42.198
Not like I can ever
win against you anyway.

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:44.117
What about you?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.994
Sorry, we have
something important to discuss. Right?

00:12:47.078 --> 00:12:48.079
[students grunt, laugh]

00:12:50.832 --> 00:12:54.460
All right then.
Guess I'll get Kona to come out and play.

00:12:56.003 --> 00:12:57.463
[all gasp]

00:12:59.757 --> 00:13:02.677
Those reflexes. How is that possible?

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.237
Kona!

00:13:08.994 --> 00:13:12.623
[Mimihime] You said something about
the outside during the test, right?

00:13:13.249 --> 00:13:15.334
[student] Ah, no, that was…

00:13:17.503 --> 00:13:20.005
[Mimihime] What do you think
the outside world is like?

00:13:21.173 --> 00:13:22.258
I don't know.

00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:24.009
[grunts]

00:13:24.093 --> 00:13:25.719
But I guess I like all the green.

00:13:26.595 --> 00:13:27.972
[Mimihime] Not here.

00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:29.849
I mean outside this wall.

00:13:29.932 --> 00:13:33.310
Oh! I didn't think
there was another outside.

00:13:33.394 --> 00:13:35.020
Isn't it just nothing?

00:13:35.104 --> 00:13:36.605
There's gotta be something.

00:13:37.314 --> 00:13:40.025
At least I've always had
this weird feeling that there is.

00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:44.613
And lately, I've been able to
picture it way more clearly.

00:13:46.282 --> 00:13:50.202
[Mimihime] <i>Whenever I think about how much</i>
<i>I want to go out beyond the wall,</i>

00:13:50.286 --> 00:13:54.373
<i>two people from the other side</i>
<i>I've never met before come to help me.</i>

00:13:54.456 --> 00:13:55.624
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE
OF THE OUTSIDE?

00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:59.336
<i>And one of those people</i>
<i>looks exactly like you.</i>

00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:05.801
[footsteps]

00:14:07.261 --> 00:14:08.721
[student] <i>Outside my room…</i>

00:14:09.597 --> 00:14:10.973
<i>outside the school…</i>

00:14:13.434 --> 00:14:17.104
W-What's outside, outside?

00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:20.399
[stranger] Tokio?

00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:23.068
[Tokio] Madame Director.

00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:26.071
If you can't sleep,
I can administer a sedative.

00:14:26.655 --> 00:14:28.407
No, thank you. Um…

00:14:29.992 --> 00:14:32.912
Is there an outside, like,
beyond this one?

00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:34.413
[grunts]

00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:37.166
Goodness,
did you think of that yourself, dear?

00:14:37.249 --> 00:14:38.709
[Tokio] Mimihime did.

00:14:38.792 --> 00:14:42.379
My, that child's intuition
is awfully sharp, isn't it?

00:14:42.463 --> 00:14:43.672
[aide] Director.

00:14:43.756 --> 00:14:47.176
[Director groans] Don't fret.
They all have to learn one day.

00:14:47.676 --> 00:14:49.845
-Tokio.
-[grunts]

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.350
As a matter of fact, there is.

00:14:56.227 --> 00:14:57.228
[Sis] Hey, Maru,

00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:02.149
it may surprise you to hear this,
coming from your bodyguard, but--

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:05.402
[Maru] I don't think anything you say
would surprise me at this point.

00:15:08.197 --> 00:15:09.615
I can't walk anymore.

00:15:09.698 --> 00:15:11.033
You what?

00:15:11.116 --> 00:15:13.994
[Sis] Don't give me that.
We've been sleeping outdoors,

00:15:14.078 --> 00:15:18.123
climbing entire mountains,
there's nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep.

00:15:18.207 --> 00:15:19.458
I'm at my limit.

00:15:20.251 --> 00:15:22.670
All that talk of there being shops
and food and people

00:15:22.753 --> 00:15:24.880
on every corner before the Collapse…

00:15:24.964 --> 00:15:26.924
Tell me that wasn't a lie!

00:15:27.007 --> 00:15:29.969
Well it's not gonna be true
while we're in the country.

00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:31.553
You really are a city girl, huh?

00:15:31.637 --> 00:15:34.640
Bet your ass I am.
Tokyo through and through.

00:15:34.723 --> 00:15:36.016
-[thud]
-Ah!

00:15:36.642 --> 00:15:38.852
Come on,
let's go find a decent spot to sleep.

00:15:39.353 --> 00:15:41.981
[groans]
Where do you get all that energy from?

00:15:42.064 --> 00:15:43.107
Is it your youth?

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.192
Shut up. We're basically the same age.

00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:47.569
[Sis] You're 15, right?

00:15:47.653 --> 00:15:49.613
[Maru] I think so. You?

00:15:49.697 --> 00:15:53.158
[Sis] I'm 18. Uh, wait, no. I'm 20.

00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:55.703
[Maru] What's with the two-year gap?

00:15:55.786 --> 00:15:57.913
[Sis] I'm not good with numbers, okay?

00:15:59.206 --> 00:16:00.624
[chickens clucking]

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:03.335
[Sis] No freaking way.

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:05.337
[both gasp]

00:16:06.046 --> 00:16:07.798
Is this place open?

00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:09.591
[inn owner] We are, yes.

00:16:11.677 --> 00:16:14.638
[inn owner] Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

00:16:14.722 --> 00:16:16.348
All right, that'll do it.

00:16:16.432 --> 00:16:19.685
Are you sure that's enough for two?
It's so cheap.

00:16:19.768 --> 00:16:20.894
I-- I feel bad.

00:16:20.978 --> 00:16:23.105
Here, take these too.

00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:25.774
[gasps] Oh, my goodness.

00:16:25.858 --> 00:16:28.694
Brand new double-A's. Thanks so much.

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:31.947
You have a guest book.
Can I take a look at it?

00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:33.365
Go for it.

00:16:33.449 --> 00:16:36.493
Wow!
You can't get batteries like this anymore!

00:16:36.577 --> 00:16:38.370
Especially all the way out here.

00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:41.415
Not in here.

00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:44.626
Have either of these guys ever come by?

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:49.173
Ooh, he's handsome.
If he had, I'd remember.

00:16:49.256 --> 00:16:50.966
What's his name?

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.426
[Sis] Robin Inazaki.

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:55.596
Hmm. Doesn't ring a bell.

00:16:56.221 --> 00:16:58.390
What about the older one with the scar?

00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:02.061
You know what? I don't know.

00:17:02.144 --> 00:17:05.939
Everyone just called him "Doctor"
or "Doc" or "Sir."

00:17:06.023 --> 00:17:07.733
[inn owner] Ah, I see.

00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:09.693
Oh, wait.

00:17:09.777 --> 00:17:13.489
Uh, before I forget, have you
ever heard of a place called "Heaven"?

00:17:14.073 --> 00:17:15.115
Hmm.

00:17:15.657 --> 00:17:18.410
Well, that's how
everyone describes this place.

00:17:19.453 --> 00:17:22.581
This is heaven!

00:17:40.766 --> 00:17:42.017
-Kiruko.
-[gasps]

00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:44.228
[Kiriko grunts] Hi! Yup, hi. I'm good.

00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:46.188
[grunts] Hey! Uh…

00:17:46.772 --> 00:17:49.483
Th-the mirror! There's a huge crack
in the mirror over here.

00:17:49.566 --> 00:17:51.110
I was just looking at it.

00:17:51.193 --> 00:17:52.194
Oh.

00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:54.988
I just wanted to let you know
the shower doesn't work,

00:17:55.072 --> 00:17:57.157
but you can use the hot bath water.

00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:58.701
Soap and shampoo are outside.

00:17:58.784 --> 00:18:01.578
Feel free to use whatever you like.
We have a pretty wide variety.

00:18:01.662 --> 00:18:04.415
The one's on the left-hand side
are all shampoo.

00:18:05.249 --> 00:18:07.209
[water running]

00:18:07.292 --> 00:18:08.293
[Kiruko] Dang.

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:15.676
We don't have any power reserves here,

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:18.345
so you'll need to use that
while the sun is up.

00:18:18.429 --> 00:18:19.513
Okay.

00:18:19.596 --> 00:18:21.265
[hair dryer blowing]

00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:29.982
Ma'am,

00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:33.527
that case in the corner,
do you keep a gun in there?

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.281
Ah, yes. There's a monster
that prowls this area at night.

00:18:37.865 --> 00:18:39.491
Stay inside and you'll be fine.

00:18:40.284 --> 00:18:41.702
-Hey, do you think it's…
-What?

00:18:41.785 --> 00:18:43.454
-The Hiruko!
-You mean a "Man-eater"?

00:18:45.372 --> 00:18:47.791
People call them all kinds of
different things,

00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:52.546
but they're, like, these big, freaky,
confusing monsters that eat people.

00:18:52.629 --> 00:18:54.006
-Is that it?
-[sighs]

00:18:55.257 --> 00:18:58.343
If you want, we could kill it for you.

00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:01.597
That's not--

00:19:02.556 --> 00:19:04.057
Guns have no effect on it.

00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:05.184
[Kiruko] Bullets don't.

00:19:05.267 --> 00:19:07.853
But my Kiru-Beam works on them just fine.
Ask this one.

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:09.021
Your Kiru-Beam?

00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:10.189
[Kiruko] What?

00:19:10.272 --> 00:19:11.648
[Maru] Kiru-Beam…

00:19:11.732 --> 00:19:14.276
As in a beam that you, Kiruko, can use?

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:16.487
[Kiruko] Yeah, you caught on.
Now drop it already.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.740
-You're gonna make her think I'm weird.
-[Maru] You are weird, Sis.

00:19:19.823 --> 00:19:21.742
Everything about this is weird.

00:19:23.368 --> 00:19:24.703
[crickets chirping]

00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:29.041
[inn owner] I've made a stew with some
boar meat and veggies, if you'd like some.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.461
-Whoa, really? I would love some.
-[chuckles]

00:19:33.462 --> 00:19:34.463
[blows]

00:19:37.007 --> 00:19:39.259
Tastes so good! [chuckles]

00:19:40.219 --> 00:19:43.013
I'd like to discuss something with you
for a second,

00:19:43.096 --> 00:19:45.766
though it's tough to find the right words.

00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:50.729
Despite growing up in a world
that's devoid of ethics or morality,

00:19:50.813 --> 00:19:53.440
you both seem very well educated.

00:19:53.524 --> 00:19:57.277
You have manners,
you can use chopsticks, et cetera.

00:19:58.362 --> 00:20:01.532
I may be meddling,
but I feel like I have to say something.

00:20:01.615 --> 00:20:05.118
This is not my opinion
or a hard-and-fast rule,

00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:08.163
but the fact remains,
having a child of incest

00:20:08.247 --> 00:20:09.915
is fundamentally dangerous!

00:20:09.998 --> 00:20:12.084
Sorry, back up. What did you say?

00:20:12.668 --> 00:20:15.337
You've got it all wrong.
I know he keeps calling me "Sis,"

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.132
but just look at this face for a second.
These faces aren't even slightly related!

00:20:19.216 --> 00:20:22.886
And more directly to the point,
we're not even slightly dating!

00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:25.180
Huh?

00:20:26.473 --> 00:20:28.892
Oopsie.
Looks like I jumped to conclusions.

00:20:28.976 --> 00:20:30.894
-[laughs]
-Give me a freaking break!

00:20:30.978 --> 00:20:34.815
[sighs] We're traveling together for work
and that's literally it.

00:20:34.898 --> 00:20:37.025
I run an odd-job business out of Tokyo.

00:20:37.109 --> 00:20:40.529
<i>I accepted a request to be his bodyguard</i>
<i>and now we're here.</i>

00:20:41.154 --> 00:20:44.908
He is nothing to me
beyond an object of my protection, okay?

00:20:50.581 --> 00:20:53.417
What's the matter?
Why are you suddenly so down?

00:20:54.459 --> 00:20:56.587
And why are you moving so far away?

00:20:57.921 --> 00:21:00.841
-Hey, are you mad about something?
-[groans]

00:21:02.175 --> 00:21:04.595
[softly snoring]

00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:06.889
[Kiruko] Huh.

00:21:06.972 --> 00:21:09.641
So today you fall asleep immediately.

00:21:11.226 --> 00:21:12.477
Sounds good to me.

00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:16.398
Might as well hit the hay myself. [grunts]

00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:18.483
[grunts]

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.361
Wow.

00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:24.156
Am I really that tired?

00:21:26.408 --> 00:21:30.537
Something feels weird…

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.009
[loading bullets]

00:22:03.236 --> 00:22:06.740
[Tokio] <i>Is there an outside, like,</i>
<i>beyond this one?</i>

00:22:06.823 --> 00:22:09.409
As a matter of fact, yes, there is.

00:22:10.786 --> 00:22:14.957
However, it's a filthy, decrepit world,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.043
-crawling with monsters.
-[monster screeches]

00:22:18.126 --> 00:22:19.419
It's hell.

00:22:20.462 --> 00:22:21.672
[screeching]
