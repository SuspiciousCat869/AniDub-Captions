[Maru]
Hey, is this how you spell "Man-eaters"?

00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:42.831
WEE KIL MANN-EETERS

00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:46.588
You're asking as if
the rest of the words are spelled right.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:47.674
Huh?

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:49.468
[sighs] Let me write it.

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:50.888
CREDIT CARD LOAN - PARKING LOT

00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:53.644
[Maru] Why can I never write
even though I can read fine?

00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:55.230
[Kiruko] I know, right?

00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:56.733
WE KILL

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:57.819
[Kiruko] There.

00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:01.618
You have to put "Man-eaters"
on a new line, or it'll look bad.

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:03.329
How come?

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:04.415
HANDY

00:02:04.498 --> 00:02:06.169
[Kiruko] <i>On my office door in Nakano</i>,

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:08.883
<i>it looked as if I killed and ate men.</i>

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.093
I KILL MAN-EATERS

00:02:10.177 --> 00:02:12.515
<i>Then there was actually a murder in town.</i>

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.853
<i>Everyone suspected me</i>
<i>and came storming over.</i>

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.988
Seems to me people get blindly aggressive
about stuff they don't understand.

00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:21.073
[exclaims]

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:22.159
WE KILL MAN-EATS

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:25.081
[Kiruko]
I messed up because I was talking!

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.087
Now it says "Man-eats."

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.927
You're making it sound like it's my fault.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.849
[Kiruko sighs]
I'll rewrite it on the other side.

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:38.316
You should include the other names
so it's easy to understand. Like Hiruko.

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.320
[Kiruko] You're the only one
who calls them that!

00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:42.700
[Maru] Mikura called them that too.

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.583
THE IMMORTAL ORDER

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:51.760

INTRO TO RIVER FISHING

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.941
I hope someone snaps up our offer quickly.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.699
Since they call themselves an order,

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:07.625
I thought once we got to the area, there'd
be a flag or sign on an obvious building.

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:11.592
If it's this quiet,
how are we supposed to find them?

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.894
[gasps] I got one! Maru, the net!

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:18.229
[Maru] Wait a sec!

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:26.287
[grunts]

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.592
What's with the mysterious face?
Thinking about something?

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:34.219
The King of Hotels?

00:03:35.013 --> 00:03:36.850
Hmm? No.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:41.108
There's an odd number of fish,
and they're all different sizes.

00:03:41.192 --> 00:03:43.572
I was wondering how
we're gonna divide them up.

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:47.120
-What's wrong, Sis?
-[groaning]

00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:49.083
[groans, sighs]

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:53.132
You look so good when you're quiet.

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.220
But you ruin it
as soon as you open your mouth.

00:03:55.303 --> 00:03:57.307
Wait! Let me try again.

00:03:58.142 --> 00:04:01.065
-Ready.
-No, it's totally different.

00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:02.777
[Maru] Wait, one more try!

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.365
[Kiruko] No way, you blew your chance!

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:14.341
Hey, there's a weird pair
at the end of the road.

00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:16.095
They're not from that group, are they?

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:18.892
You should probably report it.

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:25.113
-[ventilator beeping]
-[knocks, door opens]

00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:29.204
[beeping continues]

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:31.501
[follower] Dr. Usami.

00:04:33.922 --> 00:04:34.924
[Usami] What is it?

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:40.060
A couple of people
are loitering around with a strange sign.

00:04:40.143 --> 00:04:44.026
It says something about being able to kill
Man-eaters and monsters.

00:04:44.527 --> 00:04:46.238
They might be roaming bodyguards.

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:52.209
[Usami] Bring them to me.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.254
Hmm? Oh.

00:04:54.338 --> 00:04:55.883
Right, of course.

00:04:58.847 --> 00:05:00.141
-[Maru] Huh?
-[Kiruko grunts]

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.278
[chuckles] Looks like
we've made another catch.

00:05:09.702 --> 00:05:11.623
[person] This way, please.

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:13.877
Watch your step.

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:15.840
[door opens]

00:05:15.923 --> 00:05:17.300
STOP HUMAN EXPERIMENTS

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:18.720
FREE THE PATIENTS

00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:21.726
Hmm?

00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:27.279
[Maru] This place…

00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:32.623
So, we have some business
with the Immortal Order.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.502
What kind of business?

00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:36.005
If you've come for treatment,

00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:38.844
you shouldn't think of it
as any ordinary hospital.

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:43.477
I'm here to see the doctor
who offers the treatment.

00:05:44.062 --> 00:05:45.733
He's an old acquaintance of mine.

00:05:45.816 --> 00:05:48.947
Hmm? That's not Dr. Usami.

00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:51.327
Maybe he's a new doctor.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.872
[both] Huh?

00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:56.504
Are you people
not from the Immortal Order?

00:05:56.588 --> 00:05:59.009
[all] What? No!

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:02.182
[follower] What?

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:04.979
Where'd they go?

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:07.108
We lost them.

00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:10.365
-This is a waste of time.
-Wait, don't go!

00:06:10.448 --> 00:06:12.578
At least hear us out!

00:06:14.498 --> 00:06:18.422
Our group is opposed to the ways
of the Immortal Order.

00:06:18.507 --> 00:06:19.634
We are called Liviuman.

00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:21.345
I am their leader, Mizuhashi.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.686
We saw the sign that you made.

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:28.025
So we brought you here to discuss it.

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:29.821
Hold on a second.

00:06:29.904 --> 00:06:33.369
First things first, we basically have
no idea what the Immortal Order is.

00:06:33.452 --> 00:06:35.456
Are they running
some kind of free hospital?

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.880
It may look like a hospital,

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:41.803
but, please, take a look.

00:06:41.886 --> 00:06:43.014
-Oh.
-Oh.

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.602
It must have been about a year ago.

00:06:46.103 --> 00:06:49.569
I had an injury and went to
the Order for treatment.

00:06:49.652 --> 00:06:52.908
But, in the end, they restrained me
and amputated my leg.

00:06:53.952 --> 00:06:57.626
Then they attached this metal leg.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.467
We thought it was one
of Dr. Usami's human experiments.

00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:06.018
[Mizuhashi] Even now, people come from
all over to have their injuries cured.

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.481
But, instead, they are
subjected to the work of the devil,

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.569
and their body parts
are replaced with machines.

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.700
That's what the Immortal Order is.

00:07:14.326 --> 00:07:17.290
But since it's called an order,
they must have followers

00:07:17.373 --> 00:07:19.837
and people who don't complain
about the treatments, right?

00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:21.716
Even before the Collapse,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.891
machines were used to replace
body parts that had deteriorated.

00:07:25.974 --> 00:07:30.776
This led to the idea that the brain,
or its memory data,

00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:34.366
could be transplanted into a robot's body,
thus transcending mortality itself.

00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:36.663
From an ethical viewpoint,

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:39.919
it wasn't possible to actually
carry out anything that radical.

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:42.215
But now we live in a lawless world.

00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:45.764
If there are doctors
willing to take their research that far,

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:49.271
then there are probably people
who would happily become machines.

00:07:49.354 --> 00:07:51.024
[Mizuhashi] I bet you're thinking,

00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:53.613
"Why not let those
who want to be involved get on with it?"

00:07:53.697 --> 00:07:54.699
[Maru grunts]

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:58.164
Or, "Isn't it your fault for going there
without knowing what you were in for?"

00:07:58.247 --> 00:07:59.249
[Kiruko grunts]

00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:01.253
I suppose that's what you think.

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:03.257
-[member grunts]
-[stutters] It's not that…

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.512
I understand.

00:08:05.596 --> 00:08:08.810
You're probably wondering why
I speak out against their ways.

00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:12.943
But I have seen it.

00:08:14.112 --> 00:08:16.576
<i>The repulsive reality.</i>

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.624
[ventilator beeping]

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:21.711
[Mizuhashi] Oh.

00:08:21.794 --> 00:08:22.796
[door closes]

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.862
[gasps]

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:39.412
Behind a curtain,

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:41.751
I saw a body completely chopped to pieces,

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:44.799
hacked up to a point
that ought to be beyond survival.

00:08:44.882 --> 00:08:48.932
A human being kept alive
by an impossible number of machines.

00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:52.648
<i>When it noticed my presence,</i>

00:08:53.148 --> 00:08:55.069
<i>it spoke to me.</i>

00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:58.075
-[robotic voice] Let…
-[gasps]

00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:01.331
Let me die.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.254
[member] Even more shockingly,

00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:09.055
that mass of machines, which has trampled
on any remaining human dignity,

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:12.521
appears to be
an object of worship for them.

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:16.403
So we decided to do something about it.

00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:20.286
[member] <i>Dr. Usami has gained followers</i>

00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:23.500
<i>from the knowledge he has acquired</i>
<i>with his inhumane acts.</i>

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:26.465
<i>It's possible that in this era,</i>

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:29.597
<i>their way of doing things</i>
<i>will become the dominant one.</i>

00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:32.352
So this guy isn't Dr. Usami?

00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:33.938
That's not him.

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:35.984
Usami is younger.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.573
Right.

00:09:39.617 --> 00:09:42.080
We heard that the Immortal Order

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:44.752
are transplanting parts of the Man-eaters
onto human bodies.

00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:46.129
[all] What?

00:09:46.213 --> 00:09:49.094
Really? So that's what they're doing.

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:54.479
That's connected to
what I wanted to discuss with you.

00:09:56.734 --> 00:09:58.655
<i>It seems that the Immortal Order</i>

00:09:59.155 --> 00:10:02.705
<i>is keeping a Man-eater in the basement</i>
<i>of their building.</i>

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.271
[Maru] What are we going to do, Sis?
Shall we do it?

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.400
Let's do it.

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.487
They said they'd pay us.

00:10:20.657 --> 00:10:22.953
If a Man-eater can be killed, we kill it.

00:10:23.036 --> 00:10:24.957
People are going to get eaten if we don't.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.334
That much is certain.

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:29.633
If you say so, then I will, but…

00:10:30.468 --> 00:10:33.098
But what?

00:10:33.182 --> 00:10:36.146
[Maru] You're not as coolheaded as usual.

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:39.319
You're turning into Haruki again.

00:10:39.402 --> 00:10:40.864
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:43.703
I've always been Haruki in my head.

00:10:43.787 --> 00:10:45.039
I am coolheaded.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.542
[grunts]

00:10:47.836 --> 00:10:48.838
[scoffs]

00:10:48.922 --> 00:10:50.424
[Maru breathing shakily]

00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:58.817
She was naked.

00:10:59.902 --> 00:11:02.323
No, no, stop it.

00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:05.037
<i>From Sis's point of view,</i>

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.420
<i>it's possible the doctor we're chasing</i>
<i>is part of the Immortal Order,</i>

00:11:09.922 --> 00:11:13.053
<i>which might bring us closer to the reason</i>
<i>why the woman she loved died.</i>

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.892
<i>No wonder it's hard to keep cool.</i>

00:11:17.186 --> 00:11:20.569
<i>But something doesn't feel right.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.702
<i>I need to figure it out.</i>

00:11:26.454 --> 00:11:28.543
[Maru strains]

00:11:28.626 --> 00:11:33.051
<i>Perfect. Being squished so close,</i>
<i>I can only think of irrelevant stuff.</i>

00:11:35.807 --> 00:11:38.646
[Mizuhashi] As many of you already know,

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.194
this morning
another large building collapsed.

00:11:42.821 --> 00:11:47.246
Day by day, the civilization that we knew
is returning to the earth.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.710
It is useless to us now.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:53.760
Those of us who remain don't have
the power to rebuild what is left.

00:11:54.344 --> 00:11:57.099
What did machines bring to humanity?

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.978
Tanks! Bombs!

00:11:59.062 --> 00:12:00.481
Fighter planes!

00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:04.782
What did we get in return for this poison?
Electricity! Convenience!

00:12:04.865 --> 00:12:08.205
What we are left with, as a result,
is an endless winter

00:12:08.288 --> 00:12:11.545
and a mountain of debris
just rotting away.

00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:13.549
-Yeah!
-Exactly!

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.971
[Mizuhashi] This kind of thing

00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:17.891
is not needed!

00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:19.185
[crowd exclaims]

00:12:19.268 --> 00:12:21.022
-Our leader!
-Ms. Mizuhashi!

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:22.108
Are you okay?

00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:24.947
We don't need machines.

00:12:25.447 --> 00:12:27.953
We don't need machines!

00:12:28.036 --> 00:12:29.540
[crowd] No machines!

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.292
BANK OF JAPAN NOTE
TEN-THOUSAND YEN

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.963
[shouting continues]

00:12:35.092 --> 00:12:37.514
It's getting really crazy out there.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.148
All we can do right now
is rant and rave outside their building.

00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:45.697
But if we get rid of that monster,
we can have a discussion on equal terms.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.035
A discussion, huh?

00:12:48.619 --> 00:12:52.126
They could release that monster anytime.
While they have that secret weapon,

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:55.508
the Order is not going to listen to us.

00:12:56.426 --> 00:12:59.933
Well, we're only being paid to kill it.

00:13:00.434 --> 00:13:02.188
After that, you can do what you like.

00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:07.323
[member] <i>Fine. So, as for today's plans…</i>

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:12.959
RESTORE HUMAN RIGHTS

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.673
Stop human experiments!

00:13:15.757 --> 00:13:16.759
FREE THE PATIENTS!!

00:13:16.842 --> 00:13:19.515
[member] <i>Now, they're demonstrating</i>
<i>against human experimentation</i>

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:22.144
<i>outside the Immortal Order's building.</i>

00:13:22.729 --> 00:13:25.109
<i>But it's a diversion.</i>

00:13:25.192 --> 00:13:28.950
<i>We'll use it to get you to the basement</i>
<i>through another entrance.</i>

00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:30.829
[Kiruko] <i>There's no guard?</i>

00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:34.043
[member] <i>The guard to the basement</i>
<i>is one of our own.</i>

00:13:34.878 --> 00:13:36.131
I've heard the plan.

00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:43.604
We're counting on you.

00:14:04.855 --> 00:14:06.065
[Kiruko grunts]

00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:08.779
[Kiruko] Huh?

00:14:08.863 --> 00:14:11.159
-[door closes]
-[Maru] It's so bright.

00:14:11.242 --> 00:14:12.704
[Kiruko] The lights are on.

00:14:14.123 --> 00:14:16.127
They must have
some serious power generators.

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:20.887
All that talk of life-support systems
is starting to sound more credible.

00:14:24.268 --> 00:14:26.022
But it's weird, isn't it?

00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:30.573
There's no sign of a Man-eater here.
Not a single sound.

00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:35.290
-Sis?
-Huh?

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.508
I've had a weird feeling for a while.

00:14:40.425 --> 00:14:41.845
I think I just got what it is.

00:14:42.847 --> 00:14:47.607
It feels like we're being set up.
Just like when we went to find the water.

00:14:48.609 --> 00:14:50.613
What if there are no Hiruko here?

00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:53.786
If there were Hiruko in this basement,

00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:57.585
<i>then why would that old guy</i>
<i>who wanted a transplant</i>

00:14:57.669 --> 00:15:00.298
<i>go to all that trouble</i>
<i>looking for Hiruko parts?</i>

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:02.136
[Kiruko] No, but…

00:15:04.432 --> 00:15:05.727
No, wait.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.146
What you're saying makes sense,

00:15:07.229 --> 00:15:11.029
but that guy probably
has never been to the Immortal Order.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.326
It's pretty likely
he was on a wild chase after some rumor.

00:15:14.828 --> 00:15:19.003
If they just wanted to lock us up in here,
that plan seems way over-the-top.

00:15:19.588 --> 00:15:20.965
Why would they do all this?

00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:22.635
To use us for experiments!

00:15:22.719 --> 00:15:26.309
If we don't escape, they'll chop us up
and keep us alive like that forever!

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.394
[gasps]

00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:32.404
[Kiruko] <i>They could use</i>
<i>a gas heavier than air to put us to sleep.</i>

00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:34.659
<i>Is that why we're in the basement?</i>

00:15:35.285 --> 00:15:37.540
This is way too risky, Sis.
Let's get outta here!

00:15:38.083 --> 00:15:39.251
Wait!

00:15:40.922 --> 00:15:43.468
What is that?

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.446
Is it a dormant Man-eater?

00:15:56.912 --> 00:15:58.582
Yeah, it's a Hiruko.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.001
[sizzling]

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:01.129
Crushed it.

00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:04.301
[sighs]

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.600
It's weird that I'm glad
there was a Man-eater here,

00:16:07.684 --> 00:16:09.646
but looks like
you were worried about nothing.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.482
Right.

00:16:12.569 --> 00:16:13.904
Wha-- Sis!

00:16:14.488 --> 00:16:16.117
Isn't that one down there too?

00:16:16.994 --> 00:16:18.914
Another? What the hell?

00:16:18.998 --> 00:16:20.751
I thought there was only one.

00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:23.214
There could be more.
We need to cover every corner.

00:16:31.272 --> 00:16:32.817
The fact that they're not moving

00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:36.115
is actually more annoying.

00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:40.248
[gasps]

00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:42.962
Got you.

00:16:43.463 --> 00:16:45.175
Is this guy the big boss?

00:16:46.553 --> 00:16:47.680
Gross.

00:16:47.764 --> 00:16:51.187
Did those little ones
multiply from this guy?

00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:54.193
But why are they frozen stiff?

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:56.657
[Kiruko] When a Man-eater
is on the verge of death,

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.326
it enters a state of suspended animation.

00:16:58.409 --> 00:17:00.288
They survive by playing dead.

00:17:00.915 --> 00:17:05.006
These ones probably haven't had any food
since being trapped down here.

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:08.054
Right. Food…

00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:11.102
And now that two humans have shown up,

00:17:11.853 --> 00:17:13.649
I guess they'll start to wake up?

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:16.237
[thrums]

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.364
[gasps]

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:19.703
[chittering]

00:17:20.705 --> 00:17:22.040
There!

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.211
Sis!

00:17:24.295 --> 00:17:25.965
There's a little one that's moving!

00:17:26.048 --> 00:17:27.802
I don't know if I got it.

00:17:27.885 --> 00:17:29.681
Where'd you go?

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.727
[breathing heavily]

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.354
-[chittering, thrumming]
-[gasps]

00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:34.649
No.

00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:37.905
They've got quick moves. Watch out!

00:17:37.989 --> 00:17:39.576
[growling]

00:17:40.076 --> 00:17:41.162
[Kiruko] No way.

00:17:41.245 --> 00:17:44.084
They're slipping through the walls.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.132
[shouts, grunts]

00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:51.725
Damn it, get off!

00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:53.353
Maru, run!

00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:55.023
Maru!

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:58.029
[strains, gasps]

00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:01.995
[gasps]

00:18:02.496 --> 00:18:03.874
Go to hell!

00:18:06.546 --> 00:18:08.132
[strains]

00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:10.303
[gasps]

00:18:10.387 --> 00:18:11.389
[growling]

00:18:11.472 --> 00:18:12.725
[Kiruko] This can't be happening.

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:15.606
Die! [breathing heavily]

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.735
-[gun clicking]
-Just die already!

00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:20.198
Let me go!

00:18:25.417 --> 00:18:27.087
[screams]

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.133
[groaning]

00:18:35.228 --> 00:18:36.773
[shouts]

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:39.988
[Kiruko breathing heavily]

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.171
Help.

00:18:48.756 --> 00:18:50.593
Help me, Robin!

00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:52.680
[screams]

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.026
[Kiruko sighs] <i>It's over.</i>

00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:01.656
<i>I can't…</i>

00:19:02.784 --> 00:19:05.455
<i>breathe.</i>

00:19:07.543 --> 00:19:08.587
[gasps]

00:19:09.171 --> 00:19:11.133
[both strain]

00:19:16.393 --> 00:19:18.064
[straining]

00:19:18.899 --> 00:19:20.276
[gasping]

00:19:21.403 --> 00:19:22.405
You're okay.

00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:24.702
There's nothing here. Nothing happened!

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:29.587
Was I dreaming?

00:19:30.129 --> 00:19:32.802
That's impossible.
Did it make me hallucinate?

00:19:33.637 --> 00:19:35.641
Thank God. You're back to reality.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.147
I don't know what I'd have done
if you'd stayed like that.

00:19:40.108 --> 00:19:43.447
You just started shooting at nothing
and flailing violently out of nowhere.

00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:46.328
Just rest like that for a bit.

00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:48.750
I'll deal with the rest of the Hiruko.

00:19:52.007 --> 00:19:53.009
Hey, Sis?

00:19:55.054 --> 00:19:57.017
I guess you wanted Robin to save you.

00:19:57.602 --> 00:19:58.604
What?

00:19:58.687 --> 00:20:00.023
[stammers]

00:20:00.106 --> 00:20:03.487
Sorry, I thought they'd already got you.

00:20:12.297 --> 00:20:13.341
[Maru] <i>Damn it.</i>

00:20:13.424 --> 00:20:16.263
<i>What kind of guy says something so stupid?</i>

00:20:16.973 --> 00:20:19.102
[Kiruko] <i>Why exactly</i>
<i>should I be apologizing?</i>

00:20:20.104 --> 00:20:22.067
[thrums, sizzles]

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:27.662
[sizzling]

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.713
[Maru] I think that's all of them.

00:20:33.507 --> 00:20:35.134
Are you feeling better, Sis?

00:20:35.719 --> 00:20:36.721
Yeah.

00:20:37.222 --> 00:20:40.436
[Maru] When you were staring
at that huge Hiruko,

00:20:40.521 --> 00:20:42.900
it must have hypnotized you.
I'm sure of it.

00:20:43.527 --> 00:20:46.908
That's why I told you
you weren't as coolheaded as usual.

00:20:48.244 --> 00:20:49.413
[sighs] Aha.

00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:51.793
I'll try and focus more.

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:01.938
-Hey!
-Ouch.

00:21:02.022 --> 00:21:04.443
[Kiruko] As if you're trying
to sneak another one in!

00:21:04.527 --> 00:21:05.946
-Are you stupid?
-[groans]

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.700
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Kiruko] Oh.

00:21:07.783 --> 00:21:09.202
-Hmm?
-Someone's coming.

00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:26.070
Is it dead?

00:21:26.571 --> 00:21:27.865
Really?

00:21:29.076 --> 00:21:30.788
[chuckles]

00:21:31.831 --> 00:21:34.252
This guy's clearly bad news.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.302
[gun cocks]

00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:42.895
[Usami]
There's someone else I want you to kill.

00:21:45.818 --> 00:21:48.615
Someone I want you to help.

00:21:49.199 --> 00:21:50.201
-Oh.
-Oh.

00:21:50.994 --> 00:21:52.665
If we can.

00:21:52.748 --> 00:21:55.712
I mean, it depends on what you're asking.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.384
Aren't you from the Immortal Order?

00:21:59.177 --> 00:22:01.473
I don't remember
ever referring to it that way,

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:03.770
but I've heard it called that before.

00:22:03.854 --> 00:22:06.066
Right.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.657
So, is Dr. Usami here? We want to see him.

00:22:10.659 --> 00:22:12.078
Usami?

00:22:12.162 --> 00:22:13.455
That's me.
