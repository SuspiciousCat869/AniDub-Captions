00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.336
[door opens]

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.547
[Maru] So, how far are Ibaraki and Nara
from here?

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:07.382
[Kiruko] Far enough for it to be a haul.

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.885
-But Ibaraki is a little closer than Nara.
-[engine starts]

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.849
[Maru] Narabaki, Narabaki, Nara, Ibaraki.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.143
Nara, Ibaraki, Nara, Ibaraki.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:19.937
Nara, Baraki, Baraki.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.439
Nara, Kibara, Nara, Ibaraki, Nara--

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.816
You are not doing that
for the next five hours!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.610
But I'm bored. [yawns]

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.528
I wanna get there now.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.572
What are you? A toddler?

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:33.242
[Maru]
No, but there has to be a faster way.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:37.204
[Juichi] Sorry, it might actually take
a little longer than five hours.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:38.622
[Maru, Kiruko shout] What?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.250
Well, that earthquake might have
messed up some of the roads, so…

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.502
[Maru] Then, how long is it gonna take?

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.087
[Juichi] I'm not sure.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.005
[Kiruko] Hmm, that's convenient.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.174
You're not taking us
to some sort of creep camp

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.677
you and your friends got in the woods
to get back at us, are you?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.262
[Juichi] No, I'm being honest.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.932
Hey, did you really mean
what you said earlier?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.059
[shouts] Hey, you came back!

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.435
Did who mean what?

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.939
[Juichi] You! You said you wanted to see
if my baby was still alive out there.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.776
The breeding pig story. It's all true.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.029
I wanna go back and take my revenge,
but I need help.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.824
Oh, so that's why you wanted my gun.

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:17.077
Sis, this tattoo is the real deal.

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.413
[splashes]

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.622
Hmm?

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.503
[Kiruko] <i>All right. Where is this place?</i>

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.048
If the roads are in good condition,
it's about five hours away by car.

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:31.925
It's around here.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.177
[Kiruko] <i>Huh. Practically in Ibaraki.</i>

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.431
[Maru] <i>Hey, hey! I believe</i>
<i>that's what they call "gratuitous."</i>

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:38.682
[groans]

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.101
[Kiruko] <i>"Fortuitous."</i>

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.312
[crickets chirping]

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.647
[Juichi snoring]

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:47.316
[groans]

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.567
[gasps]

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.156
[sighs]

00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:59.661
[snoring continues]

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:05.917
I didn't touch it.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.127
[gasps, grunts]

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.546
[groans]

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.715
Oh, sorry. You okay?

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.134
-That looked like it hurt.
-[groans]

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:15.802
-But…
-Huh?

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.555
…that proves I'm trustworthy, right?

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.681
At least a little?

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.060
[groans]

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.770
-[Kiruko] Listen.
-Huh?

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.273
[Kiruko] I'm only coming
to see if the baby's alive.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.318
[sighs]

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.780
[Juichi] That's good enough for me.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.662
[door closes]

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.706
We should hide the car
and walk from here. That way, we can--

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.167
-Hey, don't be so obvious!
-[both grunt]

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:49.044
[both groan]

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.046
[gasps] Oh, miss? Come here a second! Uh--

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.382
There's something I need to check out.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.885
-Hmm…
-[Maru panting]

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.679
You jerk!

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.472
-[screams]
-[Juichi groans]

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.683
You can't just go around
feeling up the chest

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.393
of another man's woman!

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:05.852
[Juichi] I'm so sorry!

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.230
I'm not yours, or a woman!

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.357
[gasps] I'm so sorry!

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.652
Look, I don't wanna be a creep.
I just wanna let you know

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.988
that your chest could put you in danger
with the women in charge out here.

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.281
[Kiruko] What?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.701
[Maru] Hmm…

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.912
Women with larger chests
are despised in this town.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.872
So you should keep your jacket zipped.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:29.292
Some women have cut their breasts off
completely just to live here.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.295
Why would a society of women
want to do that to each other?

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.923
I don't know. They're the same people
who imprisoned a little boy

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.299
and tattooed him for fun!

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.802
Who knows
why these psychopaths do anything?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.763
This sounds too scary!
I'm going in with you!

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:44.683
No! Walking in there with a guy
makes the whole thing worse!

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:48.019
Wait. If you really wanna go,
I have something that will help.

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.274
-[Maru] A little to the left?
-[Juichi] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.113
Well, Sis? You like it?

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.532
[Kiruko stutters]

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.827
[straining] You look great.
You're so pretty.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.996
Why did you say it like that? [chuckles]

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.582
-Hey, Juichi!
-[gasps]

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.083
Which one of us is cuter?

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:14.212
[gasps] Well, naturally,
I'd say you, miss.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.797
Is that the right answer, or…

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.633
Yes! Now, let's head out.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.552
Wait, were you jealous?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:21.928
This is all fake.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.555
-Shut up.
-[groans]

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.348
Uh…

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.100
If you're ready, it's this way.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.936
[panting]

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:35.400
[Juichi] The big building in front
is the school.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.404
But, you know, if we can see it from here,
then they can see us.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.573
Yeah, yeah. I know.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.450
Bye. Back in a bit.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.036
Don't mess with our stuff, okay? [laughs]

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.497
I haven't yet, and I'm not gonna!

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.084
Just saying. There are tons of people
out there who would love to.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.545
Like that girl? The King of Hotels?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.256
Hmm, I wonder how she's doing.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.175
[Maru] Yeah. I hope she's good.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:06.348
[Kiruko] That's one big hole
for a place called the Walled Off Town.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.727
-All right. Knock, knock, coming in.
-[Maru] Hey! We gotta stay close.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.611
[Kiruko] Geez. It's not just abandoned,
it's totally wrecked.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.491
[Maru] But like, look at this stuff…

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.161
[Kiruko] Yeah.
Someone definitely used to live here.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:31.581
[Maru] Doesn't look like they're
coming back anytime soon.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.085
[Kiruko] I wonder what they did
with the pigs.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.338
Let's look around some more.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.466
[Maru] Is anybody here?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.552
[footsteps approach]

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.641
-[Maru grunts]
-Yeah, go ahead and make a bigger mess.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.434
-Graceful.
-[Maru] Shut up!

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.103
It was an accident!

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.648
Whoa. This is in great condition.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.235
Hmm. They left so much good stuff here.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.946
It's like they disappeared
more than moved out.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.866
'Cause they did.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.368
Yeah, this journal is incomplete.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.536
[Maru] Like how?

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.998
[Kiruko] It ends on this page
with just a date and a scribble. So…

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.625
-[wind howls]
-[gasps]

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.461
[Maru groans] It just got so cold…

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:20.881
[gasps]

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.591
[Maru grunts]

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.635
That hurt! What the heck, Sis?

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.178
[ice crackles]

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:28.972
Sis?

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.103
Here! Why is everything covered in ice?

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.022
[Kiruko shivering]

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.024
[straining] Shit. Maru.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.650
It's a Man-eater.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.777
It's gotta be close.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.862
Find it.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.780
[panting]

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.867
[groans] My eyes are…

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.077
freezed shut.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.372
[grunts]

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.836
[gasps] Above us! Shoot!

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.547
[Kiruko straining, shivering]

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.848
[grunts]
Yep. That was a Hiruko, all right.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.975
[coughs, gasps]

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.187
Damn it. That was really bad.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.272
Any longer and it would've killed us.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.943
How did you know it was up there?

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.404
-Just somehow.
-Descriptive! Thank you!

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:27.864
[rattles, thuds]

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.199
[both gasp]

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:32.410
[Kiruko] Let's go.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.664
It's tracking us from above!

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.290
Better not run into it!

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.254
Why are you stopping? We gotta go!

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:46.675
-[grunts]
-[Maru] Sis?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.760
Are we not running away?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.736
-[footsteps approaching]
-[steady breathing]

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.991
[rattles, thuds]

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.872
[Kiruko] <i>There it is.</i>

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:22.168
[ice crackling]

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:26.965
[inhales]

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.466
[blows]

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.019
[Kiruko] <i>I get it now.</i>

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:41.646
<i>It's a proximity thing.</i>

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.607
<i>Cold starts to dissipate</i>
<i>at a certain point.</i>

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.652
<i>You only have the upper hand</i>
<i>when you sneak up on your prey,</i>

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.155
<i>trap them and freeze them in place.</i>

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:53.783
<i>But if someone runs at you</i>
<i>with a weapon before they freeze,</i>

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.285
<i>then you're in trouble!</i>

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.171
[exhales]

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.673
Hmm…

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:12.010
Nope. I can get in,
but I can't find the core.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.386
Must be in the other half.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.806
Yeah, and that half ran away.
That figures.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.767
What now?

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.439
Are we leaving?

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.567
-Hey! Shouldn't we--
-No point.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.695
We were only supposed
to look for the baby.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.031
And he's obviously not here.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.158
So let's go.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.126
[chuckles]

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:53.635
[Kiruko sighs] I don't think I can say it.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.804
-[Maru] Okay. So I'll tell him.
-[gasps]

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.388
That's fine, right?

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.850
[Juichi] There was no one there at all?

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.602
Not even the women?

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:06.314
[Maru] There was a Hiruko, a Man-eater.
But that's it.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.442
[Juichi] So they're dead.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.071
My child, my enemies.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:19.452
[Kiruko] Look, it's a Man-eater nest now.
But that doesn't mean anything.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.956
Maybe the building
just got too old for them.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.000
So everyone moved out,
and the spider moved in.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.756
We don't know.
It could be fine, so don't lose hope.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.263
[stranger] Hey! Needle noggin!

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.183
You got something to say,
come say it to my fists!

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.727
-[stranger 2] Is it him?
-[stranger] Yeah, it's gotta be.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.480
-[stranger 2] No way.
-[stranger] It is, look!

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.816
Hey! You're Boar #11, aren't you?

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:52.402
-Juichi, right?
-[gasps]

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.822
[Juichi] Yes, you're Boar #6! And Boar #9!

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.907
[Boar #6] Oh, come on, man!
Don't call us that!

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.994
[Juichi] You called me that first!
I was just copying you!

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.913
[Boar #9] Anyway, uh,
we're living somewhere else now.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.083
[Boar #6] Oh, and the kid
born from your seed is happy and healthy!

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.085
-[Juichi] What?
-We can take you to him.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.587
Come see the new place!

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.591
Let's see, where to start? Um…

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.010
You hadn't been gone very long.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.513
It was only a few weeks,
maybe a month, after you ran away,

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.724
and those two women were executed.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.393
Your son started crying
in the middle of the night.

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:26.477
[crying]

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.563
<i>But we were terrified</i>
<i>of what those women might have done</i>

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:29.731
<i>if he annoyed them.</i>

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.233
<i>So we were all trying to quiet him down.</i>

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.027
<i>And then, suddenly…</i>

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.487
<i>that monster invaded.</i>

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.824
Since we were all awake when it attacked,

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.160
we escaped through the hole
it blasted in the outer wall.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.244
Hmm…

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.249
[Boar #6]
Look, Jugo, look! It's your daddy!

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.376
[Boar #9] No, Jugo. No, not me. That way.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.502
[laughs]

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.504
[chattering]

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.381
-[Boar #9] I said it's not me.
-[chuckles]

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:56.966
[person] He can't understand you.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.303
[Juichi panting]

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:02.722
[gasping]

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.807
-[cries]
-[Jugo grunts]

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.893
[Juichi sobbing]

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.815
[sobbing continues]

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.068
[Maru] Good for him.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.528
His enemies are dead and his kid's okay.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.364
I love a happy ending.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:22.784
Yeah. Now I won't feel so bad
about taking his money.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.077
-[Kiruko sniffles]
-[scoffs]

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.621
Sure. You keep trying to act tough.

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:28.081
You're clearly crying.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.166
No, you are. [sniffles]

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.543
[cheering, laughing]

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.963
-[laughing]
-[person] All right, what do we have here?

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.674
-[person 2] Maybe some boar meat…
-[person 3 groans]

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.842
-[sighs]
-[person 2] …let's just cook all of it!

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.178
-[person 3] Uh-huh. Mouse or rat?
-[person 2] Oh!

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.847
[chattering, laughing]

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.267
-[person 2] Where'd you put the liquor?
-[person 3] Right there!

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.060
-[chattering continues]
-[chuckles]

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:51.187
-It was great last time.
-Mmm…

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.523
-[Boar #9] Juichi.
-[laughter continues]

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.276
Come eat. It's your party, after all.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.654
[babbling]

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.906
[Juichi] They said
you've been looking after Jugo.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.492
I really can't thank you enough
for taking care of him.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:07.829
-[Jugo continues babbling]
-It's the least I could do. He's your son.

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:10.999
Listen, Juichi, I--

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.877
[chattering, laughing continues]

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.381
-[person] It's stupid! Stupid! So stupid.
-[laughs]

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:19.882
[Kiruko grunts]

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.759
[exhales]

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.346
Oh, that's real nice after freezing today.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.639
[sighs]

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.025
[yawns]

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.903
Crazy how a hot bath
and one good meal will knock you out.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.655
What are we doing tomorrow?

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.450
We can go find that Ibaraki facility,
I guess.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.326
Okay, how are we gonna find it?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.537
It's cool. I got an idea--

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.748
-[snoring]
-Huh?

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.208
Did she fall asleep mid-sentence?

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.173
[Boar #6 whispers] Lights out.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:05.803
[taps]

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:11.017
[snoring]

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.226
[taps]

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.231
[tapping]

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.029
-[Kiruko] Hey, Maru! Wake up!
-[gasps]

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.991
-[Maru] Crap. Do you think--
-[Kiruko] There's no mistaking it.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.743
Everyone out, now!

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.662
-[shivers]
-This cold is an attack by a Man-eater!

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.289
[pants]

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.500
-Where's Juichi?
-[Kiruko] Is he not here?

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.502
Do you see him here?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.504
Just calm down! Are you sure?

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.715
[person] I can't find the leader
or Jugo either!

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:46.052
Damn it! Juichi, where are you?
Get outside!

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:48.387
[grunts, pants]

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.056
-[shivering]
-[Kiruko] Is he--

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:53.101
He's just unconscious.
But here, take Jugo.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:54.727
[grunts]

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:57.522
All right, guys!
Get on the road and keep moving!

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.817
The cold has a center point.
If you stay there, you die!

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.485
[panting]

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.737
[Kiruko] <i>Stay calm.</i>

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.698
<i>My head's so cold, it hurts!</i>

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.201
<i>But I can still feel my legs.</i>

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:13.079
[coughing]

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.705
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:18.084
<i>No matter how much I run,</i>
<i>I can't get away.</i>

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.419
<i>My lungs are burning.</i>

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.880
<i>Is it chasing me?</i>

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.466
<i>Then why can't I see it?</i>

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.718
<i>Or hear it? Where is it?</i>

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:29.971
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:32.974
<i>That attack range I figured out earlier…</i>

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:35.601
<i>Did I get it wrong?</i>

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.855
-[ice crackling]
-[Kiruko whimpers]

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.399

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.193
Sis! [grunts]

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:48.030
[grunting, panting]

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.827
[Kiruko] <i>The cold air is gone.</i>

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.538
[grunts, gasps]

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.831
[pants]

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:58.708
It's okay! You're good now!

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:03.087
-[Maru] Don't go near him!
-[Kiruko] I have to! He'll die!

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.256
-We can't let the monster get him!
-[Maru] Stop!

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.801
Stop! That kid is the Hiruko! [pants]

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.470
I know. I've fought enough of them by now.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:15.224
It's kinda like I can sense
their presence or something.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.185
Look, you see?

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.271
The kid is the one doing the cold attack.

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.773
-[wind howls]
-[ice crackles]

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.094
And just like that, the cold is gone.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.096
Yeah. Like nothing ever happened.

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:58.226
-[crying continues]
-[Kiruko] Uh… [chuckles]

00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:59.727
Hey, it's okay.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.148
[Tokio] Send message to Kona.

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:08.819
They said they can remove
the thing inside me soon.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.864
After that, I can go…

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.407
[stifles sob]

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.159
…back to school.

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:18.371
And see you. I miss you, Kona.

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.873
[sobbing, sniffling]

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.586
I'll see you soon, okay? Promise.

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.559
-[Dr. Sawatari] It'll be born soon.
-[gasps]

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:43.479
[stutters] Dr. Sawatari!

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.440
It'll be fine.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.694
[Maru] Jugo, hey!

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.988
-[Juichi] Here. Take this too.
-[Jugo laughs, coos]

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:56.158
[Juichi] It expired over ten years ago,
but it's better than nothing.

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:57.952
[Kiruko] Oh, thanks.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.414
You're sure it's okay if I--

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:04.125
Yeah. We have plenty of medicine
stashed away.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.211
[Kiruko] Not the medicine, the car.

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.131
Hmm.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:14.385
Sure. Not like I have any reason
to be traveling now, right?

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:18.764
Besides, the car they have here
is much better than that old hunk of junk.

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.891
[chuckles] You're kinda doing me a favor.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.563
-All right, then. Fair enough.
-[laughing]

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:27.982
[people chattering]

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:29.066
[trunk closes]

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.193
See you around, Juichi.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.238
Don't get frozen to death
by that kid of yours! You got it?

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.824
-See you. Bye-bye.
-Hmm.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.831
-[engine sputters]
-[all gasp]

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.334
Uh… [chuckles]

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:49.337
-Huh?
-[engine sputters]

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.090
-[Kiruko] Uh, sorry. Crap. That's weird.
-[engine sputters]

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.593
-Sis, we look dumb.
-Hush! I'm working on it!

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:58.304
-All right, you. Come on!
-[engine sputters]

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.473
[groans] Or not!

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:03.017
[Maru] There's no, "Or not!"
'Cause we gotta go!

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.519
[Kiruko] Panicking isn't gonna
make anything work any better!

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:06.854
[Maru] Wait, I'm panicking?

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:14.820
[Aoshima] Children, we're going to be
welcoming some new friends today.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.448
And you, as classmates,

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:20.534
are reaching an important time
in your lives.

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:24.080
I hope you will aim for a bright future,
no matter what happens.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:27.208
And if you have doubts,
I hope you will listen to your hearts.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.002
Well, that was vague and confusing.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:34.340
[Aoshima] Now, let's all give
a nice, warm welcome to our 5th years.

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.274
[person breathing heavily]

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.778

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:02.451
-[Juichi] I didn't forget.
-[gurgling]

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.370
The night I escaped.

[Boar #9] <i>Someone's escaping!</i>

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.607
[Juichi] <i>Someone called</i>
<i>for the guards immediately.</i>

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.279
<i>I wondered if I was a traitor</i>
<i>for leaving you all behind?</i>

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:42.491
Or if it was just payback
for some petty grudge?

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.202
I guess I'll never know the answer.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.747
But I do know one thing.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.667

[gasps]

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:09.810
Well,

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.062

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.117
Hmm? Who's going out?

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:26.744
[shouts, pants]

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.621
-Come on!
-Oh, man. You scared the crap out of me.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.581
<i>Okay, okay. Let's go.</i>

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.127
[both grunt]

00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:37.838
-[both scream]
-[Jugo giggling]

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.467
Watch where you're going, you idiot!
[grumbles]

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.053
Hey, wasn't that our car?

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.556
[babbling]

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.851
[laughing]

00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:58.526
[Juichi] <i>See you. Bye-bye.</i>
