WEBVTT

00:01:34.397 --> 00:01:38.071
Water… Oh, yeah.
That's where you wanna go.

00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:41.578
If you head just a little way's
past that elevated track,

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:43.624
there's an underground passage.

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:45.586
Water builds up there all the time.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.383
[Kiruko] Sweet, thanks.
We'll head over there.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.682
Uh, wait! Don't you guys need
somewhere to rest first?

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.896
We've got the cleanest rooms,
and the freshest futons in town.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.982
Come on.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.904
Sorry, but we don't really have time
to hang around.

00:01:59.488 --> 00:02:00.658
Uh-- Oh.

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:02.787
Right, of course.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:05.668
Although,

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:07.672
I guess if we're heading to get water,

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:10.427
it wouldn't hurt to leave our bags
somewhere for a while.

00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:12.557
With any luck,
we'll have a lot of water to haul.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.059
[laughs]

00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:17.859
[Maru] You totally just did that
to give her money.

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:21.992
You're too nice.
What if she tries to rob us?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.706
Well, she'd be out of luck,
'cause we are broke.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.171
She told us to keep our valuables
with us, right?

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:29.340
We can trust her.

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:31.052
<i>You know, probably.</i>

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.225
[Maru] Oh, hey! Look!

00:02:35.352 --> 00:02:37.272
You think that's our underground passage?

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.702
[Maru grunts]

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.425
[water dripping]

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.512
[gasps]

00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:57.605
Run off.

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.987
There could be all kinds of nasty bacteria
living in there.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.408
Not exactly safe for us to drink.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.796
There's someone over there!

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.175
Hey, get out of there! The bacteria!

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:13.888
[sighs]

00:03:19.858 --> 00:03:21.528
[groans]

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.919
Guy's in pretty bad shape.

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:31.380
Is he still alive?

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:32.967
[stranger] My friend…

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.846
Please, you gotta help him.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.685
It was a monster.

00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:39.648
Damn thing got him.

00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:41.442
I'm begging you.

00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:43.321
Leave.

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.741
Oh, man.
I think his friend's already a goner.

00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:07.285
-Sis, look.
-[gasps]

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.170
-[gasps]
-[howling]

00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:16.555
Let's go!

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.954
[Maru whimpers]

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.437
-Boom goes the dynamite.
-Huh?

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:07.740
[Kiruko] Don't love that I had to squander
a bullet on him, but look.

00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:08.826
He's done for.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.411
Whoa!

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:12.583
Once you know something's
gonna chase after you,

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.002
setting up a trap's easy.

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:17.175
[Maru] It's crazy how fast
you come up with this stuff.

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.469
[Kiruko chuckles]

00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:21.475
You're up, Maru. Go do your thing.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.854
Oh, uh-- Right.

00:05:23.354 --> 00:05:24.774
Okay…

00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:27.989
Fatal Dive!

00:05:28.072 --> 00:05:33.709
[echoing]
<i>Fatal Dive! Fatal Dive! Fatal Dive!</i>

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:39.261
Huh?

00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:40.346
Hmm?

00:05:40.848 --> 00:05:42.100
[soft howl]

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.062
Uh-oh.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.485
[Maru] It's not a Hiruko, it's an animal!

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.323
-[Kiruko] Wait, are you serious?
-[Maru] Run, run!

00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:50.868
-[Kiruko] Okay. Maru, over here!
-[Maru] Run!

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.122
-[bear groans]
-[Kiruko] Here, hurry up, come on!

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:55.753
-[Maru panting]
-[Kiruko] Climb up now!

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:57.130
[Maru] Please don't leave me!

00:05:57.214 --> 00:05:58.675
-[objects clatter]
-[both clamoring]

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:08.402
[Kiruko sighs]

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:11.701
Wow. My parkour skills are on point.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.582
[both gasp]

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.087
[both] There's a freaking bear down there!

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.676
You have no idea
how scary that was for me.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.055
I thought I was just gonna do
the Maru Touch,

00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:24.686
but what I did was literally poke a bear.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:26.230
I saw death today.

00:06:26.313 --> 00:06:29.278
-I stared at it from this close!
-I'm so sorry!

00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:31.908
That guy told us it was a monster,
so I thought--

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.912
It's not your fault, or that guy's fault.

00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:37.294
It basically is a monster. Look at it!

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:41.511
I mean, yeah, it's huge and feral,
and hungry,

00:06:41.594 --> 00:06:44.642
but at least it can't climb ladders.
A gorilla would be way worse.

00:06:46.103 --> 00:06:47.480
[groans]

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.494
[Kiruko] Amazing.

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:56.206
It's gonna get cold soon.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.672
Oh, hey. Where did the bear go?

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:03.387
It was circling the place like a big
furry buzzard, but now it's gone.

00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:04.891
Let's go before it comes back.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.405
I only have one round left
if the fourth shot works.

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:15.495
-And do you think it's gonna?
-Um…

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:17.165
I'll warm up the battery.

00:07:22.133 --> 00:07:24.387
-Uh-oh.
-"Uh-oh" what?

00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:29.356
So, bad news.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.567
I dropped the battery.

00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:33.532
But the good news is-- Uh--

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:36.328
[crying] The good news is-- Uh--

00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:38.165
There is no good news, is there?

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:42.006
Oh, come on. That is a long way down.

00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:44.469
-Go get it.
-Oh, yeah, right.

00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:46.306
What if that bear's
still hanging around somewhere?

00:07:48.352 --> 00:07:49.647
[Kiruko] Look at me, Maru.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.156
What do you see?
Am I a woman, or am I a man?

00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:55.324
What?

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.911
Where did that come from?

00:07:56.995 --> 00:07:57.997
[Kiruko] Hmm?

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.463
I mean, I'm sorry, dude,
but you look like a girl.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:06.096
Are you gonna tell me this was a test
and I've failed now, or what?

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.182
[Kiruko exclaims]

00:08:07.766 --> 00:08:09.770
I'll let you touch my boobs
if you go get--

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:13.820
[Kiruko] Oh, you jumped?

00:08:13.904 --> 00:08:15.866
Oh, my God, you are so stupid!

00:08:18.287 --> 00:08:20.082
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.460
[gasps] Look out!

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:23.130
-[howling]
-It's back!

00:08:23.214 --> 00:08:25.468
[grunting]

00:08:27.472 --> 00:08:29.602
-[growling]
-[Maru groans]

00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:34.444
Damn thing was waiting for us.

00:08:35.238 --> 00:08:36.866
It definitely won't leave us alone.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.749
So either we just live here now,
or we try to kill it.

00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:45.592
[Kiruko] Yeah, about that…
I gotta tell ya,

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:48.347
the only reason
I'm not bear chow right now

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.434
is because
the adrenaline rush helped me climb.

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:52.606
There's no way I can get back down.

00:08:53.608 --> 00:08:54.652
Sorry, what?

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:58.409
Listen, normal people
aren't spider monkeys like you, okay?

00:08:58.492 --> 00:09:00.371
It's a miracle I even made it up here.

00:09:00.914 --> 00:09:02.333
So, here's the plan.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.712
You're gonna take the Kiru-Beam,

00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:07.135
shimmy on down there, and one-hit-KO
that bear in the face.

00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:10.099
Then I'll jump down and use the
bear's corpse to cushion my fall.

00:09:12.395 --> 00:09:16.613
Good news is, it's a regular animal.
All you need is one shot to the head.

00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:21.246
Okay, so props for creativity on your
plan, but one flaw.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.212
There's no freaking way I'll hit its head.
I can't shoot like you.

00:09:25.922 --> 00:09:28.135
Am I really that good of a shot?

00:09:28.218 --> 00:09:29.847
Are you being serious?

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.354
I have seen you shoot a power pole
while climbing a fence,

00:09:33.437 --> 00:09:35.692
and wing a dude in the arm
while running away.

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:38.447
So I'm-- I'm good at this?

00:09:38.531 --> 00:09:39.867
Well, yeah. Of course you are.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.080
I would have died at least five times
already without you.

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:47.048
What's wrong?

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:51.473
You think I'm good?

00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:53.978
[Haruki] <i>I'll be okay,</i>
<i>I have my gun, remember?</i>

00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:55.774
[Robin] <i>Did you think</i>
<i>I was playing around?</i>

00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:57.485
<i>When I tell you to stay put, you do it!</i>

00:09:57.569 --> 00:09:59.322
[Haruki] <i>It's plenty of time.</i>
<i>I've got this.</i>

00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:03.455
-[Kiruko] Okay.
-Hmm?

00:10:04.082 --> 00:10:05.752
We're gonna make a new plan.

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:12.558
<i>First, we'll get ourselves warmed up,</i>
<i>while we wait for the bear to wander away.</i>

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:16.231
-[Maru] <i>And once it does?</i>
-<i>That's where you come in.</i>

00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:17.943
<i>Climb down while it's distracted.</i>

00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:20.156
[groans]

00:10:21.324 --> 00:10:24.080
[Kiruko] <i>As soon as you land,</i>
<i>it's trust fall time for me.</i>

00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:29.759
[whimpers, screams]

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.731
<i>After you catch me,</i>
<i>run away as fast as you can.</i>

00:10:37.608 --> 00:10:40.154
[Maru] <i>What about you?</i>
<i>What if the fourth shot won't fire?</i>

00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:42.576
[growling]

00:10:44.037 --> 00:10:46.166
[Kiruko] <i>If that happens…</i>

00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:50.801
<i>Then I'll make sure to hold it off</i>
<i>until you get away.</i>

00:10:58.148 --> 00:10:59.275
[squelching]

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:08.335
[sighs deeply]

00:11:09.755 --> 00:11:13.178
[panting]

00:11:16.978 --> 00:11:19.692
[gasps] Why the hell didn't you run away?

00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:23.783
Did you seriously think
I'd follow your terrible plan,

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:25.871
and just let a bear maul you to death?

00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:26.956
That hurts, man.

00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:31.757
[chuckles] You underestimate me.

00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:34.262
I knew the shot would go off
the whole time.

00:11:34.345 --> 00:11:35.557
Yeah?

00:11:36.517 --> 00:11:39.565
The battery had the power
of your horny energy.

00:11:39.648 --> 00:11:42.821
-It was your idea. You can't pick on me.
-[laughs]

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:45.117
-Sis, stop it!
-[Kiruko laughing]

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:49.459
[bystander 1] Iwata! Come on, wake up!

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:50.587
Iwata!

00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:54.344
-[Totori] Iwata…
-[bystander 2] Shimomoto didn't make it.

00:11:54.427 --> 00:11:55.555
-[bystander 3] Totori.
-Huh?

00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:58.477
Tell me about the people
who brought him here.

00:11:59.187 --> 00:12:01.441
They just said their names
were of no importance,

00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:02.819
and were gone on the breeze.

00:12:02.903 --> 00:12:05.742
-[bystander 1] Seriously?
-Who the hell were they?

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.537
They took that bear on all alone?

00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:12.463
-I was hoping to meet them.
-[bystander 2] Same here.

00:12:12.547 --> 00:12:14.425
[bystander 3] Since when do bears
even live here, anyway?

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.054
Man, I love animals.

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:19.268
Their bodies don't disappear,
and we can eat them.

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:21.774
Okay, Maru.

00:12:21.857 --> 00:12:24.362
I got tricked back there,
and I'm gonna tell you how.

00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:25.782
Wait, we got tricked?

00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:28.997
You know those vigilantes
we met in the tent city?

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:34.633
Well, they're bandits,
and they lured us right into a trap.

00:12:35.342 --> 00:12:37.346
How could those guys have lured us?

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.727
100% safe water?

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.689
-[Maru] <i>Oh.</i>
-<i>Yeah.</i>

00:12:41.772 --> 00:12:44.945
<i>I bet their plan was to block the entrance</i>
<i>to that underground passage</i>

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:46.239
<i>once we got close.</i>

00:12:46.824 --> 00:12:49.203
The map-seller was definitely
in on it too.

00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:53.253
Are you saying the whole map
is useless lies we can't trust, then?

00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:56.176
I assume some of it's real, but who knows?

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:59.600
That's enough regret for now.
Let's get some rest.

00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:02.856
I know we didn't plan on staying,
but we're here now.

00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:07.574
Maru, aren't you gonna go to your room?
You know, she gave us two.

00:13:07.657 --> 00:13:09.243
I'll see you in the morning.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.500
[Maru]
Isn't there something you're forgetting?

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.045
[Kiruko] Huh?

00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:18.805
You and I had a deal.
And I made good on my end of it, Sis.

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:24.107
-[Kiruko] Uh…
-I put my life on the line.

00:13:26.277 --> 00:13:28.281
Time to let me touch your boobs.

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:35.505
[Kiruko] <i>My sister's hair used to be</i>
<i>straight and black.</i>

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:40.682
<i>Apparently, sometimes your hair can change</i>
<i>after you get injured</i>

00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:42.894
<i>or you go through a major stress.</i>

00:13:42.978 --> 00:13:46.694
That could be why
I started growing this dry, red hair,

00:13:46.777 --> 00:13:48.865
that looks nothing like hers used to.

00:13:49.448 --> 00:13:52.204
But I think it's a warning from my sister:

00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:55.168
"You'd better not mess with my body."

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.881
Know what I mean?

00:13:56.964 --> 00:13:58.425
[Maru] Cool story.

00:13:59.176 --> 00:14:00.763
Now take off your jacket.

00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:04.312
I mean, it's your call, dude.

00:14:04.395 --> 00:14:06.984
Just remember that
this is whose boobs you're touching.

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:08.153
This guy right here.

00:14:08.236 --> 00:14:09.865
But as long as you're cool with that,

00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:13.371
I'll hold up my end of the deal as a man
'cause that's what men do.

00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:14.750
So keep that in mind.

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:17.547
-[Maru grunts]
-[Kiruko squeals] Whoa!

00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:20.637
[Kiruko] Okay, let's set some
ground rules first, all right?

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.724
Like how many seconds you-- [screams]

00:14:23.517 --> 00:14:25.354
[both]
<i>Well, that sure sounded like a girl.</i>

00:14:25.437 --> 00:14:26.607
[door opens]

00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:28.694
Hey, lovebirds.

00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:40.510
What part of "the cleanest futons in town"
don't you understand?

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:43.264
-Come on, perv. Let's go.
-Wait!

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.022
[whimpering]

00:14:47.607 --> 00:14:48.818
Now that that's done,

00:14:50.697 --> 00:14:52.909
how about you give me a try?

00:14:55.414 --> 00:15:00.257
800K, or you can fork over
your solar-powered light. What do you say?

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.929
So you did go through our stuff after all.

00:15:03.013 --> 00:15:05.392
Well, yeah. But I didn't take anything.

00:15:05.475 --> 00:15:07.271
So, what's your deal?

00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:10.068
Want me to keep
the bandana on during or no?

00:15:10.152 --> 00:15:13.826
Oh, my name's Totori, by the way.
I don't know my last name.

00:15:13.909 --> 00:15:17.416
[stammering] No… Bad--
Thanks, but no thanks to all of this.

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.506
For your information,
I like older girls and-- [gasps]

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.303
-Oh.
-[giggles]

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:25.307
[heart beating]

00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:34.158
-[Maru gasps]
-[Totori shrieks]

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.162
Are you a--

00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:38.709
Hey, Sis! Get in here now!

00:15:38.793 --> 00:15:40.295
[Totori] Ugh! What are you doing?

00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:43.176
-Get off!
-[Maru] Stay still. Don't move.

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:45.347
-Hurry up, Sis!
-Hey! What's the matter?

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.103
-Sis, I got in!
-Ow, that hurts. Stop it.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.614
You got in where?

00:15:53.697 --> 00:15:55.827
[gasps]

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.799
What the hell have you done?

00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:04.803
No…

00:16:05.847 --> 00:16:09.019
[narrator] <i>Maru realized that</i>
<i>no explanation would ever be enough</i>

00:16:09.103 --> 00:16:11.399
<i>to save him from this humiliation.</i>

00:16:11.482 --> 00:16:15.323
<i>The misunderstanding was as deep and dark</i>
<i>as the gaping pit of despair</i>

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:16.827
<i>that swallowed his soul.</i>

00:16:18.622 --> 00:16:20.918
[medical robot]
<i>No illnesses have been detected.</i>

00:16:22.212 --> 00:16:25.177
So, there's nothing wrong? What a relief.

00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:28.308
<i>Your body is showing signs of fatigue.</i>

00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:30.187
<i>A nap is advised at this time.</i>

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.191
[students chattering]

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:42.670
[gasps]

00:16:45.718 --> 00:16:46.970
Who's there?

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:51.062
Uh… Wait, what?

00:16:55.655 --> 00:16:57.575
[gasps, screams]

00:16:58.076 --> 00:16:59.913
[breathing heavily]

00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:02.334
A-Asura?

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.054
What are you good at, Tokio?

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.728
[Tokio] What do you mean?

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.742
Where'd you go?

00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:21.289
[gasps]

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.923
[shrieks] No! What's happening to me?

00:17:26.007 --> 00:17:27.802
Doctor, help me!

00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:29.597
Doctor!

00:17:31.727 --> 00:17:32.770
[gasps]

00:17:36.653 --> 00:17:37.655
A dream?

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.868
[sighs, whimpers]

00:17:42.372 --> 00:17:43.792
So, how are you feeling?

00:17:44.335 --> 00:17:46.130
[Tokio] Uh, o-okay, I think.

00:17:49.554 --> 00:17:50.556
Hmm.

00:17:51.642 --> 00:17:54.063
We are so sorry again.

00:17:54.564 --> 00:17:56.275
[Maru] This place is my heaven now.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:59.741
I promise I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to earn your forgiveness.

00:17:59.824 --> 00:18:01.077
Oh, my.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.999
This is fun,
but the groveling is kind of a lot.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.212
-You can get up already. Come on.
-[both sigh]

00:18:06.295 --> 00:18:08.257
This guy didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:10.053
I swear, the whole thing was my idea.

00:18:10.136 --> 00:18:13.101
Thank you so much.

00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:15.815
[Totori]
I mean, you can ask about my past,

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:18.319
but I'm just a typical orphan.

00:18:18.946 --> 00:18:20.700
You know, I don't even remember a time

00:18:20.783 --> 00:18:23.079
it wasn't just me and the vigilantes
out here.

00:18:23.664 --> 00:18:27.212
You were born after the Great Disaster
and raised by strangers?

00:18:27.295 --> 00:18:29.843
So then your parents might be alive
out there somewhere.

00:18:30.636 --> 00:18:33.391
Well, it's not like meeting them
would do me any good.

00:18:34.143 --> 00:18:36.982
For me, it's all about what's profitable.

00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:39.445
And anything that feels good
makes you a lot of money.

00:18:40.196 --> 00:18:43.327
First, I'm gonna rent out
more and more clean rooms and futons.

00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:46.668
Then, I'm gonna have a whole bunch of sex
with the customers who aren't skeezy.

00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:49.298
And then I'm gonna be the King of Hotels!

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:55.561
[Maru] I don't get how I was able to
go into a human like that.

00:18:55.644 --> 00:18:58.776
I mean, I'm glad that
everything got cleared up but still.

00:19:00.195 --> 00:19:04.036
I thought I was gonna have to kill her
with the Maru-Touch to prove it happened.

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:06.248
I was really freaked out
for a minute there.

00:19:06.332 --> 00:19:07.543
Hold up.

00:19:07.627 --> 00:19:09.379
What happened to the Failure Dive?

00:19:09.463 --> 00:19:11.551
See, I knew you were gonna rub that in.

00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:14.682
As soon as I said it, I thought,
"Sis won't let that go."

00:19:14.766 --> 00:19:15.768
And I was right.

00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:17.647
[Kiruko] Oh, now I remember.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.899
Fatal Dive!

00:19:18.982 --> 00:19:20.653
[Maru sobbing] Leave me alone!

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.201
[broom sweeping]

00:19:24.284 --> 00:19:26.247
[Kiruko] Well, see you.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.627
Those futons were really comfy.

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.340
Where's all that energy
you had last night?

00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:33.427
You're looking kinda rough today.

00:19:34.597 --> 00:19:36.768
I heard the boss died.

00:19:36.852 --> 00:19:39.899
-[Maru gasps]
-It happened early this morning.

00:19:40.568 --> 00:19:43.281
You guys saved him but he's still…

00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:47.790
He was always so strong,
and I didn't even think he could die.

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:52.299
He was always a really good boss to us,
you know?

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:56.975
But it's fine. Death's just part of life.
[sniffles]

00:20:01.442 --> 00:20:02.862
[Kiruko] Wanna come with us?

00:20:04.489 --> 00:20:05.491
Hmm.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.580
Mm-mmm.

00:20:08.164 --> 00:20:09.166
[Kiruko] Okay.

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:16.765
Do it! Become the King of Hotels.

00:20:23.695 --> 00:20:27.703
I guess even a guy like that
can end up with people who care about him.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.505
You know,
if I was born and raised in this area,

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.552
I might have been one of his crew.

00:22:39.382 --> 00:22:41.220
You're looking a lot better
than last time.

00:22:41.804 --> 00:22:45.394
I was just worried about something.
But I'm great now.

00:22:45.896 --> 00:22:47.023
I'm glad.

00:22:57.335 --> 00:22:59.297
DETECTING DETAILED POINTS

00:23:03.264 --> 00:23:05.644
So I was right. This is it.

00:23:06.688 --> 00:23:09.484
There's only one person
that footprint could have belonged to.

00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:11.071
And it's Tokio.

00:23:12.323 --> 00:23:14.912
But how? Without anyone noticing?

00:23:17.458 --> 00:23:21.509
[Tokio] I know how this sounds,
but I saw Asura's ghost today.

00:23:21.592 --> 00:23:23.555
-Really?
-Maybe.

00:23:23.638 --> 00:23:25.308
It might have been a dream.

00:23:26.226 --> 00:23:28.606
You liked Asura a lot, didn't you?

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:30.443
Yeah.

00:23:32.573 --> 00:23:33.575
I did.

00:23:33.658 --> 00:23:36.956
But it was a different kind of love
than the love I feel for you.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:38.793
You know that, right?

00:23:42.091 --> 00:23:43.093
[giggles]
