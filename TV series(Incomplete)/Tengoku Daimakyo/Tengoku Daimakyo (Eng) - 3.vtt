Can't. This little pup knows

Huh. I don't remember putting out
a want ad for babysitters.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.672
Robin, these guys have been making

Did you think you could come after me
with a tiny scrap of metal like that?

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.388
Haruki, whenever you get in a fight,

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.602
try not to look
right into your opponent's eyes.

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:19.649
Cowards will glare at you
and try to psych you out.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.945
It's a sure sign of all bark and no bite.

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:25.953
If you want to win,
look at their collar instead.

00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:28.458
Then, feel the ground beneath you.

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:30.671
Make sure you have solid footing.

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:32.925
Hmm.

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.349
Keep your eyes sharp and you'll come out
on top, nine times out of ten.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.396
Guess we should hand them over
to the boss.

00:03:39.898 --> 00:03:42.402
Good work. You deserve a reward.

00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:44.490
Whatever you want, you got it.

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.243

00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:52.255
[Haruki] We're back!

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:53.509
What kind of meat is that?

00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:56.765
[friend] Monkey, crow and mouse, I think.

00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:01.065
Oh, whoa. Cool jacket, dude.

00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:02.694
-Robin gave it to me.
-[chuckles]

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:04.446
-[chuckles]
-It's kinda baggy.

00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:05.991
He'll grow into it soon enough.

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:10.668
Wow. Oh, it's so nice.
I wish I had something of his. Lucky.

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.337
How about we get you his pants then?

00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:14.551
They might fit if we cut 'em off
at the knee.

00:04:14.634 --> 00:04:16.972
[friend] My legs are not that short.
I'm almost your height.

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:18.057
[all laugh]

00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:19.936
Is lunch ready yet?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.107
-Hmm?
-Sis, you're back!

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.319
[Haruki] So? Where did you finish?

00:04:24.403 --> 00:04:27.284
I was disqualified. Ugh.
Fell out of my kart.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.371
-What?
-Are you hurt?

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:31.960
No, I'm fine.
The other drivers went around me.

00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:34.131
And Doc was there.

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:36.762
Don't just brush it off.
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:38.932
[Doc] You really should drive
more carefully out there.

00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:41.062
Yeah, yeah. I know.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:43.984
Oh, wait a sec. Check this out.

00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:45.487
[grunts]

00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:49.036
I finally attached that flash
to my camera.

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:51.583
Now we can take all sorts of cool photos
to sell. [giggles]

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.296
Oh, why don't you get
one of me and Doc, then?

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.800
I don't do pictures.

00:04:55.883 --> 00:04:56.968
Say cheese!

00:04:59.306 --> 00:05:00.433
[giggles]

00:05:00.518 --> 00:05:02.522
-I gotta go.
-Mmm.

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:03.816
[Kiriko] Thanks for everything.

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:08.199
Hey, listen, man. There's a rumor that
Doc's not just researching Man-eaters,

00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:10.538
he's doing weird stuff to people too.

00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:11.748
What?

00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:13.585
[friend] Robin said he's looking into it.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.883
But in the meantime, maybe don't let
Kiriko get too close to him.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.762
[sighs]

00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:31.078
[Kiriko] Haruki, are you warm enough?

00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:33.374
Yeah. What about you?

00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:34.459
Not even.

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:37.132
Oh, then wanna come up here?

00:05:39.052 --> 00:05:41.683
[gasps] I-I didn't think
you actually would.

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:43.060
[footsteps]

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:47.110
What's happening?

00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:49.072
Man-eater in the third district.

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:51.703
But it isn't coming this way,
so just go back to sleep.

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:54.416
-You coming?
-Yep.

00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:57.715
[Haruki grunts]

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.969
Ah, Haruki.

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:01.388
I'll be okay.

00:06:01.472 --> 00:06:02.975
I have my gun, remember?

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:06.273
And Robin would do the same
for either of us.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.987

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.250

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.811
[person] Nice shooting.

00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:26.690
You're the talk of the town.

00:06:26.773 --> 00:06:28.735
Heard you killed a Man-eater last week.

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:30.280
Hmm.

00:06:30.363 --> 00:06:34.747
Did you think I was playing around?
When I tell you to stay put, you do it.

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:37.252
I upset Robin though.

00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:42.137
He lost a sister about my age
in the Great Disaster…

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.222
[children laughing]

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:44.474
…And ever since then,

00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:49.652
he's been overprotective.
Of me and Kiriko.

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.535
[gasps] Wait! What time is it?

00:06:53.618 --> 00:06:55.664
It's, uh, hang on.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.918
Which one of these is accurate again?

00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:01.258
-Uh, that one.
-Yep. It's 2:20.

00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:04.264
-I gotta go! Kiriko's race starts at 3:00.
-Hmm.

00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:05.349
[Haruki] Thanks!

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:07.437
[person] Robin may be overprotective,

00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:09.609
but that kid's obsessed with his sister.

00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:11.361

[Haruki] <i>Hey, guys</i>.

00:12:49.287 --> 00:12:50.289
<i>Hey, Sis</i>…

00:12:54.422 --> 00:12:55.424
[clinks]

00:12:56.969 --> 00:12:58.013
…<i>I feel</i>

00:12:59.348 --> 00:13:01.269
<i>so hot.</i>

00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:05.444
<i>Kiri--</i>

00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:07.783
[whispers] <i>ko</i>.

00:13:07.866 --> 00:13:08.951
[music continues]

00:13:17.552 --> 00:13:18.930
[gunshot]

00:13:19.013 --> 00:13:20.140
[music ends]

00:13:23.606 --> 00:13:25.067
[groans]

00:13:36.297 --> 00:13:37.509
[echoing] Kiriko.

00:13:37.592 --> 00:13:38.594
[strains]

00:13:41.224 --> 00:13:43.855
[shrieks] Sis!

00:13:45.274 --> 00:13:47.027
[gasping, panting]

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:48.990
[breathing shakily]

00:13:49.908 --> 00:13:50.910
[grunts]

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.252
Doctor! Takehaya's awake!

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:17.171
[patient] I heard there was
another Man-eater in town,

00:14:17.254 --> 00:14:19.843
and apparently that monster ate a kid
this time.

00:14:20.344 --> 00:14:21.513
That's horrifying.

00:14:21.597 --> 00:14:22.766
Uh, hello.

00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:25.145
[gasps]

00:14:25.228 --> 00:14:26.356
[grunts]

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:31.199
[whimpers, gasps]

00:14:33.537 --> 00:14:34.915
Sis?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.463
Is that… [gasps, pants]

00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:41.344
Stop. What is going on?

00:14:41.427 --> 00:14:43.056
-[nurse] The patient--
-[Haruki screams]

00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:46.020
Excuse me, Miss K.

00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:48.149
-You shouldn't be out of bed yet!
-[sobs] Get away!

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:50.445
[shrieks] I'm Haruki! Where's my sister?

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.784
-Tranquilizer!
-[nurse 2] Got it!

00:14:52.867 --> 00:14:55.455
-[Haruki] I want Kiriko! I want my sister!
-[nurse 3] It's all right.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.711
[Haruki shrieks] Kiriko! Kiriko!

00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:08.189
[nurse] It sounds to me that maybe
the shock of her brother's death

00:15:08.273 --> 00:15:10.987
has led her to believe she is her brother.

00:15:11.613 --> 00:15:12.741
That poor girl.

00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:14.661
[Haruki] The doctor.

00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:18.293
The doctor that performed the surgery.

00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:20.088
He'll know what's going on.

00:15:20.673 --> 00:15:22.134
Let me see him.

00:15:22.217 --> 00:15:25.140
I wish I could,
but once you were in stable condition,

00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:26.727
well, I'm afraid he left town.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:27.937
[gasps]

00:15:28.021 --> 00:15:30.568
You were nearly dead
when they first brought you in.

00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:32.446
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.247
It breaks my heart
that we lost your little brother,

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:40.170
but if the doctor hadn't been here,

00:15:40.253 --> 00:15:42.091
I believe you both would be dead.

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.178
We couldn't have saved you without him.

00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:47.936
[Haruki] <i>I don't get it.</i>

00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:51.944
<i>Last time I saw her, she was crying,</i>

00:15:52.612 --> 00:15:54.281
<i>but she was still alive.</i>

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:57.454
<i>So, did the Man-eater kill her?</i>

00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:00.293
<i>It obviously didn't eat her body.</i>

00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:04.553
<i>I do know one thing.</i>

00:16:04.636 --> 00:16:08.101
<i>I am definitely still Haruki.</i>

00:16:08.184 --> 00:16:09.478
<i>The proof?</i>

00:16:09.563 --> 00:16:14.071
<i>The sorrow splintering through me,</i>
<i>knowing that Kiriko is gone.</i>

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:19.456
<i>And, this weird faint comfort</i>
<i>in having inherited her body.</i>

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.337
<i>You know, at least there's this.</i>

00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:28.559
<i>It took about four-and-a-half months</i>
<i>for my sister's wounds to heal enough</i>

00:16:28.642 --> 00:16:30.688
<i>that I could get out of bed again.</i>

00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:32.525
<i>Shock kept me going the first time.</i>

00:16:37.075 --> 00:16:40.040
<i>Robin was investigating</i>
<i>this kind of stuff, wasn't he?</i>

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.795
<i>He'll be able to figure this out.</i>

00:16:43.254 --> 00:16:45.593
<i>He'll know how I wound up like this.</i>

00:16:45.676 --> 00:16:47.847
<i>And why my sister had to die.</i>

00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:51.647
-[Haruki] Excuse me.
-Huh?

00:16:52.231 --> 00:16:55.529
I'm trying to find Robin Inazaki
from the Race Association?

00:16:55.613 --> 00:16:58.409
[sighs] You won't have much luck.

00:17:00.121 --> 00:17:03.002
Sometime around September, October
last year,

00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:05.508
pretty sure that guy was murdered…

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.096
[panting]

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:10.893
…<i>We had a bunch of folks go missing</i>
<i>over the last year.</i>

00:17:11.394 --> 00:17:14.191
<i>Looks like he got tangled up</i>
<i>trying to investigate.</i>

00:17:14.275 --> 00:17:16.362
<i>And then, just like that, poof</i>,

00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:17.949
<i>he disappeared, too.</i>

00:17:18.784 --> 00:17:21.205
[panting, gulps]

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.253
[Haruki] Ken! Ran!

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.382
[shouts] Director! Anyone!

00:17:26.465 --> 00:17:28.512
[gasping, breathing shakily]

00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:33.564
[gasps]

00:17:33.647 --> 00:17:35.442
Hey, sir? [stammers]

00:17:35.526 --> 00:17:37.947
Please! What happened
to the orphanage here?

00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:40.160
-Oh, they packed up and left.
-[gasps]

00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.876
[person] The racer who was earning
their money died in some kind of accident

00:17:44.418 --> 00:17:46.923
then their leader went missing
not too long after.

00:17:47.007 --> 00:17:48.719
I guess with all that bad luck,

00:17:48.802 --> 00:17:51.015
they just decided
to give up on this place.

00:17:56.192 --> 00:17:58.196
[door opens, creaks]

00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:02.079
[door closes]

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.420
[equipment clatters]

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:14.395
[Haruki] Sis.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.944
Robin. [sobs]

00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:20.866
[gasps]

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.329
[kart-race employee]
<i>Then, just like that, poof,</i>

00:18:23.413 --> 00:18:24.916
<i>he disappeared too.</i>

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:27.714
[person] <i>…then their leader went missing</i>
<i>not too long after.</i>

00:18:27.797 --> 00:18:30.761
[gasps] "Disappeared"?

00:18:30.845 --> 00:18:32.055
"Missing"?

00:18:32.139 --> 00:18:35.437
So no one actually has any proof
that Robin is dead.

00:18:39.445 --> 00:18:41.031
[voice breaking] There's no way.

00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:44.581
[sobs] He has to be out there somewhere!

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:47.837
The doctor.

00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:50.300
The doctor has the answer to everything.

00:18:50.383 --> 00:18:54.433
He'll know where Robin is,
why my sister had to die…

00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:55.686
[crying]

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.650
…and why I have to live inside her body!

00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:04.579
[Kiruko] <i>After that,</i>
<i>I moved from town to town,</i>

00:19:04.662 --> 00:19:06.499
<i>taking security jobs,</i>

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.044
<i>hoping to run into them,</i>

00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:10.465
<i>and I learned to be fully self-reliant.</i>

00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:15.601
Four years later, I met you in Nakano

00:19:15.684 --> 00:19:17.688
and now here we are.

00:19:24.536 --> 00:19:27.499
This is the first time I ever told
anybody all that.

00:19:29.504 --> 00:19:31.215
[Maru] I just have one question.

00:19:32.384 --> 00:19:35.558
Would you prefer
if I stopped calling you "Sis"?

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:37.143
That's all?

00:19:37.227 --> 00:19:38.730
[chuckles] Don't worry about it.

00:19:38.814 --> 00:19:40.776
You've been calling me that
for, like, a month now.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.279
Pretty sure we're both used to it.

00:19:43.364 --> 00:19:47.247
Anyway, there you go. Surprise.
You have to think of me as a man now.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.627
You can't expect me to adjust that quick.

00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:53.969
[groans]

00:19:54.052 --> 00:19:56.850
But listen, you're
a pretty good-looking kid, you know?

00:19:56.933 --> 00:19:58.937
I'm sure you're gonna find
someone else soon.

00:19:59.021 --> 00:20:02.110
I'll never find another girl
who gets me like you.

00:20:02.193 --> 00:20:04.991
Yeah, 'cause I got
a guy brain up here, remember?

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.291
[Maru] So that photo
of Jane Inamura, whatever?

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:11.003
Robin Inazaki.

00:20:12.339 --> 00:20:14.176
[Maru] What's the deal with you and him?

00:20:16.013 --> 00:20:17.390
[sighing] What's the deal?

00:20:17.892 --> 00:20:21.482
Well, we're basically family, since we
grew up in the same house together.

00:20:21.983 --> 00:20:23.361
But he's also a friend.

00:20:24.404 --> 00:20:25.991
And I really admire him.

00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:27.494
[groans]

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:30.208
For the love of--
He is a dude I look up to

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.045
because we're both dudes.
What don't you get?

00:20:32.128 --> 00:20:35.051
It's not that I don't get it.
It's that it doesn't make any sense.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.470
[groans]

00:20:36.554 --> 00:20:38.976
Maybe a good night's sleep
will sort your head out.

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:42.942
[Maru] Yeah. Maybe when I wake up,
this'll all be a dream.

00:20:44.194 --> 00:20:45.864
[shrieking]

00:20:45.948 --> 00:20:47.785
Come on! What is it now?

00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:49.539
-[whimpering]
-What is it?

00:20:49.622 --> 00:20:52.920
There was a huge fish or something
crawling across the window.

00:20:53.004 --> 00:20:54.006
Did he say "fish"?

00:20:55.926 --> 00:20:57.137
Look at that.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.101
The outside of the window is wet,
even though it's not raining.

00:21:00.853 --> 00:21:01.896
Okay.

00:21:02.606 --> 00:21:05.779
Hey, Maru, go and tell the captain
to keep an eye out for anything unusual--

00:21:05.863 --> 00:21:08.117
-[clattering]
-[both whimper]

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.453
[thrumming]

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:16.425
A Man-eater.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.944
[water bubbling]

00:22:50.948 --> 00:22:52.952
[Kuku grunting]

00:22:54.496 --> 00:22:55.791
[chuckles]

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:58.295
What is that? A baby?

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.424
Can I have this one when you're done?

00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:04.725
No. I already promised it to Tokio.
Want the next one?

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:06.228
Yeah. Okay.

00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:08.232
This one is kinda goofy anyway.

00:23:08.315 --> 00:23:09.902
[chuckles] Goofy, huh?

00:23:09.986 --> 00:23:13.827
Well, yeah. It's good and all,
but proper babies don't have-- [shrieks]

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.125
<i>Climbing on tables is</i>
<i>a violation of school rules, Kuku.</i>

00:23:17.208 --> 00:23:20.339
What's your deal? Stop annoying Kona
already and come with me.

00:23:20.423 --> 00:23:21.509
[grunts]

00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:28.606
Listen. You don't have to be so nasty
about his drawings, you know.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.234
I was telling him I like 'em!

00:23:30.318 --> 00:23:33.282
But real babies?
They don't look like that.

00:23:35.202 --> 00:23:38.500
They don't have normal faces.
Just a big eye.

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:40.129
[chuckles]

00:23:40.212 --> 00:23:42.008
<i>Want to go and see one with me?</i>
