[protesters chanting]
No more human experiments!

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:44.751
[protester 1] You can't cut people up
for your stupid little experiments!

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:45.837
People don't do that!

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.632
FREE THE PATIENTS
STOP HUMAN EXPERIMENTS

00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:50.053

That's right. You're all monsters!

-[groaning]
-[protester 3] How could they do this?

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:12.306
[protester 4] Is she okay?
This is unbelievable.

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.603
-[chattering]
-That's foul!

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:15.980
[all] Violence is wrong!

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:17.776
Violence is wrong!

00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:21.533
One little rock,
and all hell breaks loose, huh?

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:25.373
Oh, yeah. Most of the time,
that's all it takes with these weirdos.

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:28.631
Although, they do seem
a little extra weird today.

00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:31.219
Look. They're retreating already.

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:34.266
Normally, they'd at least stick around
and yell for a while.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.189
That makes it sound like
they wanted that to happen.

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:38.526
But why?

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.865
Well, it could be a tactic
to gain leverage.

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.119
They may use that injury to make demands.

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:47.417
They can't do that. They threw it first.

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:48.838
-[sighs]
-Hmm?

00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:51.760
You think reason actually matters
to people like them?

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:55.475
When they do it, it's virtuous.
When others do it, it's an "attack."

00:02:56.477 --> 00:03:00.235
[protestors chattering]

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:03.491
-[protester 5] Come on. Let us see her.
-[protestor 6] Excuse me. Please.

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:04.786
I'm coming through.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.915
[chattering continues]

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:10.338
[panting]

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:13.428
[breathing heavily]

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:17.645
I was able to confirm
with our guard on watch.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.152
He said the monster in the basement
really is dead.

00:03:22.864 --> 00:03:24.283
[Kuwata] Is that so?

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:26.329
Then let's not waste time.

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.794
My friends, I have news.

00:03:30.713 --> 00:03:33.051
[sighs] Miss Mizuhashi…

00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:34.929
has passed away.

00:03:35.013 --> 00:03:36.725
[gasp, exclaim]

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:40.733
[wailing]

00:03:41.317 --> 00:03:45.450
[Kuwata] Let us all remember
that our leader was tortured, butchered.

00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:47.664
And yet, she refused to yield.

00:03:47.747 --> 00:03:48.999
She worked every day

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:53.299
to save the test subjects still held
captive by the villainous Immortal Order.

00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:56.222
They must answer for her murder!

00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:58.142
Grab your weapons!

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:00.146
[shouting]

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:02.944
Here goes nothing.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.831
[sighs]

00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:17.347
There you are.

00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:20.061
Hey, Doc.
My hand started squeaking real bad.

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:23.234
[metal hand squeaking]

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:28.119
[Usami] Have someone spray it
with oil or silicon spray.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:30.708
Just a little right here should be enough.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.254
[parent] Doctor.

00:04:33.337 --> 00:04:34.674
My daughter can't figure out

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:37.345
how to control the grip strength
of her prosthetic.

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:39.308
-Is there anything you can do?
-[grunts]

00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:42.105
No, ma'am. She'll get used to it.

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:43.984
Doctor, wait. I got a question.

00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:45.195
-Let's go.
-[gasps]

00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:47.240
Are you sure?

00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:49.078
It'll never end.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.627
<i>In here.</i>

00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:56.467
Please know
I don't want to ask this of you.

00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:59.557
But I need to know
if you can help her die.

00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:01.937
[machines beeping]

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:06.613
[Maru] Hey.

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.955
You think this is
what Mizuhashi was talking about?

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.419
[gasps, groans]

00:05:15.463 --> 00:05:19.848
[breathes heavily] Is this how
he's developed his treatments here?

00:05:27.028 --> 00:05:28.532
[gasps, groans]

00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:33.207
If you wanna let her die,
why don't you just turn off the machines?

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:37.550
[Usami] She'd become a monster,
like the one you just killed.

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:38.594
[both gasp]

00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:43.186
No. What?
She's going to become a Man-eater?

00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:46.776
Does that mean
that all Man-eaters are human?

00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:50.366
Well, they used to be, yes.

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:53.916
They were humans
who died of a particular disease.

00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:56.462
You can slow the progression.

00:05:56.546 --> 00:05:58.299
But it's not pretty.

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:01.723
All affected tissue
must be completely excised or amputated,

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:03.434
cut out to the very core.

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:09.154
Though despite even heroic efforts,
patients will relapse eventually.

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.658
Over and over.

00:06:12.327 --> 00:06:15.876
And when they do,
you have to amputate again.

00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:20.719
Once it became clear that her body
would no longer function on its own,

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:24.476
I assembled these devices
to help prolong her life.

00:06:25.478 --> 00:06:28.192
But we've been at this
for a long time now.

00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:33.494
And I believe
she's finally reached her limit.

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:39.966
If you could do to her
whatever you did in the basement,

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:43.890
she may be able to die with dignity
as a human.

00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:47.480
Uh…

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:51.238
[Usami] It's our only hope.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.742
[machines beeping]

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:20.923
It'll work.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.387
You can do it then?

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.976
I can, yeah, but what does she want?

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:30.483
She can communicate through that tablet.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:33.322
And she can hear us. So let's see.

00:07:52.443 --> 00:07:54.824
-[gasps]
-[sighs]

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.416
All right. Can she be moved outside?

00:08:00.084 --> 00:08:01.838
Not without her life support, no.

00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:02.923
[sighs]

00:08:07.098 --> 00:08:09.269
-[door opens]
-[Kiruko] Let's see.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.908
It's only this far.

00:08:16.618 --> 00:08:18.329
That's like, what, 30 feet?

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:23.255
We'll help move everything.

00:08:24.049 --> 00:08:26.345
Then we'll let her go. Do we have a deal?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.025
[Usami] Yes. That's right.

00:08:33.568 --> 00:08:35.029
Gently now.

00:08:35.112 --> 00:08:36.365
[Maru] Gently.

00:08:38.494 --> 00:08:40.707
[Usami] Keep that close to her, would you?

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:42.460
Yeah, okay. [grunts]

00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:46.134
-[Usami] And put this by her side as well.
-[Kiruko] Mmm.

00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:49.725
[groans] Too short. I need another cord.

00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:52.690
Would you go stand in her line of sight
for a moment?

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:55.779
She won't be able to hear anything
while I do this.

00:08:55.862 --> 00:08:56.990
Mmm.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:02.918
[grunts]

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:14.984

00:09:20.453 --> 00:09:22.165
[gasps] I'm sorry!

Calling me an idiot…

-[protestor 1] We gotta go around!
-[all shout]

00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:39.324
-Come on. There's another way this way.
-Let's go around!

00:09:39.407 --> 00:09:41.829
-Grab your weapons! Let's go!
-<i>They still don't suspect me, right?</i>

00:09:41.913 --> 00:09:43.374
Hey, guys!

00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:47.131
So, let's-- [grunts]

[protester 2] This traitor's
only the first to pay the price.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.673
-You're right. Let's get them!
-Miss Mizuhashi will be avenged!

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.177
Go do what must be done.

00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:12.725
-[protestors shouting]
-[Immortal Order member] Red alert!

00:10:12.808 --> 00:10:16.189
The Whiteshirts are on our doorstep,
and they're armed to the teeth!

00:10:16.273 --> 00:10:20.239
[grunts] Those maniacs.
So much for being nonviolent.

00:10:21.199 --> 00:10:25.667
Everyone, move upstairs!
Those who are mobile, assist the wounded!

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.388
[gasps] Whoa. What's going on up there?

00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:56.061
-[Usami] It doesn't matter.
-[gasps]

00:10:56.144 --> 00:10:57.438
[shouting continues]

00:10:57.523 --> 00:11:00.361
[protestor] Looks like a decoy!
Leave it, and let's go!

00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:04.077
[Hoshio continues breathing heavily]

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:16.686

[breathes shakily]

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.927
[Usami] Maybe it would've been easier
to just let her become a monster.

00:13:00.643 --> 00:13:04.777
I made her suffer
for so much longer than she ever deserved.

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.168
[sighs, gasps]

00:13:15.757 --> 00:13:18.721
Hey, Maru. Look at this.

THANK YOU

Did everyone make it? Is anyone else hurt?

00:14:44.726 --> 00:14:45.561
[chattering]

00:14:45.645 --> 00:14:48.859
Naito's dead.
He was the first to go confront them.

00:14:48.943 --> 00:14:50.237
Damn them.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.991
[sighs] Huh?

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:53.744
Doctor!

00:14:54.495 --> 00:14:55.832
[grunts] You're all right.

00:14:55.915 --> 00:14:59.506
Sorry, sir. Apparently Mizuhashi died,
so they all broke in screaming.

00:14:59.589 --> 00:15:01.969
Do we need to retrieve
Miss Hoshio's generators?

00:15:02.052 --> 00:15:03.263
We'll go back right now.

00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:09.651
No need. She's dead.

00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:10.737
[both gasp]

00:15:11.655 --> 00:15:12.699
-[grunts]
-She's dead.

00:15:13.534 --> 00:15:14.828
Don't tell me…

00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:16.080
Did they hurt her?

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.506
[Usami] No, she died a natural death.

00:15:26.852 --> 00:15:28.773
There should be a settlement here.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.319
Can you make it there before sundown?

00:15:31.402 --> 00:15:33.949
Maybe, but are you not coming with us?

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.168
I'll have the young guards escort me
once I give Hoshio a proper burial.

00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:40.630
You should all go on ahead.

-[patron grunting] Let's go.

00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:48.186
[patron 2] That was our home.
Why do we have to get chased out?

00:15:49.564 --> 00:15:51.735
[Maru] Because I killed that Hiruko
in the basement.

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:54.866
None of this
would've ever happened otherwise.

00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:58.666
-Maru--
-[Usami] It's fine.

00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:05.011
Almost all the facilities in that building
were made for her.

00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:06.974
And they're no longer necessary.

00:16:07.057 --> 00:16:08.811
But there are still wounded.

00:16:08.894 --> 00:16:11.733
There are still tons of people
who want to be treated by you.

00:16:14.196 --> 00:16:15.533
[Usami] I'm not a doctor.

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:19.456
I made someone a prosthetic hand
on a whim one day.

00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:20.751
And he spread the word.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.549
I don't even remember why I did that now.

00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:28.976
No, wait. Yes, I do.

00:16:30.938 --> 00:16:32.984
<i>It made her happy when I built things.</i>

00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:35.280
<i>It always did.</i>

00:16:38.369 --> 00:16:40.040
It was always about her.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.377
Not them.

00:16:45.383 --> 00:16:46.803
I am not a doctor.

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:54.318
[Kuwata] Incredible.

00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:57.992
Do you realize
what we can accomplish here?

00:16:58.619 --> 00:17:02.459
With this many power generators,
we could build a real city.

00:17:04.213 --> 00:17:07.595
A new capital for this broken world.

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:09.139
A new culture!

00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:14.024
<i>Let this be the end of childish factions.</i>

00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:20.245
<i>Under my steady leadership,</i>
<i>a new order, a new nation will rise!</i>

00:17:20.328 --> 00:17:22.750
<i>The future is ours!</i>

00:17:24.003 --> 00:17:25.005
[rumbles]

00:17:35.776 --> 00:17:37.530
[Kiruko] Uh, excuse me.

00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:38.616
Hmm?

00:17:38.699 --> 00:17:40.786
I really am sorry to bother you.

00:17:41.287 --> 00:17:43.667
But have you run into
either of these guys?

00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:45.588
The one on the left here is a doctor.

00:17:45.671 --> 00:17:47.842
[patron 3] Don't think I know him.

00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:49.763
Yeah, I would remember that scar.

00:17:49.846 --> 00:17:51.933
Features like that
are kind of hard to forget.

00:17:52.017 --> 00:17:55.816
He hasn't come by in the three years
I've been here, that's for certain.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.283
Mmm. But doesn't this handsome fella
look a lot like Dr. Inazaki?

00:18:00.785 --> 00:18:03.039
[gasps] What?

00:18:03.122 --> 00:18:06.713
Oh, yeah! You're right.
That is Dr. Inazaki.

00:18:06.797 --> 00:18:10.596
He spent some time with us not long before
the Whiteshirts started messing around.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.307
Maybe about two years ago.

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.854
Oh, yeah. Then one day, he just left.

00:18:14.938 --> 00:18:16.566
Didn't even say goodbye.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.529
[patron 4]
He had some surgical knowledge already,

00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:20.825
so he'd been studying
Dr. Usami's techniques.

00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:24.415
[patron 5] Always figured he left
to go help folks somewhere else.

00:18:24.498 --> 00:18:25.751
He was a good guy.

00:18:27.254 --> 00:18:28.423
Robin's alive.

00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:33.559
[sobbing]
<i>You're alive. I knew you had to be.</i>

00:18:34.769 --> 00:18:36.021
<i>I'm gonna find you.</i>

00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:37.399
<i>I have to see you!</i>

00:18:39.027 --> 00:18:40.948
-[Maru] Sis.
-[gasps]

00:18:43.787 --> 00:18:45.916
I asked if you really wanted
to escort Usami?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.169
Oh.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:48.964
I don't know.

00:18:49.047 --> 00:18:52.262
But if he can pay us in information,
I don't see why not.

00:18:52.345 --> 00:18:55.853
[sighs] That mean you're gonna
ask him about Robin?

00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:58.859
You-- Why do you always say it like that?

00:18:58.942 --> 00:19:00.236
Mmm.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.322
[grunts]

00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:05.455
[sighs]

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.379
Is Usami done up there yet?

00:19:10.173 --> 00:19:12.804
[crow screeching]

00:19:22.657 --> 00:19:24.117
[crow flapping]

00:20:12.297 --> 00:20:13.634
[hammer cocks]

00:20:20.355 --> 00:20:21.858
[gunshot]

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.862
[both gasp]

00:20:26.534 --> 00:20:30.500
-[panting]
-[footsteps approaching]

00:20:30.584 --> 00:20:33.548
-[door clangs]
-[panting]

00:20:45.823 --> 00:20:46.866
[gasps]

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.204
What-- [cries]

00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:51.458
Damn it.

00:20:55.383 --> 00:20:56.468
Maru?

00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:01.145
[Maru]
I'm the total opposite of guys like him.

00:21:02.523 --> 00:21:03.734
Or Robin.

00:21:05.654 --> 00:21:07.240
I can't help people.

00:21:08.744 --> 00:21:10.748
My hands only bring death!

00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:11.916
[sobs]

00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:14.922
[sobbing] Shut up.

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:18.722
Don't say that, you idiot.

00:21:20.391 --> 00:21:24.316
[crying] Don't you dare say that.
You hear me?

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:28.282
When you kill Man-eaters,
that means they can't kill anyone else.

00:21:28.365 --> 00:21:30.704
Your hands are saving everyone!

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:35.046
[breathes shakily]

00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:58.969
[exclaiming, laughing]

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.732
[sighs]

00:22:12.036 --> 00:22:13.540
[blowing]

00:22:28.778 --> 00:22:30.239
[gasps]

00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:32.912
[sighs]

00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:35.709
Oh, where am I? What is this place?

00:22:36.836 --> 00:22:38.047
It's so dark.

00:22:41.763 --> 00:22:45.186
I don't like this.
It's scary. [breathes shakily]

00:22:47.858 --> 00:22:50.196
[whimpers]

00:22:52.408 --> 00:22:53.452
Help me.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.083
[footsteps approaching]

00:22:57.544 --> 00:22:58.505
[gasps]

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:00.926
[sighs]

00:23:02.011 --> 00:23:03.682
[gasps]

00:23:04.725 --> 00:23:05.978
You're here too?

00:23:09.234 --> 00:23:10.319
Well, now.

00:23:11.488 --> 00:23:13.117
This isn't scary at all.

00:23:16.874 --> 00:23:19.337
[people laughing]

00:23:19.421 --> 00:23:23.012
[humming]

00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:24.264
[giggles]

00:23:24.347 --> 00:23:27.061
Uh, hey.
What's got you acting all giggly today?

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:31.111
I don't know. Nothing really.

00:23:31.821 --> 00:23:34.451
I just had a dream last night
that made me happy.

00:23:34.535 --> 00:23:36.455
Oh, yeah? About what?

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:40.171
[giggles]

00:23:40.881 --> 00:23:42.593
I don't even remember now.
