WEBVTT

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.430
[Kona] So, it floats into the sky
and shoots out light?

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.890
What else? What kind of face does it have?

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:42.394
Don't ask me for the details.
Use your imagination.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.897
Close your eyes, and focus
on whatever image appears.

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.900
[Kona exhales]

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:52.487
It may feel like something you glimpsed
out of the corner of your eye,

00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:54.156
or like an optical illusion.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.199
But let it fill your senses.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.827
[children clamoring]

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.998
[gasps]

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.291
Did you see something?

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.002
A sword of light?

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:09.212
-[student shrieks]
-[Asura] Oh.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.632
-[Taka] Michika!
-[Kuku] There's blood.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.134
-[screams, cries]
-[Asura] What happened?

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.720
-[Anzu] Michika just started bleeding.
-Someone get the teacher!

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.138
[Asura] That looks deep.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.725
[Anzu] Nothing even happened.
It just came out of nowhere.

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:25.145
Michika, be still for me please.

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.356
[Michika whimpering]

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.943
-[whimpering stops]
-[all gasp]

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.988
I wasn't able to mend it perfectly,
so be careful, okay?

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:36.406
[Kona exhales]

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.617
[giggles]

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.202
Yeah, I will.

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.747
[Kona snoring]

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.960
[Asura] Kona?

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:50.504
Kona.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.508
Asura? What's wrong?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.636
Wait, how long have you been there?

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.847
[static, thud]

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:02.099
[both gasp]

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.558
Is it a power outage?

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.728
[overseer 1] No, it's fine.
We just lost the monitors.

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.188
Restart them now.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.315
CAMERAS ARE NOT RESPONDING

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.650
[Asura] Kona,

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.944
I have come to understand why I was born.

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.447
So now, I have come to say goodbye.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.615
W-- What?

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:20.867
Goodbye?

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.452
Asura, wait! [grunts]

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.705
Asura, where are you?

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:25.831
Come on.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.625
[inhales sharply]

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:32.963
-[ringing]
-[gasps]

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.947
Asura!

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.907
[grunts]

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.120
[screams]

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:16.465
[Asura] <i>The adults are on their way.</i>
<i>Go back to your room, Kona.</i>

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:19.342
Asura, please don't go.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.845
[crying] Don't leave me alone.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:23.805
[Asura] <i>You are not alone.</i>

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.479
<i>You have Anzu, Tokio, Mimihime, Nanaki,</i>
<i>Iwa, and the others.</i>

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.815
<i>And I know you'll make even more friends.</i>

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.319
<i>And then, you'll find someone to love.</i>

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.154
But I love you!

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.032
[Asura] <i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>a different kind of love.</i>

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.409
<i>Something even more special.</i>

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.246
-<i>Open your heart to it.</i>
-[Kona continues crying]

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.923
Poor thing. He seems so lonely.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:01.635
Yeah, of course he is.
He's the only one left in his year now.

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.095
-Hey, I'll be right back okay?
-Huh?

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:05.972
Tokio!

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.105
[Tokio] Uh.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.190
Tokio.

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:18.860
-Yes?
-Oh, hello. I don't need anything.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.698
I just thought I'd come over here
for a while.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.828
Wow, you're so good at drawing.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.919
[chuckles] Thank you.

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:41.466
[breathing deeply]

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.469
-[electronic chime]
-[gasps]

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.017
Whoever killed Asura,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.229
will take Tokio next.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.109
-[Taka straining]
-[student giggling]

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.027
[Taka grunts]

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.657
[student laughs]
You almost jumped right into me!

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.908
[both laughing]

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.287
[interpreter] And this is our group
of 14-year-olds.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.289
Very impressive.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.002
<i>Is Tokioâ€¦</i>

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.756
And a new group of five-year-olds
will be joining the nursery.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.509
This will likely be the last group
we introduce.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:26.887
Oh!

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.390
Miss Aoshima! What are you doing?
I need your input here.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.892
[Aoshima] Sorry, ma'am!

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:37.564
[Kiruko] This button Usami was holding
has the same logo as the Kiru-Beam.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:42.527
-Seems weird, right? Little too weird.
-Hmm.

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:46.197
[Kiruko] <i>Since we only have a vague</i>
<i>idea of where you're trying to go,</i>

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.283
<i>I think we should try tracking down</i>
<i>this mark.</i>

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.995
-And I know just where to start looking.
-[Maru gasps]

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.497
The town where Usami used to live? Right?

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.582
Bingo.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.668
But I thought we'd have Usami
to guide us there.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.254
So when he showed us the map, I zoned out.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.549
[Maru] Didn't everyone else head that way?

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.261
[Kiruko] Yes, but we have no idea
where they turned after that.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.848
Oh, fantastic.
So this is gonna be an adventure.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.934
If by "adventure"
you mean "pain in the ass."

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.312
I was really hoping for "pain free"
this time.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:20.398
Oh, speaking of which, check it out.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.526
My tooth's growing back. Cool, huh?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.987
Whoa! What is going on
with your body, dude?

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:27.697
[rumbling]

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.536
-An earthquake.
-It's a big one.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.499
We have to move.
We're dead if we fall down there.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.507
-[sighs]
-[sighs]

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.592
Of all the times
for there to be an earthquake.

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.427
[crashing]

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.597
Must be a building collapsing nearby.
Let's go.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.057
What? Why?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.726
[Kiruko] Because you don't have
to pick locks on a fallen building.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.061
Total jackpot.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.896
Plus, if it's near the town
we're looking for,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.232
resource collectors from there
might show up.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.402
So you're saying we should clean
the place out before they get to it.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.486
No, you idiot.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.738
-I want them to take us to that town.
-Oh.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:17.288
Yikes. This looks pretty precarious.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.165
[Maru] Hmm.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.959
We could try going in here.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.086
No way, it's gonna cave in.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:25.255
Hmm.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.049
[screams]

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.677
What the hell?
There's someone living in there.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.639
Hey, are you okay?
Sorry your house got crushed.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.559
Oh, no. I didn't live there.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.270
I just came to see if I could
salvage any resources.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.272
Well, what do you know. I was right.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.440
But no such luck.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.067
I mean, I tried my best,
but I couldn't get inside.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.361
So I've got nothing on me worth stealing.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.280
Can you let it slide this once?

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.032
Why are you acting so jumpy?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.452
Because-- Well, you guys are bandits,
aren't you?

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.164
Have you checked a mirror lately?

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.583
You are the most bandit-looking dude
I've ever seen.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:02.709
Oh no. Sorry!

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.169
Thank you for your time.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.589
Apologies for calling you out so late.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:11.092
[Tokio] It's okay. I've been pretty
worried about my health recently too.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.136
I appreciate you checking on me.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.848
Well, everything seems to be perfectly
fine, so no need to worry.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.642
For now, just be extra careful
not to catch a chill, all right?

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.020
Don't do anything too strenuous.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.980
Uh-- Okay.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.273
I promise I'll try.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.570
-[Shiro] Mimihime.
-[gasps]

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.574
You scared me half to death.
Don't sneak up on people like that.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.203
I've noticed that you're always looking
at something up there.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.039
And I've noticed
you're always looking at me.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.625
[sighs]

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:45.752
The ceiling?

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.588
[Mimihime] No.
Something floating up there.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:50.590
You mean dust?

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:52.884
If you're seeing specks of light,

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:55.512
they're just particles
in your eye's vitreous fluid.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.473
Now let's go. Class is about to start.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.311
I see.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.146
Just as I thought.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.233
I am the only one who can see it.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.780
[shudders] Really?
Why do I have to be the one?

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.409
[robot teacher]
<i>Are all students in attendance?</i>

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.328
Tokio still isn't here yet.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.330
<i>Yes.</i>

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:26.376
<i>Before we start today, I need to inform</i>
<i>you all of something on that matter.</i>

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.212
<i>Starting today,</i>
<i>Tokio will be absent indefinitely.</i>

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.547
[all] What?

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.633
[robot teacher] <i>You will meet again,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.512
<i>Please, do not be concerned.</i>

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.350
<i>Now, let's begin.</i>

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.402
I can't believe you have a working car.
Must be nice.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.362
It's not as useful as you might think.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.489
Especially when the roads are such a mess.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.449
Well, I'll be on my way now.

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.285
Isn't it dangerous all by yourself?

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.911
[chuckles]

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.374
Don't worry, that's what this is for.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.086
Dude, do you just run around
with that thing under your jacket?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.422
Well, isn't that a gun
on your friend's hip?

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:16.426
Something like that.
So, are there any other towns nearby?

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.304
I'm sorry, kid.
I don't give out free info.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.307
Money isn't a problem. Just talk.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.517
You seen either of these guys?

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:29.147
We also need info on this logo,
and a place some people call "Heaven."

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.524
Hmm.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.526
Hmm. Wait there just a minute.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.780
I'm gonna need to move this.
Can you step aside?

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.741
-[car door closes]
-[engine starts]

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:45.246
[scavenger] Excuse me! Scoot!
Come on, scoot!

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.665
[clunking]

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:52.921
[scavenger chuckles]

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.049
Now we can talk properly.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.386
Here's the thing.
I have seen that logo before.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.264
-I may even know where it's from.
-Well, tell us!

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.642
I'll tell you what I know
if you give me that gun.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:06.768
Not for sale.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.686
Okay. Cash it is, then.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.772
[Maru] Well, that was easy.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.816
I know better than to try and haggle
with someone who's armed.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:18.696
But it may take me longer than usual
to, uh, remember what you want me to know.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.243
An intel salesman's gotta have certain
rules of engagement, you understand.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.954
But I'm sure a tip
could help jog my memory.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.581
You're really milking this, aren't you?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.167
Let's go with your favorite, I guess.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.713
Greetings and good evening, everyone.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.007
Welcome to my realm of wonders.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.927
I am the one the fables call Juichi.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.554
And I've many a tale to tell this night.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.307
-It is broad daylight.
-[Juichi clears throat]

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.477
We've all heard rumors
about the Great Disaster.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.230
But why is its true cause such a mystery?

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:55.566
Because the subsequent earthquakes,
the abnormally long winters,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.737
the famine and disease, all led humanity
towards the edge of extinction.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.073
<i>And the real story was lost in the chaos.</i>

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.827
<i>There are three theories</i>
<i>that have stood the test of time.</i>

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.704
<i>First is the planet impact theory.</i>

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.957
<i>Before the Great Disaster,</i>
<i>scientists allegedly discovered a comet</i>

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.959
<i>on course to collide with the Earth.</i>

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.753
<i>Something like that</i>
<i>would have been a catastrophe.</i>

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.298
<i>So it's easy to see</i>
<i>how that theory rings true.</i>

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.134
Next is the alien invasion theory.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.511
It may sound out of this worldâ€¦ [laughs]

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:26.556
<i>â€¦but some people think</i>
<i>that those man-eating life-forms</i>

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.892
<i>came to Earth</i>
<i>from the furthest reaches of outer space.</i>

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.936
<i>Before the Collapse,</i>
<i>it was said that many people</i>

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.689
<i>saw unidentified flying objects</i>
<i>in the sky.</i>

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.693
And as you can see,
some even captured those objects on film.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:39.819
-Whoa!
-Bird.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.655
Finally, there's the world war theory.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.240
<i>Before the Great Disaster,</i>

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.326
<i>a terrorist attack</i>
<i>may have occurred in Japan.</i>

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.829
<i>This theory suggests</i>
<i>war broke out soon after</i>

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.123
<i>with the use of a special weapon</i>
<i>powerful enough</i>

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:54.584
<i>to assure mutual destruction.</i>

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.712
So, was that tale
tantalizing enough for you?

00:13:57.795 --> 00:13:59.756
I'll regale you with another one
when next we meet.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.966
See you. Bye-bye.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.968
"See you. Bye-bye," I think not!

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.179
What about Heaven? Or the logo?

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:09.932
Oh, dear. Pardon me,
I can be so forgetful sometimes.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.143
[Kiruko] Oh, how very convenient for you!

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.604
Hold on, Sis.
Just let him tell one more story.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.272
Tell us one of the spooky ones.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:17.732
MENU - GREAT DISASTER
TRUE GHOST STORIES

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:21.235
-How about, "The Walled-Off Town"?
-[Juichi] Why, thank you kindly.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.613
This, I'll tell you everything I know.

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.991
This story is one I experienced firsthand.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.702
For ten years, from the age of 12 onward,

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:33.081
<i>I was shut up in a school</i>
<i>surrounded by walls.</i>

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:38.795
[Director] I apologize
for calling everyone here so suddenly.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.632
Mina will send notes from this meeting
to the departments who cannot attend.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:47.303
First, in regards to the ongoing
search for an assistant director,

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.306
I would like to offer
Miss Aoshima the position.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.683
[participants applauding, exclaiming]

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.143
[gasps]

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:59.899
She will be given level-four
security clearance effective immediately.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:01.234
[staff] Now hold on just a minute.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.736
Why was she the one
chosen for this promotion?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.321
Because I know her to be

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.282
this organization's
most trustworthy member.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.743
[huffs]

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.371
-[scoffs]
-Wasn't Dr. Sawatari

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:16.082
the one who was in talks
to be the next director?

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:18.209
Yeah, it doesn't look like
he's taking it well.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:20.711
-Madam Takeuchi, either.
-[Takeuchi grumbles]

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.673
[Juichi] Our tale begins

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.717
in a place where hostile women ruled.

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:29.679
Around 30 women, aged 20 to 40,

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.764
made that town their home.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.310
<i>The school was their stronghold,</i>
<i>and they barricaded it from the inside.</i>

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:39.355
<i>Any man who accidentally approached it</i>
<i>would be killed.</i>

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.482
<i>But in rare cases,</i>

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:44.819
<i>if they thought the man was healthy</i>
<i>and attractive enough,</i>

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.656
<i>they would imprison him</i>
<i>and keep him as a "breeding pig."</i>

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.827
I spent ten years in that town.
Not as Juichi, no.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.287
But as Boar #11.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.331
<i>The breeding pigs</i>
<i>would perform manual labor</i>

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.292
<i>and provide the women with sperm.</i>

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.587
<i>When it was my turn,</i>
<i>one couple kept asking for me.</i>

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.172
<i>Over and over.</i>

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.259
[sighs]
<i>Eventually, one of them became pregnant.</i>

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:12.763
<i>If a girl was born, she would be accepted</i>
<i>into the town as a human.</i>

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:16.642
<i>But if it was a boy,</i>
<i>he would be taken from his mother</i>

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.187
<i>and raised by us as a breeding pig.</i>

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.065
-[baby coos]
-<i>Of course, the child she had was a boy.</i>

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:27.904
<i>One night, about six months later,</i>
<i>that couple hatched a plan.</i>

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:31.282
<i>The four of us would flee the town</i>
<i>together under the cover of darkness.</i>

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:33.034
Nice! So, you got out?

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.912
-[Juichi] <i>No.</i>
-[baby crying]

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.246
<i>We were caught.</i>

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.791
<i>I'm the only one who managed to escape.</i>

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.880
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>the couple's slaughtered corpses</i>

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.424
<i>had been strung up outside the town walls.</i>

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.594
<i>About one year has passed since then.</i>

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:56.724
<i>And I must live with the knowledge</i>
<i>that such a monstrous place still exists.</i>

00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:00.728
Anyway, that's all I've got.
See you for more stories next time.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:02.939
See you. Bye-bye.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.941
Not "See you. Bye bye." No!

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:08.194
-What happened to the baby?
-[Juichi] I don't know.

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:10.571
That was a terrible story.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:15.201
Okay, Sis. We gotta go find this place
and see if that baby's still alive.

00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:17.203
Assuming the story's true.

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.830
[Juichi strains]

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.751
[chuckles]

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:27.213
You did tell us something interesting,
so you can keep the money.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.258
But you better get lost
before I waste you.

00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:32.218
All right, leaving now! Sorry!

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.595
Wait, you're gonna send him away?

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.765
-But what about the logo?
-It isn't worth the risk.

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:40.142
He was acting way too suspicious
for comfort.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.061
<i>Even though</i>
<i>the driver's seat is on the right,</i>

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.398
<i>he went to all that trouble</i>
<i>to repark his car on the right side.</i>

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.482
Pretty weird.

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:50.027
Especially considering that
there's literally no one else around.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.737
So why repark at all?

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:56.742
There was a reason
he needed to move it so quickly.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.662
That creep saw something
that he wanted to hide.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.790
2F - TAKA

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.128
The logo was there the whole time!

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.256
[Kiruko] We almost wasted all our time
and money on that idiot

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.716
and his tall tales.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:14.885
But we found it.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.680
The origin of the symbol.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.893
TAKAHARA ACADEMY

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.103
[door creaks]

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.571
Bird on the box!

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.991
That's a good eye you got there.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.201
You ever tried firing a gun before?

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.203
[both laugh]

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.496
[both sigh]

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.916
"â€¦and welcome to Takahara Academy.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.587
A place where all may rest
their weary bodies and minds.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.757
We will give you the time
to immerse yourself in your hobbies,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.967
and we will listen to you
in your times of stress."

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:56.052
HELL OF PATIENCE

00:18:56.135 --> 00:19:00.306
One more thing I don't understand
about life before the Great Disaster.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:04.810
So kids could get put into an orphanage,
even if they had a familyâ€¦

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:05.895
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION
TAKAHARA ACADEMY

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.773
â€¦and that orphanage
was also a cram school?

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.402
Sounds less like heaven,
and more like a lot of hard work,

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.737
if you ask me.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.285
Although, it might be nice.

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.871
Especially if you had some friends there.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:24.955
Maybeâ€¦

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:27.416
[sniffs]

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.168
[Maru] Sis! Get over here!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.712
TAKAHARA ACADEMY

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:32.797
Whoa.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:36.133
Was this floor also part of the academy?

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.054
Over here.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.436
Another weird little bird mark, okayâ€¦

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.649
But it just looks like someone made
an ugly graffiti version of the other one.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.734
Bandits would be my guess.

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.194
I have a feeling

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:58.948
this place isn't the one
I've been searching for.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.825
There's no one who looks like me.

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:06.330
I thought we were on the right path
after we found the logo on the gun here.

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:09.166
But maybe I was wrong
to think they were related.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.961
The gun might not have any connection
to Heaven at all.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.045
-[paper rustles]
-Huh?

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.256
What's this?

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:16.841
If this guide is correct,

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.885
the Takahara Academy
used to be some kind of orphanage.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:24.890
It also goes on to describe
the outside world as a "Hell of Patience."

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.810
And the opposite of hell is what?

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.562
Heaven?

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.941
If the gun and the academy
are both connected to heaven,

00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:36.193
then this might not be
a dead-end after all.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.278
CONTACT NUMBERS

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:40.656
According to the pamphlet,
Takahara Academy has two facilities

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.324
and 18 branches.

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.494
My guess is the other branches
are similar to this one.

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.164
But I'm more interested
in the two facilities.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.916
Ibaraki and Nara, huh?

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:54.962
So you wanna crash here for the night
and head out tomorrow, or what?

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:58.007
Nah. Let's find somewhere else.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.009
This place gives me the creeps.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:05.806
Now, to the main topic of our meeting.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.310
We have discovered that Tokio is pregnant.

00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:10.561
[all gasp]

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.897
-What?
-But that's completely outrageous!

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.816
-She's far too young for that!
-That's not the issue here!

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.193
How can this be?

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.945
-Who is the father?
-[staff 1] We need to know!

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:22.281
