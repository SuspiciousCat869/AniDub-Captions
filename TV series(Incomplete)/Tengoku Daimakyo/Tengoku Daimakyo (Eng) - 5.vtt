-[child babbles]
-[parent] Here we go.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.980
Get your newspapers!

00:00:13.443 --> 00:00:16.115
We got room
for two more resource collectors!

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.621
-Who's in?
-O-Oh, me, I wanna go!

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:22.671
Holy moly! <i>GAGA</i> by Peat Moss.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:25.718
You found a rare one, I'll tell you what.

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.475
If this still plays,
it's worth around 400k, easy-peasy.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:30.979
[gasps] Really?

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:32.607

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:51.520
Someone sure is taking her time.

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:02.667
-[chuckles] Hey, kid.

00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:06.550
<i>Crocodile Quest</i> lets you have
up to four people in your party, you know.

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.178
Why are you only using two?

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:11.100
You're not from around here,
are you, baby face?

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:14.315
If you're gonna play here,
you better speak when spoken to.

00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:16.402
Hey, what's up?

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:20.452
You ever have the girl you're into
turn out to be a dude? Or nah?

00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:23.375
-I have not. Never heard that one before--
-[gasps]

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:26.965
Who asked about that?
Pay attention! [grunts]

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:29.220
-[gasps]
-[thug 2] Punk kid.

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:31.474
Did your mama
never teach you about respect?

Hey.

00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:43.791
[thug 1] Come on, once was enough.
You didn't have to break his nose!

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:47.464
You don't kick a man
when he's already down. Apologize!

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.220
-No, you're right.
-[thug continues groaning]

00:01:51.264 --> 00:01:52.642
Hey, sorry--

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:56.023
[chuckles]

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:59.698
Take it outside, will you?
You're tearing up my shop.

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.202
[groans] Come on, man.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:03.956
Not so tough now, are you?

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.877
Did you really think
you could pick a fight

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.296
and then just wriggle out of it?

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.634
-[thug 3] Yeah. Are you stupid or what?
-[Maru groans]

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:11.555

You brat! [strains]

00:02:30.718 --> 00:02:32.179
[grunting]

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:36.522
What the hell?
This kid's a freaking monster!

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:41.155
[thug 4 shudders, screams]

[Kiruko grunts]

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.173
-Oh, hey, Sis.
-What the heck happened over here?

00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:51.510
Whoa, it's-it's cool.

00:02:51.593 --> 00:02:54.516
But don't just charge in here
without knowing what's going on.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.562
What if this was, like, entirely my fault?

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.066
We've been hanging out for ages, dude.

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.322
I think I'd know by now if you were
the type to go around picking fights.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.832
Besides, gangs like this
always have backup nearby.

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:09.044
So you gotta take them all out to be safe.

00:03:09.128 --> 00:03:11.215
-Right…
-I'm being serious.

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.177
[gasps] Maru!

00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:14.723
They knocked out a tooth.

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:17.185
-[Maru groans]
-Hey, wait. Let me see.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.023
It'll grow back sooner or later.

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:21.737
No, it won't.
Adult teeth don't work that way!

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:24.618
[groans] Let's ditch this place.

00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.414
We'll find somewhere to sleep
way away from here.

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:07.657
[Maru] <i>I was born the same year</i>
<i>as the Great Disaster, apparently.</i>

00:05:09.284 --> 00:05:13.627
<i>The first memories I have</i>
<i>are from about three or four years old.</i>

00:05:14.211 --> 00:05:18.094
<i>I lived in some run-down building</i>
<i>with seven or eight other kids my age.</i>

00:05:18.177 --> 00:05:20.265
<i>We were usually cold and pretty hungry,</i>

00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:22.812
<i>but we had adults around</i>
<i>to help care of us,</i>

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:26.443
<i>so it wasn't that bad,</i>
<i>all things considered.</i>

00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:31.663
<i>I was about seven when that school,</i>
<i>or whatever it was, shut down.</i>

00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:35.086
<i>The adults split us up,</i>
<i>sent us to different places.</i>

00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:37.717
<i>My group was all the orphans.</i>

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.514
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>where we were supposed to be going,</i>

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:44.104
<i>but we hopped from place to place</i>
<i>for about three years.</i>

00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:45.774
<i>Lived on scraps.</i>

00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:48.989
<i>At one point,</i>
<i>the adult who led our group got killed</i>

00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:50.951
<i>in some kind of turf war.</i>

00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:53.999
<i>We didn't have anywhere else to go,</i>

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:57.130
<i>so we went with the killer</i>
<i>and became part of their gang.</i>

00:05:57.673 --> 00:05:59.886
<i>I was still working with them</i>
<i>until recently.</i>

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.646
<i>One day, Mikura turned up.</i>

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.400
<i>She said she was gonna take me in.</i>

00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:10.574
<i>She was the one who taught me</i>
<i>how to kill Hiruko.</i>

00:06:10.658 --> 00:06:12.745
<i>And, now we're here.</i>

00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:17.630
How did you feel about Mikura?
Like, did you think of her as a woman?

00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:18.882
What?

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.468
Not really.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.476
She was just the next person
I had to listen to to survive. So…

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.562
Hmm.

00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:28.109
[Kiruko]
You don't fall in love easily, then?

00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:30.071
[Maru] I-I-I don't know. Who cares?

00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:32.242
But anyway, she only ever looked at me

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.872
with this kind of distant coldness
in her eyes.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:37.168
She didn't really treat me like a human.

00:06:38.087 --> 00:06:39.381
Okay.

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:41.970
Can you remember the name
of the town where she found you,

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:43.139
or where it was?

00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:46.270
No. Until Mikura started telling me,

00:06:46.353 --> 00:06:48.024
I never had any idea where I was.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.445
<i>And even then,</i>

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.036
<i>it kinda took a while for me</i>
<i>to understand how big Japan really is.</i>

00:06:54.704 --> 00:06:58.127
My life has basically consisted of
nothing but following adults around.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.337
Drama queen!

00:07:00.632 --> 00:07:02.970
Well, if you can't offer up
any new information…

00:07:03.054 --> 00:07:05.349
You've heard this story
like a thousand times.

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:09.316
Not the point. Repeating yourself
can help you remember other details.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:11.320
Memories are weird like that.

00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:13.742
I read that somewhere once.

00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:16.873
Oh. Speaking of books,
check out the other room.

00:07:16.956 --> 00:07:19.545
There are tons in there.
We should sell them.

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:21.256
I'm way ahead of you.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.096
I packed up the novels and comics
while you were asleep.

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:26.475
The more useful-looking books…

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.522
I'm gonna read 'em.

00:07:28.605 --> 00:07:31.026
And then I'm gonna burn 'em.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.657
Knowledge has more value
if you keep it to yourself.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.909
[Maru] Huh. Okay.

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:38.542
Oh, that's a newspaper I found in town.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.754
Maybe you could check it out
while I'm gone.

00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:43.510
Oh, am I not coming with you? I thought--

00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:45.639
Nah, your face will get us busted.

00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:48.227
If the guys from yesterday recognize you,
we are screwed.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.273
[groans] Hmm?

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:52.611
[groans]

00:07:54.156 --> 00:07:56.870
It's all good!
It's a little swollen, but not busted.

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:58.623
[groans]

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:00.001
Oh, boy.

00:08:00.502 --> 00:08:04.301
Listen to my words.
I'm not saying that your face is busted.

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:07.223
I'm saying your face will get us busted.

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:13.277
Hey, wait. If Mikura taught you
how to kill Man-eaters,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.824
does that mean
she could use the Maru-Touch too?

00:08:15.908 --> 00:08:18.538
No, she said only I can do it.

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:21.878
I don't know why,
but that's why I need to go to Heaven.

00:08:22.378 --> 00:08:25.134
But I did notice that the poster
outside your office

00:08:25.218 --> 00:08:27.180
said you could kill Man-eaters, too.

00:08:27.263 --> 00:08:29.727
All's fair in love and marketing.

00:08:37.492 --> 00:08:38.912
[thug 1 sighs]

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:43.295
Where'd he disappear to?
That stupid kid and his stupid hair.

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:45.424
I know you're mad
you got your asses kicked,

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:46.803
but let the punk go.

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:49.432
We should focus
on the Ministry of Reconstruction.

00:08:49.517 --> 00:08:51.854
-You think they're nearby?
-[thug 1] Who knows?

00:08:51.938 --> 00:08:54.401
No one ever has solid intel on those guys.

00:08:54.484 --> 00:08:58.325
[Kiruko] <i>Wow. Guess that Ministry rumor</i>
<i>is still alive and well…</i>

00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:03.002
[Robin] I've heard there's a group
out there abducting people

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.880
with certain skills and expertise

00:09:04.964 --> 00:09:07.761
to try to get civilization
back to the way it used to be.

00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:09.932
-[gasps]
-Are they gonna come to Asakusa?

00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:13.648
It's just a rumor right now,
but it's possible.

00:09:13.732 --> 00:09:17.322
But my sis told me the Reconstruction
was a pipe dream for old people.

00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:19.200
Well, both can be true at once.

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:20.621
Wait a sec.

00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:23.793
What if this is the reason that
all those people have gone missing lately?

00:09:23.877 --> 00:09:24.879
Freaky.

00:09:24.962 --> 00:09:26.633
I don't say this to scare you,

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:29.680
but because you're all pretty handy
with those electro-karts,

00:09:29.764 --> 00:09:33.312
better act stupid
if any strangers show up asking questions.

00:09:33.938 --> 00:09:36.527
Wanna practice acting stupid, then? Ran?

00:09:36.611 --> 00:09:37.738
Um…

00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:41.286
-Oh, you're good at it.
-Hey, I haven't started yet!

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.499
[all laughing]

00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:45.504
[chuckles]

00:09:47.298 --> 00:09:51.808
Kid probably left town by now.
I vote we give up and go home already.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.897
Not yet. What if we leave and he shows up?

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.276
Don't worry. We'll grab him if we see him.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.074
Iwata wants another round,
and I really want to see that!

00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:04.165
Is he insane? There were eight of us there
yesterday, and he destroyed us all.

00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:07.213
I'm not kidding, either.
That dude was like an explosive!

00:10:08.424 --> 00:10:10.721
You couldn't pay me
to go one-on-one with him.

00:10:12.432 --> 00:10:13.852
[chuckles]

00:10:13.935 --> 00:10:16.106
My Maru is pretty tough.

00:10:19.487 --> 00:10:21.324
"My Maru"? That's new.

00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:25.876
Why am I so proud of him all of a sudden?

00:10:27.546 --> 00:10:29.633
<i>I'm just his bodyguard.</i>

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:33.223
<i>Once we get him to Heaven</i>
<i>and he finds what he's looking for,</i>

00:10:33.307 --> 00:10:34.935
<i>I'll be on my own again.</i>

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:40.781
[gasps]

00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:43.703
What…

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:46.667
Maru?

00:10:51.803 --> 00:10:52.846
Hey, Maru.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.767
-[gasps]
-[wind howling]

00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:06.206
[gasps, shudders]

00:11:06.289 --> 00:11:07.835
[breathing heavily] No! Maru!

00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:09.630
[panting]

00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:11.551
Maru!

00:11:13.136 --> 00:11:15.684
[breathing shakily]

00:11:15.767 --> 00:11:16.769
Maru!

00:11:16.853 --> 00:11:18.857
[whimpers]

00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:21.152
Where--

00:11:21.236 --> 00:11:23.198
Hey. Shh.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.077
Why are you yelling like that? I'm fine.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.417
-[Kiruko breathing heavily]
-I'm hiding like I'm supposed to.

00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:32.425
But why were you doing it
in the next apartment?

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:34.137
I wasn't doing any--

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.308
[groans] I mean, um…

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:39.815
I was just looking for any useful books
that you may have missed.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.531
[stammers] Hey, wait!
There's nothing in there to see.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.913
[Kiruko sighs] Oh. Okay.

00:11:46.996 --> 00:11:49.000
You were just using porn. Okay.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:51.254
[Maru groans] Don't say using!
I was looking.

00:11:51.338 --> 00:11:53.216
Uh, but I wasn't, like, "looking."

00:11:54.887 --> 00:11:57.559
Sis! What happened to you?

00:11:57.643 --> 00:11:58.645
You're acting weird.

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:03.195
I can't believe I panicked like that,
but I really lost it, huh?

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.449
I got back, and you were gone.

00:12:05.533 --> 00:12:07.119
-I thought you were--
-Ah.

00:12:07.203 --> 00:12:08.539
-You can't just--
-[groans]

00:12:08.623 --> 00:12:10.125
I thought I told you before.

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:13.215
Um, I might not always
be exactly where you left me--

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.302
-[Kiruko crying]
-[gasps]

00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:17.139
[sniffles]

00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:19.645
-Uh? [breathes heavily] Uh…
-[Kiruko shudders]

00:12:19.728 --> 00:12:22.776
Sorry. Um, I-I messed up, okay?

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:25.280
I… was wrong?

00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:31.042
You know, earlier when I was telling you
about my past and all that,

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:33.965
I thought maybe I was complaining
to someone

00:12:34.048 --> 00:12:36.136
whose childhood was even worse than mine.

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:42.189
[Kiruko] Well, thanks.

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:45.446
-But you're still at half-mast, bud.
-[gasps]

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.993
Shut up! I-It's not because of you.

00:12:48.076 --> 00:12:49.162
I was already halfway--

00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:51.709
[gasps] No wait,
I wasn't halfway anywhere!

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:53.170
[whines] Shut up!

00:12:55.925 --> 00:12:58.263
[Maru] There was this cool article
in that newspaper.

00:12:58.346 --> 00:12:59.975
Before the Great Disaster,

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:02.898
humans built robots
to make life easier for them.

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.194
But then they started to get nervous

00:13:05.277 --> 00:13:07.866
as the robots and AI and whatever
were watching them.

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:10.370
-[chuckles]
-[Maru] But the dumb thing is,

00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:12.709
because they were all
so paranoid about it,

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.713
they just started watching each other.

00:13:14.797 --> 00:13:16.842
They all started
to push their own agendas…

00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:19.055
[muffled] …and eventually
slaughtered one another

00:13:19.138 --> 00:13:20.934
until everything broke down.

00:13:21.017 --> 00:13:22.854
[Kiruko] Yeah. The War Collapse Theory.

00:13:22.938 --> 00:13:26.361
Sounds made-up to me.
Too much like an old fable, you know?

00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:29.701
I think that story is just to say
life before wasn't Heaven.

00:13:30.202 --> 00:13:33.083
I mean, if Heaven did exist then,

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:36.549
we'd have to travel to the past,
which of course we can't do.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.678
I'm not sure about that.

00:13:38.761 --> 00:13:41.976
Everyone who knows about life before
really wants to go back.

00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:45.440
<i>So what if, somewhere out there,</i>

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:48.446
<i>civilization has already been restored?</i>

00:13:51.286 --> 00:13:52.998
[computer beeping]

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.296
Hmm?

00:13:59.803 --> 00:14:00.805
What the--

00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:04.186
Is that…

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.690
[gasps]

00:14:06.274 --> 00:14:07.736
…a footprint?

00:14:09.238 --> 00:14:12.453
How is there a footprint up that high?

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:15.960
[instrumental music playing]

00:14:19.133 --> 00:14:20.553
[bells jingling]

00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:40.050
What's all this for?

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:43.516
We thought if Tarao heard something fun
going on, he might feel a little better.

00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:44.893
[Taka straining]

00:14:47.314 --> 00:14:48.943
Uh, what's he doing?

00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:51.573
Oh. Before he was sick,
Tarao could pick up that rock.

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:53.953
He didn't just pick it up.

00:14:54.036 --> 00:14:56.332
He could throw it all the way over there.

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:59.631
Tarao was quite strong, wasn't he?

00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:01.009
[Taka] I can do it too!

00:15:01.092 --> 00:15:03.556
[straining] You just watch…

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:05.183
[Taka groans]

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:06.310
[music ends]

00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:09.025
[rhythmic beeping]

00:15:09.901 --> 00:15:11.780
[steady beep]

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:18.376
[doctor] Time of death,
Ten'ei 17, October 16th, 11:34 p. m.

00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:21.759
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

00:15:22.342 --> 00:15:24.556
[cries]

00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:29.858
[robot teacher] <i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

00:15:30.358 --> 00:15:32.864
<i>Once you're dressed,</i>
<i>please report to the square</i>

00:15:32.947 --> 00:15:34.951
<i>before going to breakfast.</i>

00:15:35.953 --> 00:15:39.251
<i>Your classmate Tarao</i>
<i>passed away last night.</i>

00:15:39.335 --> 00:15:40.337
[gasps]

00:15:41.715 --> 00:15:43.468
[whimpers]

00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:45.430
[crying]

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:52.987
[Kuku crying]

00:16:26.763 --> 00:16:29.268
Did Asura have the same disease?

00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:30.395
[gasps]

00:16:33.903 --> 00:16:35.030
Asura.

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:39.288
Yeah.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.129
Or maybe, I don't know.

00:16:46.762 --> 00:16:50.978
Mina, are we able to proceed
with Tarao's cremation yet?

00:16:51.062 --> 00:16:55.278
[Mina] <i>Yes. We have already taken</i>
<i>all the necessary samples.</i>

00:16:56.072 --> 00:16:58.409
It's awful. Simply awful.

00:16:58.994 --> 00:17:00.790
This cannot happen again.

00:17:00.873 --> 00:17:03.419
This is the second death
among the children.

00:17:03.504 --> 00:17:06.969
With all due respect, no one
could have predicted Asura's suicide.

00:17:07.052 --> 00:17:08.179
-That's not true.
-[gasps]

00:17:08.806 --> 00:17:12.939
Asura was born into a body that
could not bear the burden of its mind.

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:17.155
[Director] We are responsible
for the sin of that birth.

00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:21.122
And we alone are responsible
for the death that followed.

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:24.921
Too much cruelty was forced
upon that poor child.

00:17:25.506 --> 00:17:29.681
They should be together.
Place Tarao's grave there, too.

00:17:34.524 --> 00:17:38.949
What exactly made Tarao's illness
so worrisome? Was it rare?

00:17:39.534 --> 00:17:42.122
It's the fact that a body
built with immunity to everything

00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:43.792
developed an illness at all.

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:46.923
Now we know it's possible that
the rest of the children could fall ill.

00:17:47.007 --> 00:17:49.053
[Director shouting]
Then we have a problem, don't we?

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:51.725
The Day of Fate is the only thing
that can't be changed.

00:17:51.808 --> 00:17:54.021
So hurry up, figure out what this is

00:17:54.104 --> 00:17:56.317
and cure it before it's too late!

00:17:56.818 --> 00:17:59.490
[retching]

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.416
[breathes heavily]

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.753
[Tokio] Oh, no.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.218
What is this? Am I sick too?

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.807
[Kiruko] Check it out.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.186
I sold all the books I could fit
in my backpack

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:16.065
and now we've got ourselves a map.

00:18:16.148 --> 00:18:18.654
That is the value of information.

00:18:18.737 --> 00:18:21.409
All right. Now let's see.

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:24.666
"Water safety level: 50%."

00:18:25.835 --> 00:18:28.047
What are these numbers
supposed to be based on?

00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:31.429
The guy at the store said
they measure taste and clarity.

00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:33.266
That's subjective.

00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:34.393
[gasps]

00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:37.399
"Water safety level: 100%."

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.986
Okay!

00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:43.119
If there's anywhere with water that safe,
it's gotta be Heaven, right?

00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:44.664
That's subjective.

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:45.916
-[footsteps approach]
-But,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.463
I guess it couldn't hurt
to stop by and look.

00:18:48.547 --> 00:18:49.632
[gasps]

00:18:50.216 --> 00:18:52.345
Quiet! I can hear footsteps.

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:56.605
[whispers] I think there's somebody
in the building.

00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:59.109
[footsteps continue]

00:19:01.155 --> 00:19:02.365
-[knocking]
-[both gasp]

00:19:02.449 --> 00:19:04.453
And they came straight for us.

00:19:04.537 --> 00:19:06.457
Do you think that gang
figured out where we are?

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:10.633
It sounds like it's only one guy.
We can handle one guy, right?

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:13.722
I don't know? What are you gonna do
if he's, like, mega strong?

00:19:13.806 --> 00:19:15.308
[stranger] I know you're in there!

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.732
I was on the ship with you.
Please let me in.

00:19:20.986 --> 00:19:24.911
I spotted you in the tent city earlier.
Sorry I followed you back.

00:19:24.994 --> 00:19:27.667
-But here. I'll get straight to the point.
-[chuckles]

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.255
I want to hire you to protect me.

00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:34.263
Well, as long as we're headed
the same way, I'll think about it.

00:19:34.346 --> 00:19:37.269
I'm not going too far.
Just to the Immortal Order.

00:19:37.352 --> 00:19:39.983
-The Immortal Order?
-What is that?

00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:42.947
Oh. Uh, that's
what I've always heard it called.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.619
But maybe it has some other,
more official name.

00:19:46.203 --> 00:19:49.752
I heard there's a doctor there
who can keep you alive forever.

00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:52.007
A doctor. A doctor?

00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:54.846
[stammers] Does he look like this?

00:19:55.764 --> 00:19:58.979
[sighs] Well, I've never been there
myself, so I'm not sure.

00:19:59.062 --> 00:20:00.189
Details!

00:20:00.774 --> 00:20:02.068
[groans]

00:20:02.152 --> 00:20:04.782
If you can't tell me,
then I can't be your bodyguard.

00:20:04.866 --> 00:20:07.495
I won't take an assignment
from someone who doesn't trust me.

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.170
I trust you.
I saw what you did on that ship.

00:20:12.464 --> 00:20:15.261
You just need to escort me
and this satchel.

00:20:15.763 --> 00:20:18.852
You know those mutants that appeared
after the Great Disaster,

00:20:18.936 --> 00:20:20.648
like the one that attacked the ship?

00:20:21.524 --> 00:20:23.695
If you graft one onto a person,

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:26.534
they gain great power and immortal life.

00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:28.329
Have you heard that before?

00:20:28.412 --> 00:20:31.503
Okay, so that bag you're carrying is--

00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:33.757
-Oh, no.
-[laughs]

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.261
Oh, yes! I'll show you.

00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:37.974
But don't you dare touch it.

00:20:40.896 --> 00:20:42.148
[both groan]

00:20:42.232 --> 00:20:44.529
It looks kind of sloppy and rotten to me?

00:20:44.612 --> 00:20:47.325
Hmm? It does? [gasps]

00:20:47.409 --> 00:20:50.833
What? I swear, it wasn't like this
before it got on the ship.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.920
Hey! Don't dump it out!

00:20:53.004 --> 00:20:55.634
[stranger whimpers]

00:20:56.803 --> 00:20:57.888
Why?

00:20:57.972 --> 00:21:00.476
I finally got my hands on it and…

00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:02.397
[crying]

00:21:04.401 --> 00:21:05.403
Uh, sorry.

00:21:05.486 --> 00:21:07.908
Where is that Indestructible Order
you mentioned?

00:21:07.992 --> 00:21:09.829
Pretty sure it was "Immortal"?

00:21:09.912 --> 00:21:10.914
[stranger cries]

00:21:10.998 --> 00:21:13.795
Here, I'll buy the information from you.

00:21:14.379 --> 00:21:17.720
You can use the money to buy yourself
a new Man-eater part, okay?

00:21:17.803 --> 00:21:19.431
[stranger cries]

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.485
So, super-safe water first,
Immortal Order second?

00:21:25.569 --> 00:21:27.823
If you want. It's a bit of a detour.

00:21:27.907 --> 00:21:29.493
Yeah. It's not that far.

00:21:30.078 --> 00:21:33.502
And who knows? Either one of those places
could be where Heaven is.

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:37.217
This is kind of creepy, though.
Take a look.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.810
The location of the Order just says,
"Here, there be monsters."

00:21:43.312 --> 00:21:44.314
[knocking]

00:21:44.397 --> 00:21:46.318
Madam Director! Come quick!

00:21:46.401 --> 00:21:48.280
Please don't crash about like that.

00:21:48.364 --> 00:21:50.493
Tarao's body has been cremated,
but there's something--

00:21:50.577 --> 00:21:52.790
Please deal with this matter yourself.

00:21:52.873 --> 00:21:55.378
-[Director screaming]
-I'm sorry! But you need to see this!

00:21:57.006 --> 00:21:58.425
[Director groans]

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.975
[grunts] What on earth is going on here?

00:22:02.685 --> 00:22:03.770
[gasps]

00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:07.778
Hmm?

00:22:08.655 --> 00:22:09.949
[gasps]

00:22:10.534 --> 00:22:13.080
What is that thing?
