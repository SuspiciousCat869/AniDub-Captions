[students laughing, clamoring]

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:13.401
Ouch, that hurts!

00:00:13.903 --> 00:00:15.865
Get off already!

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:18.829
[student laughs] Run!

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:21.417
[sighs] Honestly…

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:23.421
-[student 2] Kona is amazing!
-Huh?

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:25.802
You're so good at drawing. [giggles]

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:28.849
[Mimihime] I bet Tokio wouldn't like that.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.018
[Shiro] Hmm.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.857
I wonder how Tokio is doing.

00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:33.943
Yeah…

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:37.491
I heard Kona is communicating with Tokio.

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:39.871
[students laughing]

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:44.213
[Tokio] It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!
[crying]

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:46.342
[nurse] It's okay, keep going.

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:48.263
[Tokio straining, groaning]

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:51.436
It hurts so much!

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.981
I'm dying! I'm dying!

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:57.114
-[nurse] You can do it.
-It hurts! I'm dying! I'm going to die!

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:58.701
[Tokio] <i>Kona!</i>

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:01.080
[Kona grunts, groans]

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:03.418
[breathing shakily]

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:04.504
Tokio.

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:08.596
<i>The baby will be born.</i>

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.095
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO
Push Start!

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.141
TENGOKU-DAIMAKYO

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.591
-[van door opens]
-[Kiruko] Hey.

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:54.390
-Morning.
-Don't climb on the car. You'll dent it.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.437
[Maru] You've climbed up here plenty.

00:02:57.522 --> 00:02:59.734
It's my car, so I can do what I want.

00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:02.155
It's our car, by the way.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.203
Wrong, it's mine. [shouts]

00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:06.623
KIRUKO-NINE

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:08.459
Kiruko-nine? [sobs]

00:03:09.128 --> 00:03:12.175
I was wondering
what you were doing all morning.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.432
Pay attention,
the character for Maru is like this.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.979
At least write it correctly.

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:19.064
[Maru] Oh.

00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:20.358
[Kiruko] Oh, well.

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:24.408
While we're at it,
let's add Juichi's name.

00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.493
Good idea.

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:28.959
KIRUKO MARU JUICHI

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:30.588
[Kiruko] I know we've already written it,

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:34.554
but I just realized Juichi's name
makes it look like our 11th car.

00:03:34.638 --> 00:03:35.931
[Maru] So what if it does?

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:39.104
Trust is everything in my job.

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:42.194
I don't want people to think
it's just some meaningless front.

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:45.868
Well, at least
the first Kirukomaru really existed.

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:47.454
You mean, the raft?

00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:52.047
Wait, if you read Juichi's name
as Roman numerals, it's Kirukomaru II!

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.842
So it makes perfect sense!

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.349
-But then we're leaving Juichi out.
-Uh…

00:03:57.432 --> 00:04:01.692
Hey, stop nit-picking
and give me directions.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.696
[Maru] You're the nitpicker.

00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:05.533
TAKAHARA ACADEMY
(IBARAKI FACILITY)

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:06.868
[Maru] Hmm. Right…

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:10.166
I don't get how you know the way
with this information.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.753
[chuckles]

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:15.636
If you wanna know about
the old civilization, ask someone older.

00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:28.954
So, tell me the status of the combatants.

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:32.712
It appears that after transportation,
all eight awoke from suspended animation.

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:39.016
The prototype of their Super-Beam
is also ready.

00:04:39.768 --> 00:04:42.690
My next concern is the children's illness.

00:04:43.274 --> 00:04:47.407
Will the 5th year students fall ill too?

00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.495
Well, they could.

00:04:50.497 --> 00:04:53.504
I'm not in a position to say that
there's no possibility of that.

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:56.092
It's never straightforward with you,
is it?

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:57.845
It's a possibility.

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:02.605
At present, we don't know the cause.
We don't have a cure either.

00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:04.441
Just as I feared.

00:05:05.694 --> 00:05:07.782
We will just have to wager on it.

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:10.370
Wager? Wager on what?

00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:12.249
[chuckles]

00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:14.671
Tokio's child.

00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:17.259
The child of two children.

00:05:17.342 --> 00:05:21.308
Not a child birthed by Mina,
but a child of two children.

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:24.148
This is far from what was planned.

00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:26.653
This is something else altogether!

00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:30.661
We will have to wager everything
on Tokio's child.

00:05:30.744 --> 00:05:34.042
-You'll do it, won't you?
-[groans]

00:05:34.627 --> 00:05:37.675
It's up to me to ensure with my own eyes

00:05:37.758 --> 00:05:41.683
that Heaven blooms
in this utterly broken world.

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:46.025
But, unless the shackles
of human mortality are broken,

00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:47.904
I cannot do so.

00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:51.410
Takahara Academy will break them.

00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:53.372
B-But…

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:56.755
But for brain transplants,
the container must be 15 years old.

00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:00.136
They should be 13 at the very least.
Otherwise it is impossible.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.769
[Director]
And I won't live another 13 years?

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:05.981
I see how it is.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.906
I'm just some dried up 80-year-old lady?

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:11.743
That level of agitation will only--

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:13.914
Only what?

00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:16.001
Shorten my life-span?

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:19.341
[gasping, choking]

00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:20.426
[Sawatari] Director!

00:06:21.805 --> 00:06:24.978
[Director sighs] I lost my composure.

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.278
I understand that
my remaining years are limited.

00:06:29.988 --> 00:06:32.325
You must have realized it

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.123
if your panic in the meeting earlier
is anything to go by.

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:38.755
First, I'll become Miss Aoshima.

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.882
[gasps]

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:44.433
Then I will wait patiently
for the container to mature.

00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:48.525
I can withstand a second transplant
if I wait that long, right?

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:53.660
So that's why you increased
Aoshima's access rights?

00:06:53.744 --> 00:06:56.248
Has Aoshima given her consent?

00:06:56.916 --> 00:07:00.173
When you agree
to become the assistant director,

00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:04.139
you also agree to eventually
become the director, right?

00:07:04.222 --> 00:07:07.270
You expect this kind of absurdity
to be permitted?

00:07:07.353 --> 00:07:10.193
Permitted? By who?

00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:11.696
Permitted by law?

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.909
Or by international public opinion?

00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:15.829
Those things are long gone.

00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:18.417
Or, could you mean…

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.094
God? [laughs]

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:25.264
You must know that, in the end,

00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:29.607
those are just different names
to call the pressure to conform.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.536
Aren't you at Takahara Academy
to avoid being tied down by such things?

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:38.124
That is why we created Heaven.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:42.048
There's already no turning back for us.

00:07:42.132 --> 00:07:45.096
We either continue, or fail entirely.

00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:49.939
Make sure Tokio's child

00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:52.318
<i>is delivered as safely as possible.</i>

00:07:57.788 --> 00:07:59.584
[sighs] So cute.

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.675
KIRUKOMARU II

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:06.138
Hey, are you okay?

00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:07.223

00:08:07.307 --> 00:08:09.604

<i>but is useless with car sickness.</i>

00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:14.446
I made some food,
do you think you can eat some?

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:16.325
Food?

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:21.376
What's this? Bread! Amazing.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.255
[Kiruko] I found it in Kirukomaru II.

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:24.341
LONG-LASTING BREAD

00:08:24.926 --> 00:08:29.309
It expired seven years ago,
so I toasted it over a fire, just in case.

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:33.484
It's tasty, this old civilization food.

00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:37.868
I had a quick look around
while you were sleeping,

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:41.166
but this whole area has already
been scavenged clean of stuff.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:44.966
There isn't a single window in this house,
let alone resources.

00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:46.803
You're right.

00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:51.144
And also,
there are pros and cons to having a car.

00:08:51.729 --> 00:08:54.527
It's taking forever
to get to our destination.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.448
All because of some bumps
we could easily get over on foot.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.496
ON THE BEACH: MANKIND'S
FINAL DAYS - NEVIL SHUTE

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:03.210
Maru, turn off the light already.

00:09:03.294 --> 00:09:04.421
[Maru] Hmm?

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:06.300
Sorry, was it shining in your eyes?

00:09:06.383 --> 00:09:07.636
No, not that.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.268
This house is so bare,
anyone would see a light straightaway.

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:13.648
We should be extra careful.

00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:15.401
[Maru] Okay then.

00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:17.447
[Maru sighs]

00:09:20.411 --> 00:09:23.877
I shouldn't have napped earlier.
Now I'm so awake…

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.881
Huh?

00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:27.300
Wait, Sis!

00:09:27.383 --> 00:09:30.181
-[snoring]
-She's already asleep.

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:33.563
Must be nice to fall asleep so fast.

00:09:34.314 --> 00:09:36.778
Sis. I can see some smoke in the distance.

00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:39.366
[groans] Sure you're not dreaming?

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:41.954
There's no way
you could see smoke far away at night.

00:09:42.038 --> 00:09:43.374
[Maru] I'm not dreaming.

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:45.002
I didn't even go to sleep yet.

00:09:46.756 --> 00:09:49.344
-[Kiruko] Oh, wow. You're right.
-[Maru] See?

00:09:49.427 --> 00:09:53.770
If we can see that from this distance,
there must be some light source below it.

00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:56.274
So, let's get the map.

00:09:56.358 --> 00:09:58.195
And the compass.

00:09:59.907 --> 00:10:02.621
It's definitely coming from the direction
of the Ibaraki facility.

00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:05.376
Sh-Shall we go over there?

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:08.758
No, it's dangerous to move at night.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.223
Let's leave the car here
and walk there tomorrow.

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:13.810
[Maru] Okay.

00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:37.064

00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:45.530
There's nothing wrong with my body,

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:49.037
but I seem to have
synchronized up with Tokio.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.917
[gasps] So is Tokio sick, then?

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.631
No, no. Tokio is fine.

00:12:55.424 --> 00:12:58.848
It's just me who can't seem to get up.

00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:00.017
[sighs]

00:13:01.102 --> 00:13:04.233
Well, I guess it's good
you're both okay then.

00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:06.614
Why are you here?

00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:07.866
I…

00:13:09.661 --> 00:13:10.872
Do you know Ohma?

00:13:10.955 --> 00:13:13.753
Yeah, the one with the black glasses?

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:14.838
[Mimihime] Yes, that one.

00:13:15.422 --> 00:13:18.596
When I looked directly into Ohma's eyes,
it made me hallucinate.

00:13:19.556 --> 00:13:23.731
I don't know how to say it.
It was like my worst fears became real.

00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:25.902
I mean, it was only a hallucination,

00:13:27.196 --> 00:13:30.870
but sharp objects
like blades and other things

00:13:30.954 --> 00:13:33.375
seem to really scare me, for some reason.

00:13:34.586 --> 00:13:38.385
It's not like I have a scary memory
of anything involving things like that.

00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:41.559
I understand. It's a phobia.

00:13:42.393 --> 00:13:46.192
I'm really scared
of being trapped in small spaces.

00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:49.365
If I had a hallucination like that,
I think I would faint.

00:13:50.284 --> 00:13:51.537
-[Mimihime] I…
-Huh?

00:13:52.162 --> 00:13:56.254
Quite often I see things
that others don't.

00:13:57.632 --> 00:13:58.759
[Kona] Like what?

00:13:59.343 --> 00:14:00.597
Like…

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.769
-I see figures floating in the sky…
-[liquid sloshing]

00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:06.650
…or I see something
that's about to happen, before it does.

00:14:07.401 --> 00:14:09.740
But it's a little vague.

00:14:09.823 --> 00:14:11.827
And I'm not sure when
what I see will happen.

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:16.587
It might feel like it'll happen tomorrow,
but then it never does.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.054
Or like it'll happen way in the future,
but then it happens ten seconds later.

00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:24.143
<i>I-It's happening now.</i>

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:26.732
[Kona] <i>I see.</i>

00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:30.823
<i>So it's like a premonition,</i>
<i>or an intuition of the future.</i>

00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:33.788
<i>Everyone probably gets those feelings</i>
<i>to a certain degree,</i>

00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:36.084
<i>but it seems like yours are much stronger.</i>

00:14:37.837 --> 00:14:39.549
[Mimihime] <i>Go away, go away.</i>

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.054
<i>Go away, go away.</i>

00:14:42.137 --> 00:14:43.683
<i>Go away, go away!</i>

00:14:48.985 --> 00:14:50.237
[Mimihime gasps]

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.324
Hmm?

00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:56.082
[sighs]

00:14:56.165 --> 00:14:58.336
I'm gonna go back to my room.

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:00.800
Okay, rest up.

00:15:04.181 --> 00:15:05.183
Huh?

00:15:06.436 --> 00:15:07.438
Ohma?

00:15:08.314 --> 00:15:11.905
-Why are you out here at this time?
-Here.

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:15.747
You were waiting this whole time
just to return my handkerchief?

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.832
Yes.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.422
Mimihime, I'm…

00:15:22.134 --> 00:15:23.470
I'm sorry.

00:15:36.496 --> 00:15:37.957
Don't do that!

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.842
[electric whirring]

00:15:43.426 --> 00:15:45.640
[gasps, grunts]

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.275
[Mimihime] <i>Go away, go away.</i>

00:15:51.359 --> 00:15:53.948
<i>Go away, go away.</i>

00:15:54.031 --> 00:15:55.117
<i>Go away.</i>

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.620
Go away!

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:01.045
Hmm?

00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:05.262
See? I'm fine.

00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:06.389
[breathing shakily]

00:16:06.472 --> 00:16:10.606
The thing that annoys everyone else
has no effect on me.

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:15.073
So you don't need to cry
or apologize anymore.

00:16:15.658 --> 00:16:17.369
-[chuckles]
-[sobbing]

00:16:27.557 --> 00:16:28.976
[grunts]

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:30.228
-[staff member] What a mess.
-Huh?

00:16:30.813 --> 00:16:32.817
There's barely any space left to walk.

00:16:33.318 --> 00:16:36.324
My head's a total mess too.

00:16:36.407 --> 00:16:40.207
[Mina]
<i>That's the correct one. Please continue.</i>

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.629
<i>Plug C23 into Y7, and…</i>

00:16:42.712 --> 00:16:45.885
-What exactly are we building?
-<i>…F18 into Z11.</i>

00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:48.891
If the head of the Tech Department
doesn't know, no one does.

00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:52.899
No, I don't just mean these machines.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.533
<i>I know the goal is to create a pure Heaven</i>
<i>in a broken world.</i>

00:16:57.617 --> 00:16:59.871
<i>That much is clear.</i>

00:17:00.998 --> 00:17:03.294
But beyond that,

00:17:04.421 --> 00:17:06.510
after the main goal of creating Heaven,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.100
the information we're being given
is too fragmented.

00:17:10.726 --> 00:17:14.358
After that, aren't we going to expand
Heaven into the outside?

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:17.865
That plan seems pretty clear to me.

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:22.249
Plus, Director said "soon,"
so it must be true.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.838
[chuckles] I guess so.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.971
Plus, we've already
crossed so many taboos.

00:17:30.056 --> 00:17:32.144
[Mina] <i>Please continue with the task.</i>

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.610
<i>B44 into A16.</i>

00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:38.741
<i>H5 into Q31.</i>

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.749
God is telling us to go!

00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:45.128
Let's execute the plan.

00:17:46.005 --> 00:17:48.217
Now's our chance,
while the director isn't here.

00:17:49.596 --> 00:17:51.767
I've made the preliminary arrangements.

00:17:52.434 --> 00:17:54.146
Then when can we start? Specifically?

00:17:55.023 --> 00:17:58.614
If the gate to the outside
were to accidentally open, then anytime.

00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:01.369
I wouldn't call that specific.

00:18:01.452 --> 00:18:02.454
[Sawatari] Uh--

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:06.087
-Oops. It's time for the milk.
-What?

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.634
-Please excuse me.
-Wait, Dr. Sawatari!

00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:11.430
Hey, wait!

00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:17.527
[PA system] <i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

00:18:18.069 --> 00:18:22.077
<i>Today is Saturday, July 20th. Ten'ei 18.</i>

00:18:22.829 --> 00:18:26.753
<i>For first period,</i>
<i>please gather at the pool.</i>

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:28.381
Huh?

00:18:28.464 --> 00:18:32.557
[PA system] <i>There will be no swimming,</i>
<i>so you may attend in your uniforms.</i>

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.604
-[student] Want to compete today?
-[student 2] Yeah, sounds good.

00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:39.571
Why are you in your swimsuit?

00:18:39.654 --> 00:18:44.789
I guess some people didn't listen properly
and came in their swimsuits.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:49.131
-Right, Anzu? [laughs]
-[groans]

00:18:51.469 --> 00:18:53.682
-[Mimihime] Don't fall in.
-[gasps]

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:56.187
-Mimihime.
-[Michika laughs]

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.732
-[Kuku] Huh?
-[Michika] Huh?

00:18:57.815 --> 00:18:59.318
-[Kuku shouts]
-[students] Huh?

00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:01.531
[Kuku] It's Tokio!

00:19:01.615 --> 00:19:03.284
-[students laughing]
-Tokio.

00:19:03.367 --> 00:19:05.246
You look fine!

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.415
Your hair got longer.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.338
They said I can come back to school soon.

00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:10.423
-[students laugh]
-Really?

00:19:11.008 --> 00:19:13.722
-[Michika] We can play with Tokio again!
-[Kuku] That's great!

00:19:13.806 --> 00:19:15.475
[students laughing]

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.645
[robot teacher] <i>Okay, everyone,</i>

00:19:16.728 --> 00:19:19.943
<i>please stop talking</i>
<i>and give me your full attention.</i>

00:19:21.403 --> 00:19:23.324
What? What lesson is that?

00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:25.453
All the students are gathered together.

00:19:25.955 --> 00:19:27.374
Is it a school assembly?

00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:31.090
[robot teacher]
<i>We will be having a test shortly.</i>

00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:35.975
<i>It will be a long test,</i>
<i>but you will have plenty of time.</i>

00:19:36.058 --> 00:19:37.687
-A test?
-[Anzu] What kind of test?

00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:40.275
[robot teacher] <i>When you are lost</i>
<i>and cannot find the answer,</i>

00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:44.199
<i>please proceed in the direction</i>
<i>that you believe to be the correct one.</i>

00:19:45.076 --> 00:19:48.332
<i>To reach the outside of the outside</i>

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:51.255
<i>is your role, as Hiruko.</i>

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.056
<i>The first problem will appear momentarily.</i>

00:19:57.434 --> 00:20:00.356
<i>I wish you all the best of luck.</i>

00:20:03.906 --> 00:20:05.701
[Michika] That was some weird lesson.

00:20:06.201 --> 00:20:09.082
-[student 3 grunts]
-Anzu, let's go for a swim!

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:10.878
I think I'll pass.

00:20:12.673 --> 00:20:13.842
Hey, Taka.

00:20:14.426 --> 00:20:16.640
Mmm? What is it?

00:20:18.142 --> 00:20:19.854
What do you think the test is?

00:20:19.938 --> 00:20:21.482
Ah.

00:20:21.566 --> 00:20:25.239
It's sudden, but they did give us notice.
At least it's not totally out of the blue.

00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:30.458
[sighs] I'm not sure why, but I'm worried.

00:20:31.043 --> 00:20:33.840
[chuckles] Anzu, you're smart.
You'll be fine!

00:20:33.924 --> 00:20:35.928
It should be me who's worried.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.978
That's not really what I meant.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.194
[student]
Did you hear? They mentioned Hiruko.

00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:46.616
Hmm? Did they?

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.329
I felt like
I was being called by my real name.

00:20:49.413 --> 00:20:52.085
One that I had completely forgotten.

00:20:52.878 --> 00:20:54.549
-[student 2] Me too.
-[student] Hmm.

00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:57.095
I had the same feeling.

00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:06.573
[chuckles]

00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:11.791
TOKIO JR.

00:21:17.887 --> 00:21:18.972
Sleep tight.

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:27.447

-[device chiming]
-[groans]

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:36.508
[chuckles] I thought you were studying,
but it's a game isn't it?

00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:37.635
Huh?

00:21:37.718 --> 00:21:41.058
What's the point of studying
if we don't know what the test is about?

00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:43.312
Yeah, good point. [chuckles]

00:21:45.692 --> 00:21:49.324

00:22:04.062 --> 00:22:06.568
[Mina powers down]

00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:13.874
THE TEST BEGINS
