WEBVTT

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.773
[Tarao] Of course there's an outside
beyond here.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:37.361
We don't know
where the teachers-only doors go,

00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:39.866
or where the cafeteria servers
disappear to,

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:42.706
or what's inside those big vents.

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:47.549
So at the very least, all of those spaces
could be considered outside.

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:51.097
[Tokio] I just wonder why Mimihime
would wanna go outside at all?

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.978
Do you like Mimihime or something?

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:55.857
Well, yeah. Of course I do.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:58.111
Oh, I see.

00:01:58.194 --> 00:01:59.280
[grunts]

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:01.075
-Hey! Are you okay?
-[groaning]

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:02.912
[Tarao groans]

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.712
I'm gonna go back to my room.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:09.843
-Want a hand?
-No. I'll use autopilot.

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:11.889
Don't worry about it.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.272
[both moaning]

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:17.692
[gasps]

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.030
[both gasp]

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:21.992
[both giggling]

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.790
-[groans]
-[giggling continues]

00:02:26.502 --> 00:02:27.796
-[Kuku giggles]
-[Tokio gasps]

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:29.674
[Kuku laughs]

00:02:29.758 --> 00:02:31.553
-Lick it.
-[Tokio] Kuku, that drawing!

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:34.183
Yeah, Kona said I could have it.
Pretty neat, huh?

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.268
Give me that!

00:02:35.352 --> 00:02:37.982
Why should I, you big meanie?
He gave it to me.

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:40.947
Because he promised that
he would give it to me when he was done.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.536
You get all of Kona's drawings.
You're being greedy.

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.708
You don't want Kuku to have any! Not one!

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.587
-[Tokio] No, you're right.
-Uh?

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:50.967
Keep it. I'm sorry.

00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:54.431
[Tokio strains, pants]

00:02:58.106 --> 00:02:59.776
[gasps, groans]

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.824
What the heck? I was just sitting there.

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:05.788
[Tokio] Why did you give that fish
to Kuku?

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:08.209
You promised that one would be mine.

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.923
I'll draw the next one for you, okay?

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:12.384
[gasps] Really?

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:16.267
[Tokio] Okay.
I like the things you imagine.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.941
[Mimihime] Geez.
All that 'cause Kuku got one picture.

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:21.862
You're such a crybaby.

00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.953
-[water running]
-[faucet squeaks]

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.586
[sighs]

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.047
-[cell phone chimes]
-Huh?

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:34.763
A picture from Mimihime?

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.059
[gasps]

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:38.896
[breathes shakily]

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:40.566
[gasps]

00:03:46.578 --> 00:03:47.580
[chuckles]

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.335
[Kiruko breathing heavily]

00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.430
[gasps, panting]

00:03:59.103 --> 00:04:01.023
[groans] I'm drenched.

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:02.527
-[tapping on window]
-[gasps]

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.117
[tapping continues]

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:09.373
[gunshot]

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:10.458
[Kiruko gasps]

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.843
[pants] Man-eater's here. Maru!
Wake up, dude.

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:17.431
[strains] She locked us in.

00:04:18.015 --> 00:04:19.728
Let's go out through the bathroom.

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:23.317
[groans]

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:25.113
-[Kiruko] Here drink.
-Huh?

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.284
She slipped us some kind of drug
to knock us out.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.371
Guess she didn't want us awake for this.

00:04:35.634 --> 00:04:37.262
[gasps]

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:39.726
[innkeeper] It's dangerous out here.
Get back inside!

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.439
[Kiruko] It's okay.
I told you we can kill these things.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:45.236
-[thuds, whooshing]
-[innkeeper gasps]

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:46.907
How's the Kiru-Beam?

00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:48.619
Locked and loaded.

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:51.583
[whooshing]

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.294
-[Kiruko] There!
-[Maru] Let's go!

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.090
[thuds]

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:12.583
-[Maru yelps]
-[gasps]

00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:14.671
I'm good. Just tripped.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.382
[sighs]

00:05:17.008 --> 00:05:18.344
[mysterious whooshing]

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:23.605
-[gasps]
-[both grunt]

00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:28.574
-[Maru] How did it--
-[Kiruko] I don't know.

00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:29.868
Try throwing something.

00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:32.038
[straining] Okay!

00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:34.293
-[clattering]
-[gasps] Was that a sound wave?

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.506
Negative. At least I don't think it was.

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:39.469
Look. You can see something flickering.

00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:40.556
[cracking]

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.477
It's got whips
or something going out of it.

00:05:52.997 --> 00:05:54.416
[both panting]

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:57.422
Did you see what I'm talking about?

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.009
There are three on each arm.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.973
If you can take them out,
then I can get up close.

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:04.478
[Kiruko] Three each?
I wanted to cut the wings.

00:06:05.313 --> 00:06:06.524
Do I have enough bullets?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.114
No. Three and three is six.
You're way short.

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:11.408
That was rhetorical.

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:13.120
[Maru gasps] Wait.

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:15.501
Where'd it go? [gasps]

00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:18.924
Hey! This way!

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:25.436
[innkeeper gasps]

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:28.317
You see that?

00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:30.572
I hit an arm and a wing at the same time!

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.908
[Maru] All right. Sniper.

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:34.037
The gun's range is longer than the whips.

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:38.922
So if I can get a little closer, I think
I should be able to hit the other arm.

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:40.509
Then you're up. Sound good?

00:06:40.592 --> 00:06:41.594
Yeah.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.807
Here goes nothing.

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:47.022
Remember, you could lose an arm
if you're not careful. So…

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:50.821
I was trying not to think about that,
so thank you.

00:06:50.904 --> 00:06:51.906
-[rustling]
-[gasps]

00:07:04.264 --> 00:07:06.143
[heavy footsteps approaching]

00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.455
[breathes shakily]

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:19.461
-Got you now!
-[shrieks]

00:07:21.716 --> 00:07:22.968
[Maru] The manager?

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:24.972
Run! Get out of here!

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:26.559
-[gun clicks]
-[innkeeper gasps]

00:07:26.643 --> 00:07:29.565
Don't hurt him! This monster is my son.

00:07:30.358 --> 00:07:32.863
[Kiruko] You mean
your son was eaten by that thing?

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:35.828
No! I mean Yuto went inside of it!

00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:38.207
[crying] And then it became Yuto!

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.294
[Kiruko] I see.

00:07:40.378 --> 00:07:43.927
You think he's still in there
because Man-eaters absorb their prey.

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:47.560
I was almost eaten by one,
so I know what it looks like.

00:07:48.854 --> 00:07:51.818
And why you'd wanna drug us to protect it.
But I'm sorry.

00:07:52.443 --> 00:07:55.659
I don't think the ones who are eaten
get to take over the bodies.

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.832
But you can't know that! You can't know.

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:00.711
Yuto protects me.

00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:04.050
One time he rescued me
when some guys tried to rough me up.

00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:05.136
[Kiruko sighs]

00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:07.641
-Okay then.
-[gasps]

00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:09.520
You sure?

00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:11.816
If it's not a threat,
there's no reason to kill it.

00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:14.822
And this thing's outta power now anyway,
so…

00:08:14.906 --> 00:08:16.450
[innkeeper sighs]

00:08:16.534 --> 00:08:19.206
Yuto, did you hear that? They understand.

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:20.499
I'm safe.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.504
We're safe.

00:08:23.757 --> 00:08:26.261
[Kiruko] Wow. They can still communicate?

00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:29.602
It's okay. See?

00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:31.731
[gasps]

00:08:33.442 --> 00:08:34.444
[Maru grunts]

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.454
[sighs]

00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:43.755
[groans] Shit!

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:46.093
-[Kiruko] Did you see that?
-Huh?

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:49.892
[Kiruko] It had to to pause
and retract the whip between attacks.

00:08:50.852 --> 00:08:52.982
It'd be a pretty good opening for us.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.948
How can you think like that?
Someone just died!

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.123
[Kiruko] And if I don't, we'll die too.

00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:05.131
-[gasps]
-[Maru] Sorry.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.849
I can handle it from here.

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:18.157
[whips cracking]

00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:21.038
[Maru grunts]

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.513
[Maru grunting]

00:09:33.228 --> 00:09:34.857
[groans]

00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:38.238
I'm in!

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.927
-[Maru grunting]
-[screeches]

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.649
[thuds]

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:03.832
[Maru] I wonder why the Hiruko didn't
attack the innkeeper until yesterday?

00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:07.004
[Kiruko] Maybe part of her kid
really was in there somewhere.

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:10.887
Or maybe it relied on her.
Kept her alive by pure instinct.

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:14.144
Because it knew
that prey would gather around here?

00:10:14.645 --> 00:10:19.530
That, or she was actively
feeding her guests to her son all along.

00:10:19.613 --> 00:10:20.615
[Maru groans]

00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:23.997
[Kiruko] Never mind.
Doesn't matter now anyway.

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:25.917
The truth can stay hidden.

00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:28.338
Besides, we have enough on our plate.

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:30.050
Looking for Heaven and all.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:33.474
Oh, hold up. Batteries.

00:10:34.058 --> 00:10:36.564
I thought you donated those
to the inn yesterday.

00:10:37.858 --> 00:10:40.237
-[chuckles, laughing]
-[groans]

00:10:40.947 --> 00:10:42.993
Hey, what do I look like, a dog?

00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:49.047
[Maru] Hey, Sis,
have you ever been on a moving train?

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.468
[Kiruko] I was like three
during the Great Disaster.

00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:53.890
I wouldn't be able to remember
even if I had.

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:58.190
Nuh-uh. If you're 20 now,
you would have been five, right?

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:00.152
-Uh, what the heck?
-[spits]

00:11:00.236 --> 00:11:02.448
-Why are you drinking dirt water?
-[coughs]

00:11:02.533 --> 00:11:06.248
Relax man, I'm just rinsing my mouth out.
But it does taste pretty clean.

00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:08.837
[chuckles] I'm glad it's so clear today.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.549
Perfect sailing weather.

00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:17.688
-[thuds]
-Okay.

00:11:18.898 --> 00:11:20.109
Let's do this.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.460
[groans] Yikes!

00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:32.216
-That's not quite as sturdy as I wanted.
-[creaks]

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.141
[yelps] Don't stomp. Gently!
Think like a feather.

00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:38.353
[Maru] I don't think that's gonna help.

00:11:38.437 --> 00:11:41.986
This rules!
I can't believe we got this to work.

00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:44.950
Now, if those old guys
were telling the truth,

00:11:45.034 --> 00:11:47.121
Tomato Heaven ought to be straight ahead.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.754
[sighs] Kind of late to ask,

00:11:50.837 --> 00:11:53.635
but there aren't any sharks or crocodiles
in here, right?

00:11:56.557 --> 00:11:58.435
-I guess.
-[Maru] You guess?

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:00.941
You know the only things I can kill
are Hiruko, right?

00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:04.197
So if we become croc chow whilst
we're out here defenseless, I blame you.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.411
Right. But I'll think of something
before it finishes eating you.

00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:10.376
Aren't you a bodyguard?
Make a plan in advance!

00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:14.760
But you know what?
If I was a crocodile, I'd eat you first.

00:12:15.344 --> 00:12:16.597
[both panting]

00:12:16.681 --> 00:12:18.768
Okay, what do you think of this plan,
then?

00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.022
We row all out
till we get to the opposite bank,

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:24.697
and in the meantime we can just pray that
we make it out with all our limbs intact!

00:12:27.577 --> 00:12:28.788
[Mimihime] Sorry, sorry.

00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:30.542
[Tokio] It's okay. I'll go get it.

00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:35.969
Ugh.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.308
<i>A teachers-only door.</i>

00:12:40.729 --> 00:12:42.941
<i>What if there is something else</i>
<i>back there?</i>

00:12:44.611 --> 00:12:47.491
Sorry, I just wanted to get our ball back.

00:12:48.243 --> 00:12:50.874
[robotic voice] <i>That's all right.</i>
<i>You may collect it.</i>

00:12:58.514 --> 00:12:59.558
[thuds]

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.564
[student] Aha, there it is.

00:13:04.777 --> 00:13:06.237
And you stick it there.

00:13:06.321 --> 00:13:09.327
[Anzu] Are you sure about this?
It looks dangerous.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.914
[laughs] It'll be fine.

00:13:10.997 --> 00:13:14.212
These little babies can stick
to just about anything. Trust me.

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:16.842
[sighs] You're gonna
get in so much trouble.

00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:18.554
Worth it either way.

00:13:19.807 --> 00:13:22.979
Because after all, this is for science!

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.900
[devices beep]

00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:26.486
Oh? Oh!

00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:28.991
Wow!

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:30.452
[student 2] Awesome!

00:13:30.537 --> 00:13:32.331
[Anzu] He's so high up already.

00:13:33.668 --> 00:13:36.131
Just a little farther
and I'll be able to reach the top.

00:13:36.214 --> 00:13:39.345
-[machines beep]
-Whoa! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:13:43.311 --> 00:13:44.397
[grunts]

00:13:48.573 --> 00:13:50.450
[groaning] Ow.

00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:52.037
[both gasp]

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.879
Uh-- Eh?

00:13:55.962 --> 00:13:58.843
[student 2] Taka fell so hard
it made Shiro start bleeding!

00:13:58.926 --> 00:14:00.555
[all laugh]

00:14:01.765 --> 00:14:04.186
-Is something wrong?
-Hmm.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.192
I just feel like
something else is about to fall.

00:14:10.365 --> 00:14:13.204
[Kiruko] If this is supposed to be Heaven,
I gotta say,

00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:14.708
I don't think it's for me.

00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:19.760
But you don't know what your Heaven
is supposed to look like,

00:14:19.843 --> 00:14:22.599
or even what you're gonna do
when you get there, right?

00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:23.726
Right.

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:26.982
Well, my job doesn't end
until you're satisfied.

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:30.030
And I won't just dump you.
I wanna do everything I can to help.

00:14:30.113 --> 00:14:33.829
So if there's anything you haven't told
me yet, now might be the time.

00:14:34.413 --> 00:14:36.627
I guess the only thing I'm hiding is…

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.671
[zipper opens]

00:14:37.754 --> 00:14:38.839
This.

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:43.975
That's a syringe full of medicine,
and a needle.

00:14:45.853 --> 00:14:49.235
Apparently it's for some guy
who looks exactly like me.

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:53.869
I'm supposed to inject him with that drug
as soon as I find him.

00:14:53.953 --> 00:14:58.713
Whoever he is, I think he's in this
"Heaven" place that we're looking for.

00:14:59.296 --> 00:15:01.259
And after that?

00:15:01.844 --> 00:15:04.181
Beats me. It'll cure his sickness?

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.398
I was actually told it would
help everyone, but I wasn't told how.

00:15:08.983 --> 00:15:11.697
And apart from that,
I don't know any more than you do.

00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:14.160
Did Mikura say anything to you?

00:15:15.037 --> 00:15:16.915
You are the last person who saw her.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.295
Before she-- You know.

00:15:20.088 --> 00:15:22.468
[Mikura exhales] Pull it back.

00:15:24.263 --> 00:15:25.348
[gasps]

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:27.729
[Mikura] Take the gun.

00:15:28.814 --> 00:15:29.816
Protect Maru.

00:15:30.777 --> 00:15:33.239
[Kiruko] I will. Where should I take him?

00:15:35.285 --> 00:15:36.370
Heaven.

00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:40.963
[Kiruko] No. Just that I had
to take you to Heaven.

00:15:42.466 --> 00:15:44.303
[villager] Hey there! Like the view?

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:46.015
[Kiruko] Oh. Hello.

00:15:46.099 --> 00:15:49.146
You kids don't strike me
as the marauding bandit type.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.650
Are you two from around here?

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:54.073
Not at all.
We actually walked all the way from Tokyo.

00:15:54.658 --> 00:15:56.787
[villager 2] And you just
stumbled across us?

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.254
No. Someone kinda gave us directions.
They said this place was like heaven?

00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:03.592
Oh, you've heard of us. Good!

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:07.391
-[villager] That mean you wanna move in?
-Well, he might, depending.

00:16:07.474 --> 00:16:08.519
That's wonderful.

00:16:08.602 --> 00:16:10.565
We should take them over
to meet the leader.

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:13.319
[villager 3] Can do. Come on in.

00:16:13.403 --> 00:16:14.698
[children laugh]

00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:16.033
Come on, Taisuke!

00:16:16.827 --> 00:16:18.998
[villager 3] If you came all the way from
Tokyo,

00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:20.793
did you have to climb down the fault?

00:16:20.877 --> 00:16:23.423
[Maru] Oh, you mean that giant cliff?
Yeah.

00:16:23.507 --> 00:16:27.807
Not the most relaxing hike. And we
built a raft to cross the rest of the way.

00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:29.268
[villager 3 laughs]

00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:30.897
You kids are brave!

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.569
Those waters are lousy
with salt water crocs.

00:16:33.652 --> 00:16:34.654
[both] Uh--

00:16:35.363 --> 00:16:38.119
There were crocs in there! I told you so!

00:16:38.203 --> 00:16:40.708
You didn't get eaten, did you?
So who cares?

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.962
[villager 3 laughs]

00:16:43.004 --> 00:16:45.676
I'm Kusakabe. I oversee this village.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.097
-And this is my wife, Momoko.
-[Momoko giggles]

00:16:48.849 --> 00:16:52.774
Welcome. Our little ragtag commune
is delighted to have you.

00:16:52.857 --> 00:16:56.280
<i>I'm sure you've seen folks</i>
<i>out there who still cling to the past,</i>

00:16:56.364 --> 00:16:59.245
<i>and dream of reviving society</i>
<i>as we knew it.</i>

00:16:59.328 --> 00:17:02.502
<i>But folks who get sick of all that mess</i>
<i>tend to wind up here.</i>

00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:06.050
<i>They can breathe</i>
<i>and live off the fruits of the earth.</i>

00:17:06.133 --> 00:17:08.096
Our lives are simple, but they're joyful.

00:17:08.639 --> 00:17:11.352
[Kusakabe] <i>At first, it was just my father</i>
<i>and a few others.</i>

00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:14.818
<i>But before we knew it,</i>
<i>we'd become the family you see today.</i>

00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:16.404
Whoa.

00:17:16.487 --> 00:17:18.534
-That's so cool.
-[Kiruko] Hmm?

00:17:18.617 --> 00:17:20.913
We came this way
looking for Tomato Heaven.

00:17:20.997 --> 00:17:22.457
Are we in the right place?

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:23.711
Ah!

00:17:23.794 --> 00:17:26.257
Tomatoes were the very first crop
we grew here.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.889
But nowadays, we can grow
just about anything you can imagine.

00:17:29.973 --> 00:17:32.102
[chattering]

00:17:35.526 --> 00:17:37.947
[Maru] I gotta say, I like Tomato Heaven.

00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.580
Yeah, I'm really impressed with
the size of their operation here.

00:17:42.164 --> 00:17:44.168
And they're nice enough to feed us,

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:46.506
but it still feels kind of warped to me.

00:17:47.341 --> 00:17:49.011
[Maru slurps]

00:17:49.094 --> 00:17:50.765
Well, you probably know best.

00:17:50.848 --> 00:17:52.769
Geez, think critically much?

00:17:53.937 --> 00:17:55.733
This place was worth a shot,

00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:59.532
but if no-one's recognized your face,
I guess your look-alike isn't here.

00:18:00.325 --> 00:18:03.874
[gasps] Hey, that's right.
Why didn't I even think of that?

00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:05.168
You're kidding.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.674
You mean that never
once crossed your tiny little mind?

00:18:07.757 --> 00:18:09.426
Oh! I know that face!

00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:11.389
It's really you!

00:18:11.472 --> 00:18:13.519
-Kiriko Takehaya!
-Huh?

00:18:13.602 --> 00:18:15.856
The electro-kart racer!

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.860
Nope. You're mistaken.

00:18:17.944 --> 00:18:20.490
No, I'd recognize you anywhere.
I was a huge fan.

00:18:20.574 --> 00:18:22.954
Look! I still have your photo.

00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:28.172
I remember your disappearance like
it was yesterday, even though it's been…

00:18:28.256 --> 00:18:30.720
five years? I was so worried.

00:18:30.803 --> 00:18:32.849
There were rumors flying around
that you lost it

00:18:32.932 --> 00:18:34.602
after you hit and killed your brother
during a race,

00:18:34.686 --> 00:18:36.063
but I never believed any of--

00:18:36.147 --> 00:18:37.650
[Maru] Hey!

00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:39.403
She doesn't look anything like--

00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:43.704
Huh.

00:18:43.787 --> 00:18:47.085
Okay, so they do look alike.
But that's not her.

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:50.467
-But they even sound the same--
-I said you got the wrong person!

00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:52.304
Right. I'm sorry.

00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:54.642
Huh? Hey, wait!

00:18:54.726 --> 00:18:56.479
-Huh?
-I thought I saw…

00:18:59.778 --> 00:19:02.032
[Maru] Boom! Sis, check it out.

00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:03.952
Uh--

00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:06.207
Am I supposed to recognize this, or--

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.044
Yeah, dude! Look, here--

00:19:08.127 --> 00:19:09.129
[Maru groans]

00:19:09.213 --> 00:19:11.760
Boundaries, buddy.
Don't go around groping people's legs.

00:19:11.843 --> 00:19:14.641
Chill out. It's on your gun.

00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:17.479
Oh.

00:19:17.563 --> 00:19:18.565
Uh--

00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:21.905
Hey, where did this box come from?

00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:23.784
[villager] Hard to say.

00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:27.040
We take vegetables over to Tokyo
by boat all the time,

00:19:27.123 --> 00:19:29.629
and we do a lot of trading
while we're there, so,

00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:32.092
we wind up with boxes
from all over the place.

00:19:32.802 --> 00:19:35.306
[Maru] Wait, you can get to Tokyo by boat?

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.475
That's cool.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.312
[Kiruko] If we look into this symbol,

00:19:38.396 --> 00:19:40.734
we might find
some kind of connection to you, Maru.

00:19:41.653 --> 00:19:44.826
At the very least, we might find out where
this gun came from.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.584
Hey, electro-kart fan.

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:51.088
Do you know where we could find a place
called "Heaven"?

00:19:51.171 --> 00:19:52.925
-Here, of course.
-Yeah, other than here?

00:19:56.348 --> 00:19:57.768
[chuckles]

00:19:57.852 --> 00:20:01.400
Well, back in Kiriko Takehaya's day,
it'd be Asakusa.

00:20:02.277 --> 00:20:03.614
Huh?

00:20:04.489 --> 00:20:05.868
That'll do. Thanks sir.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.080
You've been very helpful.

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:12.590
If we can't get any more useful info
by tomorrow night,

00:20:12.673 --> 00:20:14.886
I say we get on the boat back to Tokyo.

00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:16.013
Sure.

00:20:16.096 --> 00:20:18.644
Japan is so much bigger
than I would have imagined.

00:20:19.227 --> 00:20:22.526
And at the rate we're going,
it'll take forever to find Heaven.

00:20:23.737 --> 00:20:26.033
I hate to turn around after
we've come all this way,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.997
but I'd like to dig into your
background a bit.

00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:30.083
That might help.

00:20:31.878 --> 00:20:33.381
[waves lapping]

00:20:33.464 --> 00:20:35.636
Maru, I found some potatoes!

00:20:35.719 --> 00:20:39.184
Yo, you want one? I'm guessing
they didn't count them or anything.

00:20:40.436 --> 00:20:43.902
<i>Hey, you good? Seasick?</i>

00:20:45.405 --> 00:20:46.490
Forget about Heaven.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.079
We're not gonna find it.

00:20:50.331 --> 00:20:52.670
I'd rather go back
and live on the farm with you.

00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:54.966
[Kiruko chuckles] I'll pass, thanks.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:59.726
Farming all day and getting high all night
isn't exactly my idea of a good life.

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:02.857
They just look like a bunch of idiots
playing in the dirt to me.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.276
We don't have to do that.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:07.533
I mean, like--
I can help you with your business.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.791
Look-- I really like you, okay?

00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:14.589
-What?
-[grunts]

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.970
[Kiruko stammers]

00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:20.601
No! Confessing in a place
where neither of us can escape

00:21:20.684 --> 00:21:22.521
is a really terrible idea! You know that?

00:21:22.605 --> 00:21:25.611
I'm being serious! I want a real answer.

00:21:28.449 --> 00:21:31.915
[Kiruko screams] Wait! Get off of me!

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:33.794
Forcing is bad!

00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:37.676
That was dumb. I am so sorry!

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.891
It's cool. I'm flattered.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.982
But, uh, I'm gonna tell you something.

00:21:45.609 --> 00:21:46.611
Okay?

00:21:48.155 --> 00:21:50.451
And it's gonna sound crazy, but it's true.

00:21:50.536 --> 00:21:54.000
So please, try to understand,
'cause I'm not trying to weird you out.

00:21:55.169 --> 00:21:58.467
I, uh-- I know I have the body of a woman,

00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:04.229
but in here,
my mind and everything, is a man's.

00:22:06.818 --> 00:22:10.116
So, yeah. Um, I'm a man.

00:22:12.621 --> 00:22:13.874
[Maru] Huh?
