[Man-eater groans]

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:07.181
A Man-eater.

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:08.266
[whimpering]

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.522
Well, that's great.
Better sound the alarm.

00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.403
-Hey, Captain!
-You can't just barge in here--

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:16.825
[Kiruko] Speed up!
A Man-eater is attacking the ship!

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.161
[captain] <i>What'd you say?</i>

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:20.583
[Maru] Sis, it's back!

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:22.294
Uh-- Ah! [grunts]

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:24.173
[metal creaking]

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.259
Eat this!

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:31.145
Yeah! Nice shot!

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:35.153
[gurgling]

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:36.364
[both groan]

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.410
Seriously?

00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:40.957
[Man-eater gurgles]

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.976

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:17.316
-[Kuku giggles] Kuku.
-Uh…

00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:21.157
Nobody followed you out here
or anything, right?

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:23.662
-[grunts]
-Then let's go!

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:26.042
We're gonna see a baby.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:27.545

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:37.816
And here it is!

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.068
What is?

00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.113
-Follow me.
-Uh…

00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:42.282
-[grunts]
-Huh?

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:43.577
[hums]

00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:46.207

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.334
Uh…

00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:51.552
We can get in through here!

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:17.562
[student 1] Hey, did you hear that noise
in class today?

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:19.064
[student 2] Maybe. Which noise?

00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:20.860
-[Taka] Look, I can do it up here!
-[Anzu] Stop!

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:23.489
-You're going to hurt yourself.

Nothing aberrant there.

[computer beeps] <i>Contact</i>

Iwa and Nanaki at it again.

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:41.192
I wonder what exactly led them
to inventing the kiss.

00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:42.904
It is bizarre, isn't it?

00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:45.660
The behavior has never been taught
or modeled in any way.

00:03:45.743 --> 00:03:46.870
-[beeping]
-[both] Huh?

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:49.876
[computer] <i>Possible deterioration</i>

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.757
Medical team,
we've received an alert for Tarao.

<i>Confirm his condition, please.</i>

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:56.515
Got it. We're on the way.

00:03:57.642 --> 00:04:00.271
-[Tokio] You stick right there.
-[beeping]

00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:03.486
Okay. Upsy-daisy.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.492
-Whoa!
-Tokio, you're a genius!

00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:08.997
I actually stole this idea from Taka.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.087
[lens whirring]

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:16.137
Almost there. I gotcha.

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:17.849

00:04:20.646 --> 00:04:22.900
[students laughing]

00:04:22.984 --> 00:04:24.821
-Okay then, lead the way!
-Let's go look for it.

00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:26.742
-[laughter continues]
-[Kuku] Tokio!

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:28.746
-Uh--
-Hurry up.

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:29.831
[Tokio] All right.

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.427
<i>Does this count?</i>
<i>Are we going outside of the outside?</i>

00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:43.609
[Man-eater squelches]

00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:45.153
[sailor] We're dead if that gets in!

00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:49.286
Wait, your gun. If you can at least
shoot it off the side of the ship again,

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:52.292
that should buy us enough time to
make sure all the outer doors are closed.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.547
[Kiruko] Sorry, I'm out of bullets.

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:58.806
And I don't know if the ship
is lopsided or rusted or what,

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.393
but we got at least one door
that won't budge.

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:04.066
Then all we can do
is barricade ourselves in here.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:06.571
[Maru] How long until we reach the shore?

00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:08.617
[captain] At top speed, half an hour.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.245
Will this thing hold?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.000
-[screw clatters]
-Yikes! Uh--

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:16.006
I'm gonna guess, "No."

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.138
What do you think?

00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:22.102
Not sure yet,
but look at all that goop on it.

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:24.691
It covers its entire body like a suit.

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:27.613
I think it needs that lubricant
to move, to attack,

00:05:27.697 --> 00:05:30.076
to use its freaky little sticky hands.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.082
If we can get rid of that,
we can incapacitate it.

00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:36.130
So where would be
the best place to fight it?

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:39.261
Somewhere that would dry it out, right?
On land?

00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:42.560
No time. We need to trap it
somewhere maze-like,

00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:44.898
force it into wiping the goop off itself.

00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:48.614
-We'll fight it inside the ship.
-Um, no, thank you.

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:52.329
Hey! That "Do not enter" door
you got downstairs?

00:05:52.412 --> 00:05:55.001
-<i>I need to enter.</i>
-[sailor] <i>What?</i>

00:05:55.084 --> 00:05:56.086
Not a chance.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.924
If you don't want to die today,
I need the key!

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:00.011
-It ain't even locked.
-[both] Huh?

00:06:00.596 --> 00:06:02.850
Ain't never been locked.
Go let yourself in.

00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:04.896
Well, he said it ain't locked…

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:07.192
Unbelievable.

00:06:08.654 --> 00:06:10.114
[Maru] Sis, hang on!

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:12.620
How are we supposed to kill it
without the Kiru-Beam?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.289
We have the Maru-Touch.

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:15.584
[gasps]

00:06:17.003 --> 00:06:18.005
And that is?

00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:21.428
-Where you touch it and it dies.
-Huh?

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:24.852
[gasps] Wait.

00:06:24.936 --> 00:06:27.023
[shouting] You don't have a plan, do you?

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:29.696
[squelching]

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:35.164

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.573
It's open, come on!

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.952
You need to open both sides.

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:17.123
Otherwise,
the fish won't be able to get in!

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:18.668
It doesn't need to get in!

00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:21.173
-The plan's not gonna work if it doesn't!
-I hate this!

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.219
[panting]

00:07:23.302 --> 00:07:26.183
-It's all boxes in here, too.
-Run across already!

00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:27.853
[Maru] Damn it! I gotta say,

00:07:27.937 --> 00:07:30.358
I don't like trapping us in a tiny room
with that thing.

00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.362
[squelching]

00:07:34.074 --> 00:07:35.869

Another door. [grunting]

00:07:41.798 --> 00:07:43.384
It's freaking stuck!

00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:45.889
Let me in! Come on!

00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:48.310

I can't get this handle to move!
[grunting]

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.297
-It doesn't need to.
-Really? Why?

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:08.225
[Man-eater groaning, squelching]

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:10.229
Oh, gross! What's happening to it now?

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:12.526
[chuckles] It found the greens.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.031
Gotta thank the good folks out at the farm
for this one.

00:08:15.114 --> 00:08:18.622
<i>The upper floor was full of produce,</i>
<i>which didn't do us much good.</i>

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:21.418
But they had to put the weed somewhere.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.510
Like, maybe behind a big door that said,
"Do not enter"?

00:08:26.094 --> 00:08:28.390
Between the hundreds of pounds
of dried marijuana

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:30.102
and all this cardboard,

00:08:30.938 --> 00:08:33.275
that poor freak
is just a fish out of water.

00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:37.158
[Man-eater squelching]

00:08:37.242 --> 00:08:39.914
[chuckles] We win.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:47.638
Yeah, he's not moving.
Give it the fatal blow.

00:08:48.222 --> 00:08:50.393
I can't believe we did this
without the Kiru-Beam.

00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:53.900
You should never focus solely
on your opponent in a fight.

00:08:54.484 --> 00:08:57.992
If you wanna win, you have to stay calm
and examine your surroundings.

00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:03.252
That's how I've survived this long,
anyway.

00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:07.051
[sighs] It does kinda suck, though.

00:09:07.636 --> 00:09:08.638
Hmm?

00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:12.145
I can live with "Kiru-Beam,"
but "Maru-Touch" is too far.

00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:14.190
[Kiruko] <i>What're you talking about?</i>

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:16.988
[Maru] <i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>how the way you name stuff is stupid!</i>

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:22.415
Um, we've been walking
for kind of a while now.

00:09:22.498 --> 00:09:23.918
You should learn how to be patient.

00:09:24.002 --> 00:09:25.254

00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:15.140
-[door opens]
-Huh?

00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:17.436
-[Director] What is all this fuss?
-[gasps]

00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:20.067
[scientist 1] Oh. There was
an intruder alert, Director.

00:11:21.152 --> 00:11:23.365
Yes, I'm aware of that. Thank you.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:25.452
[scientist 2] We'll follow up now.

00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:26.956
<i>Any info?</i>

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:29.043
[overseer 1] Not yet. We're still looking.

00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:32.676
[overseer 2] There's no sign
of an intruder anywhere on the premises.

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:34.012
We'll keep at it, of course,

00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:37.393
but chances are
it was just a glitch in the system.

00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:40.942
I guess that wasn't for us after all.

00:11:41.026 --> 00:11:43.531
Tokio! Give me your hand.

00:11:44.115 --> 00:11:46.328
[both grunting]

00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:52.716
[Tokio] Ah! [panting]

00:11:55.387 --> 00:11:56.557
[Kuku] We should hurry.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.441
-Hurry means move!
-[gasps]

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:12.589
To-ki-o…

00:12:16.304 --> 00:12:17.557
[Director] Okay, Mina.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.106
<i>Yes?</i>

00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:25.030
Tell me what happened to cause
that phantom intruder alert we all heard.

00:12:25.114 --> 00:12:27.953
This place is essentially your body,
correct?

00:12:28.036 --> 00:12:31.126
<i>If a human's health inspection</i>
<i>returned an error</i>

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.296
<i>requiring further examination,</i>

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.388
<i>would it be reasonable</i>
<i>to assume that human could identify</i>

00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:40.144
<i>where there something was wrong</i>
<i>in their body?</i>

00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:44.152
[chuckles]
You make a fair point, Mina. I surrender.

00:12:50.957 --> 00:12:53.170
[captain] Hey! Not so fast!

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.178
Yeah, you little punks!
Think you can just walk away from us?

00:12:57.261 --> 00:13:00.017
Well, think again!
You destroyed our cargo!

00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:02.981
-[grumbles]
-Uh…

00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:06.279
We all would have lost our lives out there
if it hadn't been for you kids.

00:13:06.362 --> 00:13:09.703
[stammers] Y-Yeah. Thank you very much
for saving us.

00:13:10.747 --> 00:13:13.126
Here. Thanks for the extermination.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.257
Oh, no. That's generous,
but I can't accept this.

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:18.721
We were also saving ourselves.

00:13:18.805 --> 00:13:21.392
But if you just gotta repay us, then…

00:13:21.476 --> 00:13:23.271
Can you tell us about the area?

00:13:23.355 --> 00:13:25.109
Well, let me think…

00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:30.119
-[both] Hmm?
-If you travel straight down this road,

00:13:30.202 --> 00:13:33.626
you'll eventually stumble over…
kind of a town, I suppose.

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:35.672
Cool. Oh, hang on.

00:13:36.256 --> 00:13:38.970
Do you know anything
about this bird symbol?

00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:40.389
[captain] Hmm.

00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:43.019
Emblems with birds like that
have been around for ages

00:13:43.103 --> 00:13:44.982
and reworked a hundred times.

00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:47.946
I'm afraid they've all run together for me
at this point.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:49.825
-That's too bad.
-I know it!

00:13:49.908 --> 00:13:51.244
You do? Where's it from?

00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:52.873
I think that…

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.795
it's the Mitsuba logo.

00:13:55.837 --> 00:13:56.964
Mitsuba, huh?

00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:58.968
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:01.347
There's a destroyed Mitsuba
along this road as well,

00:14:01.431 --> 00:14:02.601
if you wanna check it out.

00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:03.853
[gasps]

00:14:03.936 --> 00:14:05.314
Thanks a lot.

00:14:06.107 --> 00:14:07.192
Oh, one last thing.

00:14:07.276 --> 00:14:10.032
If you're interested
in working as our bodyguards--

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:12.954
We're kinda busy right now,
but maybe one day.

00:14:14.206 --> 00:14:16.629
Little brats, turning down a job offer.

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:18.549
Just who do they think they are?

00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:20.720
I do hope to run into 'em again.

00:14:20.803 --> 00:14:23.350
Those two have character and smarts
in spades.

00:14:23.433 --> 00:14:25.521
Yeah, yeah.
They're good kids, aren't they?

00:14:33.537 --> 00:14:34.790
[clattering]

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:36.543
[Kiruko groans] Geez, that guy.

00:14:38.004 --> 00:14:39.925
Got my hopes up over nothing.

00:14:40.927 --> 00:14:42.514
Big waste of time.

00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:45.185
-[Maru] Look what I found!
-Huh?

00:14:45.268 --> 00:14:47.565
Packaged food that totally won't kill us!

00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:49.861
Hey. That's awesome.

00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:51.364
Where'd you dig that up?

00:14:51.447 --> 00:14:53.661
It was in a book bag
hidden under some shelves.

00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:55.581
And there was an umbrella in there.

00:14:55.665 --> 00:14:57.459
So, you wanna go find the town--

00:14:57.544 --> 00:15:00.717
No, we still have plenty of time
before it's light out.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.512
-Might as well sleep here.
-Hmm.

00:15:05.183 --> 00:15:06.603
"You-kan".

00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:08.858
Okay, is this still good?

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:09.943
[sniffs]

00:15:11.613 --> 00:15:13.450
-[chuckles] Oh, it's sweet!
-[gasps]

00:15:13.534 --> 00:15:14.745
Yeah, you-kan!

00:15:14.828 --> 00:15:17.416
-Because "you-can" eat it!
-[groans]

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:25.223
[slurps, gasps]

00:15:25.307 --> 00:15:27.019
Whoa, this stuff is amazing!

00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:28.480
Ow! [groans]

00:15:28.564 --> 00:15:31.110
I could make this again tomorrow,
if you want.

00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:32.947
-We should give it a name.
-Huh?

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:34.033
[slurps]

00:15:34.116 --> 00:15:36.580
Well, it's youkan,
and I made it with a pan.

00:15:36.663 --> 00:15:38.124
So, how about "yo-pan"?

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:41.757
Right. Somehow, I already forgot
that you're terrible at that.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.636
Hey! Don't you judge me.

00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:45.848
You're the one who said
"you-can" eat the youkan.

00:15:45.932 --> 00:15:49.606
[Maru] Whatever we call it, it's so good.
How many more times can you make it?

00:15:49.689 --> 00:15:52.486
-[Kiruko] Only once.
-[Maru] Oh. Shoot…

00:15:56.745 --> 00:15:59.751
I expected nothing
and I'm still disappointed.

00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:02.715
Why? The rain? Came out of nowhere.

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:04.009
That sailor.

00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:06.849
"It's the logo."

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.434
[chuckles]

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.729
Yeah, no kidding.

00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:12.442
[deep voice]
"It's Mitsuba's logo, it's gotta be!"

00:16:12.527 --> 00:16:15.448
[normal voice]
<i>They don't look anything alike! Moron.</i>

00:16:17.954 --> 00:16:20.668
[both laugh]

00:16:29.728 --> 00:16:32.107
What happened? Where'd it go?

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:35.197
It should be right here.
Between these two dates.

00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:38.537
I can't even remember it clearly anymore.

00:16:38.621 --> 00:16:40.373
[sniffles]

00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:41.960
I am so dumb.

00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:44.716
I should have burned that image
onto the inside of my eyelids

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:46.845
the second I saw it.

00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:48.849
[bell chiming]

00:16:48.933 --> 00:16:52.189
-[Taka] Who wants to play my new game?
-[Shiro] Mimihime.

00:16:52.272 --> 00:16:54.443
[Anzu] No one does.
The only person who can play it is you.

00:16:54.527 --> 00:16:56.740
-[Taka] At least learn the rules!
-[Anzu] I'm going to the pool.

00:16:57.951 --> 00:16:58.994
[Mimihime] A picture?

00:16:59.078 --> 00:17:02.585
I don't remember having anything
to message you about recently.

00:17:03.253 --> 00:17:05.591
If I wanted to talk to you,
I'd just come find you.

00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:07.845
-Oh, right.
-What was the picture?

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:10.768
It's, uh, nothing.
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:11.979
But, um…

00:17:13.273 --> 00:17:14.901
as long as we're in here--

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:17.406
And you might think I'm weird
for saying this…

00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:18.951
Hmm?

00:17:19.034 --> 00:17:21.999
But when I see you,
every time I look at you…

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.504
I get these unbearable urges.

00:17:24.587 --> 00:17:26.883
Hmm? Like what?

00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:28.804
Can you be more specific?

00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:31.893
[groans] I mean, I'll try.

00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:34.941
I want to keep you.

00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:38.741
Like, I want to lock you up in my room.

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:41.872
That's fine with me,
if it's not for too long.

00:17:41.955 --> 00:17:43.082
Anything else?

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.253
-[Shiro stammers]
-Huh?

00:17:46.297 --> 00:17:49.929
I guess, I want to… take off your clothes?

00:17:50.013 --> 00:17:51.767
[breathes shakily] And touch you.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:52.894
And maybe, um,

00:17:53.394 --> 00:17:54.396
lick you.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.442
Hmm?

00:17:57.027 --> 00:17:58.614
[Mimihime] You want to eat me?

00:17:58.697 --> 00:18:01.620
[Shiro] No! It's different from eating.

00:18:01.703 --> 00:18:04.542
-You'll disappear if I eat you.
-[breathing shakily]

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.548
[Mimihime] Do you want to cut me up
and stab me with needles?

00:18:07.632 --> 00:18:09.426
[Shiro] I would never do that.

00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:10.513
[Tokio whimpers]

00:18:10.596 --> 00:18:13.017
[students chattering]

00:18:13.101 --> 00:18:15.523
Catch me if you can! [laughs]

00:18:15.606 --> 00:18:18.236
[chattering, laughing continues]

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:30.427
[grunts]

00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:35.061
[Tokio] Hey, please get better soon.

00:18:35.145 --> 00:18:37.357
I really miss playing with you.

00:18:37.859 --> 00:18:38.986
Tokio…

00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:40.447
[breathes heavily]

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:41.783
[gasps]

00:18:42.367 --> 00:18:45.875
It's okay. This isn't something
you can catch from me.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.212
No, I know that, I'm sorry.

00:18:49.423 --> 00:18:50.551
I didn't…

00:18:51.385 --> 00:18:52.805
[gasps]

00:18:52.889 --> 00:18:53.974
Tokio.

00:18:58.232 --> 00:18:59.318
[Tokio gasps]

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.952
-[whimpers]
-Tokio!

00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:05.623
[panting, sobbing]

00:19:13.262 --> 00:19:15.266
-[footsteps approach]
-[panting]

00:19:17.688 --> 00:19:19.441
[sobbing]

00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:21.613
-[Kona] Tokio!
-[gasps]

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:23.575
Hey, are you okay?

00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:25.203
Kona.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.417
[whimpers, sobs]

00:19:31.967 --> 00:19:34.889
-Feel any better?
-Mm-hmm.

00:19:36.518 --> 00:19:39.691
But like… everyone's acting weird.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.201
And I'm… scared, I guess.

00:19:46.412 --> 00:19:47.414
[chuckles]

00:19:48.499 --> 00:19:51.130
-That's not something to be afraid of.
-Huh?

00:19:52.132 --> 00:19:54.721
[Kona] It's natural for people
to start liking one another,

00:19:54.804 --> 00:19:56.056
or fall in love.

00:19:57.058 --> 00:19:59.981
And it can be confusing at first,
but that's okay.

00:20:00.064 --> 00:20:03.697
One day, you might want to touch
and be touched by someone.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.868
That's not scary. Just new.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.456
[sighs]

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.088
-[Tokio] Then--
-Hmm?

00:20:13.341 --> 00:20:15.011
[Tokio] If that's the case…

00:20:17.892 --> 00:20:19.938
I would like it to be you.

00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:21.148
[gasps]

00:20:23.654 --> 00:20:25.658
[breathes shakily]

00:20:28.622 --> 00:20:30.124
I want it to be you, too.

00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:31.418
[gasps]

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.339

00:20:33.882 --> 00:20:35.093
Um…

[giggles]

00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:51.918
[giggling continues]

00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:54.841
[computer crackles] <i>Tokio.</i>

00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:58.347
<i>This announcement is being made</i>
<i>to your room only.</i>

00:20:58.849 --> 00:21:01.604
<i>Tarao's condition has suddenly changed.</i>

[Tokio gasps] Tarao!

00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:15.507
[breathes shakily] Let me be alone…

00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:17.595
with Tokio, please.

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:20.934
[Tokio] I'm right here, okay?
What's wrong?

00:21:21.603 --> 00:21:24.692
We'll be outside.
Call us if anything happens.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.742
Tarao.

00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:31.080
-[groans]
-Sorry.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:35.379
It's okay. I want you to hold me.

00:21:37.342 --> 00:21:38.845
[gasps]

00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:42.143
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.941
I didn't think about your feelings.

00:21:45.024 --> 00:21:48.824
-[Tokio] It's fine. Forget about that.
-[Tarao breathing shakily]

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.330
I'm not going to get better.

00:21:53.082 --> 00:21:55.253
Yes, you will. Don't say that.

00:21:55.838 --> 00:21:58.593
Tokio. Listen to me.

00:22:00.388 --> 00:22:01.390
You have to go.

00:22:03.477 --> 00:22:05.106
Run away.

00:22:07.235 --> 00:22:08.320
<i>This place…</i>

00:22:10.324 --> 00:22:11.703
<i>is dangerous.</i>
