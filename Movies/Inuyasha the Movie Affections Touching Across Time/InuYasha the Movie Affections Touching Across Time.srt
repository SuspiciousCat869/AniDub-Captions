1
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,725
‐What do you want?

2
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,676
‐Lord Sesshomaru.

3
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,308
‐We’ll have your fang.

4
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,146
‐My fang?

5
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,889
‐That isn’t the one.

6
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,807
That Fang carries with it
no aura of destruction.

7
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,516
Find me the other fang.

8
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,578
The only one powerful enough to
break the spell, the Tessaiga.

9
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,548
‐Gramps, breakfast time.

10
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,683
Breakfast is ready, Gramps.

11
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,432
‐Sota, look.

12
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,966
Look at all the flower buds.

13
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,727
Thousands and thousands
of flower buds.

14
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,062
‐Hey, yeah.

15
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,437
Unreal.

16
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,574
‐It’s been 500 years since
this sacred tree last bloomed.

17
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,874
Sota, let me tell you about
the origin of this sacred tree.

18
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,699
‐Kagome, your soup’s
going to get cold.

19
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,584
‐Yeah, yeah.

20
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,873
Mom, where’s the sugar?

21
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,254
‐Over by the window.

22
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,421
You sure you don’t
need any help, dear?

23
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,130
‐Nope, omelettes are one
thing I do know how to make.

24
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,803
‐OK, just don’t
overheat the frying pan.

25
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,632
‐I know.

26
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,968
Ah, I forgot to put in some oil.

27
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,433
‐You see, Sota, the
ancient sacred tree

28
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,722
would blossom without fail
every year at this time.

29
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,728
That is, until the evil half
demon was put under a spell

30
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,812
and fixed to the
trunk 500 years ago.

31
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,769
What do you think?

32
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,278
Learn anything today?

33
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,031
‐So the flowers
bloom again because I

34
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,622
broke the spell on Inayasha?

35
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,701
Hurray for me.

36
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,335
Done.

37
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:45,952
‐Looks delicious.

38
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,867
Beautifully done, dear.

39
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,794
‐Not to bad, huh?

40
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,003
‐You’re terrific, sis.

41
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,376
‐None for you.

42
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,461
‐Don’t be so stingy.

43
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,247
‐Humph.

44
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:56,958
You’re getting a real attitude.

45
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,085
Bye!

46
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,151
‐My name’s Kagome Higurashi.

47
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,318
Until just recently, I was
your average ninth grader.

48
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,663
That is until I
discovered I could travel

49
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,668
500 years back in time through
the ancient [inaudible] Shrine.

50
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,507
‐What is that?

51
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,927
‐It’s a poisonous insect from
the mainland called a scorpion,

52
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,885
I think.

53
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,143
‐What’s it doing here?

54
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,233
‐Who cares out that?

55
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,944
If it has a jewel shard,
then I’m going after it.

56
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,065
‐Be careful, Inuyasha.

57
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,291
I tried to warn him.

58
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,047
‐Reckless as usual,
when will he learn?

59
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:08,966
‐He won’t.

60
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,755
Let’s go.

61
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,718
‐I’m coming too.

62
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,728
I’m just a kid.

63
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,639
Why do I have to go?

64
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:19,941
What the heck.

65
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,155
I’m going!

66
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,697
‐The feudal era is full
of all kinds of demons,

67
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,255
and it was during this
period that Inuyasha

68
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,329
was bound to the sacred tree.

69
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,205
Oh, Inuyasha’s father was
a demon and his mother

70
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,041
was human, making
him a half demon.

71
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,496
He’s very rough
around the edges,

72
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,129
and he’s got a huge ego
and a wicked temper.

73
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,966
And did I mention
how jealous he gets?

74
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,430
Totally hopeless.

75
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,680
Well, I guess he has a
few redeeming qualities.

76
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,184
Before we met, Inuyasha was
looking for the Shikon Jewel,

77
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,136
the Sacred Jewel
of the Four Souls.

78
00:07:55,266 --> 00:08:00,226
Then, 50 years ago, Priestess
Kikyo put a spell on him

79
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,653
and fixed him to this tree.

80
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,733
They’d been very close until
something tore them apart,

81
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,398
but that’s a whole other story.

82
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,027
The Sacred Jewel
of the Four Souls

83
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,155
could increase the
power of demons,

84
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
and it’s all my
fault that it was

85
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,662
shattered into
hundreds of shards.

86
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,077
Anyway, that’s
why Inuyasha and I

87
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,497
are collecting the jewel shards.

88
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:40,311
We have some dependable
friends who help us.

89
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,065
A young fox demon
named Shippo, who

90
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,688
uses his fox magic
whenever there’s trouble.

91
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:53,527
And an amazingly talented
demon slayer named Sango.

92
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,118
And there’s the
flirtatious Miroku,

93
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,212
who has a cursed wind
tunnel in his right hand.

94
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,580
‐Sango, you’re
not hurt, are you?

95
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:08,709
‐Thanks so much Miroku,
you saved me from‐‐ [slap]

96
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,168
Keep your hands to
yourself, pervert.

97
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,388
‐You misunderstand.

98
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,430
I was just making sure
that your flawless body

99
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,474
wasn’t harmed in any way.

100
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,965
‐Not necessary, thank you.

101
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,387
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Then there’s
Sango’s faithful companion,

102
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:25,227
the two‐tailed
demon cat, Kirara.

103
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,066
Oh, yes, there’s one
other friend I forgot,

104
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,320
Myoga, the flea demon.

105
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,532
He’s knowledgeable,
but he is a flea,

106
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,953
and fleas aren’t
exactly the brave type.

107
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:34,454
‐Kagome!

108
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,414
Kagome!

109
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:35,912
Yes!

110
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,242
Yes!

111
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:43,328
Kagome, I’ve got something
to tell you and warn‐‐

112
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,206
Kagome, where have you been?

113
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,673
Master Inuyasha is
already in battle.

114
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,884
Oh.

115
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,973
‐In other words, you sensed
danger and ran away as fast

116
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,261
as you could.

117
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,264
‐Nonsense, I just
came to fetch you,

118
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,556
seeing as you so long to return.

119
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,429
‐You’re always the
first to disappear

120
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,935
when there’s any
sign of trouble.

121
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:06,976
‐Bastard!

122
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,370
‐Hey, are you alright?

123
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,124
‐Just having an off day.

124
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,618
‐Oh, I knew it.

125
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,789
You really are hopeless
when Kagome isn’t around.

126
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,668
‐What?

127
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,385
‐Inuyasha!

128
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,632
I’m back, you guys.

129
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,627
‐Kagome!

130
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,128
‐Kagome.

131
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,759
‐Kagome.

132
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,216
‐Just what the hell
have you been doing?

133
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,266
‐Making lunches.

134
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,309
Took longer than I thought.

135
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,483
‐This isn’t a picnic.

136
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,271
Typical woman, no
sense of priorities.

137
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,774
‐I apologized already.

138
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,187
‐Yeah, I heard it myself.

139
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:52,898
‐Ahh!

140
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,832
‐Are you all right?

141
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,662
‐I’m fine, thanks.

142
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,705
‐Where’s the sacred
jewel shard on the demon?

143
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,131
‐Right there.

144
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,132
On it’s tail.

145
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,134
At the top.

146
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,296
‐All right.

147
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,601
Say hello to my Tessaiga.

148
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,573
‐Way to go!

149
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,025
‐Kagome!

150
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,289
‐Let me handle it from here.

151
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,409
Wind tunnel!

152
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:02,855
‐We did it.

153
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:09,846
‐Shoo.

154
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,768
Oh, dear.

155
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,280
‐Now what’s your problem?

156
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,324
Hurry up and get
the jewel shard.

157
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,737
I’ll do it.

158
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,424
‐Look, here’s the jewel shard.

159
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,172
‐Astounding, once again, Kagome.

160
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,594
The demonic aura
has been purified.

161
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,269
‐Excellent, they found it.

162
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:49,984
Ruri?

163
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:50,773
‐Yes.

164
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,345
‐Hari?

165
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,307
‐Yes.

166
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,438
The time has come.

167
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,565
‐We are prepared, Master.

168
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,969
‐There, I made an extra
special lunch for us today.

169
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,392
‐Hm, this is wonderful.

170
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,310
‐A wonderful day, wonderful
friends and Kagome’s

171
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,810
home‐cooking.

172
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,443
‐Hm, I’ve never seen half
have this stuff before.

173
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,769
What’s it supposed to be?

174
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,614
Is it edible?

175
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,729
‐Would you give it a rest?

176
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,935
You haven’t even tried it yet.

177
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:38,976
‐Uh, Kagome?

178
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,358
How come this octopus
has only four legs?

179
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,987
‐And it’s faceless, no less.

180
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:44,825
‐It’s a wiener.

181
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,657
SANGO: This rice
ball is delicious.

182
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,415
‐That’s because Kagome put
such care into her cooking.

183
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,667
We must force ourselves
to eat every last morsel.

184
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,803
‐Hey.

185
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,379
‐It’s been a long time since
we had anything decent.

186
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,545
‐How’s that omelette?

187
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,053
If my specialty, light
and fluffy, right?

188
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,847
‐Pipe down and let me eat.

189
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,525
‐Now, now.

190
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,476
Don’t be so cruel, he’s just
a little follow, remember?

191
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,124
‐That worked out
nicely for you, Shippo.

192
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,122
‐This faceless octopus is great.

193
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,965
‐Hey, how do like that?

194
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,054
I’m only asking if
you like the taste.

195
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:40,801
‐Wait.

196
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,300
I knew something was missing.

197
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,052
‐Something missing?

198
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,224
What do you mean?

199
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,142
‐You know what I mean.

200
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,550
Oh great, here it is.

201
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,392
Kagome, boil up some
water for me, would ya?

202
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,398
‐Inuyasha, sit, boy.

203
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,822
Sit sit sit sit sit.

204
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,579
Thanks for nothing!

205
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,912
‐I’ve heard her say sit
before, but never like that.

206
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,419
‐Call it punishment for not
considering Kagome’s feelings.

207
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:18,923
[squeaking]

208
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,253
‐Huh?

209
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,666
What’s the matter, Kirara?

210
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,764
She’s got a fever.

211
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,260
‐It must be the toxin
from the scorpion.

212
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,052
‐Let me see.

213
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:27,845
I’ll suck out the poison.

214
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,521
‐Kirara.

215
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,100
Come back.

216
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:37,766
‐Kirara’s acting strange.

217
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,685
I don’t like the looks of this.

218
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,772
I better follow them.

219
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,978
This thing’s heavy.

220
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,489
How does she manage to
make it look so easy?

221
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,241
‐They’re sure
impatient, as usual.

222
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,282
‐I couldn’t agree more.

223
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,453
‐I don’t believe
the nerve that guy.

224
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,620
I’ll never make him lunch again.

225
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,668
He’ll regret this.

226
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,921
Ahh!

227
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:03,754
This would have been a
good day to stay in bed.

228
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,514
‐Kirara!

229
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,005
Kirara.

230
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,613
Excuse me.

231
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,906
‐She belongs to you?

232
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,830
She’s reacting to insect poison.

233
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,620
We just gave her an antidote.

234
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,079
‐You’re very kind.

235
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,206
Thanks so much.

236
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:41,964
‐Not at all.

237
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,423
We’re glad we’re able to help.

238
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,213
‐I too am very grateful, and
I have a suggestion for you

239
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,510
both to contemplate.

240
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,221
As a token of my gratitude
for helping our furry friend,

241
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,354
would you ladies kindly
consider bearing my children?

242
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,681
Forgive me.

243
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,477
It’s hard to control myself
around such beauties.

244
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,019
‐Who asked you?

245
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,524
‐So ladies, did you
come from the continent?

246
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,529
‐We did.

247
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,739
‐Yes, how very observant.

248
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,570
‐And yet, you seemed to
have mastered our language.

249
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,356
You speak it fluently.

250
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,990
‐Indeed, we do.

251
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,205
After all, we can to
this land many years ago.

252
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,286
‐Well over 200 years ago,
if the truth be told.

253
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,340
‐Kirara!

254
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,809
What are you doing?

255
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,350
What do you want with us?

256
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,736
‐Scorpions.

257
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,650
Wait, that giant scorpion
from this morning.

258
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,117
‐I was the one who summoned it.

259
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,121
‐Everything is
exactly as we hoped.

260
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,124
‐Meaning the whole
thing was a trap.

261
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,169
‐Sango!

262
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,466
I’ll save you.

263
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,769
‐I was waiting for
you to use that power.

264
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,437
‐You what?

265
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,778
‐You cannot escape my
powers of duplication.

266
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,078
‐Duplication?

267
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:55,929
‐Miroku.

268
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,434
‐That evil woman.

269
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,687
What did she do to me?

270
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,481
‐At last, I have it
in my possession.

271
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,314
Wind tunnel.

272
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,498
Well, monk, any
thoughts before you die?

273
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,061
Someone has interfered.

274
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,352
‐Our business here is done.

275
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,596
Let’s go.

276
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,436
Kirara!

277
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:47,940
‐Kirara?

278
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,240
Kirara!

279
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,991
What’s the matter?

280
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:04,084
Don’t you recognize me anymore?

281
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,623
Kirara!

282
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,875
‐We’re taking the
two‐tail with us.

283
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,747
‐Damn.

284
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,209
‐Kirara seems to be
under their spell.

285
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,337
I’ll bet it’s the
scorpion poison.

286
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,345
We must do something
to bring her back.

287
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,968
‐Are ye two all right?

288
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,186
‐So you fired that
arrow, Lady Kaede?

289
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,099
‐I felt a restlessness
among the trees,

290
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,149
so I came to investigate.

291
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,441
‐Well, you came in
the nick of time.

292
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,357
Thank you for your help.

293
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,783
‐Are ye going to go
after those women?

294
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,782
‐Yes.

295
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,614
‐They headed west.

296
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,080
‐Toward the Forest of No Return.

297
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,240
‐Ye must use the utmost care.

298
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,249
Restlessness in
the trees signifies

299
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,908
that a disaster
is about to occur,

300
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,459
or that something
evil is already afoot.

301
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,805
In any case, huh?

302
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,260
Oh, I was talking
here, you know?

303
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,912
KIKYO (VOICEOVER): The Tree of
Ages senses impending danger.

304
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,003
Trouble looms not far ahead.

305
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,094
Is someone after Inuyasha?

306
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,353
‐Oh brother, what am
I going to tell mom?

307
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:54,064
I had a tiny little accident.
ould you buy me a new bike?

308
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,976
She’ll never go for it.

309
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,659
That’s Kikyo.

310
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,341
‐Inuyasha.

311
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,849
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
This is stupid.

312
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,186
What am I hiding for?

313
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,689
I haven’t done anything.

314
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:51,827
‐Wait!

315
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,712
Inuyasha, where you going?

316
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,041
‐To find that damn Kagome.

317
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,916
I’m going to give her
a piece in my mind.

318
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,713
I’ll tell you that much.

319
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,875
‐Yeah, right.

320
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,133
She’s got you wrapped
around her finger.

321
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,222
‐Those are Kikyo’s
soul collectors.

322
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,565
‐Something wrong,
Master Inuyasha?

323
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,061
Yikes!

324
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,063
‐What’d you do that for?

325
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,765
My father taught me
to respect elders, not

326
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,607
treat them like, well, fleas.

327
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,772
‐You two stay here.

328
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,820
Don’t even think
about following me.

329
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,742
‐No wait!

330
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,031
Where are you going?

331
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,242
What’s his problem?

332
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,664
‐It’s the curse of the octopus.

333
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,838
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
The Sacred Tree.

334
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,461
This is where I
first met Inuyasha.

335
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,600
And it’s where Kikyo
and Inuyasha parted.

336
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,150
They were so close.

337
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,231
They understood each other.

338
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,106
And Kikyo still loves Inuyasha.

339
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,200
‐Guess I’d better get back.

340
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,210
What’s this?

341
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,514
Ow.

342
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,801
What was that?

343
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,637
What did I do that for?

344
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,182
Well, that’s what I
get for being nosy.

345
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,314
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
The only reason

346
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,436
I’m here in the feudal
era is to gather

347
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,023
the shards of the sacred
jewel and restore it

348
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:48,399
to its original form.

349
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,357
Doesn’t really
have to me though.

350
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,279
Kikyo could find the shards.

351
00:24:53,367 --> 00:25:05,497
The real reason I come
here is‐‐ Inuyasha.

352
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,969
‐You cut yourself, clumsy.

353
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,933
To bad Myoga isn’t around.

354
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,814
This would make his day.

355
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,730
[gasps]

356
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,061
‐What’s your problem?

357
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,015
‐You wrecked that handkerchief,
and it was my favorite one.

358
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:23,695
‐So.

359
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:24,404
Who cares?

360
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,193
It’s just a piece of cloth.

361
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,115
Anyone else here
or are you alone?

362
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,863
‐What do you mean?

363
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,645
‐Just asking.

364
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,278
Forget about it.

365
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,544
‐You came looking for
Kikyo, didn’t you?

366
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,581
A‐ha, so you did
follow Kikyo’s scents.

367
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,206
‐Will you shut up.

368
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,132
Just stop yakking
and let me do this.

369
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,839
There.

370
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,839
You’re good to go.

371
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,340
Come on.

372
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,335
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): I knew it.

373
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,386
No matter how far
apart they are,

374
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,810
they still think about
each other all the time.

375
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,231
There’s no place for me here.

376
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,270
I know that, but I
can’t stop myself.

377
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,198
‐All those moths.

378
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,661
‐There’s millions of them.

379
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,872
Where’d the come from?

380
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,831
This is creepy.

381
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,082
‐Kagome, hold your breath
or their poison powder

382
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,366
will make you blackout.

383
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,088
‐How long do I have
to stay like this for?

384
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,209
‐What do you think?

385
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,205
Until I get rid of
all these nasty bugs.

386
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,966
Iron river soul stealer.

387
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,256
There’s so many of them.

388
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,927
OK, I’ll get them all at once.

389
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,859
[evil laugh]

390
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,860
‐Who’s that?

391
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,205
‐Inuyahsa, is it not?

392
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,779
‐Depends who’s asking and
what you want with me.

393
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,275
‐My name is Menomaru.

394
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:02,538
Inuyasha, let my sword
be my introduction.

395
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,800
Good, the fang of destruction.

396
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:16,796
‐What’s that?

397
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,845
I don’t know what
you’re going on about.

398
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,852
You all right, Kogame?

399
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,224
‐I can’t hold it anymore.

400
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,938
‐You idiot!

401
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,770
‐Such a pity, using the weapon
to protect a mere human.

402
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,818
I would use the sword
for a more noble cause,

403
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,152
now hand it over to me!

404
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,399
‐I don’t think so.

405
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,503
How the hell he’d
block my Tessaiga?

406
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,210
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): I
have to finish him off quick

407
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,246
or Kagome won’t make it.

408
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,418
Iron Rebar.

409
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:03,685
It’s getting blurry.

410
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,309
‐Hm.

411
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,740
‐Yah!

412
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,525
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Can’t move.

413
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,539
‐How pathetic.

414
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,544
Are you losing
consciousness so soon?

415
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:46,183
Inuyasha, I shall run you
through with your fang

416
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:46,766
of destruction.

417
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:53,653
A barrier.

418
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,514
This is most disappointing.

419
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,434
It seems you are the only
one who can wield the sword.

420
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,941
Maybe I can use the girl though.

421
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,237
‐What do you think
you’re doing, Inuyasha?

422
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,158
We just finished
bandaging up your wounds.

423
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,169
What if you open them up again?

424
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,291
‐These aren’t anything serious.

425
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,675
Where did he get to?

426
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,134
‐Who are you talking about?

427
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,972
‐He said his name was Menomaru,
that disgusting demon.

428
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,631
‐Menomaru?

429
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,509
Are you sure about that name?

430
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,485
‐Where is Sango
and Miroku anyway?

431
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,561
They still haven’t come back.

432
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,266
And no sign of
Kagome yet either.

433
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,316
‐That bastard.

434
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,531
He must have taken
Kagome with him.

435
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,112
‐What’s that?

436
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,655
You mean Kagome didn’t go back
to her world beyond the well?

437
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,831
‐There’s no way she’d go
home without running it

438
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,118
past me first.

439
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,871
‐I don’t believe my ears.

440
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,835
You’re supposed to
be defending her.

441
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,753
Can’t you even do that properly?

442
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,383
Ow, and after all I did for you.

443
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,381
‐Why’d you bother?

444
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,012
These wounds aren’t
really that bad.

445
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,379
‐Master Inuyasha, are you
quite certain this demon called

446
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,888
himself Menomaru?

447
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,801
‐Yeah, there’s no
mistake about it.

448
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:48,218
Why?

449
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,387
You know him?

450
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,685
‐He’s the only son of
Hyoga, an infamous demon

451
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,639
from the continent.

452
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,438
‐I don’t like the
sounds of this.

453
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,690
‐Indeed.

454
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:02,113
200 years ago, a huge Mongol
army from the continent

455
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,494
began an attack.

456
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,360
Demons, led by Hyoga,
came here to snatch

457
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,620
the souls of those
killed in battle.

458
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,580
At that time, your father
ruled the regions of the West.

459
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,294
Hyoga and your father
battled ferociously,

460
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:20,174
cling forth thunder and winds
and causing a terrible violence

461
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,633
storm.

462
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,593
Using one of his fangs, your
father sealed Hyoga away,

463
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,967
and thus, I understand,
chased the foreign demons back

464
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,224
to the continent.

465
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,137
‐Let me guess.

466
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,473
You weren’t even there.

467
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,637
‐Uh, well, I‐‐

468
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,095
‐In other words, you were
running from danger even

469
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,019
way back then.

470
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,025
‐It was an act of
self preservation.

471
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,647
I really do it
because your father

472
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,903
and you were so reckless.

473
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,397
‐I guess you wouldn’t know
where this Hyoga was sealed away

474
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,569
then.

475
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,196
‐Fortunately, I can
help you with that.

476
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,413
‐Where?

477
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,375
‐The tree of ages in
the forest of no return.

478
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:57,503
‐The tree of ages?

479
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,002
‐Inuyasha.

480
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:00,965
You there?

481
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:01,706
Wait.

482
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,925
Please, don’t leave me behind.

483
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,485
‐Lord Menomaru,
how did you fare?

484
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,726
‐See for yourselves.

485
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,316
What will you do with the girl?

486
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,404
‐Use her to lure Inuyasha here.

487
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,317
‐Why bring him to our hideout?

488
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,618
‐It seems the fang
of destruction

489
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,529
has a barrier around it.

490
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,698
‐You mean?

491
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,116
‐Only he can wield it.

492
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,495
But I cannot inherit my father’s
legacy until the spell on this

493
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,245
fang is broken.

494
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,955
And the only way to accomplish
that is with the Tessaiga.

495
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,169
‐I don’t see how
a mere mortal will

496
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,090
be enough to lure him here.

497
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,047
‐He’ll come.

498
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,596
Dog demons seemed to
be fond of humans.

499
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,641
Inuyasha’s father fell in
love with a mortal woman,

500
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,647
and Inuyasha with his
partially human blood

501
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,821
has also fallen in
love with a mortal.

502
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,231
‐Indeed.

503
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,277
Such eccentrics.

504
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,151
‐Hari?

505
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,147
‐Yes?

506
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,658
‐Watch over the girl.

507
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,076
I have an idea about how to rid
ourselves of that half‐demon.

508
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,624
‐I understand, Master.

509
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,680
‐What’s the matter, Hari?

510
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,347
‐This girl possesses unusually
strong spiritual powers.

511
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,359
Is she a priestess?

512
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,359
‐Impossible.

513
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,282
Look at the odd
way she’s dressed.

514
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,703
‐Here, use this.

515
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,203
‐A sacred jewel shard?

516
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,993
‐Are you certain, Master?

517
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,868
‐One with great powers such
as mine has no need for it.

518
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,056
‐What’s going on?

519
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,778
‐What’s this?

520
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,400
She easily broke the roots.

521
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:32,738
‐It seems that the
girl does indeed

522
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,702
possess spiritual powers.

523
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,702
‐Who are you?

524
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,833
What do you want with me?

525
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,289
Where is Inuyasha?

526
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,911
‐Don’t worry, mortal, your
friend will be here short;y.

527
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:43,868
‐What are you going
to do with me?

528
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,878
Kirara?

529
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,595
What did you do to Kirara?

530
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:54,677
Something’s different about her.

531
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,139
‐The two‐tail belongs to us now.

532
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,311
‐Turn Kirara back to normal.

533
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,727
‐You’re a feisty one.

534
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,194
‐I’m serious.

535
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:13,114
‐My friends, keep this
girl company, won’t you?

536
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,290
[laughing]

537
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,803
‐Sango’s weapon.

538
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,308
Miroku, Sango, you found me.

539
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,640
‐Kagome?

540
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:47,235
‐Oh no, they’ve got Kagome
and Kirara imprisoned in here.

541
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,812
‐I don’t know what
you’re thinking, you two,

542
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,318
but we’re taking
our friends back!

543
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,656
Kirara!

544
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,333
‐It seems she doesn’t
want to return to you.

545
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,007
‐Sango!

546
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:15,841
‐I’ll deal with you, monk.

547
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:36,986
‐I told you I was serious.

548
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,320
shot you won’t be so lucky.

549
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,737
‐Little girl, you’re bait,
so start acting like bait.

550
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,369
‐Why don’t you make me?

551
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,214
He’s fast.

552
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,044
‐Kagome!

553
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,207
Get out of the way!

554
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,625
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Inuyasha.

555
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,015
‐You’re going down.

556
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,643
‐I thought you’d
never come, Inuyasha.

557
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,226
‐Really?

558
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,229
Is that so?

559
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,230
Well, I’m here to
take Kagome back.

560
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,483
‐Inuyash.

561
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,775
‐You’re here.

562
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,479
‐Kirara.

563
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:22,568
‐Kirara, no!

564
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,746
‐She’s still not herself.

565
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,371
‐Quick, take cover, Kagome.

566
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,670
‐Ha.

567
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,882
Not terribly impressive.

568
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,178
‐Guess that’s it for him.

569
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:02,782
What the‐‐ Damn it.

570
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,454
What’s going on?

571
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,946
‐I am immortal.

572
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,286
‐Master Inuyasha, Menomaru
absorbs demonic power

573
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,753
from Hyoga, who lies
dormant behind him.

574
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,294
‐What?

575
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:16,917
Hyoga?

576
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:17,883
That thing?

577
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,212
‐The very same.

578
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,088
Hyoga’s body perished long ago,
but his near limitless power

579
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,467
remains sealed inside.

580
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,717
‐Huh?

581
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,927
Myoga, how unusual for you not
to flee in the face of danger.

582
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,018
‐I would if I could.

583
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:39,396
Master Inuyasha, spare an
old man and untie me, please?

584
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,944
‐I’ll let you go right after
you tell me how to defeat him.

585
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:42,818
‐Be reasonable.

586
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,856
‐It’s useless.

587
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,369
You cannot defeat me.

588
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,371
I am invincible.

589
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,993
‐I don’t care what kind of
demonic power you’ve got,

590
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,538
it ain’t gonna stop me from
splashing you to pieces.

591
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,755
‐How bold of you.

592
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:56,504
Let’s see you try it.

593
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,254
‐Something’s not right.

594
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,836
‐Please, be careful, Inuyasha.

595
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,381
‐You asked for it.

596
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,507
‐No, you must stop,
Master Inuyasha.

597
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,480
‐Wind star!

598
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,194
‐Excellent!

599
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,115
This is the moment
I’ve waited for.

600
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,035
‐I did it.

601
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:53,563
‐‐[laughing] Finally, the
seal has been broken.

602
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,563
‐Oh no.

603
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:01,856
‐It’s caving in.

604
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,321
‐Let’s go.

605
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:03,611
Let’s go.

606
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,405
Let’s go.

607
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:35,017
‐Right.

608
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:35,979
‐Inuyasha!

609
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,020
Kagome!

610
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,601
‐Are you all right, Kagome?

611
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,597
‐Yeah.

612
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,608
What happened to Sango
and Miroku though?

613
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,402
‐Ahhh!

614
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,527
‐We’re here.

615
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,114
‐Everyone accounted for?

616
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,039
‐So Inuyasha, thank you.

617
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,294
‐What?

618
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,925
‐My father, Hyoga, lost
to your father in battle

619
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,464
and was sealed away
at this very spot.

620
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,008
The fang your brother
Sesshomaru wields

621
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,134
did not have the power
to break the spell.

622
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,258
The fang that does
possess the power

623
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:59,425
is the one passed on
to you, the Tessaiga.

624
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,847
‐Tessaiga?

625
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,516
You used me to break the seal?

626
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,105
‐Now that my family’s
spell has been broken,

627
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,191
I can inherit generations
of my family’s power!

628
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,513
‐What’s this?

629
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,221
‐This is the beginning of the
Hyoga clan succession ceremony.

630
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,472
‐What’s gonna happen?

631
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,393
‐Menomaru will possess
the power of his father

632
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,313
and become even more
ferocious demon.

633
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,246
[evil laughing]

634
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,854
‐The new Lord Hyoga
has been born.

635
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,809
‐Our new lord and master.

636
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,222
‐It’s all over for us.

637
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,098
Menomaru will absorb
his father’s power

638
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,096
and become the new Hyoga.

639
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,479
No one could defeat him now.

640
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,690
‐My father beat him, didn’t he?

641
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,197
‐Each generation absorbs the
power of the previous ones,

642
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,279
and thus increases in strength.

643
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:42,036
Menomaru, the new Hyoga,
is already much stronger

644
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,540
than the demon your
father defeated.

645
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,211
And in order to transform into
an even more powerful demon

646
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,134
then he already is, then he’s‐‐

647
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,264
‐Who cares?

648
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:55,971
‐Inuyasha!

649
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,135
‐Won’t matter if I kill him.

650
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,394
‐Have mercy on this old flea.

651
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,314
Please, untie me.

652
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,570
‐Die!

653
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,578
‐Inuyasha!

654
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,660
MENOMARU: I would
never allow myself

655
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,004
to be wounded by a
half‐breed like you.

656
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,521
‐Look at all the pretty colors.

657
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,273
‐Don’t die on me
yet, half demon.

658
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,355
You’re spoiling all my fun.

659
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:57,652
I’ve made special
arrangements for your death.

660
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,697
‐Your threats ain’t
foolin’ no one.

661
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,320
Your father was afraid of
mine, and you’re afraid of me.

662
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,528
Come out and fight me.

663
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,499
‐You can talk like a man,
but can you fight like one?

664
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,715
Think back for me, Myoga.

665
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,299
Can’t you remember anything,
like his weakness or some way

666
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,433
to kill him?

667
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,433
Hurry and remember something,
if you want to live.

668
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:37,108
MENOMARU: You still don’t
understand how strong I am.

669
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,365
This is in your honor.

670
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,405
Now, be gone from the
face of the earth.

671
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:07,974
Come forth, all kneel before me.

672
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:08,969
Bring your offerings.

673
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,810
I hunger for the souls
of all living creatures!

674
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:07,161
‐What is it?

675
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,161
‐Look at that.

676
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,624
Grandma, come quick.

677
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,424
‐A swarm of moths.

678
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,416
‐What’s happening?

679
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,587
I’m scared.

680
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,645
‐Oh, the Tree of Ages.

681
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,607
I don’t understand.

682
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,568
What is happening?

683
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:33,117
‐Something’s coming this way.

684
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,084
‐Look at that cloud?

685
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:37,083
Are those bugs?

686
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:37,584
‐No.

687
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:57,021
[mumbling]

688
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:05,401
[mumbling]

689
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,944
‐Are you all right, Priestess?

690
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:11,817
‐I sense something sinister
is behind this turmoil.

691
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:12,569
‐Kaede.

692
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,411
‐Kagome.

693
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,867
Kagome.

694
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:19,997
Kagome.

695
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,302
‐Rin, take cover.

696
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:33,797
‐Right.

697
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,144
‐Lord Sesshomaru,
there’s no need for you

698
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,437
to waste your energy.

699
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,150
Allow me to take care of them.

700
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,783
Behold the power of
the staff of two heads!

701
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:05,003
How brazen to think they
could conquer Lord Sesshomaru.

702
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,512
I can’t see.

703
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,222
Get it off me!

704
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,091
It’s stuck to my nose.

705
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,006
I can’t see a thing.

706
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,967
‐Excellent aim, Lord Sesshomaru.

707
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,678
‐So it seems Hyoga
has been resurrected.

708
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,689
‐The moths are
all gone, my lord.

709
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,824
No, don’t leave me,
Lord Sesshomaru.

710
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,660
‐Alas, the dismal fate of Jaken.

711
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:56,894
‐Are you certain this
will work, Master Miroku?

712
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,682
‐Hyoga is consuming the
souls of every living thing

713
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,484
he can get his hands on.

714
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,269
If you’re not constantly
alert and strong,

715
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,734
you’ll lose your soul
and become his prey.

716
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,444
‐I don’t care what he’s doing.

717
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,776
He’s just too strong.

718
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,610
I’m afraid you must
admit to yourselves

719
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,565
that this time your
hands are indeed tied.

720
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,736
‐I’m going.

721
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,574
I can’t leave Kirara
under their spell.

722
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,578
‐I’m coming as well, Sango.

723
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,582
I can’t stand idly
by while my wind

724
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,043
tunnel is used
for evil purposes.

725
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,833
‐Heed me, you don’t
stand a chance.

726
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,417
‐We’ll manage some
way or another.

727
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,923
‐We’ll find a way.

728
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,756
‐Oh, well, if you insist,
I won’t try to stop you.

729
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,892
I warn you though, you
won’t have an easy time

730
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,930
climbing that huge Tree of Ages.

731
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,059
No!

732
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,865
Please don’t‐‐ don’t
make me go there, master.

733
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,439
‐Come with us or be
sucked into my hand.

734
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,235
‐All right, all right.

735
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,123
‐Crooked monk.

736
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,834
‐Don’t transform in this
tiny space, you fool.

737
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,914
‐Now I’m really
going to suck you up.

738
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,967
‐This is just a little scratch.

739
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,974
‐Master Inuyasha, we’re
in great danger here.

740
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,388
Let us return to the west
and recoup our strength.

741
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:26,687
‐Run away?

742
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,520
‐Yes.

743
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,857
The Hyoga clan has spent
the last 200 years planning

744
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,322
to take revenge on you for
Menomaru’s father being

745
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,864
sealed away.

746
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,067
In order to stand up to
them, we need some time

747
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,116
to plan our counterattack.

748
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,910
Master Inuyasha, you
must wait until you’re

749
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,624
at least as powerful
as your father‐‐

750
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,504
‐No chance.

751
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,330
I can’t stand sit around here.

752
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,367
‐But, Master‐‐

753
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:49,830
‐I don’t need your excuses.

754
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,458
m going back there.

755
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,594
‐Don’t do it, Master Inuyasha.

756
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:54,501
‐Quiet.

757
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,168
I’ve heard enough.

758
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,571
‐What did you do that for?

759
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,531
‐You’re getting on my nerves.

760
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:16,361
Get out of here.

761
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:17,695
Can’t you sense the danger?

762
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,700
Take off.

763
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,239
I’m going in alone.

764
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,535
‐Forget it.

765
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,038
I will not allow this.

766
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,829
I will stop you
even if it kills me.

767
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,634
If you insist on going,
Master Inuyasha, then you

768
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,840
must do it over my dead body.

769
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,512
Such is the fate of a flea.

770
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,682
‐Inuyasha, is your
persistence a human trait?

771
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,926
No matter.

772
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,309
I shall have some
amusement at your expense.

773
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,266
[whistling sound]

774
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,294
‐What happened to you, Kagome?

775
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,413
‐Water, please.

776
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:10,907
‐Aye.

777
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,008
‐My head is killing me.

778
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,970
I feel really sick.

779
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,064
‐Kagome?

780
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:39,359
Kagome?

781
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,863
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
What’s happening?

782
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,494
I have no control over my body.

783
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,453
Run away, Kaede!

784
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:44,991
Hurry!

785
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,141
‐Is that Kikyo?

786
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,895
Kagome!

787
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,726
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
Inuyasha, get away from me.

788
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,273
Please.

789
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,146
‐You look kind of pale, Kagome.

790
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:23,654
Go back to Kaede’s house
and get yourself some rest.

791
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,857
K‐‐ Kagome?

792
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,409
I’m sorry, I couldn’t
get to you sooner.

793
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:34,504
‐Inuyasha, get away.

794
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,384
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Inuyasha!

795
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,345
‐She has to be under
someone’s spell.

796
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:00,187
It has to be Menomaru.

797
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,025
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Inuyasha,
please, get away form me!

798
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,030
‐Snap out of it, Kagome.

799
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,207
‐Die, Inuyasha.

800
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,385
‐Hm, how long can you
keep running, Inuyasha?

801
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,599
‐Damn!

802
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:39,099
What am I gonna do?

803
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,488
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): How
dare he do this to Kagome?

804
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,205
I won’t let him
get away with this.

805
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,999
‐Am I imagining it or is
that orb growing bigger?

806
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,503
‐Each time he devours a
soul, he becomes bigger.

807
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,797
‐That would make
him a growing boy.

808
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:06,923
‐Very true.

809
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:07,917
I just hope he
doesn’t grow too much.

810
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,590
‐Kirara, I’ll get you back.

811
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:40,827
‐Kikyo.

812
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:01,773
This is just like
last time, huh, Kikyo?

813
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:02,853
No, wait.

814
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,400
She’s not Kikyo, it’s Kagome.

815
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:13,816
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Inuyasha,
please, get away from me!

816
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:14,907
MENOMARU: Do it.

817
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:15,992
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Run!

818
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,828
MENOMARU: Finish off Inuyasha.

819
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,754
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Run!

820
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,621
‐Die, Inuyasha.

821
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:23,168
‐[inaudible].

822
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,892
‐Damn, yet more interference.

823
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,766
‐Here you are, my dear friends.

824
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,985
I wish you all the best.

825
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,735
‐I’m impressed that Hachi
brought us this far considering

826
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,531
the strong demonic aura.

827
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,784
‐Miroku.

828
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,035
‐Sango.

829
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,278
‐Why are you stroking my hand?

830
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,908
‐I’m afraid the end might
be drawing near for us.

831
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,208
‐Don’t speak of such nonsense.

832
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,341
‐You challenge me knowing
you don’t stand a chance.

833
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,631
Humans are such
strange creatures.

834
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:12,305
‐Oh?

835
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,472
You’re one to pass judgment.

836
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,861
‐Inuyasha, get away, please.

837
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:33,949
I have no control over my body.

838
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,911
I can’t stop.

839
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,741
Run before it’s too late.

840
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:39,657
Before I‐‐

841
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,243
‐That’s enough.

842
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,659
I don’t want to hear it.

843
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,167
I’m sick of you and everyone
else telling me to run.

844
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,963
I’m not running.

845
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,130
Not without you.

846
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,338
I won’t leave you behind.

847
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,558
‐Wind tunnel!

848
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:20,244
‐Wind tunnel!

849
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,885
‐I’ll take you on.

850
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:44,814
It’ll be my pleasure.

851
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,695
‐So more interference, how dull.

852
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,283
[whistling sound]

853
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,906
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
That sound again.

854
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:09,366
‐Damn, those Moths are back.

855
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,471
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Inuyasha.

856
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,978
No.

857
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,229
No.

858
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,902
No.

859
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:32,362
No!

860
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:41,954
‐Kagome.

861
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,215
‐Inuyasha.

862
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,715
Inuyasha!

863
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,779
Inuyasha.

864
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,570
Inuyasha.

865
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,276
Inuyasha, say something.

866
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,906
Open your eyes.

867
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,205
I’m sorry.

868
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,746
I’m so sorry.

869
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,293
‐Ironic, isn’t it?

870
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,416
‐Kikyo.

871
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:39,711
The same situation,
the same spot.

872
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:45,718
You truly are my reincarnation,
walking the same path I did.

873
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:47,314
Now, take this and
return to your world.

874
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,100
‐I won’t.

875
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,313
‐You must go.

876
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,394
You never belonged
here in these times.

877
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,728
You are an outsider.

878
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:58,404
A person who chanced
upon this world of ours.

879
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,573
‐I can’t leave Inuyasha.

880
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,572
‐You must leave!

881
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:07,995
You’re the one who injured him.

882
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:12,208
‐Heed my words, Hyoga is using
the formidable Tree of Ages

883
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,789
in order to increase
his demon powers.

884
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:17,500
‐Tree of Ages?

885
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,377
‐That’s correct.

886
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,762
This is also a Tree of the Ages.

887
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,880
‐Sacred trees?

888
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,966
‐The Tree of Ages lives
through different eras.

889
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:30,142
Hyoga’s Tree of Ages, it steals
energy from various generations

890
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,643
and matures.

891
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:36,726
By now, other generations of
time have already frozen over.

892
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,073
‐Your era has
likely been plunged

893
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,649
into a never ending winter.

894
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:53,657
‐Oh, dear.

895
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,038
It’s so cold all of a sudden.

896
01:03:59,210 --> 01:03:59,630
Oh.

897
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,523
The flowers, they only
just began to bloom.

898
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,162
‐Roots are forming.

899
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,293
The wood of this
well is ancient.

900
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:38,211
‐This wall was constructed out
of wood from the Tree of Ages.

901
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,461
It’s vital life force lay
dormant all these years,

902
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,673
and is now being awakened
by the Tree of Ages.

903
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,549
If the well is covered
over, you will never

904
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,546
be able to pass through
to your own time.

905
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,388
You must return
to your own world

906
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,815
while you still have a chance.

907
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,148
‐But, Inuyasha.

908
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,860
‐Go home.

909
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,570
Back to your own era
where you belong.

910
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:08,781
You and Inuyasha live
at different times.

911
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,129
You must never be
with Inuyasha again.

912
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,469
Nor I, for I am one of
the dead, and as such

913
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,595
I too don’t belong here.

914
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,690
‐That bothersome girl, she
has broken through my spell.

915
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,319
GRANDFATHER: Sota, run and
get me some more matches.

916
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,745
SOTA: Sure, I’ll
be back, Gramps.

917
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,537
‐Heed my prayers, oh
spirit of the skies.

918
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:44,673
Stop the snow from falling.

919
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:48,172
‐Will the weather really go
back to normal if we pray?

920
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,464
‐It will.

921
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,087
This is the sacred tree which
has protected our shrine.

922
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,466
Our prayers are
sure to be answered.

923
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,933
Now, Sota, pray.

924
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:07,021
BOTH: Oh, spirit of the skies,
stop the snow from falling.

925
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,016
‐Kagome.

926
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:08,979
‐You’ve returned.

927
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,359
‐Sis!

928
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,699
‐Kagome, the sacred tree.

929
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:21,252
‐Inuyasha.

930
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,091
Inuyasha.

931
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,012
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): My hands
can’t touch him any more.

932
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,104
My voice can’t
reach him anymore.

933
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:45,478
I won’t see Inuyasha ever again.

934
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,232
‐Kagome.

935
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:47,815
Kagome.

936
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:48,727
‐What’s wrong, Kagome?

937
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:04,909
‐Very nice.

938
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,039
You’re a handsome
one, young monk.

939
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,836
Makes me want to dig out
your heart and eat it.

940
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,630
‐Kirara!

941
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,924
Kirara, snap out of it!

942
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:12,823
‐It’s useless, she cannot
hear your voice anymore.

943
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,939
A human and a demon,
you were never

944
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,987
destined to
understand each other.

945
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:47,886
‐You’re Inuyasha’s
older brother.

946
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:53,607
‐The girl named Kagome,
you truly must loathe her.

947
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:57,280
Or are you merely
testing her powers?

948
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,570
‐I loathe all things.

949
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:04,576
I despise every living
creature who’s bound to time.

950
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,656
‐Do as you see fit.

951
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:12,206
Though I warn you, I shall be
the one to destroy Inuyasha.

952
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,054
‐Lord Sesshomaru,
are you certainly it

953
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,888
was a wise decision to
let that woman go free?

954
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,425
‐Are you blind, Jaken?

955
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,809
That woman is already dead.

956
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,475
‐Yeah, but how can that be?

957
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:36,445
She spoke as if she were living.

958
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,726
How can she be dead if
she’s alive, my lord?

959
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,900
‐Silence, Rin!

960
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,486
‐I’m not asking
you, Master Jaken.

961
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:43,282
‐What?

962
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:46,156
‐You brazen child.

963
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,162
‐Wait for me, Lord Sesshomaru.

964
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:56,748
‐It’s a lie.

965
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,418
Kagome saved me.

966
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,256
She’d never do such a thing.

967
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:05,221
‐Kagome’s eyes were dazed over
with evil, she was not herself.

968
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:08,763
‐Perhaps she’s under the
same spell as Kirara?

969
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,268
‐I had a bad premonition.

970
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,429
We must hurry to
the sacred tree.

971
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,347
‐You could at least
carry yourself there.

972
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,687
‐Have ye no morals?

973
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:16,862
Be kind to the elderly
and the injured.

974
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:17,769
‐She’s right.

975
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,607
‐Onward cow.

976
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,322
‐I’m a horse.

977
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,785
‐What is this?

978
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:24,743
Oh.

979
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:25,782
‐I’m so done.

980
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,947
‐What on earth has happened?

981
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:35,749
‐The well is covered up.

982
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:36,713
‐Oh no.

983
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,713
The Tree of Ages has gone wild.

984
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:39,805
‐What do you mean?

985
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,379
‐That huge tree is
calling out to it.

986
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:44,594
This world will be swallowed
up if it’s left unchecked.

987
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,295
‐Master Inuyasha.

988
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,063
Master Inuyasha.

989
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:17,956
‐Had enough of this, monk?

990
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,882
What do you say we
settle this battle.

991
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,763
We’ll test your wind
tunnel against my own.

992
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,510
Who will be sucked
into the void first?

993
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,351
Wind tunnel!

994
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:29,204
‐Oh spirits of the skies,
stop the snow from falling.

995
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:36,832
Stop the snow from falling.

996
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:39,463
‐Kagome, I didn’t
know you were back.

997
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:40,372
Welcome home.

998
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,038
SOTA: Mom, what
took you so long?

999
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:45,245
‐I’m sorry, dear.

1000
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,668
Oh my, you look frozen.

1001
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,336
‐Oh, Mom.

1002
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,054
‐Thanks for your
prayers, Father.

1003
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,013
How’s the sacred tree?

1004
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,103
‐Don’t you worry.

1005
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,429
I have the power
to correct this.

1006
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,426
‐I know.

1007
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,977
Here, Sota, put this
over his shoulders.

1008
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,652
‐You hang in there, Gramps, K?

1009
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:08,783
‐Oh spirits of the skies,
stop the snow from falling.

1010
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,281
‐Thanks, Mom.

1011
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,114
‐Oh, it’s probably a little
too late in this cold weather.

1012
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,618
I’ll bring a coat
out for you, dear.

1013
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:18,619
Kagome?

1014
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,630
‐Hey, Mom, is this
tree that important?

1015
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:25,792
‐Yes, it is.

1016
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,128
They say the sacred tree
holds all of our memories.

1017
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,135
SOTA: It does?

1018
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,127
‐It remembers when
Kagome was born,

1019
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:34,428
and when you were born, Sota.

1020
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:36,392
When you both started
going to school,

1021
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,312
and when you won first
place in the school race.

1022
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:42,353
The times when you were sick
in bed with a high fever.

1023
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,808
This tree has lived through
it all with us, happy times

1024
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,148
and sad times.

1025
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:50,904
It has always been
here to protect us.

1026
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:54,527
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): The sacred
tree has been there for me too.

1027
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,164
Inuyasha.

1028
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,674
This place means more
than anything to me.

1029
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:08,917
‐What’s the matter?

1030
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,095
The sacred tree
shard is glowing.

1031
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,183
‐Sacred jewel shard, as
in the Shikon jewel‐‐

1032
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:18,181
‐I’m still connected
to their world.

1033
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:19,675
I’m still connected.

1034
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,609
MIROKU (VOICEOVER):
I’ve never kept

1035
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,769
the wind tunnel
exposed for this long.

1036
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,188
I can’t hold on for much longer.

1037
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,040
‐And now, monk, prepare to die.

1038
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,542
Farewell.

1039
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:54,553
[laughing] I win this battle.

1040
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,888
Oh, what’s this?

1041
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,321
Lord Hyoga.

1042
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,997
‐Someday, that very
fate will befall me.

1043
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,878
My own flesh and
bones will be sucked

1044
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,514
into the void of my cursed hand.

1045
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:49,148
‐You refuse to
admit the obvious.

1046
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,611
Demons are born
to be controlled,

1047
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,070
and the best way is with power.

1048
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,441
‐Not true.

1049
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:58,359
My relationship with Kirara
is nothing like that.

1050
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,697
‐Fool, still so
naive and stubborn.

1051
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,244
You won’t be missed.

1052
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,417
‐Kirara, I know this
isn’t how you want to be.

1053
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,399
‐What’s the matter with you?

1054
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,309
Finish her off.

1055
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:39,324
‐Kirara.

1056
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:43,447
Kirara, stop it.

1057
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,170
Kirara.

1058
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:58,015
‐The feline broke
through my spell.

1059
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,592
‐Kirara, I knew it.

1060
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,675
I knew you wanted to come back.

1061
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,510
‐Kirara, I have no
use for you anymore.

1062
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:12,445
‐Kirara, the hiraikotsu.

1063
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,870
Let’s get her, Kirara.

1064
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:38,343
We did it.

1065
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,132
‐I’m not that easy to kill.

1066
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,507
Nice try, but‐‐ ahhh!

1067
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,890
Lord Hyoga, no.

1068
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,060
Don’t do this.

1069
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,018
I can still serve you.

1070
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,572
‐Let’s go, Kirara.

1071
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:13,124
‐I am almost there.

1072
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:16,419
Only a few more souls and
I will at last be complete.

1073
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:21,762
‐So it seems Myoga was
right about Menomaru.

1074
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:21,922
‐Miroku.

1075
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,007
‐Sango.

1076
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,427
I’m glad you got Kirara back.

1077
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,065
‐How did you do?

1078
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:31,981
‐Well, I managed.

1079
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,941
overused my wind tunnel
a little bit though.

1080
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,270
It feels like the demonic
aura has become much stronger.

1081
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:39,438
Take Kirara and
make your escape.

1082
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:42,776
I will use my wind tunnel
and take care of it.

1083
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:43,323
Ah.

1084
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:44,775
‐Are you all right?

1085
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:57,827
‐Curse you, Menomaru, but you
steal the souls of the dead.

1086
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,790
‐Fox Fire!

1087
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:05,336
Oh no, my fox magic
isn’t working.

1088
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,797
What do you think we
should do now, Kaede?

1089
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:10,888
‐This tree is feeding
off sheer evil.

1090
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:13,983
Only the secret powers
of Kikyo or Kagome

1091
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:17,481
would be powerful enough
to stop it at this point.

1092
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,403
‐Master Inuyasha, say something.

1093
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,481
It’s the last demand
I’ll make of you.

1094
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:39,001
‐Oh spirits of the skies,
stop the snow from falling.

1095
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:49,638
‐I drank too much.

1096
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,524
‐Kagome.

1097
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,943
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
I can feel him.

1098
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,651
I can feel Inuyasha.

1099
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:02,902
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Kagome.

1100
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,202
Is that you?

1101
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,872
‐Inuyasha, how are you?

1102
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,489
Are you OK?

1103
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,446
‐Don’t worry.

1104
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,285
This is nothing.

1105
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,582
I’m kind of surprised
you’re not here.

1106
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:24,088
‐I came back.

1107
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,093
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Got scared, did ya?

1108
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:26,515
‐No!

1109
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,260
I just‐‐ I‐‐

1110
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:37,386
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): You what?

1111
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,476
‐Never mind.

1112
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,060
You’re right, maybe I ran away.

1113
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:46,068
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Stupid,
you’ll never change, will ya?

1114
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:46,741
‐What do you mean stupid?

1115
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,913
‐Inuyasha.

1116
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,834
‐Oh hey, you are here, Kagome.

1117
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:03,416
So what have you
been worrying about.

1118
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:06,672
‐I just fell so helpless.

1119
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,585
I even ended up
hurting you, Inuyasha.

1120
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:13,465
And I thought you’d be
better off without me around.

1121
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:17,135
‐Would you stop
going on like that?

1122
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,016
‐Inuyasha, don’t move.

1123
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:19,641
You’ll open your wounds.

1124
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:34,322
‐I need you with me, Kagome.

1125
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,200
Haven’t you realized that yet?

1126
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:46,753
‐Thank you.

1127
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,092
Inuyasha?

1128
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,763
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Come on back, Kagome.

1129
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,098
‐Hm.

1130
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:08,151
‐Oh spirits of skies, stop
the snow from falling.

1131
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:14,743
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Oh boy.

1132
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:22,408
‐Inuyasha, I can’t get back.

1133
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:25,168
‐Kagome?

1134
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,500
‐She’s finally lost it.

1135
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:27,537
‐Inuyasha?

1136
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,669
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
What is it?

1137
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,554
‐The well is filled with roots.

1138
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,922
I can’t get back.

1139
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,508
‐Kagome, use the sacred
arrow [inaudible].

1140
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,515
Use that to tear
apart the roots.

1141
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:38,678
That’s what Kaede said to do.

1142
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:43,175
‐But I don’t have
anything like that here.

1143
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,688
I do.

1144
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,020
Gramps, give me one of those.

1145
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,405
Got it.

1146
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,242
Inuyasha, I’ll be right there.

1147
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:58,697
Let me borrow this.

1148
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:03,706
‐Cold, huh, Gramps?

1149
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,710
‐Stew would be nice for supper.

1150
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:09,342
A nice hot stew.

1151
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,589
‐Kagome.

1152
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:12,513
‐Mom.

1153
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:13,339
‐You forgot this.

1154
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:20,353
‐You do what you have to, OK?

1155
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,440
‐I don’t think ye are
up to this, Inuyasha.

1156
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,613
‐Your wound’s still not healed.

1157
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,610
‐Shut up.

1158
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,732
My body’s build a lot
tougher than yours.

1159
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:34,819
Stay back unless you
want to get killed.

1160
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:48,964
‐Here goes.

1161
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:55,304
‐What happened?

1162
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,634
‐I made it.

1163
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,128
‐Kagome!

1164
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,558
Kagome.

1165
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,771
‐Ye are all right.

1166
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,522
‐And Kaede too.

1167
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,483
Your arm.

1168
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,615
I’m sorry.

1169
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,519
‐Nothing to worry about.

1170
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:13,018
‐Kagome!

1171
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,856
‐Inuyasha.

1172
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,737
‐Did you have to make
such a noisy entrance?

1173
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:22,945
‐Pardon me?

1174
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:23,795
You’re the one who told
me to use an arrow.

1175
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:26,159
‐I never told you to blow us up.

1176
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:29,619
‐What more does he want?

1177
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:30,630
She’s back, isn’t she?

1178
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,839
Why is he picking a fight?

1179
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,591
‐No need for concern,
they’re back to normal.

1180
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:39,012
‐Master Inuyasha,
Hyoga’s absorbing

1181
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,724
the soul of every living
creature in the world.

1182
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:44,472
This is not the time
for petty arguments.

1183
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,678
‐I figured out that much.

1184
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,348
Let’s go, Kagome.

1185
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:48,847
‐Right.

1186
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,881
‐What’s that glow from?

1187
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,968
‐We’ll find out soon,
now hang on tight.

1188
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,726
‐What was that explosion?

1189
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,687
‐Curses, we’re too late.

1190
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:39,489
‐Myoga?

1191
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:40,859
‐You’re not running away?

1192
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:44,697
‐I act when it’s necessary.

1193
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:46,033
‐Seems I’ve
misjudged you, Myoga.

1194
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:19,727
‐Look at the size of him.

1195
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:20,900
He’s enormous.

1196
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,856
‐Size isn’t everything, Kagome.

1197
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,583
You can’t scare us, moth man.

1198
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:36,084
‐Are you all right?

1199
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:37,878
‐Don’t waste your time
worrying about me.

1200
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,591
‐So you’re still
alive, half‐demon?

1201
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:41,592
‐And kicking.

1202
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,633
Now, it’s my turn to thank you.

1203
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:47,050
‐The time has come.

1204
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:02,441
‐What are those demons?

1205
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:03,277
Where did they come from?

1206
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,161
‐They are demons
from the continent.

1207
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,951
The only way to defeat
them is to combine

1208
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:12,703
the powers of the Tessaiga
and Kagome’s arrow.

1209
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:13,908
‐My Tessaiga and Kagome’s arrow?

1210
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:17,207
‐Good luck to you all.

1211
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,542
You’re running away yet again?

1212
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,338
‐My faithful demon servants,
devour every creature

1213
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:25,634
in the world.

1214
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,967
Feel the wrath of my Tessaiga.

1215
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:32,391
‐Yes.

1216
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:32,814
‐He did it.

1217
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,813
‐Nicely done!

1218
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:38,693
‐I’m not getting anywhere.

1219
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,064
‐There’s way too many of them.

1220
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,399
Here they come.

1221
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:49,197
Stay away, you creeps.

1222
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:49,704
‐Kagome!

1223
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:50,205
Shippo!

1224
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:53,124
‐Hiraikotsu!

1225
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:01,336
‐Sango and Miroku too.

1226
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:01,841
‐Kagome.

1227
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:04,632
‐You’re all OK.

1228
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:05,514
Thank goodness.

1229
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,300
‐You’re safe too.

1230
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,513
‐Don’t just stand
there, help me.

1231
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:12,309
‐Wind tunnel!

1232
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,853
Hurry and go.

1233
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:17,735
I’ll take care of them.

1234
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:18,903
‐Thanks Miroku and good luck.

1235
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,190
‐Please, do your best.

1236
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:24,363
Should you not live through
this, I’ll never forget you.

1237
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:27,402
Don’t jinx me before
I even get started.

1238
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,399
‐We’re gonna win.

1239
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,450
Ain’t it obvious?

1240
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,241
‐You must be mad.

1241
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,946
You still think a half‐breed
like yourself can defeat me?

1242
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:34,945
new Lord Hyoga?

1243
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,036
‐Definitely.

1244
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,962
I’ll show you how it’s done.

1245
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,580
‐Inuyasha.

1246
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,539
‐Kagome, be careful.

1247
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,129
‐I’ll be fine.

1248
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:44,671
I’m with Inuyasha.

1249
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:55,473
Are you all right?

1250
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:57,597
‐I’ve never seen
anything more pathetic.

1251
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:58,936
A half‐demon [inaudible]
with a mortal girl.

1252
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,060
‐Why?

1253
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:04,115
What’s wrong with
us being together?

1254
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:09,282
‐Inuyasha, your kind is turning
into spineless weaklings

1255
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,914
by those same
disgusting creatures.

1256
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,119
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Damn.

1257
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,030
His aura is so strong,
it’s overpowering mine.

1258
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,998
‐Kagome, shoot your arrow.

1259
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,999
Just shoot and aim for his body.

1260
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,172
‐All right.

1261
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:25,090
I sure this tiny arrow
will work on him.

1262
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,468
‐There it is, the spot where
the swirling air collides.

1263
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:37,428
Wind star!

1264
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:49,744
Damn.

1265
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:50,109
I barely scratched the surface.

1266
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,662
‐How dare you challenge me.

1267
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,959
Witness my awesome power.

1268
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,793
‐Kagome, run!

1269
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:12,967
‐His aura is so powerful.

1270
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:16,601
‐I don’t believe this.

1271
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,220
‐We really got him
good and mad that time.

1272
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,477
We could win, Kagome.

1273
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:24,021
I’ll use the backlash wave to
send his own energy right back

1274
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:24,555
at him.

1275
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:26,266
‐Amazing.

1276
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,726
‐Do you think that maybe
we’re in way over our heads

1277
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:29,397
this time?

1278
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:30,784
‐Yeah, shall we run for it?

1279
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:31,280
‐Uh‐huh.

1280
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:35,705
‐Hiraikotsu!

1281
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,547
‐You’ve witnessed my power
and you still wish to defy me.

1282
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,013
Come at me then.

1283
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:56,511
‐You got two legs and a
heartbeat, what’s stopping you?

1284
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:59,264
‐Your mouth seems to be your
only weapon, half‐demon.

1285
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:00,137
‐Don’t count on it.

1286
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:01,933
I’m full of surprises.

1287
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,887
‐Inuyasha, his demonic
aura is centered

1288
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:05,769
around the mark on his forehead.

1289
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,524
‐Do you think you can hit it?

1290
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,895
‐I’ll try.

1291
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:12,325
Come on, you’ve got to make it.

1292
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,947
‐That’s the spot!

1293
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:25,406
‐You fool, do you really think
I’d fall for a second time?

1294
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:33,550
‐It’s gonna miss.

1295
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:45,143
‐What?

1296
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:47,976
Lousy wench.

1297
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,733
Die!

1298
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:50,356
‐Oh no, Kagome!

1299
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,738
‐Are you all right?

1300
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:58,112
‐Yeah.

1301
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:58,909
Thanks.

1302
01:32:58,990 --> 01:32:59,910
‐Can you go on?

1303
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:00,781
‐Yes.

1304
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,659
Please take me to Inuyasha.

1305
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,004
‐All right.

1306
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:04,499
Kirara.

1307
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,922
‐Inuyasha.

1308
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:10,132
‐Miroku.

1309
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,291
‐I’ve taking care of
his demonic minions.

1310
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,249
‐Yeah, and I got three of them.

1311
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:13,878
‐Good job.

1312
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:14,633
KAGOME: Inuyasha!

1313
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,546
‐You idiot!

1314
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,258
That was a little reckless.

1315
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:25,268
‐Yeah, well, I
knew you’d catch me

1316
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,441
so I figured I’d
take the fast way.

1317
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,849
INUYASHA: You’re not a
piece of baggage, dummy.

1318
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:33,108
‐Sango, no need to be shy.

1319
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:33,823
Come.

1320
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,942
Fall into my arms.

1321
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:36,437
Ow.

1322
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:36,939
‐Idiot.

1323
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,579
‐He’s coming.

1324
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,239
Kagome, aim for the mark again.

1325
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:46,037
‐His aura’s too strong.

1326
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:48,581
My arrow will never
make it that far.

1327
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,335
‐Will you stop
making excuses, just

1328
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,128
be over confident like
usual and fire the arrow.

1329
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,380
‐Like you’re one to talk.

1330
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,922
‐I’ll use your arrow to
relay my backlash wave.

1331
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,626
Just trust me and shoot.

1332
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:03,143
‐Play time is over.

1333
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,353
Prepare for your lives to end.

1334
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:17,319
‐Come on, what’s taking ya?

1335
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:17,902
Just shoot!

1336
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,236
‐I’m going to.

1337
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,450
How about having a
little faith in me too?

1338
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:29,158
‐Kagome!

1339
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:29,407
‐You can do it.

1340
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:40,684
‐No!

1341
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:41,840
‐I’ll show you!

1342
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:45,136
You mocked us, but now you’re
gonna feel our true power.

1343
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:46,351
Backlash wave!

1344
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:54,559
‐What?

1345
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:02,035
Curse you, half demon.

1346
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,460
‐We did it.

1347
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,301
‐How could a human
and a half demon

1348
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,920
defeat the great Lord Hyoga?

1349
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:22,880
‐Is it over?

1350
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,522
‐Hurry everyone.

1351
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:39,651
‐The Tree of Ages is
beginning to collapse.

1352
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,534
‐The tree was tapped
into Hyoga’s demon power

1353
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:43,361
and grew to enormous
proportions,

1354
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:45,066
so it’s only natural
that it return

1355
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:45,528
to dust now that he’s dead.

1356
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:02,263
You’re not hurt, are you?

1357
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,300
‐No, I’m fine.

1358
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:04,804
But what about you?

1359
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:07,796
I mean, that wound
to your chest.

1360
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:11,059
‐That’s nothing,
hardly a scratch.

1361
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,100
‐Thank you, Inuyasha.

1362
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:15,941
Never mind.

‐Women.

1364
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:19,113
‐Master Inuyasha.

1365
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:20,272
‐Myoga, you’re back.

1366
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:22,438
‐That was brilliant,
and all because you

1367
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:25,108
used the precise
tactic I prescribed.

1368
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:26,488
You are amazing indeed.

1369
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:30,834
‐Ha, you ran away at the
most critical time again.

1370
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,452

how you defeated Hyoga‐‐

there the whole time?

01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,289
MYOGA: Of course, I would never
abandon my Master Inuyasha.

1373
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,255
INUYASHA: You always do.

1374
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,214
KAGOME: Always.

1375
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:41,055

Snow.

It was so weird before.

01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:27,588
I could hear your voice
from within the sacred tree.

1386
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:31,300
You seemed so close.

‐I was right there.

1388

You looked so exhausted.

I thought you were
going to collapse.

1390

You almost had me worried.

‐Hey, what do say I make
another special lunch?

put in that stuff I like.

‐No, I don’t think it was egg.

It was kind of crunchy.

only good thing.
