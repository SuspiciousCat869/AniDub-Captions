1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,873
(static hissing)

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,356
(cheerful jazz music)

3
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:43,009
(skates clattering)

4
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,321
(crowd chattering indistinctly)

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,696
(cars whooshing)

6
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,780
(car whooshing)

7
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,354
(liquid pouring)

8
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,125
(glass clinking)

9
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,531
(paper rustling)

10
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,708
(ominous music)

11
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,582
- That's the target for
the current assignment.

12
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,326
(door clattering)

13
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,997
(plane whooshing)

14
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,568
(cheerful music)

15
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,006
- For any investigation,

16
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,009
you can count on the
Saeba firm every time!

17
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,378
- Yeah yeah, remember, Saeba.

18
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,181
- We won't get any clients
if you're talking like that!

19
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,153
Now, act friendlier!
- Oh, friendlier.

20
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,690
Hi there! And how are we today?

21
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,759
My name is Joe, and who might you be?

22
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,196
- Um, Hinako.
- Oh gee, that's so cute!

23
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,265
Hinako, if you'll just step this way,

24
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,633
I'll show you how friendly I can be.

25
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,369
- That's okay.
(mallet thudding)

26
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,206
- That is not what I meant
and you know it, Joe!

27
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,942
(sighs) If I'm gonna have to
look after you every second,

28
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,078
then just do me a favor and
don't bother getting up.

29
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,079
- Fine.

30
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:06,518
Wow!
(romantic music)

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,020
- Can you help me, please?

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,555
(fireworks booming)

33
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,824
- A blonde! I'm finally
gonna get a real blonde!

34
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,362
Any problem, any investigation,
you'll be satisfied!

35
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,899
- See? Now that's the spirit.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,502
(Joe groaning)

37
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,905
Say bye to Miss American Pie!

38
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,942
- Uh-uh-uh, don't act that
way in front of the client.

39
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,511
- Wait, the client? Huh?

40
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,616
- My name is Emily O'Hara.

41
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,520
(calming music)

42
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,090
- Wow, the mafia's after you?

43
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,993
- That's why I had to get
as far from LA as possible.

44
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,362
- But why would they want you?

45
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,598
- I had this thing going
for a while with a guy

46
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,200
who was the son of a mafia
don, but it turns out

47
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,637
he's a real pervert and
would never leave me alone.

48
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,106
One time I had to kick him where it counts

49
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,908
in order to get him off me.

50
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,710
He spent the night in the hospital

51
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,346
and his dad wasn't too happy about that.

52
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,814
(both laughing)

53
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,516
- That's great, I'll have to try that.

54
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,286
- Except that his dad
took out a contract on me.

55
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,522
The guy says he usually
cools down in about a month,

56
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,392
but until then, I need the
two of you to look out for me.

57
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,527
I'm willing to pay a million dollars.

58
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,863
- Huh? Million?

59
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,465
So with the current rate exchange,

60
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,501
don't forget to carry
the one, let's see...

61
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,372
200 million yen?

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,807
- Last Christmas,

63
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,809
the mafia guy's son gave
me a luxury cruiser.

64
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,879
It's worth twice that much,
and it's in great shape.

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,681
- Great! Don't you worry about a thing!

66
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,217
We promise we'll protect
you. Won't we, Joe?

67
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,852
- No way?
- What?

68
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,754
- Scared of the mafia?

69
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,556
- I don't care who the
enemy is, I never take a job

70
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,393
if I don't think the
payment is acceptable.

71
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,296
- A million's not enough?

72
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,331
- It's not the money.

73
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,700
- What do you mean?
- Joe!

74
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,403
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, nookie time!

75
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,272
- You jerk! Don't try to
take advantage of her!

76
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,208
- Do you want the million dollars or not?

77
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,945
Nookie and money or nothing, you decide.

78
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,348
- Million bucks, but Joe gets nookie.

79
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,785
No nookie, no million bucks! Wait!

80
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,620
- Huh?

81
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,321
- Why don't you have sex with me?

82
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,157
(Joe yelps)
(ominous music)

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,626
So that just doesn't do it for you, huh?

84
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,829
Fine, okay okay okay,
but just this one time!

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,064
(Joe cheering)

86
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,299
- Woo-hoo! Yay, yippee!

87
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,202
Okay, Emily, Kaori says I can take you!

88
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,770
- Take me?

89
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,706
- I mean, take you on as a client.

90
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,408
- Oh, thank you, take me.

91
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,877
- (laughs) What have I done?

92
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:46,946
Snap out of it!

93
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,981
Remember that you're getting
a million dollars, Kaori.

94
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:50,817
(ominous music)

95
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,284
- Huh? Get down!

96
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,652
(guns firing)

97
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,920
- Ah!

98
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,054
(Joe grunts)

99
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,924
(wheels screeching)

100
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,892
- He sure took off fast.
- Emily!

101
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,763
- Kaori, don't move her!
- Why? What's the matter?

102
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,031
- I can see her panties.

103
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,735
Blue, like the waves of the
ocean on a clear summer day.

104
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,472
- Joe, I hate your perverted poetry!

105
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,209
- Ah! I was just getting a down payment!

106
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,578
- I got your down payment right here!

107
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,179
- That's okay, I don't want it from you!

108
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,617
- What's the matter, Joe?
- Oh, no way is this the guy.

109
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,453
- I wouldn't do it with
you for 10 million dollars!

110
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,322
- Yep, that's him.

111
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,992
(horns honking)

112
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,164
Mr. Saeba, tell me
again why I need to stay

113
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,833
in your apartment instead
of staying in the hotel.

114
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,136
- It's very simple.

115
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,772
It'll be easier for me to protect you

116
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,975
in a controlled environment,
which a hotel is not.

117
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,677
- So I should be safe at your place?

118
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,812
- Not exactly.

119
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,149
- Kaori, if there's a problem,
I can turn down the job!

120
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,150
- Oh, hey, no,

121
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,119
you do whatever you feel
you need to, Mr. Saeba.

122
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,654
- Good, thank you.

123
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,660
(engines revving)
(ominous music)

124
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,836
(horns honking)

125
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,605
- Here's the $10,000 deposit.

126
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,176
- Wow, this is by far the
biggest deposit we've ever had!

127
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,078
Hey Joe, look, we got
a check for 10 grand!

128
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,947
- Kaori, I'm willing to bet

129
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,282
that Emily's exhausted
after her long trip,

130
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,418
surely she'd like to take
a hot shower before dinner.

131
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,488
- Oh, he's right. I'm
being such a poor hostess.

132
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,556
Why don't I take you upstairs

133
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,158
and I can show you where the bathroom is?

134
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,328
(Joe laughs)
(ominous music)

135
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,930
This bath towel will be for you.

136
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,398
- Oh, thank you.

137
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,300
- How long are you gonna
stay in there, Joe?

138
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,301
- Huh?

139
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,739
- Now that's strange, I don't
remember coming up here.

140
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,842
(Joe screaming)

141
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,011
- You'll get this piece of
nookie over my dead body.

142
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,746
Emily, you may want to make sure

143
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,249
you lock the door from the inside.

144
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,218
- Yeah, I think I will.

145
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,087
- She broke the promise!

146
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,325
(shower hissing)

147
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,264
(Emily sighing)

148
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,870
(rope whooshing)

149
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,406
Blonde like golden field of nookie.

150
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,643
(Emily sighing)

151
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,812
No, Kaori, we will never share nookie

152
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,615
while blondes roam the earth.

153
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,416
(rope snapping)

154
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,086
(Joe screaming)

155
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,522
(garbage crashing)

156
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,824
- You should never say never, Joe.

157
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,692
(Joe laughs)

158
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,295
- How about you should never
break a promise, Kaori?

159
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,000
(Emily sighing)

160
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,035
- Where did I put my lingerie?

161
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:02,041
(gun firing)
(Emily gasping)

162
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,542
Huh?
- Kaori, stop!

163
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,344
I'm a guy, I'm supposed
to do stuff like this!

164
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,280
- Three chances are all you get, Joe.

165
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,749
Next time you're gonna be a holy man.

166
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,652
Oh, Emily, did you enjoy your shower?

167
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,320
- Yeah.
- A gun!

168
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,424
- Oh, I thought the killer was
here. I guess I overreacted.

169
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,061
Besides, everybody at home
in the US carries a gun.

170
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,864
I've never actually had to
use mine, thank goodness.

171
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,732
- Is that so?

172
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,700
It seems like you've been

173
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,702
through some special
weapons training, though.

174
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,439
(Emily gasps)
Well? Am I right?

175
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,409
- How did you pick up
on that so quickly, Joe?

176
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,911
- Maybe it's because he
sniffed all the gunpowder

177
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,447
off of my bra.
- Bingo!

178
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,284
Wow, I finally found someone
with a sense of humor!

179
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,153
(Emily laughing)

180
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,823
- This just can't be happening to me.

181
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,926
(relaxing jazz music)

182
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,226
- Man, this sucks.

183
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,762
Kaori seems to have figured
out all of my tricks.

184
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,799
I'll have to come up with
a new plan of attack.

185
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,634
(door clattering)
Huh?

186
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,501
- Joe, I'm picking up
groceries for dinner,

187
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,538
so keep an eye on Emily for me.

188
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,174
- Yes? No.

189
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,210
I'm dreaming, or Kaori's being kidnapped,

190
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,615
and this imposter decided to
leave Emily home alone with me!

191
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,383
I know, it's a test!

192
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,019
There must be a million booby
traps between me and Emily.

193
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,021
Kaori, you've underestimated me.

194
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,192
Nookie means never back down!

195
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,829
I'm coming out now.
(door clattering)

196
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,432
Don't hurt me, no!

197
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,434
Huh? That's interesting.

198
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,769
I should've been smashed in the head

199
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,971
with a giant hammer by now.

200
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,943
(relaxing jazz music continues)

201
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,280
Huh? I still don't see anything scary.

202
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,750
Ah, Kaori must have
decided to honor her word

203
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,985
and let me have Emily after all!

204
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,088
Thank you, Kaori, I won't let you down.

205
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,089
Emily!

206
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,793
(hammer thudding)

207
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,730
Okay, I should've seen this coming.

208
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,700
(Joe grunting)

209
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,469
- Kaori told me how fun this
was, so I asked if I could try.

210
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,439
This is a great way to
blow off some steam.

211
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,342
One more time!
(Joe screams)

212
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,079
- Watch it, it's not a
toy! Don't come any closer!

213
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,447
- You're scared of this thing?

214
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,117
- No, obviously I'm worried
that you might hurt yourself.

215
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,153
(hammer thudding)
(Joe screaming)

216
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:32,490
- This is so much fun.
Don't you want to play?

217
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,659
- Some other time, I think
it's past my bedtime.

218
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,229
Well, see you tomorrow! Goodnight!

219
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,665
- You're no fun.

220
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,103
- Mom, can I have this?

221
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,973
- Green onions, three for
88 yen. That's a bargain.

222
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,175
- Sure is.
- Hm?

223
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,644
- Cooking someone a
special dinner, Falcon?

224
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,979
- Ah, Kaori, how nice to see you.

225
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,449
Miki has a fever, so I'm
picking up some groceries

226
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,818
for her so she can rest. (laughs)

227
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,520
- Oh, Miki has a fever?
Do you need any help?

228
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,155
- No, I'll be just fine, thank you.

229
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,926
You seem to be stocking up, so
what's the special occasion?

230
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,694
- We have a guest. (laughs)

231
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,396
We have a million dollar client!

232
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,630
- Hm? A hit job?

233
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,133
- No no no, we're bodyguards.

234
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,636
- That's way too much money.
- Oh, really?

235
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,139
- Look, I heard this weird rumor.

236
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,775
There's someone in town
who's out to kill Joe,

237
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,543
someone from LA.

238
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,546
- From LA? Is the person male or female?

239
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,284
- Sorry, but that's all I
know. Got to go. (laughs)

240
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,056
(ominous music)

241
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,925
- Someone from LA.

242
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,261
But, oh god...

243
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,498
- Are you watching?

244
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,468
The time of revenge is
close at hand, I promise.

245
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,378
(door rattling)

246
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,797
Look at him, anyone could kill him now.

247
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,770
This is the great City
Hunter. I can't believe it.

248
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,675
(Kaori panting)

249
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,077
- Joe!
(Emily gasps)

250
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,078
Joe!

251
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,387
Emily, where's Joe?

252
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,255
- Kaori, what's the matter? Are you okay?

253
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,592
Joe's sleeping quietly in his room.

254
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
- Joe! Joe!

255
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,132
- (yawns) Why are you so noisy?

256
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,401
- Oh Joe, you're all right.

257
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,736
- Huh? What's the matter with you?

258
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,772
Why'd you wake me like that?

259
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,541
I'm hungry, what did you get for dinner?

260
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,410
- I forgot!
(Joe shouts)

261
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,912
- You went shopping
and forgot to buy food?

262
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,683
(wondrous music)

263
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,421
- I'm sorry we had to get
takeout. It's all my fault.

264
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,989
- No, I love sushi.

265
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,691
- Besides, I'd rather have this stuff

266
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,160
than Kaori's atrocious cooking anytime.

267
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,128
(Joe yelps)

268
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,529
- Ha! Please, help yourself.

269
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,098
- Great, thank you.

270
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,706
Delicious! It's so much better here.

271
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,908
- Thank you, I'm glad to hear that.

272
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,010
You're pretty good with
chopsticks, aren't you?

273
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,478
- Well, I love Japanese food

274
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,014
and go out for sushi in LA all the time.

275
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,482
(Kaori gasps)
(ominous music)

276
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,452
- There's someone in town
who's out to kill Joe,

277
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,621
someone from LA.

278
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,689
- No, it can't be Emily.

279
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,825
It's just a coincidence, I'm sure of it.

280
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,027
There's lots of people from LA.

281
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,030
- What's wrong, Kaori? You look so sad.

282
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,832
- Hey Emily, after dinner,

283
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,634
why don't we go out for a little while?

284
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,069
I know this place that
serves great coffee.

285
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,039
- That sounds wonderful,
I love little cafes.

286
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,209
- You can't possibly mean
that bastard's coffee!

287
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,510
- It's delicious!

288
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,512
Besides, Miki has a fever,

289
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,381
so we need to go over
there and cheer her up.

290
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,249
- Huh, a fever?

291
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,717
Then she's probably all sweaty

292
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,952
and only wearing her underwear.

293
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,754
Yeah, let's go take a look, shall we?

294
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,389
- Yeah, let's.

295
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,390
- Huh?

296
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,693
- Maybe if Falcon had
a good look at Emily,

297
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,728
he might recognize her.

298
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,597
It's worth a shot.

299
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,768
(relaxing jazz music)

300
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,269
(wheels screeching)

301
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,173
(doors clattering)

302
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,875
Here we are.
(bell ringing)

303
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,110
- Hello.
- Oh, hi there, Joe. Come in.

304
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,813
- Hey, I thought you were
supposed to be all sweaty!

305
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,382
Come on, please tell me
you still have a fever.

306
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,919
- I was feeling just
fine until you got here.

307
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,488
- Good evening, Miki. Are
you feeling any better?

308
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,990
- I feel just fine.

309
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,960
I do have a little fever,
but Falcon's overreacting.

310
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,595
- Oh, that's sweet. Well, this is Emily.

311
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,431
She's a client we're protecting.

312
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,399
This is Miki and this is Falcon.

313
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,935
- Nice to met you.
- You too.

314
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,070
- Hm.

315
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,639
(ominous music)

316
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,674
- Well, let's go have a seat and relax

317
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,876
till Falcon's delicious coffee is ready.

318
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,479
- Falcon, did you get a good
look at Emily? Is she the one?

319
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,814
- Hm?
- The person you heard about

320
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,849
from LA who came here to kill Joe.

321
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,453
- I already told you everything
that I know. However...

322
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,288
- Yes?

323
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,223
- She has a callus on her
hand from firing a pistol.

324
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,259
You don't get a callus with
just normal practice shooting.

325
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,461
You would have to shoot a lot,

326
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,396
like you were training every day.

327
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,132
- Shoot every day?
She's got to be the one.

328
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,234
- That's not what I said, I'm just saying

329
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,070
you don't usually get
calluses from target shooting.

330
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,741
Besides, I'm sure Joe would've
already picked up on this.

331
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,576
- Come on, let me see them.
- You saw them before!

332
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,211
- I'm not so sure, let's
just say Joe's been

333
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,913
a little distracted lately.
- Stop it!

334
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,149
(ominous music)

335
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,886
(engine revving)

336
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,688
(glass shattering)

337
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,555
(Kaori gasps)

338
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,393
(blades whirring)

339
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:13,899
- Huh?
(drone beeping)

340
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:14,933
- (gasps) Douglas!

341
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,369
(gun firing)

342
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,206
Don't shoot, it'll explode!

343
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,811
(glass shattering)

344
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,382
- Huh, always playing the hero.
He could've used the door.

345
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,551
- Emily, it's dangerous!
Let Joe handle this!

346
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,820
- I can't! It's Douglas!

347
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,821
- Douglas?

348
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,725
(tense music)

349
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,862
- (laughs) City Hunter, I've
heard so much about you.

350
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,731
Don't tell me the hero of the underground

351
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,634
can't outrun a model airplane.

352
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,237
(gun firing)

353
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,043
(explosion booming)

354
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,883
(tree crashing)

355
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,621
- That's the real City
Hunter, a man of action.

356
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,991
He's completely different
when he has a gun.

357
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,994
(ominous music)

358
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,798
- (laughs) Just my way of saying hello.

359
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,935
But don't worry, I'll
finish you off soon enough.

360
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,703
- Mr. Saeba, are you all right?

361
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,773
- Yeah, fine, not a scratch on me.

362
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,512
(Emily gasps)

363
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,513
Douglas!

364
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,053
- Don't waste your bullets,
he's already out of range.

365
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,088
Give it up.
- Hm.

366
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,293
- Let me guess, I'm the one
being targeted here, right?

367
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:54,165
Emily O'Hara, 25, CIA
agent extraordinaire.

368
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,000
(Emily gasps)

369
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,836
Based in Los Angeles,
badge number ST249960.

370
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,039
- You knew all along.

371
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,177
- You carry a Sentinel Arms
custon combat 44 magnum,

372
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,945
a little stronger than the average handgun

373
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,748
a lady uses for protection,
don't you think?

374
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,550
(gun firing)

375
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,019
Lastly, you got a nice shooting callus.

376
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,321
Even most pros don't get that.

377
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,592
I want you to tell me
everything, no secrets this time.

378
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,361
- Understood.

379
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,729
(hammer thudding)

380
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,430
- Falcon, don't let yourself

381
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,966
get dragged into Joe's
foolishness this time.

382
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,535
- Yes, yes, I know.

383
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,104
Every time I get involved, I
wind up regretting it later.

384
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,540
- Aw, your bow tie's on crooked.

385
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,875
- Hey, cut it out! What if Joe sees us?

386
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,311
- What? You're with the CIA?

387
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,346
- I came here because
I'm tracking Douglas.

388
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,983
- Mm, I knew you couldn't be a killer.

389
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,618
- Douglas's killings have really put him

390
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,487
on the map in the criminal underground.

391
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,789
He's quite the talented young terrorist.

392
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,893
He uses radio controlled toys
loaded with high explosives

393
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,896
and aimed at top government targets.

394
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,264
Under normal circumstances,

395
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,734
he wouldn't even be on our
radar, but just six months ago

396
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,939
a CIA field agent became
one of his victims.

397
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,042
The agent's mission was hardly critical.

398
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,579
The CIA has no idea why
Douglas chose him as a target,

399
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,980
and that's where I come in.

400
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,250
Keep an eye on Douglas and
figure out what makes him tick.

401
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,519
Recently, the CIA found out that Douglas

402
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,155
has chosen City Hunter
as his latest target.

403
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,991
- And your best chance of
catching Douglas is to make sure

404
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,760
that you're as close to the
target as possible, is that it?

405
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,530
Which would make that little
shooting incident earlier

406
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,866
your people making sure we
bought your mafia cover story.

407
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:39,337
- You're right, we used one
of our Japanese field agents.

408
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,973
- Why do you think Douglas
chose Joe as his target?

409
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,475
- We don't know, but killing Mr. Saeba

410
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,444
would definitely cement his reputation

411
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,112
as one of the foremost assassins

412
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,847
in the criminal underground.

413
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,984
- Great, well we might as well
try to track him down first.

414
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,919
- So you're still willing to help me?

415
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,055
The CIA will still pay you the
million dollars as promised.

416
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,858
- Forget about it, a million
dollars won't matter at all

417
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,793
if Joe gets himself killed in this mess.

418
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,262
- Don't be silly!

419
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,732
Whether I help her or not,
I'm still this guy's target.

420
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,833
- But Joe...

421
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,868
- And if I'm gonna be
running from model planes,

422
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,137
let's take the easy cash.

423
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,240
- You're still hoping to
score with Emily, aren't you?

424
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,408
(Joe laughs)

425
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,579
(relaxing jazz music)

426
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,291
- Ah, perfect. Tanks offer
such superior firepower.

427
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,059
Next, I'll build the Harley.

428
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,663
It'll make a nice reconnaissance vehicle.

429
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,166
(birds chirping)

430
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,702
(gun firing)

431
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,804
- Wow, your accuracy is incredible.

432
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,240
- It's not that big a deal,
it just takes practice.

433
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,243
(bullets clinking)

434
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,078
I'd like to see

435
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,614
the legendary City
Hunter's skills in action.

436
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,853
(gun firing)

437
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,223
One entry point, amazing!

438
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,125
- Your weapon of choice isn't bad either.

439
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,461
This is one of the finest
handguns I've used.

440
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,531
- It looks like I need to
practice with it even more.

441
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,532
- No.

442
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,435
(gun clicking)

443
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,004
Your shooting style
feels filled with anger.

444
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,205
It's useless to practice

445
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,808
if your mind isn't fully calm and clear.

446
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,476
- What are you trying to say?

447
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,211
- Emily, don't pretend you're training

448
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,280
just so you can protect yourself better.

449
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,248
You're practicing to kill someone.

450
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,383
Your mind is obsessed

451
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,685
with avenging the murder of your brother.

452
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,387
- Your brother was murdered?

453
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,889
- I see, you figured it all out.

454
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,192
Daniel, the agent that Douglas murdered,

455
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,593
was my older brother.

456
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:46,997
He was on vacation, fishing.
(ominous music)

457
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:51,069
It was so horrible. There was
nothing left of him at all.

458
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,208
- Huh?

459
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,908
(boat revving)

460
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,479
(explosion booming)

461
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,681
(water splashing)

462
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,616
(melancholy music)

463
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,285
After that, I made a promise to myself.

464
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,989
That's why I requested a
reassignment from my desk job

465
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,325
to be a field agent, I promised myself

466
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,727
I would get revenge for
my brother's murder.

467
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,729
I don't intend to capture Douglas,

468
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,799
I intend to bring Douglas's
body home in a bag!

469
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,535
- I won't tell you what to do, but Emily,

470
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,271
a gun is not supposed
to be a tool for murder.

471
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,106
- What else is it for?

472
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,510
The only reason anyone ever
pulls a trigger is to kill.

473
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,746
- A trigger can only reflect your intent.

474
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,851
- You can't understand my pain!

475
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,889
You have no idea what
it was like, not at all!

476
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,626
- We do. My brother was also murdered.

477
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,860
- Kaori.

478
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,829
- Joe took the news pretty badly.

479
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,765
My brother and Joe were best friends.

480
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,004
(plane whooshing)

481
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,946
(alarm blaring)

482
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,349
(birds chirping)

483
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,417
- I give up, what are you
calling me down here for?

484
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,220
- After you asked me to do
that background check on Emily,

485
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,255
I dug up something new.

486
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,623
She doesn't have any assignment

487
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,227
regarding this Douglas person,
at least not an official one.

488
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,196
- Really?

489
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:27,398
- I asked our old Pentagon
friend Mr. Norton to confirm it,

490
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,167
since he still owes us a favor
from the Gilliam incident.

491
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,069
The information's good.

492
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,372
What's interesting, Joe,
is that her supervisor

493
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:39,210
arrived here in Tokyo
today, we have no idea why.

494
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,211
- Hm.

495
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,819
- You can rest in peace, brother.
I promise I'll avenge you.

496
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,255
(door knocking)
Yes?

497
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,625
- Emily, there's a phone call.
- For me?

498
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,993
- Mm-hm, he said his name's Dick.

499
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,395
- Ah, my boss. O'Hara.

500
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,499
- I've just got into Japan.
I'm at the Narita airport.

501
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,635
Everything's according to plan, I assume.

502
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,470
I've got some good news for you,

503
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,206
we have confirmed Douglas's location.

504
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,741
- You've found him? Where is he?

505
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,576
I'll be right there,
I'm leaving right now.

506
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:16,313
- What? Emily?
(tense music)

507
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,816
Wait, stop! Wait till Joe gets back!

508
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,251
Oh, I hate this! What should I do?

509
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,252
I'll go follow her!

510
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,524
- Taxi!
(wheels screeching)

511
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,496
(wheels screeching)

512
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,600
- I have to stop her from doing this.

513
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,839
- Hey, Kaori, is my lunch ready yet?

514
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,976
Kaori? Where did she take off to now?

515
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,647
(ominous music)

516
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,450
- Daniel, I'll keep my promise.

517
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,953
(dirt crunching)

518
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,088
- Emily, wait!

519
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,693
(door creaking)

520
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,363
(Emily gasping)

521
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,003
(explosion booming)

522
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,239
- Sleeping gas!

523
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,943
(Emily coughing)

524
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,379
- Emily, no!

525
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,084
(Emily sighing)

526
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,288
Emily, what's the matter? Emily?

527
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,626
Who are...

528
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,962
(ominous music)

529
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,632
(Kaori sighing)

530
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,107
(floorboards creaking)

531
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,575
(Joe laughing)

532
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,645
- Now while Kaori's gone,
we'll have some fun.

533
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,646
Emily!

534
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,150
Ah!
(glass shattering)

535
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,853
Emily, this is the chance
we've been waiting for!

536
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:06,890
Where did you go? Huh?
(phone ringing)

537
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,961
Yeah, Saeba firm.
- Is this City Hunter?

538
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,530
I found two women walking around my cabin.

539
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,299
Do they by any chance belong to you?

540
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,668
- Well, Douglas, tell me what you want.

541
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,037
- Be at the Yokohama horse racing facility

542
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,174
at midnight tonight, by yourself.

543
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,544
Otherwise, the ladies will
dance across the night sky

544
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,880
as part of a fireworks display.

545
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,249
I'm looking forward to
playing with you, Joe.

546
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,518
- Right, so how many of your dumb toys

547
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,387
should I look forward to?

548
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,155
(phone beeping)

549
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,725
Huh? What have we here?

550
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,194
It's Emily's bra! (laughs)

551
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,232
Wow, yes! There's got to
be more hiding in here!

552
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:52,771
What? No, I know she wears nookie panties.

553
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,205
Hm, that Douglas character

554
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,141
must've ripped them off her already.

555
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,176
Huh? No, stop.

556
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,080
The most important thing
now is saving their lives.

557
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,784
(alarm blaring)

558
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,194
(engine revving)

559
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,309
(wheels screeching)

560
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,580
(door thudding)

561
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,368
(Kaori groaning)

562
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,605
- Kaori, you okay?
- Douglas! Ah!

563
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,007
(handcuffs jingling)

564
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,745
I remember, Douglas
used sleeping gas on us.

565
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,380
- When I woke up, we were
already trapped here.

566
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,950
I have a feeling Douglas
is using us as bait

567
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,252
in order to draw Joe into the open.

568
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,922
Then he'll send his toys.
- At Joe.

569
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,693
(ominous music)

570
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,501
- Douglas, where are you? Show yourself.

571
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,603
- Welcome, Saeba.

572
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,639
I thought it would be fitting
to bury a notorious stud

573
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,641
beneath a horse racing track.

574
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,876
- What's up with the outfit?

575
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,311
After this, are you going to dance class?

576
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,213
- Your friends are in that tower.

577
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,748
If you go through this building,

578
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,416
you'll find the tower entrance.

579
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,985
Why don't you go rescue them?

580
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,120
I'm sure they'd be thrilled to see you,

581
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,290
assuming you actually make
it over there in one piece.

582
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,194
(Douglas laughing)

583
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,398
- Someone's coming.
(Kaori gasps)

584
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,501
(door clattering)

585
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,970
(ominous music)

586
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,106
- Dick! Oh, thank god you found us.

587
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,507
Get us out of here.

588
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,610
- Dick? Are you the guy who called before?

589
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,747
- Dick? Hello?

590
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,217
- Motives never were your
strong suit, were they?

591
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:24,154
Soon you'll realize that I
didn't come here to rescue you.

592
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,256
- What? What are you saying?

593
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,927
- I came to Japan to watch you die, Emily.

594
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,496
(Emily gasps)

595
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,999
(Joe panting)

596
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,076
(explosions booming)

597
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,955
Looks like it's started.
- There's no way.

598
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,991
I can't believe you're the
one pulling Douglas's strings.

599
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,693
(gasps) What about Daniel?

600
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,763
- You're right, Douglas provided
the creativity and the bomb

601
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,499
but I'm the one who gave him the order.

602
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,635
- Why? Why did you have to kill him?

603
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,370
What did he ever do to you?

604
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,038
- Daniel was my employee,

605
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,675
and one of the best intelligence
agents I had ever met.

606
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,577
That was unfortunate.

607
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:24,448
He deduced the one secret no
one could be allowed to know.

608
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,416
- That you can't be trusted?

609
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:30,554
- Yes. Do you know what I
mean when I say I'm a Yuri?

610
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,624
- (gasps) You, but you can't be!

611
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,860
(rubble rumbling)

612
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,962
- That was close.

613
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,032
(ominous music)

614
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,333
- What? How?

615
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,003
Those bombs should've
blown him to kingdom come.

616
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,405
But that's all right,
the real pyro excitement

617
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,073
hasn't even begun yet.

618
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,577
(tense music)

619
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,316
(car whirring)

620
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,063
(explosion booming)

621
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,236
(explosions booming)

622
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,471
Nice shooting!

623
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,009
(explosion booming)
(Joe grunting)

624
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,010
Nice roll.

625
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,616
(explosion booming)
(Joe groaning)

626
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,617
Come on.

627
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,389
(explosion booming)
Now you die!

628
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,931
(bullets clattering)

629
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,868
(Douglas gasps)
(gun firing)

630
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,972
(Douglas screaming)

631
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,175
You shot me! That's not fair.

632
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,148
- You're taking orders from Dick,

633
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,751
the CIA director from Los Angeles.

634
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,853
- Dick? How'd you know that?

635
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,823
- I had a hunch. What's
the real deal here?

636
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,325
He's more than just CIA.

637
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,662
- You're right, that bastard's a Yuri.

638
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,896
- Yuri?

639
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,832
- I can't believe you would kill Daniel

640
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,600
just to protect yourself.

641
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,269
- I'm sorry, can someone
explain Yuri to me?

642
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,005
- It's a spy from the Eastern Bloc

643
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,208
raised from childhood by
other spies inside America.

644
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,976
- To be raised in your enemy's culture

645
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,145
is quite an effective camouflage.

646
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,247
- How could any of this
be possibly related

647
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,783
to manipulating Douglas
into going after Joe?

648
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:43,687
- My dear, would you trust Mr.
Saeba's skill over Douglas's?

649
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,323
- There's no way Joe
could ever possibly lose

650
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,724
against a creep like Douglas!

651
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,292
- Oh, I agree with you.

652
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,295
I have a great deal of respect
for City Hunter's skills.

653
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,332
Douglas has become
something of a nuisance.

654
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,701
He tends to brag too loudly.

655
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,704
- Wait, you mean you
had Douglas attack Joe

656
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,206
because you knew he'd lose?

657
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,842
- Are you suggesting that
Dick assigned you as a target

658
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,544
because he thought I would lose to you?

659
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,248
- You got it, no other
explanation makes any sense to me.

660
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,116
- Well try this, both you guys

661
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,885
are jerks who underestimate me!

662
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,186
- I don't know, but if I were Dick,

663
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,388
I wouldn't have placed any bets on you.

664
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,224
- Hm, you sound confident,

665
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,294
like someone who's just won
a game and wants a prize.

666
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,295
- Hm?

667
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,633
- Go!
(whimsical music)

668
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,970
- Ah, it's beautiful! Emily's underwear!

669
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,040
(Joe chewing)

670
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,477
(gun firing)

671
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,147
(exciting music)

672
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,720
(explosions booming)
(Joe grunting)

673
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,157
(gun firing)

674
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,328
(metal clanking)

675
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:03,301
(Douglas screaming)
(explosions booming)

676
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,270
(rubble crashing)

677
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,520
- Looks like those two have finished.

678
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,355
(explosions booming)

679
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,024
Could that be Douglas?
Still putting up a fight.

680
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,193
- (coughs) So what happens
to your master plan

681
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,728
if Douglas is still alive?

682
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,498
What'll you do if he hides
from Joe or something?

683
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,734
- He can't, City Hunter
has to kill Douglas.

684
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,637
I've gone through too much
trouble to set this up.

685
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,972
- I still don't get it,

686
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,174
why go through all of
this to protect yourself?

687
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,110
If the only danger is that
your identity is discovered,

688
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,212
why don't you go home where it's safe?

689
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,549
- I would prefer to continue
working for my home country,

690
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,117
and I'm willing to eliminate

691
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,586
anything that might pose a threat to that.

692
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,456
- Come on, you're hiding
something and you know it.

693
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,459
- Sorry, but there's
no time to explain it.

694
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,294
I need to make sure that you're both dead

695
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,497
before Mr. Saeba arrives.
(both gasp)

696
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,567
I'd like to thank you for
the use of your gun, Emily.

697
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,769
A shame you never had
the chance to use it.

698
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,439
All that practice seems such a waste.

699
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,308
(tense music)
(both gasp)

700
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,910
Don't hate me, Emily.

701
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,180
We're both victims of the
collapse of the Cold War.

702
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,683
(gun cocking)

703
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,154
It can be difficult loving
one's country so much.

704
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,690
- You don't have a home country,

705
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,359
you betrayed it along with
everyone you ever knew.

706
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,561
- Joe!
- You!

707
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,597
(gun firing)

708
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,466
(glass shattering)

709
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,501
- You've lied so much

710
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,603
you can't tell your
truth from your fiction.

711
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,371
You've played both
sides against the middle

712
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,240
until your whole life fell apart.

713
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,475
- I can't believe it.

714
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,213
- If he was just a Yuri, he would've run

715
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,015
back to his mother country
when he thought his CIA cover

716
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,017
was blown, but he can't do that

717
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,420
if he double crossed his
home country as well.

718
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,988
Douglas was blackmailing you,

719
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,624
and that couldn't be tolerated,
so you had to find a way

720
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,060
to have him neutralized
without getting involved.

721
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,728
You arranged for Douglas to be killed

722
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,163
before he could expose the fact

723
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,733
that you sold out your home
country as well as the US.

724
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,768
- That's the real reason
Daniel was killed.

725
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,537
He had figured you out.

726
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,872
- That's why he needed
you as his employee,

727
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,009
to keep an eye on you and
find out what Daniel told you.

728
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,711
(gun firing)

729
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,613
You only made one mistake, Dick.

730
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,115
You got me involved in your little game.

731
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:32,950
(explosion booming)

732
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:36,753
- Huh? Who the hell is
still back there fighting?

733
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,756
- Well, it's a little idea I had.

734
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,325
(explosion booming)

735
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,061
Your little game is over.
- No, not yet!

736
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,230
- Emily!
- Huh?

737
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,470
- Stay right there.
- Emily!

738
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,405
- Huh, home country.
(tense music)

739
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,607
What did my home country ever do for me

740
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,844
except guarantee a screwed
up life from birth?

741
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:04,781
I got to where I was on my own.
They didn't help me at all.

742
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,449
But one day, out of the blue,

743
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,552
they call and tell me that I
have to start spying for them.

744
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:13,156
So for payback, I also
sold the CIA information

745
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:16,660
about the East, information
I had access to as a Yuri.

746
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,095
Neither side had a clue.
(Emily gasps)

747
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,866
And they both paid handsomely.
I even live in Beverly Hills.

748
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,868
In fact, if Daniel hadn't caught on,

749
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,503
I'd still be raking it in.

750
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,371
Such a terrible waste,

751
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,674
but I've decided to quit while I'm ahead.

752
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,242
I'll be taking my hard earned money

753
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,811
and will be retiring
early to a life of ease

754
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,481
where no one, not even you, can get to me.

755
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,621
(both grunting)
(door clattering)

756
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,189
(jetpack whooshing)

757
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,658
- It's locked!
- Emily, move!

758
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,062
(gun firing)

759
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,898
- What is that?

760
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,900
(tense music)

761
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,636
- Get off me! The jetpack
can't carry both of us.

762
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:03,207
- Emily!
- Let go of me, ah!

763
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,115
(Emily screaming)

764
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,785
(Dick grunting)

765
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,928
- She looks like she's okay!
(plane whirring)

766
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,030
- Watch out, it's Douglas!

767
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,933
- Shoot it down!
- It's out of range!

768
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,001
- Emily, run!

769
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,740
(Douglas laughing)

770
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,677
- See what happens when
you set me up? You die!

771
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,279
- Hurry, Emily, shoot that thing already!

772
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,981
(gun firing)

773
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:49,018
- Come on, you can do it!
(gun firing)

774
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,087
- No, I keep missing it!

775
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:56,059
- Hey Dick, you want to fly
on my airplane? (laughs)

776
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,162
Die, Dick! (screams)

777
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,798
(fist thudding)

778
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,136
Too let, it's got jerk seeking missiles!

779
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,145
- Do your best to relax!
Keep your mind clear!

780
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,480
(calming music)

781
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,617
- Relax, create a clear mind.

782
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,553
- A trigger can only reflect your intent.

783
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,990
- Yes, that is true, I
heard those same words

784
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,726
a long, long time ago.
(gun firing)

785
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,129
- No, I missed it. How come?

786
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,832
- If you're worried about
missing it, you will.

787
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,767
Your mind needs to be clear.

788
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,738
Otherwise, the target will be
blocked from your true intent.

789
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,072
- Daniel.

790
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,743

00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,370
- Yeah! She really did it!

800
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,945
- A gun is not supposed
to be a tool for murder.

801
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:24,581
- I'm alive!

802
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,751
No, don't shoot me! Oh god, please!

803
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,821
- It would be a disgrace
to my gun to murder you.

804
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,357
You're not worth it.

805
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:39,629
You're under arrest for murder,
conspiracy, and espionage.

806
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,367
(Dick mumbling indistinctly)

807
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,938
(Dick sighs)

808
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,674
- We did it, the case is over.

809
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,944
- Oh man, this was never
an official CIA job,

810
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,479
so we'll never get paid for it.

811
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,216
No million dollars and
no nookie with Emily.

812
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,285
I never win!

813
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,320
- But at least you got
some souvenirs out of it.

814
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,788
Isn't that right?

815
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,391
- Huh? What do you mean? (screams)

816
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,794
- So these belong to you? You're a jerk!

817
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,697
You went into Emily's room,
dug through all her stuff,

818
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,635
and stole her underwear while
we were captured, didn't you?

819
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,537
- No! I didn't!

820
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,038
It was Douglas, I swear!

821
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,139
(hammer thudding)

822
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,574
- I can't believe after all this

823
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,110
you're still gonna use
your stupid excuses!

824
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:31,682
- (groans) But I'm innocent this time!

825
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,587
(plane whooshing)

826
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:38,856
(cheerful music)

827
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:42,225
- Mr. Saeba, Kaori, thank you so much.

828
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,227
Thanks to you, I was able to find out

829
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,296
what really happened to Daniel.

830
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,531
Once the handcuffs went
on Douglas and Dick,

831
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,668
a chapter in my life came to a close,

832
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,202
and I've made a decision.

833
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,739
I'm going back to my previous
position as an analyst.

834
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,075
Somehow I know my brother feels happy

835
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,845
that I no longer need a
gun to serve my country.

836
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,482
- Check it out, a million bucks!

837
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,984
- You really got it?

838
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,786
- We sure did, for our help

839
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,056
in bringing in both the
double agent and a terrorist.

840
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,291
- Or maybe they're
paying you to keep quiet

841
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,895
about the fact that they
let a Yuri inside the CIA.

842
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,631
- You're just jealous
Falcon, now aren't you?

843
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,533
Do you want it? (meows)

844
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,101
Come on, meow for me.

845
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,936
- Meow.
- Huh?

846
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,438
- This should cover the expense

847
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,607
of cleaning up the horse racing track.

848
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,909
- The expense of cleaning up what?

849
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,911
That place was already trashed!

850
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,113
- But since you made
such a big scene of it,

851
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,048
we need to pay some serious hush money

852
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,683
to keep it out of the press.

853
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,487
- But, but I, I worked so hard.

854
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,156
I risked life and limb
once again, and all I have

855
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:51,729
to show for it is a lousy 10
grand deposit check. (yelps)

856
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,432
Just what the hell do
you think you're doing?

857
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,934
- I'm sure you intend to help pay

858
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,770
for the damage you caused
to the shop windows.

859
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,771
- Hm?

860
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,643
Ah, well, I never said
I wouldn't pay for it,

861
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,878
but no way will it cost 10 grand.

862
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,514
- You also never paid your tab.

863
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,750
- Wait a second, no!

864
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,084
(both shouting over each other)

865
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,653
- Ah! What are you doing?

866
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,321
Ah! Don't touch me there!

867
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,091
(both shouting over each other)

868
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,762
