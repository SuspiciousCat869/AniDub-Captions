What about the drought

Why have these hardships
struck us?

been sighted off the coast.

I never dreamed
such a thing would come to pass.

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:36.498 position:33% line:83% align:start
In ages past,
dragons and men were one.

00:04:36.532 --> 00:04:39.002 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those who lusted after
wealth chose

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:41.771 position:21% line:83% align:start
the land and the sea
and became men.

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:44.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those who cherished
freedom became

00:04:44.808 --> 00:04:47.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
dragons and chose wind and fire.

00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:51.881 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since then, dragons and men
have remained divided.

00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:54.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
To hear the dragons
have been seen,

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:56.451 position:24% line:89% align:start
let alone fighting,

00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:59.488 position:19% line:83% align:start
means the darkness that
threatens us

00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:02.424 position:19% line:89% align:start
is rapidly approaching.

captain to me.

00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:06.763 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wish to hear more of this.

00:05:06.796 --> 00:05:09.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
And, Root, I want you
there as well.

00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:15.138 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:21.711 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was wondering
if you have seen Prince Arren?

00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:24.647 position:10% line:83% align:start
You see, he has not returned
since last night.

00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:26.115 position:24% line:89% align:start
Prince Arren? Gone?

00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:37.493 position:7% line:89% align:start
His Majesty is quite occupied.

00:05:37.527 --> 00:05:39.629 position:16% line:89% align:start
Surely you can see that.

00:05:39.662 --> 00:05:41.131 position:16% line:89% align:start
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:05:41.165 --> 00:05:44.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's just that he's not himself
lately. We were worried.

00:05:44.968 --> 00:05:47.904 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's absurd! Arren is
no longer a boy.

00:05:47.937 --> 00:05:49.973 position:27% line:89% align:start
In fact, he's 17.

00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:53.643 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please forgive this heedless
interruption, Your Majesty.

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:56.981 position:13% line:83% align:start

your undivided attention.

- Yes, lad?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.036 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought you told me that
you're a wizard.

00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:53.103 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:39:54.204 --> 00:39:56.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
You want to know why
a wizard would spend his time

00:39:56.173 --> 00:39:58.208 position:21% line:83% align:start
working in the fields
like a farmer.

00:39:58.242 --> 00:39:59.576 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:00.543 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:40:01.712 --> 00:40:03.213 position:21% line:89% align:start
Listen to me, Arren.

00:40:03.247 --> 00:40:05.749 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything you see
under the sun and stars

00:40:05.783 --> 00:40:08.085 position:19% line:83% align:start
owes its very existence
to the balance.

00:40:09.253 --> 00:40:11.255 position:24% line:89% align:start
The wind and seas.

00:40:11.288 --> 00:40:14.158 position:7% line:89% align:start
The powers of earth and light.

00:40:14.191 --> 00:40:16.093 position:21% line:83% align:start
All that these do is
well and

00:40:16.126 --> 00:40:18.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
rightly done within the
equilibrium.

00:40:20.297 --> 00:40:24.668 position:13% line:83% align:start
But now, men hold the power
to control the world.

00:40:26.236 --> 00:40:29.606 position:16% line:83% align:start
Man must learn to do what
leaf and whale

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.241 position:19% line:89% align:start
and wind do naturally.

00:40:31.276 --> 00:40:33.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
It is for us to keep
the balance.

00:40:34.678 --> 00:40:37.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everything that exists
has its true name.

00:40:37.248 --> 00:40:38.816 position:21% line:83% align:start
The power of magic is
nothing more

00:40:38.849 --> 00:40:39.850 position:16% line:89% align:start
than the power to command

00:40:39.883 --> 00:40:44.255 position:19% line:83% align:start
based on the knowledge
of the thing's true name.

00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:46.191 position:5% line:89% align:start
But use that power irresponsibly

00:40:46.224 --> 00:40:49.026 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the balance of the world
is easily damaged.

00:40:49.059 --> 00:40:52.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
Spells should be made
only when absolutely needed.

00:40:52.596 --> 00:40:54.665 position:7% line:89% align:start
TENAR: You two have been busy.

00:40:54.698 --> 00:40:55.733 position:16% line:89% align:start
From the looks of things,

00:40:55.766 --> 00:40:58.069 position:7% line:83% align:start

00:41:03.707 --> 00:41:05.977 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:41:10.148 --> 00:41:12.250 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:41:12.283 --> 00:41:15.887 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, it seems that one of

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.156 position:7% line:89% align:start
so she's busy nursing it today.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.028 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you want to change places?

00:41:23.061 --> 00:41:24.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, I can do it.

How did it go?

00:41:37.776 --> 00:41:38.977 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's all for today.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.981 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, dinner is nearly ready,
so wash up and come inside.

00:41:45.884 --> 00:41:48.086 position:19% line:83% align:start

What?

00:58:42.844 --> 00:58:45.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
I stabbed him and
then I ran away.

No. My father was a great man.

But I am nothing like that.

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:24.705 position:38% line:89% align:start
What man?

01:07:24.738 --> 01:07:26.440 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sparrowhawk.

01:07:26.473 --> 01:07:28.775 position:10% line:89% align:start
That is to say, the Archmage.

01:07:29.843 --> 01:07:33.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here, drink this. It

The Archmage is more dangerous
than you can ever imagine.

01:08:05.379 --> 01:08:08.448 position:7% line:89% align:start
No. Sparrowhawk is a good man.

01:08:08.482 --> 01:08:11.418 position:24% line:83% align:start
When I needed him,
he was there for me.

01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:12.954 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then tell me this.

01:08:12.987 --> 01:08:16.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did you ever ask yourself
what it is he's seeking?

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:20.327 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

01:08:21.763 --> 01:08:25.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
Eternal life is the only
thing he craves.

01:08:25.633 --> 01:08:28.301 position:7% line:89% align:start
Eternal life? What do you mean?

01:08:29.737 --> 01:08:31.739 position:33% line:83% align:start
You see, the
Archmage stands

01:08:31.773 --> 01:08:33.808 position:30% line:83% align:start
at the pinnacle
of sorcery.

01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:37.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
Except that the secret of
eternal life

01:08:37.411 --> 01:08:38.813 position:21% line:89% align:start
is beyond his grasp.

01:08:39.947 --> 01:08:43.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
And yet, that is what
he covets most.

01:08:43.484 --> 01:08:44.919 position:27% line:89% align:start
But as he covets,

01:08:44.952 --> 01:08:48.589 position:30% line:83% align:start
so does he fear
another will discover it first.

01:08:48.623 --> 01:08:53.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
That would be unbearable to
one so proud as the Archmage.

01:08:53.294 --> 01:08:56.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
And what does all of this
have to do with me?

01:08:56.898 --> 01:08:58.833 position:35% line:89% align:start
Because you

01:08:58.866 --> 01:09:00.735 position:7% line:89% align:start
are the one who has been chosen

01:09:00.768 --> 01:09:04.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
to receive the secret
of life eternal.

01:09:04.572 --> 01:09:07.308 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's the reason Sparrowhawk
follows you,

01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:08.943 position:24% line:83% align:start
because he wants to
kill you.

01:09:08.976 --> 01:09:11.779 position:13% line:89% align:start
He wants to bring me death.

01:09:11.813 --> 01:09:14.348 position:21% line:83% align:start
Arren, I'm asking you
to come with me.

01:09:14.382 --> 01:09:16.350 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've already found it.

01:09:16.384 --> 01:09:18.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
I found the door that
separates us

01:09:18.686 --> 01:09:21.389 position:19% line:83% align:start
from the chasm between
life and death.

01:09:21.422 --> 01:09:24.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
You see, we can open
that door together, you and I.

01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:28.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
And together, we will
live forever.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:31.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
We will conquer every
form of fear and suffering.

01:09:31.432 --> 01:09:33.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
Fear and suffering...

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:39.340 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come with me, Arren.
The face of death is terrible.

01:09:41.342 --> 01:09:44.479 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't want to die.

01:09:46.014 --> 01:09:50.018 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course not. All you need to
do is tell me your true name.

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:53.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then you will finally possess
that which you most desire.

01:09:56.792 --> 01:10:01.029 position:10% line:83% align:start
Come, your true name, Arren.
Tell me what it is.

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:06.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
(STUTTERING) Lebannen.

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:17.012 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, I finally have you,
Sparrowhawk.

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:28.357 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hawk, where are you?

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.328 position:35% line:89% align:start
(GRUNTING)

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.025 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

(PANTING)

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:05.794 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hawk!

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:10.566 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, Therru?

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:15.071 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's Tenar!
They came and took her away!

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.406 position:19% line:83% align:start
They said for you to go
to Cob's castle!

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.975 position:16% line:89% align:start
Therru, what about Arren?

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.576 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's already gone!

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:24.680 position:10% line:83% align:start
He told me that it would come
if he didn't go away!

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:25.982 position:33% line:89% align:start
Cob's doing.

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:28.650 position:16% line:89% align:start
Therru, no need to worry.

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:32.454 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm going there to help Tenar.

01:11:32.487 --> 01:11:34.057 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wait here and I'll be back.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:37.626 position:7% line:89% align:start
Here, I want you to take this.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.095 position:16% line:89% align:start
Arren's going to need it.

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:49.005 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do not leave the farmhouse,
Therru.

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.039 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hee-yah!

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:04.554 position:35% line:89% align:start
Out you go.

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:10.994 position:35% line:83% align:start

Oh...

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
Greetings, Lord Cob.

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:23.473 position:7% line:83% align:start
We brought the woman, My Lord.
Just as you ordered.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:26.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
Excellent work, Hare.
You've done well.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.478 position:16% line:89% align:start
(LAUGHS) It was nothing.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:32.149 position:5% line:83% align:start
The only pleasure I seek in this
life is to serve you, My Lord.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:33.483 position:30% line:89% align:start
Out of my way!

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.451 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch your mouth!

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:37.520 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you responsible for this?

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:39.489 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you want with me?

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.624 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let me go now!

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:44.694 position:21% line:83% align:start
My apologies for the
harsh treatment.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:47.197 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have pressing business
with Sparrowhawk.

01:12:47.231 --> 01:12:49.599 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're a wizard,
isn't that right?

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:52.802 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wizards don't do this sort of
thing. You should be ashamed!

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:55.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you want him, go
find him yourself!

01:12:55.239 --> 01:12:58.508 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's actually
an old acquaintance of mine.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.778 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just thought it would be nice
to see him one more time.

01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
So why bring me here?
To be the bait?

01:13:04.014 --> 01:13:06.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
What are you planning to
do to him?

01:13:06.083 --> 01:13:09.485 position:7% line:89% align:start
Women forever tax my patience.

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:11.956 position:10% line:89% align:start
Put her down in the dungeon.

01:13:11.989 --> 01:13:13.824 position:30% line:89% align:start
My Lord. Do it!

01:13:14.657 --> 01:13:16.592 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait! Answer me!

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:17.995 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm warning you,

01:13:18.028 --> 01:13:22.099 position:19% line:83% align:start
if something happens to
Sparrowhawk, so help me...

01:13:22.132 --> 01:13:24.134 position:38% line:83% align:start
- Arren.
- GUARD: Let's go!

01:13:34.111 --> 01:13:36.513 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come with me, Lebannen.

01:13:36.547 --> 01:13:38.682 position:16% line:83% align:start

for you.

In you go.

01:14:15.753 --> 01:14:17.155 position:13% line:89% align:start
Make yourself comfortable.

01:14:17.188 --> 01:14:20.557 position:7% line:83% align:start
Your wizard will be joining you
down there soon enough.

(LAUGHING)

01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:39.177 position:10% line:89% align:start

Sparrowhawk.

01:14:56.694 --> 01:15:00.198 position:24% line:83% align:start
Cob, are you making
the same mistake again?

01:15:08.373 --> 01:15:09.841 position:30% line:89% align:start
HARE: At ease!

01:15:09.874 --> 01:15:11.342 position:19% line:89% align:start
Any sign of the wizard?

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:13.378 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, not yet, sir.

01:15:13.411 --> 01:15:14.646 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

Hmm.

01:15:25.424 --> 01:15:28.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's him. All right, take
your positions!

Here he comes.

Well, Cob, I'm here.
It's Sparrowhawk.

Cob of Havnor.

Congratulations.

01:16:38.063 --> 01:16:40.866 position:7% line:89% align:start
I came, Cob. Now release Tenar.

You disappoint me, Sparrowhawk.

The great Archmage in all his
glorious power,

01:16:48.507 --> 01:16:49.875 position:24% line:89% align:start
smitten by a woman.

01:16:49.909 --> 01:16:52.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know that you used her
to lure me here.

01:16:52.311 --> 01:16:53.979 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is it you want?

01:16:54.013 --> 01:16:55.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you think I want?

01:16:56.015 --> 01:16:58.384 position:16% line:83% align:start
I haven't forgotten what
you did to me.

01:16:58.417 --> 01:17:01.754 position:21% line:83% align:start
How you dragged me to
the gates of the Dry Land.

01:17:01.787 --> 01:17:03.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
Have you forgotten
the reason why?

01:17:03.989 --> 01:17:05.991 position:10% line:89% align:start
You twisted the Pelnish Lore

01:17:06.025 --> 01:17:08.260 position:19% line:83% align:start
to mock and make sport
of the spirits

01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:10.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the living as well
as the dead.

01:17:10.363 --> 01:17:12.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
Isn't that enough for
you to repent?

01:17:12.898 --> 01:17:14.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
You taught me an
important lesson

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.469 position:7% line:89% align:start
on the border of the Dry Land.

01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:21.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now I know I can never
accept death.

01:17:21.274 --> 01:17:25.978 position:13% line:83% align:start
So I gathered up every book
on ancient lore I could find.

01:17:26.011 --> 01:17:30.950 position:10% line:83% align:start
I regret to say some of their
owners were not cooperative.

01:17:30.983 --> 01:17:34.454 position:7% line:83% align:start
And what are you plotting now,
Cob?

01:17:34.487 --> 01:17:37.424 position:7% line:89% align:start
I have succeeded, Sparrowhawk.

01:17:37.457 --> 01:17:41.027 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've finally woven
the greatest spell of all.

01:17:41.061 --> 01:17:43.997 position:7% line:83% align:start
The door between life and death
has been closed

01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:45.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
since the beginning
of time itself.

01:17:46.032 --> 01:17:48.168 position:16% line:89% align:start
But now I shall open it.

01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:50.470 position:7% line:89% align:start
Opening the door is forbidden.

01:17:50.503 --> 01:17:52.472 position:13% line:89% align:start
Have you finally gone mad?

01:17:52.505 --> 01:17:56.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
Those with power better learn
to wield it with wisdom, Cob.

01:17:56.109 --> 01:17:59.112 position:10% line:83% align:start
Would you destroy the balance
that sustains the world?

01:17:59.145 --> 01:18:00.480 position:35% line:89% align:start
(CHUCKLES)

01:18:00.513 --> 01:18:02.182 position:33% line:89% align:start
What rubbish.

01:18:02.215 --> 01:18:04.951 position:7% line:89% align:start
The balance was gone long ago.

01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:08.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
You would know that
far better than anyone else.

01:18:08.822 --> 01:18:11.157 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was destroyed by man.

01:18:11.191 --> 01:18:17.397 position:10% line:83% align:start
You think you can limit man's
desire? The desire for life?

01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:20.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
Immortality will be mine.

01:18:20.233 --> 01:18:23.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will exist between
time and death.

01:18:23.436 --> 01:18:26.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
Cob, without the cycle
of death and rebirth,

01:18:26.574 --> 01:18:29.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
there can be no life for anyone.
