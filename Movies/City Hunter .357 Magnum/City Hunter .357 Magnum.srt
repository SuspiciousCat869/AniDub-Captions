1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,132
(static crackling)

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,141
(plane whirring)

3
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,732
(tires screeching)

4
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,736
(engines thrumming)

5
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,206
(car horn honking)
(woman shrieking)

6
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,959
(tires squealing)

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,462
- Has your driving actually gotten worse?

8
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,465
- You're the one who told me
to hurry it up, as I recall.

9
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,592
(policeman scoffing)

10
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,178
- You look like you don't
want to do this mission.

11
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,555
- Very observant.

12
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,975
(board clacking)

13
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:04,647
- [Traveler] I don't know if
I can go through with this.

14
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,152
- I guess we're here right on time.

15
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,739
(ominous music)

16
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,828
(doors whirring)

17
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,499
(feet stamping)

18
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,119
- [Passenger] Excuse me, sir.

19
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,470
(chimes ringing)

20
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,597
- You're Mr. Kihliman, right?

21
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,267
We're your escort from
the Metropolitan PD.

22
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,561
- You're pretty careful, aren't you?

23
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,772
- It's going to make me a fortune.

24
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,273
- I don't think the police department

25
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,526
has as much money as you're hoping.

26
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,444
- If the police can't pay,

27
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,613
the government better come through.

28
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,990
This item is worth a healthy sum.

29
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,534
(camera shutters clicking)

30
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,494
- Statement with the press.
- Question.

31
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,288
- Over here, over here.
- Hey, I said clear out.

32
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,332
Enough's enough, and no pictures.

33
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,583
- Just one question.
- Grandpa, don't worry.

34
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,835
I will be fine.

35
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,837
- Now you just be quiet.

36
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,964
And you can take any pictures you need

37
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,341
at the reception tomorrow.

38
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,635
- What, is she a movie star or something?

39
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,347
- She is Nina Shutenberg
from West Galiera.

40
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,266
The piano wunderkind.

41
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,101
- Oh.

42
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,184
I would have never guessed

43
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,978
that your interests were so varied.

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,272
How impressive that your expertise extends

45
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,274
to the entertainment industry.

46
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,859
- Nina is high art.

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,112
Your culture will benefit from her visit.

48
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
- Ah.

49
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,948
You're just too kind.

50
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,076
- Let's get going, shall we?

51
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,203
(gun firing)

52
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,665
(Kihliman shrieking)

53
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,750
(briefcase clattering)

54
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,170
(man grunting)
(thrilling music)

55
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,421
- After him.

56
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,547
- No, forget him.

57
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,549
Protect me, dammit.

58
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,426
(gun firing)

59
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,345
(bullet whistling)

60
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,513
(body thudding)

61
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,348
- [Bystander] Oh my god.

62
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,808
- [Sandra] Kihliman, Mr. Kihliman.

63
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,685
- What's happened?

64
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,852
What's that noise?

65
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,061
(bystanders chattering)

66
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,062
- What's happening?

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,696
- Someone call for a doctor.

68
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,203
(explosion booming)
(crowd screaming)

69
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,123
(glass shattering)

70
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,417
What the hell?

71
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,883
(alarm ringing)
(people groaning)

72
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:41,971
- Damn.

73
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,889
Nina, where are you?

74
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,309
(rock music)

75
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,192
(brakes squealing)

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,365
- Quite admirable, Colonel Helzen.

77
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,659
- Save the compliments.

78
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,868
Let's go.

79
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,797

80
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,217

81
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,739

85
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,539
- Hey, did you find one yet?
- No, I don't see any.

86
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,750
- [Kaori] You should look more carefully.

87
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,960
- [Joe] I am looking carefully.

88
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,337
- [Kaori] You missed some, didn't you?

89
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,547
- No, I haven't missed any.

90
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,049
Don't let it get you down.

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,385
I'm sure we'll get a job tomorrow.

92
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,261
- How can you be so optimistic?

93
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,846
We're in the middle of the worst streak

94
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,264
in our entire history.

95
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,810
We haven't had any clients
now for 48 straight days.

96
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,894
- Huh, that long?

97
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,354
Are you serious?

98
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,607
- I'm always serious when
it comes to business.

99
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,861
(congratulatory music)

100
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,573
- A new record is cause for celebration.

00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,327
(Kaori groaning)

102
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,954
- Is your cat lost?

103
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,539
Is your wallet missing?

104
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,083
Please come to us if you
have any mystery to solve.

105
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,544
Any job is okay.

106
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,004
Our marker quality is XYZ.

107
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,757
Here, sir.

108
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,925
Learn more about the Saeba Agency.

109
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,176
Perfect service.

110
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,594
Speedy solutions.

111
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,180
You can depend on us.

112
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,225
- Just crumple me up and step all over me.

113
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,185
- Hi, Joe.

114
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,395
Long time, no see.

115
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,481
So, can I be your new client?

116
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,316
- Wow.

117
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,234
Of course, Reika.

118
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,276
I would do anything for you.

119
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,820
- Not a chance.

120
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,655
- Oh, why not?

121
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,865
Says here you're looking for clients.

122
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,491
- We wouldn't work for our worst enemy

123
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,410
even if we were starving to death.

124
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,703
- I'm not your enemy.

125
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,914
I'm just a woman who works
under the same covers.

126
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:41,960
Look, Joe, I'm so overloaded right now.

127
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,587
Don't you want to work with me?

128
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,547
- So, you've finally decided

129
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,799
that you need me to be your partner.

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,594
- Yes, in every sense of the word.

131
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,720
(Joe shrieking)

132
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,222
- Let's have our first
meeting at the hotel.

133
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,265
(Joe grunting)

134
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,059
- Why there, at the hotel?

135
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,103
- At the hotel, we would
strengthen our relationship

136
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,023
with special team-building exercises.

137
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,109
- You and I still haven't done
any team-building exercises.

138
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,862
- [Joe And Reika] Oh.

139
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,032
- No.

140
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,366
I won't let her be our client.

141
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,701
I'm going home.

142
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,330
- So, you and Kaori haven't
laid much groundwork.

143
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,625
Then maybe I can still
lure you away from her.

144
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,710
Call me up anytime.

145
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,254
- Call you for nookie?

146
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,506
- No.

147
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,133
But maybe if you help me.

148
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,178
(Reika giggling)

149
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,639
(Joe chuckling)

150
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,142
(Joe sobbing)

151
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,271
(bell dinging)

152
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,814
- Falcon, darling, you're
looking dapper today.

153
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,983
That tie really suits you.

154
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,027
- Why don't you disappear?

155
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,404
- You always talk that
way to your customers?

156
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,073
Woo.

157
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,199
With service like that,

158
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,244
it's no wonder the place is so empty.

159
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,622
Garcon, bring me a cup of coffee.

160
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,582
- Would you like that
poured over your head

161
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,292
or down your pants maybe?

162
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,586
- Oh, let me think.

163
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,587
Hm.

164
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,050
Do I actually see evidence
of a paying customer in here?

165
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,635
- Your partner.
- What's she doing

166
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,012
now that's gotten herself all wired?

167
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,138
- Learning to kill.

168
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,057
She's downstairs with Micky.

169
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,058
- Hm.

170
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,228
(gears whirring)

171
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,648
(gun firing)

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,234
- Wow.

173
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,442
You're incredible, Micky.

174
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,319
All of your shots hit dead center.

175
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,197
- Oh come on, it's nothing.

176
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,035
(bullets clattering)

177
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,581
Why don't you give it a try, Kaori?

178
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,582
- Oh, no, no, no.

179
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,125
I'm no good at shooting.

180
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,377
- You look mad, and
this is an excellent way

181
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,087
to blow off some steam.

182
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,422
- Huh?

183
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,048
Hm.

184
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,759
Yeah, let me give it a try.

185
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,885
- [Micky] Here.

186
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,886
- [Kaori] Thanks.

187
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,019
(Kaori grunting)

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,353
(Joe shouting)

189
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,396
- Nookie.

190
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,606
- I'll give you some nookie,

191
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,358
right in your little pixie stick.

192
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,110
Take that and that.

193
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,486
You want a piece of me?

194
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,322
(Kaori yelling)

195
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,198
- She's not in a good mood today.

196
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,743
- Yeah well, she shoots better unhappy.

197
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,578
- Hm.

198
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,620
- You wouldn't know a real woman

199
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,538
if she sent you her panties for Christmas.

200
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,956
- Listen to that.

201
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,626
It sounds like she's
closing in on the target.

202
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,045
- Got any interest in
serving me my coffee?

203
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,005
- Huh?

204
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,422
Oh.

205
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,467
- And it's not always
that time of the month.

206
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,635
(Kaori screaming)

207
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,137
- Well, it looks like
you've been giving her a lot

208
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,307
of material to work
with, you little pervert.

209
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,142
- Yeah?

210
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,310
My nookie's less perverted
than your coffee.

211
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,896
- Time to neuter Joe.

212
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,648
(gun firing)

213
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,732
(Kaori grunting)

214
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,567
- Bullseye.

215
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,985
That was fantastic, Kaori.

216
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,820
- Huh?

217
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,029
I did it, really?

218
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,405
I don't believe it.

219
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,907
(bell ringing)

220
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,076
- Hm?
- Hm?

221
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,411
(Joe shrieking)

222
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm in love.

223
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,665
(Nina gasping)

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,249
You must be an angel.

225
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,210
And I must have died and gone to heaven.

226
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,171
Should we go back to your cloud or mine?

227
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,132
- Are you City Hunter, perchance?

228
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,842
(Joe groaning)

229
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,095
- And who are you?

230
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,513
Huh?

231
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,015
- Would you play this tape?

232
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,769
(water bubbling)

233
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,650
(piano music)

234
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,490
(violin music)

235
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,325
- Hm.

236
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,119
- That music.

237
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,541
(violin music)

238
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,988
- [Kaori] I feel so much better.

239
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,782
Thank you, Micky.
- You're welcome.

240
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,826
- I would really love to come back.

241
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,536
- Sure, any time.

242
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,537
- I didn't know you were here.

243
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,707
- Long time no see, Mr. Saeba.

244
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,667
(cup clattering)

245
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,210
- Did something bad happen to Maki?

246
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,837
- Maki, Maki Himoro?

247
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,839
You mean the daughter of Chief Himoro?

248
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,674
- Yes.

249
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,341
I am her good friend, Nina.

250
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,636
Maki and I knew each other
well during our time in Vienna.

251
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,014
May I assume that you're Mr. Ijuin?

252
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,851
(Falcon groaning)

253
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,188
(Joe laughing)

254
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,314
(table banging)

255
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,149
- The darn name.

256
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,400
I almost forgot all about it.

257
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,943
- Shut up!

258
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,945
- I'm sorry, but did I say something

259
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,781
I shouldn't have just now?

260
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,452
- No, just (coughing) call me Falcon.

261
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,370
- Huh?

262
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,662
Ah.

263
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,457
- Excuse me, but are you Nina Shutenberg?

264
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,293
Who won the Chopin Competition?

265
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,212
- That's right.

266
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,171
I just arrived in Japan today.

267
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,923
I will play several concerts here

268
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,258
beginning the day after tomorrow.

269
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,260
(piano music)

270
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:28,264
Maki is doing superbly at
the national music school.

271
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,767
She must practice quite
diligently every day,

272
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,102
but she always remains cheerful.

273
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,021
I've heard that both Falcon

274
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,732
and Mr. Saeba work as private detectives?

275
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,192
- Private detectives.

276
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:43,072
Uh, well, I guess it's
something like that.

277
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,199
You didn't come all the way here

278
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,577
just to give a report about Maki, did you?

279
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,496
- I talked to Maki,

280
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,998
and she told me that I should
ask Falcon and Mr. Saeba.

281
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,293
There's something I need to find.

282
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,128
- [Joe] Hm.

283
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,420
- [Falcon] Hm?

284
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,550
- I was told that my father
had died before I was born,

285
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,053
but I learned that he
might still be alive.

286
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,472
My mother was also a pianist,

287
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,183
but she died five years
ago due to illness.

288
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,978
Before she passed away,
she said something to me.

289
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,732
She said, \"Your father is
alive, and he is in Japan.\"

290
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,652
But I've never seen his name or face.

291
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,989
I had asked my grandpa,
who's working as my manager.

292
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,950
All he told me is that my father died.

293
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,536
This is the only clue I have.

294
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,707
This pendant of my mother's.

295
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,753
- [Joe] J to S.

296
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,007
- S stands for Sophia, my mother's name.

297
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,428
- So his first initial is our
only clue to his identity.

298
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,847
- I know, it's ridiculous.

299
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,140
(Nina gasping)

300
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,725
- It's not ridiculous.

301
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,767
I have some friends over

302
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,312
at the police department
that owe me some favors.

303
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,855
I don't anticipate any trouble

304
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,440
at all looking for your father.

305
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,234
So, why don't we wait for
the good news at my office?

306
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,195
Now, let's go.
- Wait.

307
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,114
- Hey, Joe, wait a sec.

308
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:08,949
Dammit.

309
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,950
- So, what are you up to?

310
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,785
- I'm going.

311
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,413
If something happens to Nina,
Maki wouldn't forgive me.

312
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,998
- Wow, sounds fun.

313
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,708
I'm gonna go with you.

314
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,461
(bird chirping)

315
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,839
(glass shattering)

316
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,426
(man grunting)

317
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,137
- What is your explanation
for this crap, Helzen?

318
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,681
We assassinated Kihliman
in order to get this thing,

319
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,391
and this is all we got?

320
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,937
- I obeyed the orders that you
gave me, Ambassador Bondal.

321
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,313
Quite simple.

322
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,564
- But you told me that Kihliman

323
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,441
might be selling classified information

324
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,945
about our activity in the Far
East region to the police.

325
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,529
- I also reported to you

326
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,949
that I didn't think a
careful man like Kihliman

327
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,160
would carry important
information like that by himself.

328
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,746
He was, by no means, a stupid man.

329
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,498
(Bondal scoffing)

330
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,084
- But who ordered you to murder him?

331
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,502
(Helzen exhaling)

332
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,129
- He placed a small but
extremely powerful bomb

333
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,215
in a trash can by the flight gate.

334
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,968
Had I let him live, he
would claim the explosion

335
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,929
was an assassination
attempt by East Galiera.

336
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,598
That would give him leverage
to exchange the information

337
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,142
for an even higher price.

338
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,688
Did you intend to take
responsibility for that?

339
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,106
(Bondal growling)

340
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,941
- But if the Metropolitan
Police Department

341
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,568
gets that information,
you're also going down.

342
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,863
It won't be only me.

343
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,615
- You don't need to worry about it.

344
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,283
The Metropolitan Police Department

345
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,619
has not yet acquired the information.

346
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,454
- They haven't?

347
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,372
Where is it, then?

348
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,872
- You leave things to us.

349
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,042
This is an intelligence
operation from now on.

350
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,378
And please advise your Mr. Gunther

351
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,756
that he is no longer
essential to the mission.

352
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,762
- That fool.

353
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,388
His confidence will do him in.

354
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,140
People call him the Red Grim Reaper,

355
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,184
but he is just a murder machine.

356
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,687
- My thoughts exactly.

357
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,273
- I won't let him take
all the credit himself.

358
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,734
We have to do something.

359
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,777
Keep an eye on Helzen.

360
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,155
We'll let him find the information.

361
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,783
Hm, then we'll step in and finish the job.

362
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,784
- Hm.

363
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,877
(newspaper rustling)

364
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,338
- Colonel Helzen, how was the meeting?

365
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,176
- Kihliman didn't have
the information with him.

366
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,970
- New ambassadors are usually
too eager for success.

367
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,265
He moved without fully
considering his actions.

368
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,185
- Did you find out who
Kihliman may have contacted?

369
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,021
- Yes, he contacted Klaus Shutenberg

370
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,815
who is the manager of Nina Shutenberg.

371
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,693
They are from West Galiera.

372
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,612
- Did you say Shutenberg?

373
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,447
- Yes.

374
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,741
Our personnel are busy uncovering
more detailed information.

375
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,243
I expect their report soon.

376
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,453
- I see.

377
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,247
Klaus Shutenberg, finally.

378
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,209
(car horn honking)

379
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,335
(siren wailing)

380
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,962
- Joe, there's no way I
can make time for that.

381
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,423
I've already got one huge
screw-up on my hands,

382
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,591
and it's giving me a headache.

383
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,301
There's just too much going on.

384
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,346
Sorry, but I can't help you now.

385
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,847
- But you owe me!

386
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,725
Well then, I guess I'll
just come over tonight

387
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,102
for some payback.

388
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,771
- You know what, I'm
not feeling well today.

389
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,232
But we could get Reika
to help you tonight.

390
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,400
She'd love to work with you late at night.

391
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,361
I mean, like with the investigation.

392
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,656
- That may be, but she
told me her schedule

393
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,616
was even busier than yours.

394
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,327
Can you guarantee that she'll help me?

395
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,912
- Absolutely.

396
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,247
And if you don't come over tonight,

397
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,541
you can add two special nookie sessions

398
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,127
to the all-night nookathon
that I already owe you.

399
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,504
Bye.

400
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,007
(Sandra sighing)

401
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,052
(officers grunting)

402
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,722
I am available for parties too.

403
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,267
(Sandra laughing)

404
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,268
(Sandra sighing)

405
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,269
I hate myself.

406
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,396
(bright music)

407
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,231
- Hey, Nina.
- Uh, yes?

408
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,024
- I promise that I'll find your father.

409
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,278
So why don't you relax
and spend the night here?

410
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,822
- You're being completely
stupid and ridiculous.

411
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,658
A celebrity like Nina
won't want to stay with us.

412
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,912
- Uh, well, actually, if it's
okay with the two of you,

413
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,081
I would like to stay here for a night.

414
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:27,916
- [Kaori] What?

415
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,126
But-
- Yeah, baby!

416
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,172
Another one snared by
the City Hunter, Joe.

417
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,007
Woo, woo, how lucky I am.

418
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,594
Nookie magnet, yeah, baby!

419
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,765
- [Kaori] Nina wanted
to try Japanese food,

420
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,726
so I put a little something together.

421
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,935
Hope you enjoy it.

422
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,563
- You made tempura and sashimi?

423
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,856
It looks wonderful.

424
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,733
Kaori, you must be an amazing cook.

425
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,319
- Amazing at displaying
food from the restaurant.

426
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,154
(bell dinging)

427
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,821
- You sure have a big mouth, don't you?

428
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,114
- Very sorry.

429
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,617
- Well, please enjoy your dinner.

430
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,993
- I'm sure I will.

431
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,786
Thank you very much.

432
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,787
Oh.

433
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,797
That's really good.

434
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,633
- Thanks.

435
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,674
I'm glad you like it.

436
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,093
Please, have all you want.

437
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,431
(Falcon munching)

438
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,101
(Falcon spitting)

439
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,185
- One more, please.

440
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,020
- [Kaori] Sure.

441
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,897
- Hey, Falcon, you really
shouldn't eat so much.

442
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,025
Aren't you ashamed of being
such an infamous leech?

443
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,694
- Oh yes, while we're on
the subject of leeches,

444
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,656
you haven't paid for a meal in years.

445
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,241
Right?
- Hm.

446
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,742
(Kaori sighing)

447
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,785
(Kaori laughing)

448
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,161
- Please eat as much as
you can, both of you.

449
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,413
Here you go, Falcon.

450
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,623
- [Nina Voiceover] I
wonder if I'll be able

451
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,875
to trust them or not.

452
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,796
Mr. Saeba seems unreliable.

453
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,924
Falcon looks scary.

454
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,009
Oh no.

455
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,429
Why is it that Maki had to set
me up with people like this?

456
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,515
- Nina.
- Oh, yes?

457
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,684
- Don't know how to
use chopsticks, do you?

458
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,811
Let me teach you how to use them.

459
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,187
- Oh, no, thank you.

460
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,522
I can do it by myself.

461
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,357
- Don't be shy.

462
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,316
Come on.
(Nina shrieking)

463
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,733
Wow, look what I did.

464
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,778
Let me clean those for you.

465
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,488
(Kaori growling)

466
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,948
- Your face isn't a washcloth!

467
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,783
(Joe screaming)

468
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,410
(wall banging)

469
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,494
Oh, that might stain.

470
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,495
You need to change.

471
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,122
- But is Mr. Saeba all right?

472
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,248
- Oh, don't worry.

473
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,791
I do that a couple of times a day.

474
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,792
Come on.

475
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,380
(Joe grunting)

476
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,260
(Joe giggling)

477
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,430
- Do you think they're
safe alone like that?

478
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,265
- Yeah.

479
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,182
Kaori's with them.

480
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,142
- I guess they'll be okay.

481
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,102
(groovy music)

482
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,645
- Here.

483
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,938
I hope these fit you.

484
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,773
- Oh, thank you.

485
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,650
I'm sure they will do just fine.

486
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,570
(Joe chuckling)

487
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,113
(Joe laughing)

488
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,865
- Oh, and the guest
room is right next door.

489
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,160
It's now or never.

490
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,703
Ha.

491
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,499
(Joe giggling)
(harp music)

492
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Wha?

493
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,961
- Huh?

494
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,962
- Hm.

495
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,798
Think you're so smart, do you?

496
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,969
(Joe laughing)

497
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,435
(chimes ringing)

498
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,105
What the heck is that?

499
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,525
(gun firing)

500
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,444
Okay.

501
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,112
Maybe it's good she's a lousy shot.

502
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,822
- [Kaori] Do the clothes fit?

503
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,574
- Yes, the waist is a little bigger,

504
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,160
but the length of the pants is perfect.

505
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,953
The chest is a bit tight.

506
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,872
(Kaori laughing)

507
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,956
- [Kaori] Of course it is.

508
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,085
- Um, Kaori, would you
mind if I used your shower?

509
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,420
I wish to clean up from traveling.

510
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,671
- Oh, of course.

511
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,256
Go right ahead.

512
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,383
(Kaori groaning)

513
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,802
I must, I must, I must increase my bust.

514
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,887
The bigger the better.

515
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,477
Here, take this.

516
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,396
- Um, do you-

517
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,605
- Oh, don't you worry about Joe.

518
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,023
I'll be right by the door.

519
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,859
You'll be completely safe
from perverts and intruders.

520
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,736
- Thank you.

521
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,447
(dramatic music)

522
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,076
(Joe chuckling)

523
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,912
- I'm still the smoothest ever.

524
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,748
(Joe gasping)

525
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,378
She's so beautiful through
the glass like a museum piece.

526
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,049
Ah, time to see her with the naked eye.

527
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,640
(Joe gulping)

528
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,730
Nina.
(Nina gasping)

529
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,190
What's a nice girl like you doing

530
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,819
in a wet, blue-tiled place like this?

531
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,488
(Nina screaming)

532
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,408
- You creep!

533
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,536
(hammer banging)

534
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,831
I know you think I have a
flat chest and a big butt.

535
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,791
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

536
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,418
- What the hell are you babbling about?

537
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,670
Are you insane?

538
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,841
I promise I won't do it again.

539
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,884
Please forgive me.

540
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,178
- He looks pretty safe to me now.

541
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,015
(engine whirring)

542
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,642
- Nina, please help me.

543
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,436
Please let me go.

544
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,440
(doorknob rattling)

545
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,902
(door clattering)

546
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,903
- Hm.

547
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,616
Kaori, I'm done with the shower.

548
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,659
Where did she go?

549
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,580
(insects chirping)

550
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,841
(Nina gasping)

551
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,926
Mother?

552
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,720
(piano music)

553
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,971
- Huh?

554
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,515
- Ah, Kaori.

555
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,891
I'm sorry.

556
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,018
You looked very much like my mother

557
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,020
from behind just a moment ago.

558
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,063
- What?

559
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,147
(Kaori laughing)

560
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,357
Someone mistook me for a man once,

561
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,027
but this is the first time
to be taken for a mother.

562
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,403
- That's not what I meant.

563
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,738
- What?

564
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,574
- Every time I asked about my father,

565
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,536
she would turn her back to me
and look through the window

566
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,537
at the moon.

567
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,376
I'm sure that my mother loved my father,

568
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,463
but then, something happened between them.

569
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,174
She was very upset, and then he left.

570
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,175
Oh, what am I saying?

571
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,260
She has passed on.

572
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,761
It doesn't make sense.

573
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,264
I'm so sorry I saw you as my mother.

574
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,307
- Well, uh...

575
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,186
- Tell me, Kaori, you
love Mr. Saeba, don't you?

576
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,022
- How could I love someone
as perverted as him?

577
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,400
Our partnership is strictly business.

578
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,859
- You're better off that way.

579
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,611
He's quite ridiculous.

580
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,864
I've never met anyone quite so perverted.

581
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,535
(Nina giggling)

582
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,869
- Naked men make you laugh.

583
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,705
How cute.

584
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,539
- Sorry.

585
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,081
I couldn't help it.

586
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,501
But while I was remembering
all the silly things he did,

587
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,794
I just couldn't stop myself

588
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,672
from laughing at the whole thing.

589
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,008
- He may seem silly and spontaneous,

590
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,011
but he plans that stuff
out weeks in advance.

591
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,262
- Um, Kaori?

592
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,806
- Anyway, now I'm thinking
it's not such a good idea

593
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,349
for you to stay over.

594
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,226
- Oh, no.

595
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:47,062
Deep down, I think he's actually
an all right kind of guy.

596
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,982
- Is it all right to
make love to a window?

597
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,817
(Nina shrieking)

598
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,651
- Mr. Saeba.

599
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,570
- Haven't you learned anything yet?

600
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,365
(glass shattering)
(Joe screaming)

601
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,201
(explosion booming)

602
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:06,207
- Don't you think you might
be overreacting just a little?

603
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,835
- An ancient Japanese proverb
says the clever play hooky

604
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,503
as the week seek nookie.

605
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,256
- I'm clever enough to know this is wrong.

606
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,634
I'm going back to my hotel now.

607
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,638
(car horns honking)

608
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,810
(phone ringing)

609
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,896
- Did you find Nina?

610
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,938
Hello?

611
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,649
- [Nina] It's me, Grandpa.

612
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,484
- Nina.

613
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,276
I was so terribly concerned.

614
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,903
- I'm sorry to make you worry about me,

615
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,446
Grandpa, but I'm all right.

616
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,365
There was just something I had to do

617
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,991
as soon as we got to Japan.

618
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,826
- Like what?

619
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,329
You have a piano here, and that is all.

620
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,706
- I am trying to locate my father.

621
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,707
- Your what?

622
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,001
Your father.

623
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,461
Oh, Nina.

624
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,630
What would make you do
something like this?

625
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,215
You need to get your rest.

626
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,426
You have a reception tomorrow,
and then, all the concerts.

627
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,388
- Don't be concerned about me, Grandpa.

628
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,973
I'm on my way to the hotel.

629
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,974
Yes.

630
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,523
(Klaus sighing)

631
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,234
- She wants to find her father.

632
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,235
Idiot.

633
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,654
I should have known that

634
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,031
coming to Japan would be a disaster.

635
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,825
(door knocking)

636
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,076
Who's there?

637
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,536
- [Man] Room service.

638
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,829
- Room service?

639
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,040
I didn't order anything from room service.

640
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,711
Huh?

641
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,087
Who the hell are you?

642
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,634
- I realized that I would need
to get away from my grandpa

643
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,345
in order to start the
search for my father.

644
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,848
I knew that if he found
out I was interested,

645
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,225
he wouldn't let me leave the hotel room.

646
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,226
(Kaori laughing)

647
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,019
- And after all that, all
you have to show for it

648
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,980
is a day of being hit on by Joe.

649
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,565
Sorry, Nina.

650
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,400
- No.

651
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,109
I should have known.

652
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,445
I should have known it
was going to be impossible

653
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,407
to find my father with just a
stupid little clue like that.

654
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,703
I just, I couldn't stop
myself from trying.

655
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,163
- It's all right.

656
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,332
(insects chirping)

657
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,252
- You kidnapped me so we
could go for a stroll?

658
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,005
- I just want you to
meet someone over there.

659
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:18,840
(Klaus scoffing)

660
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
- Meet someone?

661
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,968
(car whirring)

662
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,805
(tires squealing)

663
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,557
- Grandpa, where are you going?

664
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,392
- Huh?
- Huh?

665
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,226
No.

666
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,102
- Lie to her.

667
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,396
- Nina, I will be right back.

668
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,731
- All right.

669
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,941
(tense music)

670
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,234
- Wait a second.

671
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,322
(rock music)
(both grunting)

672
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,617
What are you gonna do now, huh?

673
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,452
(Kaori giggling)

674
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,244
I forgot about the gun.

675
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,163
- Keep your mouth shut.

676
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,958
I guess we will all attend
this meeting together.

677
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,294
- I don't think so.
- Joe.

678
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,338
- [Nina] Mr. Saeba.

679
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,673
- [Joe] You see, Nina's dance card

680
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,717
is already filled this evening.

681
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,053
- Hm, except I'm the DJ.

682
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,848
You don't seem to
understand the situation.

683
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,060
- If you're gonna shoot
me, you'd better do it now.

684
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,228
- Right.

685
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,522
- Mr. Saeba, don't.

686
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,275
(dramatic music)

687
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,697
- [Nina Voiceover] He's so
different than he was before.

688
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,866
What kind of man is he?

689
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,994
- Can you shoot, or is
that gun just for fashion?

690
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,080
- That does it.

691
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,790
(gun firing)

692
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,625
But how?

693
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,793
How did you fire so quickly?

694
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,586
- I drink a lot of coffee.

695
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,631
Well now, it doesn't seem
like your motive was robbery.

696
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,716
Why don't you start explaining?

697
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,552
(gun cocking)

698
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,094
Huh?

699
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,262
- Joe, he's getting away.

700
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,138
- Don't move, I'll get him.

701
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,850
(ominous music)

702
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,561
- Colonel Helzen, I apologize.

703
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,354
- We'll discuss it later.

704
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,441
- Yes.
(dramatic music)

705
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:14,413
(Helzen grunting)
(jeep whirring)

706
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,250
(tires squealing)

707
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,006
(Helzen grunting)

708
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,720
- City Hunter and Falcon, yes.

709
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,393
- I think they're gone.

710
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,103
- Well, that was pretty close,

711
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,730
but I don't hear you saying thank you.

712
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,149
- Ah, that's 'cause I didn't need you.

713
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,735
And besides, why do you
think you had to follow me?

714
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,194
- Hm, 'cause in this neighborhood,

715
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,447
hormones like yours have to be on a leash.

716
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,282
- What was that?

717
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,283
Why you, hey, ah.

718
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,161
- And just what the hell
were you doing here?

719
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,330
(Joe shrieking)

720
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,206
- My superior detective skills

721
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,208
told me that this kind
of incident would happen.

722
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,211
So I hid in the back of your
car so I could look after Nina.

723
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,963
- Nina.
- Hm?

724
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,673
- We're going back to the hotel.

725
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,217
- Grandfather.
- Hey, Nina, wait up.

726
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,178
Wait up.

727
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,471
You're obviously in some kind of danger.

728
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,348
I can be your bodyguard.

729
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,183
You know?

730
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,726
(tense music)
- Hm.

731
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,520
(car horns honking)

732
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,105
- That man is a professional.

733
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,815
Do you know why he'd be after you?

734
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,651
- No, I don't.

735
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,943
Now leave us alone.

736
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,028
- Grandpa.
- Sir, I don't think we're

737
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,073
going anywhere until we've
heard a proper explanation.

738
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,741
- Ha, do what you like.

739
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,868
I'm going to bed now.

740
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,954
- But our guests.

741
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,914
- You should retire to bed as well.

742
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,750
You have a reception tomorrow.

743
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,961
- I'm sorry, everybody.

744
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,921
My grandfather can be stubborn.

745
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,215
- Ah, you don't need to apologize.

746
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,217
So, Falcon, check this out.

747
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,052
- Hm?

748
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,636
- I don't really wanna
waste my whole evening

749
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,930
sitting around here, and
I know you don't, right?

750
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,683
So, I've got these two matches here.

751
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,519
The guy who pulls the red
one has to stay here tonight.

752
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,895
Go ahead.

753
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,896
Pick one.

754
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,442
Lucky you, you get to leave.

755
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,361
I guess I have to stay.

756
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,446
- Now I'm supposed to
pull one for you, right?

757
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,281
- You don't need to.

758
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,116
The game's over.

759
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:15,242
No, no, no, don't, look.

760
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,493
- You won too.

761
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,078
I'm very happy for you.

762
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,413
- Huh, I did?

763
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,498
Get this, they broke off in my hand.

764
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,751
What do you say we try that one more time?

765
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,044
- Have a nice evening.

766
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,671
Falcon and I will keep watch tonight.

767
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,340
Am I making myself clear?

768
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,843
- Yes, ma'am.

769
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,385
I guess there's nothing I can do

770
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,303
since you saw through my trick.

771
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,472
I'm going home.

772
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,434
- Hm, you have got to be kidding me.

773
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,020
(wolf howling)

774
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,857
- Ah, so Helzen intended
to meet with Shutenberg.

775
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,985
When he sees Klaus again,
that will be the time.

776
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,528
I'm sure of it.

777
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,696
Then, you go.

778
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,531
- Mm.

779
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,157
I will take care of them.

780
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,075
Just leave it to me.

781
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,077
(car whirring)

782
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,914
(tires squealing)

783
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,880
- Such a completely unexpected surprise,

784
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,965
and at this very late hour.

785
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,384
- I have a little undercover investigation

786
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,928
that you'd be perfect for.

787
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,099
- Ah, damn soundproof doors.

788
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,225
I can't hear them.

789
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,269
- And you'll be well compensated.

790
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,396
I'm not like Sandra.

791
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:30,525
- I haven't had any problems
lately with my cash flow.

792
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,235
- You're very lucky.

793
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,487
Money is very important,

794
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,280
but it's not the answer to everything.

795
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,365
Love makes all things possible.

796
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:41,495
So I'm willing to pay you
in nookie certificates.

797
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,038
- Really?

798
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,291
Then why don't we stop at
the hotel bar for a cocktail

799
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,794
and start this assignment off right?

800
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,545
- You read my mind.

801
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,714
(Kaori growling)

802
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,091
Hi, Kaori.

803
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,134
- Sleeping with the enemy?

804
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,469
Traitor!

805
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,138
(hammer banging)

806
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,724
- I just remembered I
have another appointment.

807
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,184
See you, Joe.

808
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,103
- Oh, Kaori, you're so kind and beautiful.

809
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,229
Please let me down.

810
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,605
It's cold out here.

811
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,856
I'm gonna freeze to death.

812
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,108
I was just there to spy on her.

813
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,442
You know I'd never betray you.

814
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,443
Oh, Kaori!

815
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,323
(soft rock music)

816
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,202
(Joe sneezing)

817
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,831
- You'll never get nookie
with snot on your face.

818
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,333
- Yeah, well please excuse
me for catching a cold

819
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,002
while hanging around
naked outside all night.

820
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,171
- It was your own damn fault.

821
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,299
(singing in foreign language)

822
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,135
- What are you doing?

823
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,593
This is the drop-off zone.

824
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,636
- Can you park the car?

825
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,388
I have to do something about this cold.

826
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,891
I'll meet you inside after
I find some medicine.

827
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,894
- And again with the lousy acting.

828
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,147
How about that?

829
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,983
- Thanks, Kaori.

830
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,276
Take your time.

831
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,528
Oh, Nina, Nina.

832
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,115
(Joe giggling)

833
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,621
(ominous music)

834
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,713
(ominous chimes ringing)

835
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,974
(ominous chimes ringing)

836
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:37,110
- So, are you interested
in taking a boyfriend?

837
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,613
- Sandra, what a pleasant surprise.

838
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,655
- Thanks.

839
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,449
My investigation of Kihliman's murder

840
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,409
has led me straight to this man.

841
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,494
- Can you tell me what you know about him?

842
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,206
- Colonel Johann Frederiech von Helzen

843
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,167
of the Intelligence
Agency of East Galiera.

844
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,961
He's affectionately
called the Red Grim Reaper

845
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:58,673
and is rumored to have quite
an impressive array of talents.

846
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,551
He might even be more
than a match for you.

847
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,386
(Joe chuckling)

848
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,597
- Then I would say you're badly
underestimating my talent.

849
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,726
My nookie would never lose to
some middle-age mustached man.

850
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,937
- Ah, silly me.

851
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,022
I thought we were talking about fighting.

852
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,816
(phone ringing)

853
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,526
- [Klaus] What the hell are you doing?

854
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,028
There are important people waiting.

855
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,114
- [Nina] All right, I'll be right there.

856
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,660
- Nina.

857
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,620
- Mr. Saeba.

858
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,205
(wood crashing)

859
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,750
My grandfather is waiting
for me, so see you later.

860
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,127
- So you're still here, huh?

861
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,255
- I've been here all
night, and I'm going home.

862
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,049
You take over guard duty.

863
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,009
- Falcon, hey.

864
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,386
Hey, come on.

865
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,387
Falcon.

866
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,517
- [Klaus Voiceover] Any day now.

867
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,060
What the hell is she doing?

868
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,897
I never understand why
women are like this.

869
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,567
(Klaus gasping)

870
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,193
- How nice to see you, Klaus.

871
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,611
- Wait, I know you.

872
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,654
Helzen.

873
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,533
- You will give me the item
that Kihliman passed to you.

874
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,410
- I don't know what you're talking about.

875
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,245
- Listen.

876
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,580
We know that Kihliman passed
a certain item to you.

877
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,541
By keeping it, you accomplish nothing

878
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,835
but place Nina in great danger.

879
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,714
- You attacked us, and now
I'm supposed to trust you?

880
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,924
- My apologies for our rudeness.

881
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,553
Please, Klaus, give me the
item and I will disappear.

882
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,264
I promise you that I won't
show my face ever again.

883
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,641
- You have not come to approach Nina?

884
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,768
- Of course not.

885
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,856
- All right then.

886
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,983
When I return, I'll send the item

887
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,693
to the East Galieran embassy,

888
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,404
and that will end our involvement.

889
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:49,367
And then, you will not show
your face to us ever again.

890
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,870
- You have my word.

891
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,540
(elevator bell dinging)

892
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,375
(Nina gasping)

893
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,375
- Nina.

894
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,627
- Are you all right, young lady?

895
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,504
That was a hard fall.

896
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,505
- Yes.

897
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,342
I'm sorry.

898
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,093
That was my fault.

899
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,178
- I've been looking forward

900
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,221
to your charity concert tomorrow.

901
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,890
You're very talented.

902
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,100
- That's so nice of you to say.

903
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,101
Huh?

904
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,190
(somber piano music)

905
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,151
- [Nina Voiceover] His eyes are so sad.

906
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,779
But what am I feeling?

907
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,073
Like a lost memory.

908
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,954
- Please, sir.

909
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,080
Do I know you?

910
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,206
- It's time to go.

911
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,583
Come on, now.

912
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,795
- It was lovely to have met you, Nina.

913
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,755
- But...

914
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,842
(somber piano music)

915
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,511
- Nina.
(Nina gasping)

916
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,678
What are you doing?

917
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,514
Everyone has been waiting.

918
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,392
- Grandpa, please tell me,
who was that gentleman?

919
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,018
- He is just a fan of yours.

920
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,062
Now hurry up and come along.

921
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,189
- I suggest you come with me quietly

922
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,900
if you don't wish to get hurt.

923
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,027
(tense music)

924
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,529
(Klaus gasping)

925
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,533
(guests chattering)

926
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,707
- Mm, absolutely scrumptious.

927
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,419
But I wonder what trouble
Joe is causing now.

928
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,420
- What?

929
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,297
That's ridiculous.

930
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,965
People are never just missing.

931
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,133
Now go and find them this instant.

932
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,135
- Yes, sir.

933
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,137
- Did I overhear that
he couldn't find her?

934
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,471
- Joe, you pervert.

935
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,474
You better not be molesting Nina.

936
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,226
Here you go, sir.

937
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,978
I highly recommend the green stuff.

938
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,400
(Kaori panting)

939
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,948
- So you killed him.

940
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,241
Very nice work.

941
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,910
That hole in Kihliman's head
is your handiwork, right?

942
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,204
That elimination of a
well-connected source

943
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,873
for both the East and West.

944
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,499
Convenient.

945
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,419
- I don't have the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

946
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,463
- Is that so?
- Hm?

947
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,389
- This is the bullet we
removed from Kihliman.

948
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:21,060
It was shot from a
Nagant M1895, wasn't it?

949
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:24,022
The 7.62 millimeter Nagant.

950
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,357
In order to maintain a silenced discharge

951
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,193
while preventing loss of velocity,

952
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,654
uses a special mechanism
for gas pressure release.

953
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,240
It's your weapon of choice, isn't it?

954
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,492
(gun firing)

955
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,037
- If you know that much about
me, why aren't I under arrest?

956
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,956
- If only you didn't have
diplomatic privilege.

957
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,250
But I need to ask you a question.

958
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,460
Why would you set the bomb

959
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,504
if you were already planning to shoot him?

960
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,673
- Kihliman set the bomb
himself in order to fool you.

961
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,300
He was trying to raise the stakes

962
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,302
with you to get more money.

963
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,595
- He set the bomb?

964
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,721
Just for that?

965
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,765
- Kihliman had been considering retirement

966
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,725
after this mission, so he intended to sell

967
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,560
his information to the highest bidder.

968
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,562
Politics didn't matter at this point.

969
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,648
He only cared about
getting the most money.

970
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,442
He never gave right or
wrong a second thought.

971
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,779
I think it's fitting that
his greed killed him.

972
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,405
- Ah, I understand now.

973
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,824
It was his greed that put
a bullet through his head.

974
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,369
Thanks for making everything so clear.

975
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,370
- Hm?

976
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,624
Can you think of any reason

977
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,460
why a crazed person might
suddenly attack you?

978
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,295
- Huh?

979
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,420
- Joe!

980
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,631
What did you do with her?

981
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,009
(Joe grunting)

982
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,678
- What the heck's your problem?

983
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,096
- You're my problem.

984
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,180
Where did you put Nina?

985
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,307
Nobody can find her anywhere.

986
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,892
- What?

987
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,227
(Joe grunting)

988
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:49,233
(engine revving)
(tires squealing)

989
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,110
(Joe panting)

990
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,403
(engine revving)
(tires squealing)

991
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,656
- Joe, where are you going?

992
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,783
What was that all about?

993
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,994
- I have no clue.

994
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,621
(engine revving)

995
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,998
- [Klaus] Are you deaf?

996
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,916
I promised Helzen I would send it.

997
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,251
Stop the car.

998
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,628
- I advise you to stop distracting me.

999
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,505
If you interfere with my driving,

1000
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,674
your granddaughter might not be able

1001
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,801
to play the piano ever again.

1002
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,678
(Nina gasping)

1003
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,804
(engine revving)

1004
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:20,847
(tires squealing)

1005
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,182
(Joe gasping)

1006
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,351
- [Joe] That's it.

1007
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,186
(Joe grunting)

1008
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:31,191
(tires squealing)
(rock music)

1009
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,527
(mirror clanking)

1010
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,364
(tires squealing)

1011
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,202
- Shit.

1012
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,749
(engine revving)

1013
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,253
(Nina screaming)

1014
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,090
(tires squealing)

1015
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,550
(tires squealing)

1016
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,304
(metal crashing)

1017
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,184
(engine revving)

1018
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,021
(tires squealing)

1019
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,231
(metal crashing)

1020
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:16,277
(man shrieking)
(tires squealing)

1021
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,989
(car horns honking)

1022
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,407
(tires squealing)

1023
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,160
(metal crashing)

1024
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,495
(tires squealing)

1025
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:30,458
(people shrieking)
(car horn honking)

1026
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,710
(tires squealing)

1027
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,547
(engines revving)

1028
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,719
(tense music)

1029
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,015
(engines revving)

1030
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,352
(gun firing)

1031
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,645
(steam hissing)

1032
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,771
Ah, shit.

1033
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,940
What was that?

1034
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:56,901
- Helzen.

1035
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,071
(woman shrieking)
- Look out!

1036
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,781
- [Woman] Are you okay?

1037
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,032
(engine revving)

1038
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,867
- We stalled?

1039
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,035
This can't be.

1040
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,080
(steam hissing)

1041
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,873
Damn thing overheated.

1042
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,625
(tires squealing)

1043
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,460
(Gunther grunting)

1044
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,711
(gun firing)

1045
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,753
(gun firing)

1046
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,505
(Gunther shrieking)

1047
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,592
(Gunther whimpering)

1048
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,435
- Come near her again and I will kill you.

1049
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,478
Now, run.

1050
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:42,072
Hm, he chose the safest
way to stop the car.

1051
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,454
You all right?

1052
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:49,704
- Yes, I'm fine.

1053
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,790
But, Nina, she has fainted
from the excitement.

1054
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,294
(piano music)

1055
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,311
- Why have the people from
East Galiera been chasing you?

1056
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,604
What is it they want?

1057
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,730
- I don't know.

1058
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,815
Why don't you ask that question to them?

1059
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,027
- Kihliman left a little
something with you, didn't he?

1060
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,904
- Of course not.

1061
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,447
- Did you know the person

1062
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,491
who assassinated Kihliman was Helzen?

1063
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,367
- What?

1064
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,368
Then why did you idiots

1065
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,120
at the police department
let a known murderer go?

1066
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,955
I have something that was
given to me by Kihliman.

1067
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,291
I don't know what it is,

1068
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,418
but he told me that
Japanese law enforcement

1069
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,170
desperately wanted to have it.

1070
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,671
I'll give it to you,

1071
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:44,258
but in exchange, you have to get Helzen.

1072
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,885
- Get Helzen?

1073
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:49,138
- Klaus, where is the item
that Kihliman left with you?

1074
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,058
- I won't tell you until
you've arrested Helzen.

1075
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,645
- He has diplomatic privilege,
and we have no real evidence.

1076
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,938
I'm sorry.

1077
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,564
- Damn.

1078
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,982
You're a professional, aren't you?

1079
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,943
Can't you just kill the man?

1080
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,196
I'll pay you anything
you want if you kill him.

1081
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,532
- Why is it you hate Helzen so much?

1082
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,700
- Will you kill him or not?

1083
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,661
- The reason you want to kill Helzen

1084
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,412
is because of Nina, isn't it?

1085
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,039
- Nina's not involved.

1086
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,457
- She's not involved?

1087
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,959
That's very interesting,

1088
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,419
because I thought Helzen
was Nina's father.

1089
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,587
(both gasping)

1090
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,422
(Nina gasping)

1091
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,632
- You have to be insane to say that.

1092
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,510
- His name, Johann Frederiech von Helzen.

1093
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:32,098
His first name is Johann,
spelled J-O-H-A-N-N.

1094
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,767
J is the same first
initial that's engraved

1095
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,811
in the back of Nina's pendant.

1096
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,854
- Coincidence.

1097
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,146
- [Reika] Not at all.

1098
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,231
(Klaus gasping)

1099
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,567
- [Kaori] Reika.

1100
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,610
- What are you doing here?

1101
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,445
- Joe came over late the other night

1102
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,655
and asked me to help him out

1103
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,782
with an investigation of Mr. Helzen.

1104
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,409
- Wait, the real reason Joe

1105
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,994
went to you the other night was for-

1106
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,121
- Well, now you know.

1107
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,874
His real name is Johann
Frederiech von Helzen.

1108
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,167
It seems that he had
stayed in West Galiera

1109
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,962
something close to 20 years
ago as a special member

1110
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,172
of the East Galiera embassy.

1111
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,259
He was also a big fan
of Sophia Shutenberg,

1112
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,677
who was Nina's mother.

1113
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,387
He constantly went to her concerts

1114
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,849
and was seen in her company
on several occasions.

1115
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,144
- Now do you feel like
telling us the story?

1116
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,439
- If I must.

1117
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,110
20 years ago, at the
celebration for the detente

1118
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,571
between East and West Galiera.

1119
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,950
We were introduced to
two brand-new diplomats.

1120
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,953
Both of them had great
skill at playing piano

1121
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,248
and were enamored of my daughter, Sophia.

1122
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,752
After awhile, my daughter
began a relationship

1123
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,170
with one of them.

1124
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,254
That was Helzen.

1125
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,715
Sophia was betrayed by him.

1126
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,383
He had been using my daughter

1127
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,928
to cover his spying activities.

1128
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,930
He left my daughter behind.

1129
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,683
And then later, Sophia
gave birth to his child.

1130
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,518
Poor girl.

1131
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,686
She has never been told.

1132
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,605
(Nina whimpering)

1133
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,940
- [Nina Voiceover] That man.

1134
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,611
That gentleman by the
elevator was my father.

1135
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,448
(Nina whimpering)

1136
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,659
- I know.

1137
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,244
The charity concert
will go on as scheduled.

1138
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,330
We will not disappoint you again.

1139
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,915
Goodnight.

1140
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,418
(dog barking)

1141
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,884
- Hello, sun.

1142
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,303
Time to nookie.

1143
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:39,309
Size one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1144
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,187
The more I get of nookie
now, the less I have to...

1145
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,314
Seven, eight.

1146
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,274
Oh.

1147
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,527
Nookie.

1148
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:52,823
Good morning.

1149
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,323
- [Nina] Good morning?

1150
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,283
It's already afternoon now.

1151
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,036
- You didn't get very much
sleep last night, did you, Nina?

1152
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,288
Your eyes look a little red to me.

1153
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,124
(Nina gasping)

1154
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,124
- Oh, you can tell?

1155
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,669
Please tell me.

1156
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,672
Why do you think my father
had to leave my mother?

1157
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,257
- Hm?
- Oh.

1158
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,927
- Did you hear what we were
talking about last night?

1159
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,638
Well, even if we wanted to hide the story,

1160
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,974
you would've found out
sooner or later, I guess.

1161
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,019
- Mr. Saeba, do you really
believe that my father

1162
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,854
meant to use my mother?

1163
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,856
He seemed like such a gentleman.

1164
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,065
I simply can't believe

1165
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,608
he would have done something like that.

1166
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,860
- Wait a second.

1167
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,986
You met him?

1168
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:32,821
- Yes.

1169
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,739
Back at the hotel.

1170
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,575
And he had these eyes that were so sad

1171
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,285
and were also so gentle.

1172
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,788
He seemed so terribly sad and alone to me.

1173
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,750
I don't understand how
he could have left her.

1174
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,585
- Hm.

1175
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:48,252
Don't cast judgment yet.

1176
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,172
There are situations where a
man has to end a relationship

1177
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,340
with a woman because he loves her.

1178
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,134
- I don't want to be like that.

1179
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,470
If I love you, I should be near you.

1180
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,430
Oh.

1181
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,723
(Kaori gasping)

1182
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,808
(Joe laughing)

1183
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,393
- I am suddenly really hungry.

1184
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,645
Gee, I wonder what's for lunch today.

1185
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,646
(Kaori shrieking)

1186
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,356
- Time to go, time to go.

1187
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,110
(Nina chuckling)

1188
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,112
- Ha.

1189
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,696
City Hunter, eh?

1190
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,822
Pathetic.

1191
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,241
You ran away from just one man.

1192
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,659
- Please let me explain.

1193
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,578
- We don't have any other choice now.

1194
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,580
We have to call them in.

1195
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,332
- That's not a good idea.

1196
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,250
- Shut up.

1197
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,584
You failed what you're supposed to do,

1198
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,127
and now you're out of ideas.

1199
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:33,047
Stop arguing and call
in the team right now.

1200
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,424
- Yes, Ambassador.

1201
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,889
- A conspiracy of imbeciles
is plotting against me.

1202
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,893
(thunder roaring)

1203
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:52,149
(lightning crackling)

1204
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,652
(thunder rumbling)

1205
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,571
(rain pattering)

1206
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,408
(Kaori shrieking)

1207
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,830
- Why did it have to rain all of a sudden?

1208
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,748
It always makes my hair frizz out.

1209
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,919
(lightning crackling)

1210
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,506
(helicopter whirring)

1211
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,759
(lightning crackling)

1212
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,680
(lightning crackling)

1213
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,641
(lightning crackling)

1214
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,061
(helicopter whirring)

1215
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,564
(lightning crackling)
(thunder rumbling)

1216
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,692
(car horn honking)

1217
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,112
(gun firing)

1218
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,616
- That's incredible.

1219
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,703
- Anybody can shoot like that
if they practice long enough.

1220
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,454
Do you wanna try?

1221
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,455
- Mm-mm.

1222
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,168
You know, it's like
you're a different person

1223
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,961
when you hold a gun, Mr. Saeba.

1224
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,047
Usually, you are unreliable and perverted.

1225
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,216
- Would you stop calling me perverted?

1226
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,552
I'm what you call nookie-dependent.

1227
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,845
- I don't understand.

1228
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,305
What's the difference?

1229
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,474
- It's complicated, like me.

1230
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:11,187
- I wish I could always talk
so freely like we are now.

1231
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,022
- Huh?

1232
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:15,316
- I want to ask my father
why he abandoned my mother.

1233
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,776
I want to see him again.

1234
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,403
- So why can't you?

1235
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,530
I'll make sure you have
the chance to see him again

1236
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,782
before your tour is over.

1237
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:24,618
- Huh?

1238
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,285
You will, really?

1239
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,078
- Really.

1240
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,495
I promise.

1241
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,539
Nookie time.

1242
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,583
Don't be coy.

1243
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,084
(Joe shrieking)
(Nina grunting)

1244
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,753
- Was that coy?

1245
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,631
- And just where did
you happen to get that?

1246
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,050
- Um, well, from Kaori?

1247
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,676
- Bad Kaori.

1248
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,637
(helicopter whirring)

1249
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,138
Huh?

1250
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,139
- Move out.

1251
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,936
(thunder rumbling)

1252
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,940
(soldiers grunting)

1253
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,152
- Stay here.

1254
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,071
- Mr. Saeba, what's the matter?

1255
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,657
- Time to greet our visitors.

1256
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,368
(thrilling rock music)

1257
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,955
(Joe grunting)

1258
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,415
(soldiers grunting)
- Who's there?

1259
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,585
(Klaus grunting)

1260
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,963
(Joe panting)

1261
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,714
(elevator bell ringing)

1262
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,218
(guns firing)

1263
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,263
(Kaori gasping)

1264
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,514
- Machine guns.

1265
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,892
(guns firing)

1266
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,769
Bring him back here.

1267
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,604
(soldier grunting)

1268
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,897
(machine gun firing)
(Kaori shrieking)

1269
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,401
(guns firing)

1270
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,362
- Crap.

1271
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,571
(window shattering)

1272
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,907
(explosion booming)

1273
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,951
(Joe yelling)

1274
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,079
(Joe grunting)

1275
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,374
(soldier panting)

1276
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,044
(Kaori panting)

1277
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:05,093
(thunder rumbling)
(soldiers panting)

1278
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,637
- Hm.

1279
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,346
Guess the opposition wasn't everything

1280
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,099
it was cracked up to be.

1281
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,934
(Kaori panting)

1282
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:15,394
- Stop, get back here.

1283
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,063
(thunder rumbling)

1284
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,732
You can't take Klaus.

1285
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:24,654
(Joe panting)
(rock music)

1286
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,657
What was I thinking?

1287
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,658
Help!

1288
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,997
(thunder roaring)

1289
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,915
- Oh, Kaori.

1290
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,544
(rain pattering)

1291
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,964
- Our field unit reports that Bondal

1292
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,675
has assigned a special forces group.

1293
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,969
- He's gone too far.

1294
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,931
(engine revving)

1295
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,769
(thunder roaring)

1296
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:04,277
(water splashing)
(engine revving)

1297
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,824
(bullets clicking)

1298
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,412
- I'll come up with
some way to rescue them.

1299
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,622
Don't worry about a thing.

1300
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,623
I'll be back soon.

1301
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,832
- I'm so sorry.

1302
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,461
Kaori is in great danger because
of my grandfather and me.

1303
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,047
- Hey, that comes with the job.

1304
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,674
- Every time she's in
danger, you have saved her.

1305
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,510
- She's my partner.

1306
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:30,511
That's part of the job too.

1307
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,012
- I am envious.

1308
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,472
She is very lucky.

1309
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,973
- Hm?

1310
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,644
- Mr. Saeba, can't you
please take me with you?

1311
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,774
- Nina, danger is my job, and
you can't help me with that

1312
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,402
any more than I can help you
play the piano beautifully

1313
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,320
at the charity concert.

1314
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,321
Understand?

1315
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,116
- Yes.

1316
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,325
- Now, listen.

1317
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:56,453
I'm afraid I might not be able
to keep the promise I made

1318
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,748
to you about seeing your father again.

1319
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,583
- All right.

1320
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,042
I understand.

1321
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,920
- Would it be possible for
me to borrow your pendant?

1322
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,173
(Nina gasping)

1323
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,174
- Of course.

1324
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,765
(gear clicking)
(bell chiming)

1325
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,684
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

1326
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,936
- I should have guessed.
- Huh?

1327
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,563
(Nina gasping)

1328
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:26,316
- If I asked really nicely,
would you give it to me?

1329
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,987
(bird chirping)

1330
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,325
(engine revving)

1331
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,996
(gate clacking)

1332
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,958
(engine revving)

1333
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,881
(brakes squealing)

1334
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,925
- You still refuse to tell us, do you?

1335
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,844
- [Klaus] I told you, I don't know.

1336
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,930
- And I don't believe you,
so don't grow too attached

1337
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,600
to this girl we found
clinging to the bottom

1338
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,769
of our helicopter, because she dies.

1339
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,605
- [Klaus] Stop it.

1340
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:06,190
This girl has nothing to do with us.

1341
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,191
- Where is it?

1342
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,486
- It's well hidden.

1343
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,862
- In the pendant.

1344
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,490
The information which
Kihliman had is currently

1345
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,494
inside the pendant which
Klaus' granddaughter wears.

1346
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,661
- Damn you to hell.

1347
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,914
That man, Helzen, is a brazen liar.

1348
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,832
- Then tell us where it is, Klaus.

1349
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,917
- No.

1350
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,752
How much longer will you make us suffer

1351
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,754
until you're satisfied?

1352
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,841
- Ambassador Bondal, why did
you break your promise with me?

1353
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,386
- You have been too slow on
making progress on the mission.

1354
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,598
- And our unit is bored of just training.

1355
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,434
We were looking forward to
enjoying an actual battle,

1356
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,937
but it was a little disappointing.

1357
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,356
- I wouldn't advise you
to underestimate Saeba,

1358
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,732
Lieutenant Laipnitz.

1359
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,528
He may cause you to regret
your overconfidence.

1360
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,864
- Ha, what a wimp.

1361
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,535
The illustrious Red Grim Reaper.

1362
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,579
- [Joe] This is where
the helicopter went to.

1363
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,914
- Wow, you're pretty good.

1364
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,292
It's a gorgeous athletics
club called Etrengere.

1365
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,253
Word has it that it started as a hobby

1366
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,421
of a billionaire from Europe.

1367
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,465
We have reason to
believe that East Galiera

1368
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,008
is using this place as a cover

1369
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:18,136
for a training facility
for their elite soldiers.

1370
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,805
- Then why hasn't the police department

1371
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,683
already done something about this place?

1372
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,892
- We couldn't move in.

1373
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,727
There was no evidence to be had.

1374
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,605
- Being a cop can be
such a hassle sometimes.

1375
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,233
Oh yeah, I'm not a cop.

1376
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:35,780
So, if nobody minds,
I'll just hold onto this.

1377
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,285
- Please.

1378
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:41,952
Mr. Saeba, wait a second.

1379
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,579
Please tell me one thing.

1380
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,581
Why haven't you accepted
that there might be

1381
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,292
a special relationship
between you and Kaori?

1382
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,876
- Well.

1383
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:50,877
- Hm?

1384
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,923
- Kaori wants to love
someone for a whole lifetime.

1385
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,968
My lifestyle makes that impossible.

1386
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,221
- Did my father share that same feeling?

1387
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,725
- He strikes me as someone
who, deep down, is very gentle.

1388
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,978
I don't think he could
hurt someone he loved.

1389
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,738
- Gonna keep all the fun to yourself?

1390
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,866
- Having trouble digging
up adventure on your own?

1391
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,701
- Ha.

1392
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,285
You always were greedy.

1393
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,872
- Oh, there might be some
tidbits left over for you,

1394
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,999
if you're also willing to drive.

1395
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,334
- I don't need much.

1396
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,753
Just wanna try out a few new gadgets.

1397
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,506
(engine revving)

1398
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,012
(ominous music)

1399
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,564
(Klaus whimpering)
(Kaori sighing)

1400
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,024
(metal clacking)

1401
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,025
- Huh?

1402
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,779
Not satisfied yet, Helzen?

1403
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,864
Haven't we suffered enough?

1404
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,574
- You would have confessed sooner or later

1405
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,993
since Laipnitz was the
one dealing with you.

1406
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,370
I was trying to spare you.

1407
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,330
- But now they're after Nina.

1408
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,582
- They won't make a move until tomorrow.

1409
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,542
So we still have a little time

1410
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,544
for Mr. Saeba to hunt us down.

1411
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,838
- But what do you mean?

1412
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,054
Stop, help, dirty old man!

1413
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,807
- This is a transmitter, isn't it?

1414
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:27,974
- It could be.

1415
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:28,851
You noticed that?

1416
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,519
Good eyes.

1417
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,354
Wait.

1418
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,522
There's something important
we need for you to tell us.

1419
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,357
Why did you separate from Sophia?

1420
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,858
Nina has been suffering from the thought

1421
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,902
that her father didn't love her mother.

1422
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:42,322
- Did Nina finally find out
about my relation to her?

1423
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,116
- Answer the question.

1424
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:48,662
- I think that answer needs to
wait until Mr. Saeba is here.

1425
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,665
What I must say, I could explain it better

1426
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,583
if he were present at the time.

1427
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,752
- [Kaori] Huh?

1428
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,841
- So, Nina knows the truth.

1429
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,468
- I guess she was eavesdropping
on them last night.

1430
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,929
- This is my fault.

1431
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:10,392
If I hadn't been so foolish
and taken that damn thing

1432
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,478
from Kihliman, this
wouldn't have happened.

1433
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,313
- Don't blame yourself.

1434
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,148
It'll work out.

1435
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,898
And besides, Joe will come through for us.

1436
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,859
I know it.

1437
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,860
- Why?
- Huh?

1438
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,905
- That man, Saeba, your partner?

1439
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,825
Why do you find men like him so appealing?

1440
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,535
They are always chasing someone

1441
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,164
or in the crosshairs
of someone even worse.

1442
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,123
- Well, I...

1443
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,877
- Why do women insist
on sharing their lives

1444
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,712
with such dangerous men?

1445
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,173
It makes no sense.

1446
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,716
- Oh.

1447
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,385
(car horns honking)

1448
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,556
(audience applauding)

1449
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,491
(Sandra sighing)

1450
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,202
- [Nina Voiceover] Mr.
Saeba, in this entire world,

1451
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:14,372
I only have faith in my
father, my mother, and you.

1452
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,917
It's because of this faith
that you have given me

1453
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,544
I can perform tonight.

1454
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,923
(piano music)

1455
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,591
(rocket firing)

1456
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,426
(explosion booming)

1457
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,594
(men grunting)

1458
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,097
(guns firing)

1459
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,644
- [Laipnitz] What's going on out there?

1460
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,772
- Lieutenant, there are two
intruders on the grounds.

1461
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:39,773
- Two intruders?

1462
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,235
They have done well so far for amateurs,

1463
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,655
but they're due for a rude awakening.

1464
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,367
Time for them to die.

1465
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,286
(rocket firing)

1466
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,789
(explosion booming)

1467
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,918
(machine guns firing)

1468
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,755
(guns firing)

1469
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,759
(guns firing)

1470
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,886
(Joe panting)

1471
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,390
(guns firing)

1472
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,476
(Falcon grunting)

1473
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,980
(guns firing)

1474
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,190
(grenade whooshing)

1475
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,735
(explosion booming)
(soldiers screaming)

1476
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:30,741
(machine gun firing)
(soldiers grunting)

1477
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,704
(machine gun firing)

1478
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,081
(machine gun firing)
- Scatter!

1479
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:41,084
(Falcon grunting)

1480
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,921
(Falcon grunting)

1481
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,050
(soldier yelling)

1482
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,136
- You owe me one.

1483
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,055
- In your dreams.

1484
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,143
(Joe grunting)

1485
01:04:57,144 --> 01:05:01,980
(air whooshing)
(gun firing)

1486
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,690
(gun firing)

1487
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,443
(Joe panting)

1488
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,946
(piano music)

1489
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,845
(guns firing)

1490
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,682
(glass shattering)
(guns firing)

1491
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:40,101
(soldier grunting)

1492
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,937
(gun firing)

1493
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,772
(chandelier shattering)
(soldiers shrieking)

1494
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,275
(guns firing)

1495
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:55,992
(glass shattering)
(machine guns firing)

1496
01:05:55,993 --> 01:06:00,664
(machine gun firing)
(soldiers shrieking)

1497
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:05,670
(machine gun firing)
(soldiers screaming)

1498
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,588
(Falcon chuckling)

1499
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,297
- Ah, you big showoff.

1500
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,800
- I'd say we're even now.

1501
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,636
(guns firing)

1502
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,388
- [Laipnitz] Haven't
you finished them yet?

1503
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,348
- No, sir.

1504
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:21,017
They have much more firepower
than we anticipated.

1505
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,936
- You are all cowards.

1506
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,522
- Lieutenant Laipnitz.
(Laipnitz growling)

1507
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,565
Are you sure we're still all right?

1508
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,733
We appear to be in trouble.

1509
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,527
- Will you quit complaining?

1510
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,445
There are only two of them,

1511
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:35,281
and they won't be alive much longer.

1512
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,117
- I see.

1513
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,283
I trust you.

1514
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,787
(guns firing)

1515
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,331
- It sure is noisy outside.

1516
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:46,042
That must be Joe coming to rescue us.

1517
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,461
I told you we'd be okay.

1518
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:51,840
- How can you make yourself
cheerful right now?

1519
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,800
- What?

1520
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,261
- Aren't you the least
bit upset or frightened?

1521
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,888
- Yeah.

1522
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,433
I am scared to death right now.

1523
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,185
But that doesn't mean
I have to be unhappy.

1524
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,270
I believe in him.

1525
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:08,481
In my heart, I always knew
that Joe would save me.

1526
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:10,985
(guns firing)

1527
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,863
- Don't you care for Sophia at all?

1528
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,449
She's an innocent girl
who doesn't know anything

1529
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,827
about your filthy world
filled with guns and blood.

1530
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:24,289
If you really care about
her, stay away from her.

1531
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:28,961
I'm warning you, the next time
I see you, I will shoot you.

1532
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:35,717
Have I been wrong all these years?

1533
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,220
(piano music)

1534
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,953
(machine gun firing)

1535
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:07,041
(soldiers shrieking)

1536
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,418
- Hey, leave some for me to shoot.

1537
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,630
- Would you hurry up and go rescue Kaori?

1538
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,967
(Falcon panting)

1539
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,345
(machine guns firing)

1540
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,013
(Falcon grunting)

1541
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:25,101
(machine gun firing)

1542
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:31,607
(soldiers shrieking)
(machine gun firing)

1543
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,654
(soldiers screaming)

1544
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,572
(grenades clattering)

1545
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:40,615
(glass shattering)

1546
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:45,621
(soldiers yelling)
(explosions booming)

1547
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,873
- I'm growing tired of them.

1548
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:51,543
(explosions booming)

1549
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,879
(soldiers shrieking)
(building rumbling)

1550
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,675
(soldiers yelling)
(building rumbling)

1551
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:01,386
(Laipnitz yelling)

1552
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,390
(building rumbling)

1553
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,270
(Gunther panting)

1554
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,896
- I don't believe it.

1555
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,857
The special forces are losing.

1556
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:17,193
(piano music)

1557
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,862
- [Oigen] Sir.

1558
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:19,863
- Hm?

1559
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,740
I see.

1560
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:31,500
- Colonel Helzen.

1561
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,591
(gun clacking)

1562
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:44,012
(rubble rumbling)
(Laipnitz grunting)

1563
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,054
- Huh?

1564
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:46,723
(Lapinitz yelling)

1565
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,224
(gun clattering)

1566
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,895
(both grunting)

1567
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:59,570
(pipe whooshing)
(both grunting)

1568
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,613
(Falcon laughing)

1569
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,573
- Huh?

1570
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:05,617
(Falcon yelling)

1571
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,493
- Son of swine.

1572
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:08,870
Hm.

1573
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,205
(Laipnitz grunting)

1574
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,331
(pipe whooshing)

1575
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,832
(Laipnitz grunting)

1576
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,709
(Laipnitz yelling)

1577
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,546
(rubble rumbling)

1578
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,931
(Bondal shrieking)

1579
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,684
(Bondal panting)

1580
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:35,813
- Somebody's coming.

1581
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,899
(metal clicking)
(Kaori gasping)

1582
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,360
- Everything's ruined now
because of your friends.

1583
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,361
You're coming with me.

1584
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,528
- Like hell we are.

1585
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:45,615
There's no way you're gonna
use us for protection.

1586
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,201
- Fine, then you will both die here.

1587
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,411
(Kaori gasping)

1588
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,121
(footsteps clicking)

1589
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,122
Huh?

1590
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,041
Get back.

1591
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,173
- You don't learn very well, do you?

1592
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,425
- Joe, I knew you would come.

1593
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,802
- Stay back.

1594
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,304
- I swear, if you hurt that woman at all,

1595
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,306
I'm not gonna let you live.

1596
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,641
- I'll take my chances.

1597
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,394
Now throw the gun away.

1598
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:15,520
(Gunther shrieking)

1599
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,146
(Klaus grunting)

1600
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:18,147
- Klaus.

1601
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:20,608
(gun firing)

1602
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,612
(Gunther shrieking)

1603
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:27,907
- Sorry about that.

1604
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:31,620
Maybe you could get a disability
transfer to a desk job.

1605
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,374
Thanks, Klaus.

1606
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,208
Couldn't have done it without you.

1607
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:38,002
- Oh.

1608
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:39,502
It was nothing.

1609
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:40,337
- All right.

1610
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,630
Let's get outta here.
- Right.

1611
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:45,550
(all panting)

1612
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:49,137
(Gunther laughing)

1613
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,806
- Nothing matters now.

1614
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,727
(Gunther laughing)

1615
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,742
(door creaking)

1616
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:14,121
(Gunther laughing)

1617
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:17,999
Damn every last one of you to hell!

1618
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,003
(explosion roaring)

1619
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:35,225
(all screaming)

1620
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:42,148
(Bondal whimpering)

1621
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,152
(building rumbling)

1622
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:03,878
- Ah, no.

1623
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,547
Le Proges.

1624
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,018
Oh, Helzen, thank God you're okay.

1625
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:19,853
Kill them.

1626
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,521
They're all against us.

1627
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:24,274
(flames roaring)

1628
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,567
- [Joe] What do you want?

1629
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,361
- I want to find closure.

1630
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,196
- [Joe] Hm.

1631
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,906
- I loved Sophia deeply,
with all my heart.

1632
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,450
I loved her so much that I
wanted everything in life

1633
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:35,868
to be perfect for her.

1634
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:38,913
I could have brought Sophia
with me to East Galiera.

1635
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,998
In fact, she wanted me to do so,

1636
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,083
but I didn't want to drag her

1637
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,544
into this horrible
existence that we share.

1638
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:47,130
You know what I'm
talking about, Mr. Saeba.

1639
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,298
I thought it was best that
I stay as far as possible

1640
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,843
from her and the baby she expected.

1641
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,805
I knew that my very presence
would endanger their wellbeing.

1642
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,975
So I disappeared, never to be seen again.

1643
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:02,520
But now that I know of Nina
and all her pain and confusion,

1644
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,189
I don't know whether that
was the right thing to do.

1645
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,859
Maybe I was just a coward.

1646
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,528
- Please, Helzen, that's enough.

1647
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,529
Stop.

1648
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,699
Everything is all my fault.

1649
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,909
I pushed you away from her.

1650
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:17,828
- You're wrong.

1651
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:19,328
It wasn't your fault, Klaus.

1652
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:22,373
Even if you hadn't told me to
disappear from Sophia's life,

1653
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:25,126
I had already gathered
my courage to withdraw.

1654
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:25,961
- Helzen.

1655
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,879
- What's he talking about?

1656
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,087
It doesn't make sense.

1657
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,297
Is he sick?

1658
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,591
Joe, what's happening?

1659
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,801
- A duel.

1660
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,303
- Joe.

1661
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,055
- Falcon will assist us
as the official witness.

1662
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:39,265
All right?

1663
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:40,267
- [Helzen] That's fine.

1664
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,062
(flames roaring)

1665
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,317
(gun clicking)

1666
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,194
(bullets clattering)

1667
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,947
(bullet chiming)

1668
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,616
- Please stop.

1669
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,534
I don't understand why you
have to shoot each other

1670
01:14:58,535 --> 01:14:59,660
like this.

1671
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,372
(flames roaring)

1672
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,883
(piano music)

1673
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,418
(gun firing)

1674
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:50,254
(gun firing)

1675
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:53,090
(Falcon grunting)

1676
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,677
(Joe grunting)

1677
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:58,678
- Joe!

1678
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:01,974
(piano music)

1679
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:09,022
(audience applauding)

1680
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:16,028
Joe, Joe.

1681
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,198
Come on, Joe.

1682
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:21,827
- I'm fine.

1683
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:23,035
Just a bit winded.

1684
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:26,289
(chimes ringing)

1685
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,042
(flames roaring)

1686
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,586
- The pendant.

1687
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,920
It's been broken.

1688
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,256
(piano wire snapping)
(audience applauding)

1689
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,843
(Nina gasping)

1690
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:50,314
(Helzen groaning)
(dramatic music)

1691
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,191
- I think that the pain in my heart

1692
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:56,736
equals the pain I have caused Nina.

1693
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:00,114
Tell her that I loved her.

1694
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:03,451
(Helzen groaning)

1695
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,286
(Bondal shrieking)

1696
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,705
- [Bondal] Somebody help me!

1697
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,502
- Oh dear God in heaven, Helzen.

1698
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:14,463
No.

1699
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:16,339
Don't leave us now.

1700
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,092
(dramatic music)

1701
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:29,478
- [Oigen] Colonel Helzen.

1702
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,154
(tires squealing)

1703
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:41,447
(Bondal panting)

1704
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:42,366
- [Bondal] Wake up.

1705
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,033
Is anybody there?

1706
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,534
It's me.

1707
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:48,288
(Bondal panting)

1708
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:56,087
- [Man] It seems you've made
a bit of a mess, Bondal.

1709
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:56,922
- Who are you supposed to be?

1710
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:59,715
Oigen, who the hell is this man?

1711
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:03,052
Why are you in my office
without my approval?

1712
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,013
- I'd like you to meet
Chief Investigator Steiner

1713
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:09,350
of our Special Intelligence Division.

1714
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,144
- The Special Intelligence Division?

1715
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,604
- You will have an opportunity

1716
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:16,065
to explain yourself when we return.

1717
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,776
But I don't think you'll
escape serving time

1718
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:21,863
in the concentration camps for
all the harm you have caused.

1719
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,158
- I can't go to the camps.

1720
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:30,371
(Bondal whimpering)

1721
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,915
- Helzen has died on the job.

1722
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:34,542
God.

1723
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:37,002
He and I joined the service together.

1724
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,964
This is such a waste.

1725
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:44,218
I suppose that he is living
in heaven now with Sophia.

1726
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,679
In a way, I envy him.

1727
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,433
(dramatic music)

1728
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,360
- [Passenger] Ah, you
know, we're going down-

1729
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:05,406
- I hope I don't-
(passengers chattering)

1730
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,241
- Thank you for everything.

1731
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,325
- You're welcome.

1732
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:09,161
Here.

1733
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:10,370
Let me return this to you.

1734
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,706
I know how important
this keepsake was to you.

1735
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,958
I'm very sorry it got damaged.

1736
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:17,042
- Don't be.

1737
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:20,963
I'm glad this pendant was
able to save you, Mr. Saeba.

1738
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,549
You're the one I...

1739
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:27,344
(boat whistle blowing)

1740
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:30,682
(passengers chattering)

1741
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:41,067
(boat whistle blowing)

1742
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:46,615
- [Nina Voiceover] It wouldn't be right

1743
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:49,116
to come between the two of them.

1744
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,536
It's better that I leave
without saying anything.

1745
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,164
(engine revving)

1746
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,999
- Bye.
- Bye.

1747
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,085
- [Woman] Gonna miss you.

1748
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:03,672
- I've just been handed the final report.

1749
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:05,633
East Galiera has confirmed the death

1750
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:08,636
of Mr. Helzen in the line of duty.

1751
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:09,637
- Excellent.

1752
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,977
- [Nina Voiceover] Kaori and
Joe, they have each other.

1753
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:19,064
But I don't have anyone now.

1754
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:37,998
(piano music)

1755
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:41,210
(Nina gasping)

1756
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:44,213
- I can see by your face that
you're surprised to see me.

1757
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,132
It just so happens that
the gunshot to my chest

1758
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:49,343
was not sufficient to kill me.

1759
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,886
- Thank God.

1760
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:52,764
But Mr. Saeba didn't say anything.

1761
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,683
- We didn't intend to deceive you,

1762
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,059
but we couldn't tell you anything

1763
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,937
until the government in East
Galiera confirmed my death,

1764
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,523
or all this pain would have
been for nothing, my daughter.

1765
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,402
Helzen the intelligence
officer is now truly dead.

1766
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,320
And so, there is no reason anymore

1767
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,698
for me to go back to East Galiera.

1768
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,116
- Father.

1769
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,450
I'm so...

1770
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,244
I'm so confused.

1771
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,079
This is so sudden.

1772
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,624
- All you need to know is
that I'm not leaving you.

1773
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,628
I'd like to make up for the
last 20 years that I've missed.

1774
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:25,880
- Oh.

1775
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:30,886
(Nina sobbing)
(piano music)

1776
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:33,305
I can't believe it.

1777
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,307
It's not a dream.

1778
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,895
(Nina sobbing)

1779
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,944
(engine revving)

1780
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:49,945
- So?
- Hm?

1781
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,032
- Does this mean that
Joe's nearly perfect record

1782
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,491
survived the fight?

1783
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:55,327
- Maybe.

1784
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:58,162
This duel was about something much deeper

1785
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,539
than just defeating the opponent.

1786
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,208
It was a test of a
different kind of honor.

1787
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:07,714
And if anyone's going to
kill Joe, it'll be me.

1788
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:11,926
(both laughing)
(saxophone music)

1789
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,385
- Nice work, Joe.

1790
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:15,512
I wouldn't have come up
with an idea like that,

1791
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,390
decreasing the amount of
powder in one of your rounds?

1792
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:21,143
Amazing that you had just
the right amount to penetrate

1793
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:23,479
but not go all the way to his heart.

1794
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,773
- Sure it was a risky way to do it,

1795
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,107
but the plan might've failed

1796
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,736
if the wound didn't appear
completely authentic.

1797
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:31,779
Wait.

1798
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,238
I brought you something.

1799
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,239
Here.

1800
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,784
- You can keep it.

1801
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,371
With Bondal gone, I don't need it anymore.

1802
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,624
- Joe, I'm sorry.

1803
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,251
That was such a foolish
mistake that I made.

1804
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,004
I shouldn't be your partner anymore.

1805
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,591
- If you hadn't taken that
incredible helicopter ride,

1806
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:55,552
I might've never found out
where they were keeping Klaus.

1807
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:56,972
I need you as a partner.

1808
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,307
- Joe.

1809
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:03,853
(pleasant saxophone music)

1810
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,067
- [Helzen Voiceover] Mr. Saeba,

1811
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:12,070
I have what I was looking for.

1812
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,781
But to see what you need,

1813
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:18,200
you need to look a little
closer from now on.

1814
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:22,413
(gull cawing)
(metal clanking)

1815
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,250
(water splashing)

1816
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,548
(upbeat heroic music)

1817
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,820
(singing in foreign language)
