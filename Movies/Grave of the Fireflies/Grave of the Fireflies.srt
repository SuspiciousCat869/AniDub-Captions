1
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:25,058
<i>September 21, 1945...</i>
<i>That was the night I died.</i>

2
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,057
Disgusting!

3
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:59,726
[Man 1] Hey, watch it!
[Man 2] Sorry.

4
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,629
[Girl 1] Is he dead?

5
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,666
[Girl 2] The Americans will
be arriving any day now.

6
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,202
[Woman 1] These bums
are a disgrace.

7
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,813
[Child 1] Mama!

8
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,484
<i>Tell me what day is it?</i>

9
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,830
Setsuko...

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,575
Another one.

11
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,257
What is this stuff?

12
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:09,763
Oh what does it matter?
Just dump it!

13
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,307
[Worker 1] This one's
a goner too.

14
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,877
You can see it in their eyes.

15
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,351
[can rattling]

16
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:55,996
[sirens wailing]
Air raid! Get to the
shelters! Quickly!

17
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,265
[Officer] We're in for the
big one this time!

18
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,968
The shelter behind the
firehouse should be safest!

19
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,175
It's hot!

20
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,745
Be a good girl; try to
be patient.

21
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,586
Well I guess, I had better get
over to the shelter.

22
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:23,323
So be careful Seita, and get
over there as soon as you can.

23
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,727
Setsuko, be a good girl and
listen to your brother.

24
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,229
Mom, never mind us!
Get to the shelter!

25
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,598
Yes, yes.

26
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,600
[Seita] Mom, do you have your
medicine with you?

27
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,369
I have it right here,
don't worry.

28
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,743
[Setsuko] I hate the shelter!

29
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,812
Well, you'll be sorry if you
get blown up by a bomb!

30
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,047
Now, get on.

31
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,122
[Setsuko] My doll! My doll!

32
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,936
[Officer ringing warning bell]
[Officer] Air raid!

33
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,738
Seita!

34
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,280
[war planes approaching]

35
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,284
[incendiary bombs being dropped]

36
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,719
[Setsuko] Get down!

37
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,032
[incendiary bombs being dropped]

38
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,314
[Both] Aah!

39
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,084
[Setsuko] Seita! Seita!

40
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,531
Seita!

41
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,713
[Man 1] Hurry! Lets go,
lets go, lets go!

42
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,661
Clear the way people!

43
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,696
Get out of my way!

44
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,531
Move the damn cary, will you?

45
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,813
Oh God!

46
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,849
[Woman 3] Help me!

47
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,296
[Man 5] Take whatever
you can carry!

48
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,852
[Man 6] Hurry! Bring all
you can carry!

49
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,937
[baby crying]

50
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,786
Long live the Emperor!

51
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,244
We're safe here,
don't worry. Okay?

52
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,481
Where's Mama? I want Mama.

53
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,852
Why she's in the shelter.

54
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,123
The firehouse shelter can take a
hit from a 250‐kilo bomb, easy.

55
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,625
Don't worry about her.

56
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,773
She'll probably go to Niponmatsu
Station to find us.

57
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,842
When things calm down we'll
meet her there.

58
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,010
Let's just rest a bit.

59
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,853
[Seita] Are you okay, Setsuko?

60
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,656
I lost one of my shoes.

61
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,160
Don't worry, I'll buy you
better ones.

62
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,930
I have some money.

63
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,972
Open this.

64
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,318
Wow, Setsuko you're rich.

65
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,797
It's black rain, from all
of the bombing.

66
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,321
[explosion in the distance]

67
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,303
[Seita] Look, it's all gone.

68
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,141
That was the civic hall.

69
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,878
We ate lunch there once.

70
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,416
Seita, is our house gone too?

71
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,218
Probably.

72
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,854
What'll we do?

73
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,457
Dad will make them pay for this!

74
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:56,777
[Daughter] Mother, mother!
[sobbing]

75
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,988
Well, it's not like I was the
only one who lost his house.

76
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,657
We're all in the same boat.

77
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,193
[Man 2] Well at least we're
still alive.

78
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,137
There were two direct hits.
The fire's impossible to
put out!

79
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,340
You try to smother them,
it just spreads the oil around.

80
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,277
It's not her. She's not
down here!

81
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,717
Seita, I have to pee.

82
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,151
Okay.

83
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:53,600
[Officer] Attention all
residents of Ichirizuka
and Kaminishi!

84
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,472
Please report to the elementary
school for first aid services!

85
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,541
What's wrong?

86
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,208
[Setsuko] My eye hurts.

87
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,443
Don't rub it.

88
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,047
We'll get it washed out
at the school.

89
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,616
Where's Mama?

90
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,584
She'll be there.

91
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,852
At school?

92
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,286
Yes, let's go.

93
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:33,406
Oh, Seita! Come with me.

94
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,578
Have you seen your mother yet?

95
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,546
She's been injured. Go to her.

96
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,315
I'll watch your sister.

97
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,651
My goodness, wasn't that
scary, Setsuko?

98
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,490
Seita has to go somewhere.
We'll wait for him together.

99
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:02,268
Ah Seita, I'm glad you're here.
Are you okay?

100
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,970
[Seita] My mom?
[Obayashi] This way.

101
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,107
Oh...

102
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,048
This is your mother's,
isn't it?

103
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,620
In here.

104
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,299
She's finally fallen asleep.

105
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,173
Your mother really should
be in a proper hospital.

106
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,176
We can't do much here.

107
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,548
[Obayashi] I don't think
they hit Kaisei hospital
in Nishinomiya.

108
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:53,019
My mother, my mother has
heart trouble. Can she get
her medicine?

109
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,088
I'll find out.

110
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,093
I'll be around, son.

111
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,267
Mom are you‐?

112
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,056
You saw her?

113
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:30,991
[Seita] Yes.

114
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,759
I am so sorry.

115
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,161
I'm thirsty.

116
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,203
[Neighbor] If there's anything
I can do, just ask.

117
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,273
Did you get your ration?

118
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,143
Let me. I'll get it for you.

119
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,790
Keep this ring safe
in your purse.

120
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,225
Don't lose it. Okay?

121
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,761
Mom's been hurt, Setsuko.

122
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,096
But‐ But she'll get better soon.

123
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,199
Where is Mama?

124
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,569
In the hospital, in Nishinomiya.

125
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,875
[Seita] We'll stay here at the
school tonight.

126
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:25,612
Then tomorrow, we'll go stay
at our aunt's house near
the hospital.

127
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,348
Okay? Setsuko?

128
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,317
Understand?

129
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:45,599
We're all staying on the
second floor. Why don't
you stop by later?

130
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,272
Thank you for all your
kindness, we will.

131
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,575
See you later, then.
Bye now.

132
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,245
Want some?

133
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,481
I want to see Mama.

134
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,451
Maybe tomorrow,
it's too late now.

135
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,555
[Setsuko crying]

136
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,244
[Seita] Setsuko, watch me,
I'm good at this!

137
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:33,139
[Obayashi] I haven't unbandaged
her. Believe me you don't want
to see the body.

138
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:37,210
With this heat we're having,
she'll have to go on the
truck today.

139
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,529
[Obayashi] Where's your sister?

140
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:59,132
[Seita] In Nishinomiya,
we have a distant aunt there.

141
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,367
[Seita] I think she'll take
care of us.

142
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,537
[Obayashi] I see, lucky for you.

143
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,341
I'd better get back to work.
Good luck to you.

144
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:37,564
Mama!

145
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,567
Where's Mama?

146
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,403
What's the matter?
Is she still sick?

147
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:46,006
Yeah, yeah she's still sick.

148
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,473
Welcome back.

149
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,879
How is your mother?
Is she at Kaisei?

150
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:55,415
Yeah.

151
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:57,450
[Aunt] Lucky your dad's
in the Navy.

152
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:01,688
You get to have a truck help
move you over here!

153
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:05,626
I've laid out futons and
mosquito netting in your room.

154
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:06,860
Thank you.

155
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:19,506
I don't understand.
Doesn't Mama need her ring?

156
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,609
Did she give it to me
to keep for her?

157
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,516
Just be careful you don't
lose it.

158
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,491
Setsuko...

159
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,564
When Mom's a little better,
I'll take you to see her.

160
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,668

00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:07,728
Mama's in a grave too.

473
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:16,469
Auntie told me about it.

474
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,074
She said that Mama died, and
that she's in a grave now.

475
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:54,007
We'll go and visit her
grave sometime.

476
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,009
Do you remember the
graveyard, Setsuko?

477
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:59,780
That really pretty one
out near Nunobiki?

478
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,951
That's where she is now, resting
peacefully under a big
camphor tree.

479
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:08,488
Why do fireflies have
to die so soon?

480
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:45,892
[kids laughing]

481
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:48,762
[Boy 1] Wow. Looks like
somebody's living here.

482
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:51,832
[Boy 2] They probably
lost their house.

483
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:54,067
[Boy 3] Maybe it's some
crazy hermit.

484
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:57,137
[Boy 2] It's a swing.

485
00:58:57,237 --> 00:58:59,239
[Boy 3] Hey a kid lives here.

486
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:00,641
What's this?

487
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:03,043
Rest in Peace! Rest in Peace!

488
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:07,080
Aw I wish it was real food.

489
00:59:08,248 --> 00:59:09,449
[Boy 4] It says "Setsuko."

490
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,517
Who's Setsuko?

491
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:13,253
Look guys! Dried out frog guts!

492
00:59:13,353 --> 00:59:14,788
Who'd wanna eat that?

493
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:17,223
Nobody I know would ever
eat this stuff!

494
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:23,496
Ground soybeans? Yegh!

495
00:59:23,597 --> 00:59:25,666
And I thought the food I got
was bad!

496
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:28,301
A ghost, a ghost! Aah!

497
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,075
Hey! Wait up!

498
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:46,252
[Seita] I've traded everything
for rice, even my mom's kimono.

499
00:59:46,352 --> 00:59:48,221
There's nothing left to trade.

500
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:51,291
Please, I can pay you good
money for the rice.

501
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:56,229
Sorry, I can't trade or sell
anything to you.

502
00:59:56,329 --> 01:00:00,701
I'm a farmer, but I'm afraid
even I don't have any rice
to share.

503
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,943
Don't you have any other
relatives to help you?

504
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:12,178
I don't know how to contact
any of them.

505
01:00:12,278 --> 01:00:16,750
Then take my advice and just
go back to the woman in
the village.

506
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,686
Look, everything's rationed now.

507
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:23,023
You can't survive outside
of the system.

508
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:26,727
Just swallow your pride
and apologize to her.

509
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:35,201
Thanks, anyway. I'll just go
and ask someone else.

510
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:41,274
[Farmer] You're the son of
a navy man, aren't you?
So try to be brave.

511
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:47,213
[Man] Look out!

512
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:13,974
Is it good?

513
01:01:54,414 --> 01:01:55,749
Oh no!

514
01:02:56,242 --> 01:02:58,178
[Seita] It doesn't matter if you
like it or not.

515
01:02:58,278 --> 01:02:59,212
You have to eat!

516
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:01,548
You need to, so you can
grow up strong!

517
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:04,885
[Setsuko] Seita...

518
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,592
I feel... My insides feel
really funny.

519
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:13,627
Are you cold?

520
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:16,462
I've been having diarrhea.

521
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:23,136
[Farmer] Hey you!

522
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:26,306
[Seita] Hey sorry!

523
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:29,142
Sorry! I didn't mean to.
Forgive me!

524
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:34,414
My sister's sick, I just wanted
to get her some sugar!
I'm sorry!

525
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:39,052
Yeah, sure! Stealing food's
a serious crime in wartime!

526
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,421
You god damned!

527
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,190
Come back here!

528
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:57,237
What the hell?! Potatoes too?!

529
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:00,406
So, YOU'RE the one who's been
stealing my crops!

530
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:02,242
[Seita] I'm sorry!

531
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:03,476
[Setsuko] Seita?

532
01:04:04,878 --> 01:04:06,279
I'll never do it again, I swear!

533
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:08,248
I promise you'll never see
me again!

534
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:11,885
Tell it to the cops! I'll take
you there myself!

535
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:13,419
[Farmer] Now walk!
[Seita] Please.

536
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,355
[Farmer] I hope they lock you up
for the rest of the war!

537
01:04:15,455 --> 01:04:16,923
[Seita] Please, she's sick! She
needs me.
[Setsuko] Seita. Seita!

538
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:18,525
No. Ah... Ah!

539

[Farmer] MOVE!

Seita...Seita...

543
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:38,912
Based on what you both
told me, the nature of the
crime is very clear.

544
01:04:39,012 --> 01:04:41,014
So I thank you for the
information sir,

545
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:42,949
and I'll take care of this.
You may go now.

546
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:45,385
But, officer!

547
01:04:45,485 --> 01:04:47,921
You've knocked this poor
kid around enough.

548
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,826
I'm even tempted to call it...

549
01:04:52,926 --> 01:04:54,194
Assault!

550
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:56,630
I... w‐ but‐... Thank you, sir!

551
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,136
I suppose you heard about
the latest attack.

552
01:05:05,672 --> 01:05:08,675
Would you like a glass of
water or something, son?

Should I get a doctor for you,
Seita? What parts hurts?
can help you.

Can it wait a little bit?

This pumpkin is great.

Tastes like sweet bean jelly.

[Setsuko] But I don't
like that stuff.

Look, if you don't eat,
Dad will blame ME for it.

Come on, ready? I'll even help
you. Okay?

Now come on cheer up and eat!

Once you're better, I'll take
you to the beach again, Setsuko.

I promise.

Prickly heat, and rashes all

Please, doctor, you have to help
her! Medicine, please!

594
01:11:45,038 --> 01:11:50,043
Give her some medicine? All this
child needs is some food.

buy you all the food you need.

[Setsuko] I don't want anything.
You can have it.

Well that's just typical,
isn't it?

we get our "divine wind" AFTER
we surrender. Figures...

we lost the war?!

621
01:14:26,432 --> 01:14:29,002
Yeah, surrendered
unconditionally.

622
01:14:30,571 --> 01:14:32,138
But what about the fleet?
Are they...

623
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:36,076
All gone. The whole fleet's been
sent to the bottom of the sea,

not one left afloat.

What?! Was my Dad's ship
sunk too?!

Is that why he hasn't written
me back?!

01:14:46,186 --> 01:14:47,521
Crazy kid.

629
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:53,393
Damn him!

630
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:54,828
God damn him.

631
01:15:09,576 --> 01:15:11,211
I'm so hungry.

632
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:18,151
Daddy...

633
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,193
Now Dad's gone too.

634
01:15:29,395 --> 01:15:30,764
He's dead too.

635
01:15:31,565 --> 01:15:33,333
[plane flying overhead]

636
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:34,768
Dad...

637
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:25,619
I'm sorry that I'm so late,
Setsuko. I'll go ahead and
start making up some rice.

638
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:29,723
♪Up they go.♪

639
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,593
♪And down again.♪

640
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:37,631
Oh, the firefly's stopped.

641
01:16:37,731 --> 01:16:40,333
I bought us some chicken
and I got a few eggs.

642
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:43,970
And I also have...

643
01:16:52,846 --> 01:16:54,815
Setsuko, what's in your mouth?!

644
01:16:59,052 --> 01:17:01,955
This is a marble.
It isn't a drop!

645
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:08,762
I brought you something really
special. I know that you're
going to like it.

646
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:15,068
[Setsuko] Seita, have one.

647
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,974
One what, Setsuko?

648
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:23,176
Rice ball.

649
01:17:25,245 --> 01:17:27,347
I made them for you.

650
01:17:27,447 --> 01:17:32,953
Here. Here have‐ have one.

651
01:17:37,357 --> 01:17:39,192
You don't want them?

652
01:17:40,193 --> 01:17:41,327
[Seita] Setsuko!

653
01:17:50,737 --> 01:17:54,374
Look here, watermelon.
And I didn't steal it.

654
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,354
Here, eat it.

655
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:18,264
It's good...

656
01:18:22,603 --> 01:18:26,339
Hold on to this and I'll go make
us some rice gruel with eggs.

657
01:18:34,147 --> 01:18:36,216
I'll leave the melon right
here for you.

658
01:18:38,318 --> 01:18:39,452
Okay?

659
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:42,022
Seita...

660
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:44,357
Thank you.

661
01:19:09,415 --> 01:19:10,817
[Seita] She never woke up.

662
01:20:05,038 --> 01:20:07,508
There you go, charcoal for
the cremation.

663
01:20:07,608 --> 01:20:11,912
Now since it's a little child,
you really should do it
at a temple.

664
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:17,350
About the body, it should be
lightly dressed and use
beanstalks for a good fire.

665
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:20,353
In spite of it all,
it's a lovely day.

666
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:27,961
[girls laughing]

667
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:30,163
[Girl 1] It's good to
be home!

668
01:20:30,263 --> 01:20:32,198
[Girl 2] It hasn't changed
a bit!

669
01:20:34,968 --> 01:20:36,870
[Girl 1] The old phonograph!

670
01:20:39,973 --> 01:20:41,908
[Girl 2] I've missed this view.

671
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,625
[Setsuko] Come back soon!

672
01:25:12,412 --> 01:25:15,516
[Seita] The next morning, I put
some of Setsuko's ashes into

673
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:19,352
the candy tin, and then
climbed down the hill.

674
01:25:19,452 --> 01:25:21,655
I never went back to
the shelter.

675
01:25:29,029 --> 01:25:30,363
[Setsuko] Seita!

676
01:25:47,881 --> 01:25:49,282
Time for bed, okay?
