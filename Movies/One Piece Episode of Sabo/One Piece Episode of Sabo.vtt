Sorry to keep you waiting
so long, my brother.

[SABO] I do have
some good news, though.

Seems Luffy's well on his way
to becoming King of the Pirates.

Our little brother's

You know, it's funny.

Since you've been gone,
for some reason,

00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:58.567 position:24% line:83% align:start

I'm not as fast as you!

They're a million miles away.

[SABO] The three of us,
we're gonna leave this country.

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:40.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're gonna sail
the ocean as pirates

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
and see the whole world!

I won't lose and I won't run!

00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:46.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
People can fear me or
they can respect me.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
But either way,
I'm gonna be a legend!

brothers is to share some sakÃ©!

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ACE] So from here on out,
we're brothers!

A bear!

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:14.434 position:19% line:83% align:start

you think you're doing?

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:23.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
You only went to sea because
you were following me!

But I've got my own damn
life without you in it!

You really wanna save me?

A scrawny wimp like you?

That's just humiliating!

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:36.634 position:19% line:83% align:start

Go home, Luffy!

a washed up failure.

A failure?

No one gets away
with mocking Pops.

00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:23.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whitebeard is the greatest

you hear me?

It's over.

00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:38.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can feel my life
slipping away.

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:40.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is it.

00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:43.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ACE] Maybe I never
should've been born.

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:47.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe I never deserved to
live in the first place.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you promised me
when we were little kids.

00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:52.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
You said you'd protect
your little brother!

00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:54.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then you promised me
you wouldn't die!

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:56.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
Remember that?

00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:58.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
I hardly had a will to live.

00:08:58.734 --> 00:09:02.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Or at lease I wouldn't have.
If it weren't for Sabo.

00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:03.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
And for you, of course.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
I had to look after my
little brother all the time.

00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:11.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I didn't, then I was afraid
you'd turn out like me.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you see Dadan,
tell her I said hello,

00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:18.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
and thank her for
putting up with us.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
I never thought I'd
miss a woman like her,

00:09:21.634 --> 00:09:24.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I guess dying does
funny things to you.

00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:27.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't say that--
You're not gonna die!

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:34.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a shame, but when
you fulfill your dream,

00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:37.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
I won't be around to see it.

00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:42.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
[ACE] It's fine.
I have faith you can do it.

00:09:42.367 --> 00:09:45.334 position:13% line:89% align:start
'Cause you're my brother.

00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:50.567 position:10% line:83% align:start

anymore-- I'm too weak.

00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:54.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
Could you tell everyone else
what I'm about to say?

Pops, my family,

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:04.567 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:06.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank you all.

00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:09.734 position:27% line:83% align:start

So I promise, I'm not gonna die.

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:08.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SABO] You probably
didn't know I was alive,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
or that I was with the
Revolutionary Army.

00:11:10.634 --> 00:11:13.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
That means Ivankov
is a friend of mine.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
So I heard all about what
happened at Marineford.

00:11:17.467 --> 00:11:19.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I couldn't be there.

right to be angry with me.

see you again for so long.

00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:37.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
But not like this.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:45.100 position:7% line:83% align:start

It's all that I can do now.

What's the situation?

00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:20.434 position:13% line:83% align:start

the army's not buying our food.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now as you know,

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
King Riku was ousted
from the throne

00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:27.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
and Don Quixote Doflamingo
took over ten years ago.

00:13:27.501 --> 00:13:32.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SABO] Mm-hmm. The official
story is that King Riku suddenly

00:13:32.234 --> 00:13:34.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
turned on his own
people one day.

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:35.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then Doflamingo
saved the country

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:37.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
by defeating him
and taking command.

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:39.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whether that's true or not,

00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:43.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
there were no issues with weapon
smuggling during Riku's reign.

00:13:43.567 --> 00:13:45.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
In other words,
we have reason to believe

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
Doflamingo's in on
the operation.

00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:19.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
but the reality is quite
horrifying, isn't it?

00:15:21.267 --> 00:15:24.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
I assume Doflamingo's
responsible for this, too?

[TOY CHEF] Here is your Fairy
Pumpkin Gazpacho, sir! Enjoy!

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:34.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KOALA] By the way,
one of Riku's daughters

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
is a member of the
Don Quixote Family now.

00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:39.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's got to be a real
story behind that one.

00:15:39.767 --> 00:15:42.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KOALA] Unfortunately,
we don't know the details.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
Her name is Violet, though.

00:15:43.767 --> 00:15:46.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
She has extraordinary
powers of perception.

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:48.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
They say she's clairvoyant.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sounds like a pain.

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:51.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
Does that mean she
knows we're here?

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KOALA] Well, she hasn't
blown our cover yet,

00:15:53.467 --> 00:15:56.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
so let's hope for the best.

00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:57.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
Riku also has a granddaughter.

00:15:57.834 --> 00:16:01.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
She fights as a gladiator
in the Colosseum.

00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:06.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wow, that's quite the
interesting family he's got.

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:09.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, do we know where they're
producing all these weapons yet?

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:12.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOALA]
I'm afraid not.

00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:14.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're still working
that part out.

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:16.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've seen what appeared
to be trading ships arrive

00:16:16.734 --> 00:16:17.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the middle of the night,

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:20.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
but they always find
some way to vanish.

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:23.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the time morning comes, it's
like they never came at all.

00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:27.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
My guess is there's a hidden
port somewhere on the island.

00:16:27.501 --> 00:16:29.767 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SABO]
Hmm. Underground, you think?

00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:32.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, probably.
Thanks to tight security,

00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:34.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
there are a few places
I haven't checked out yet.

00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:36.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
The palace, of course.

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:38.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
And the Colosseum.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SABO]
Guarding the Colosseum?

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
That sounds fishy.

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:45.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna check the
place out tonight, okay?

Hey, got some news.

00:17:10.734 --> 00:17:14.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
They announced the prize for the
tournament and it's a big one.

Is that really relevant?

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:18.367 position:21% line:83% align:start

so it must be something crazy.

So are you gonna win and
be a billionaire, Hack?

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
Earlier today.

You'll want to hear this.

it's better than money.

[NARRATOR] Luffy arrives in
Dressrossa with his new allies:

00:17:52.734 --> 00:17:56.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
Kin'emon from the Wano Kingdom
and the pirate Trafalgar Law.

00:17:56.767 --> 00:18:00.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Also present is their
captive, Caesar Clown.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
The crew quickly
splits into three teams,

with one staying on the boat.

00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:07.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
Another heads to the
small island of Greenbit,

00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:09.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
where they have arranged
a meeting with Doflamingo

in order to hand over
his associate, Caesar.

with plans to launch an attack
on Doflamingo's SMILE Factory,

It's a once-in-

The king has entrusted us with

00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:36.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
an extraordinary prize
for today's show!

00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:38.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
And here to share the news

00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:43.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
is our fine ruler himself,
King Doflamingo!

Yeah! It's him! The king!

00:18:49.534 --> 00:18:51.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hello, everyone.

00:18:51.234 --> 00:18:52.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here's a little story.

00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:56.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
If someone with Devil Fruit
powers happens to die,

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
then somewhere in the world,
their fruit will appear.

00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:02.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
Two years ago, a famous
pirate lost his life

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the War of the Best
at Marineford,

00:19:04.334 --> 00:19:06.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
making his Devil Fruit
"available."

00:19:06.334 --> 00:19:08.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
And after some
effort on my part,

00:19:08.601 --> 00:19:12.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
it just so happens it's made
its way to our fair city.

00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:15.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm speaking, of course,
of the Devil Fruit

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
once belonging to the son
of the King of the Pirates.

00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:21.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
Fire Fist Ace.

00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:27.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if he met his maker young,
Ace's exploits are well known.

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:30.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
His fruit has been in high
demand since his demise.

00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:31.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
And so today,

00:19:31.334 --> 00:19:34.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I offer it to the winner
of this tournament!

00:19:34.133 --> 00:19:37.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's a Logia, the most coveted
type of Devil Fruit power!

00:19:37.534 --> 00:19:40.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is the Flame Flame Fruit!

[chuckles] However,
a special prize also requires

00:19:57.567 --> 00:20:00.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
a special trial.

00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:04.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
Therefore, Mister Diamante,

That was Ace's power--

I'm not gonna let someone
he didn't even know take it!

like a memento?

00:21:31.634 --> 00:21:34.501 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's cool!
I like this place already!

00:21:34.534 --> 00:21:37.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Listen, Luffy, you can do
whatever you want in there,

00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:39.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
but you gotta
keep up your disguise!

00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:41.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's easy!

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:42.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KYROS]
Greetings!

00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:45.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you senior citizens require
assistance with anything?

00:21:45.767 --> 00:21:48.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY laughs]
This little guy is funny!

00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:50.400 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KYROS]
Oh, am I?

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:51.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then how about this?

00:21:51.767 --> 00:21:53.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
Or this maybe?

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
--[LUFFY laughs]
--Funny enough?

00:21:54.534 --> 00:21:57.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY] Yeah, real cute.
Now would you move?

00:21:57.434 --> 00:22:01.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh! I'm in the way.
Please excuse me!

00:22:01.734 --> 00:22:07.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
[GLADIATORS grunting]

00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:09.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE ATTENDANT A] This is the
waiting room for our gladiators.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Sweet! They're
all here to fight?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder if they're
as tough as they look!

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
He's gonna get
slaughtered out there.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let the guy have his fun.

00:22:29.367 --> 00:22:32.300 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right! [laughs]

00:22:33.367 --> 00:22:38.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Ooh. That's one
awesome-looking warrior guy.

00:22:38.334 --> 00:22:39.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
[REBECCA]
Taken an interest in Kyros?

00:22:39.601 --> 00:22:41.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hm? Who're you?

00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:43.167 position:35% line:83% align:start
[REBECCA]
My name is Rebecca.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm a gladiator.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't quite stack up
to Kyros, though.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's the greatest warrior
this Colosseum has ever known.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Three thousand battles,
three thousand victories.

00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:56.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Wow, he sounds pretty strong.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.300 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, he was.

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:00.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
Although no one in the city
seems to remember him at all.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ha? I don't get it,
but whatever.

00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:07.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
The guy has a manly statue.
That's all I need to know.

00:23:07.334 --> 00:23:09.734 position:33% line:83% align:start
By the way,
which block are you in?

00:23:09.767 --> 00:23:10.400 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
C.

00:23:10.434 --> 00:23:13.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's good. I'm in Block D.

00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:16.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
[REBECCA]
Best of luck out there.

00:23:16.501 --> 00:23:18.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
To both of us.

00:23:18.767 --> 00:23:19.734 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:21.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.801 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BURGESS]
Happy Store!

00:23:26.834 --> 00:23:30.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] The tournament began
with over 550 contestants.

00:23:30.501 --> 00:23:32.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
But in the first
block of fighters,

00:23:32.167 --> 00:23:34.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
only one man is left standing.

00:23:34.234 --> 00:23:35.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
[BURGESS grunts]

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh my! That's Jesus Burgess!

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
That bag on his head was
hiding the terrible truth!

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
The notorious pirate
from Blackbeard's crew

00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:45.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
entered the tournament
as "Mr. Store"

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:49.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
and single-handedly
devastated all of Block A!

00:23:49.267 --> 00:23:52.167 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
Aw man, I didn't
know he was here.

00:23:54.534 --> 00:23:55.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right, Block B.

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:58.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's time for you
to enter the ring!

00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:03.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HACK] Don't worry, I'll
get the Flame Flame Fruit.

00:24:03.467 --> 00:24:05.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
You investigate the
Colosseum as planned.

00:24:05.834 --> 00:24:06.901 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SABO]
Roger that.

00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:10.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] And now, 138 contenders
will take the stage

00:24:10.734 --> 00:24:12.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
for the Block B qualifiers!

00:24:12.434 --> 00:24:15.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
The last man standing
will proceed to the finals!

00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:19.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
So let's sound the bell and
get this show on the road!

00:24:19.234 --> 00:24:21.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
[GLADIATORS yelling]

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:33.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
A Four Thousand Brick Fist
should do the job! [yells]

00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:37.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, who are you?

00:24:37.834 --> 00:24:39.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
[COLOSSEUM GUARD B]
This area is off limits!

00:24:39.467 --> 00:24:41.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
I need a bathroom!

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
[COLOSSEUM GUARD A]
You can't use ours! Turn around!

00:24:43.267 --> 00:24:45.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
[ANTSY GLADIATOR]
I can't hold it!

00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:56.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SABO] It's just one
dead end after another.

00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:04.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
There must be an entrance
to the basement somewhere.

00:25:04.267 --> 00:25:06.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
[APPALLED WOMAN A screams]

00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:11.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO groans] Aw yeah,
that's the stuff, baby. Huh?

00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:13.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not too proud
to strike from behind

00:25:13.634 --> 00:25:16.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you won't take
this seriously.

00:25:16.067 --> 00:25:19.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'd better finish with
that quickly, you degenerate!

00:25:19.067 --> 00:25:20.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa, hold up!

00:25:20.467 --> 00:25:22.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't just stop.
I'm defenseless here!

Four Thousand Brick Fist!

[GLADIATORS screaming]

No one packs more
power in a punch

00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:25.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
than the Fighting King!

I, uh, think we have
our winner for Block B!

Wait! Someone survived!

It's not over!

Barrier!

so you can't lay a finger on me.

00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:43.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now, Barrier Crush!

00:26:51.634 --> 00:26:54.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] We don't have any rules
against indecent exposure,

00:26:54.634 --> 00:26:58.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I'm afraid Bartolomeo
is the Block B champion!

[NARRATOR] In a flash, the first
two rounds are finished,

you useless toys!

Would you pull it together?

You can either get up
or get scrapped!

is a Triple X-ranked boxer,

00:29:43.434 --> 00:29:48.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
the man known as the
"Destruction Cannon." Ideo!

00:29:53.634 --> 00:29:55.400 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GATZ]
And you can't miss this one!

00:29:55.434 --> 00:29:58.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
A warrior from Elbaf they call
the "Pirate Mercenary"!

00:29:58.801 --> 00:30:02.767 position:27% line:5% align:start
Say hello to the
Giant, Hajrudin!

00:30:12.234 --> 00:30:13.667 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GATZ]
Last but not least

00:30:13.701 --> 00:30:17.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
is the Grim Reaper
of the Colloseum.

A raging beast known
only as the Brutal Bull!

00:30:27.734 --> 00:30:31.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] Now, all 139
competitors from Block C

00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:34.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is an outstanding lineup!

00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:36.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
One of them could very well
take the Flame Flame Fruit!

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:40.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] This is gonna be fun!

00:30:40.167 --> 00:30:45.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] Let's sound the bell
and get this show on the road!

00:30:45.067 --> 00:30:46.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
[bell dings]

00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:50.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so ready!

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, I hear you've set
your sights on Lucy.

00:30:57.601 --> 00:30:59.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
That is none of your business.

00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:03.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles] Sorry, but
that man ain't yours to kill.

00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:07.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
That transparent disguise of his
didn't fool you either, I see.

00:31:07.567 --> 00:31:11.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
Regardless, I will
have him as my prey.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles] Sorry, but
our connection runs too deep.

00:31:15.734 --> 00:31:18.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO] Ever since that
day I saw him at Loguetown,

00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:21.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
my life has never been the same.

00:31:21.234 --> 00:31:24.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] I'm the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

00:31:28.067 --> 00:31:30.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO]
You're my hero, Luffy.

00:31:30.133 --> 00:31:33.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope someday I'm
half as cool as you.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, on the
nearby island of Greenbit,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
Law and the others prepared to
hand over Caesar to Doflamingo.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.334 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LAW]
All right, that's the beach

00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:45.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
on the south side of the island.

00:31:45.501 --> 00:31:48.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
We agreed to drop you off
there at three o'clock.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Hey, I think that
shipwreck is pretty recent.

00:31:50.834 --> 00:31:53.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
And it looks like a Navy vessel!

00:31:53.234 --> 00:31:56.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CAESAR] What? This was
not a part of the plan!

00:31:56.367 --> 00:31:57.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
Abort the mission!

00:31:57.701 --> 00:31:58.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
I didn't set you up.

00:31:58.767 --> 00:32:01.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm with the
Straw Hats, remember?

00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:04.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't want the Navy sticking
their noses in this either.

00:32:04.834 --> 00:32:08.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
We still have 15 minutes before
Doflamingo's scheduled to show.

00:32:08.367 --> 00:32:09.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
Move, you two.

00:32:09.467 --> 00:32:12.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Go do some surveillance
and find a sniping position.

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:14.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
Right. We'll get on it.

00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:19.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is this place?

00:32:24.234 --> 00:32:25.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why are you locked away?

00:32:25.567 --> 00:32:27.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
None of your business!

00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:30.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
Who are you with?

00:32:30.467 --> 00:32:33.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, anyway,
we're convict gladiators.

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:35.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
We were sent here
and forced to fight

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
because we protested
the Don Quixote Family.

00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:42.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
We're tossed out there to die
as part of the entertainment.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no hope of escape.

00:32:44.701 --> 00:32:46.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ten years back,

00:32:46.601 --> 00:32:49.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
before Doflamingo became
king of this place,

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:52.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
the Colosseum matches weren't
fights to the death like now.

00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:55.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
All we can do is
wait for our death.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] We've got lots of
strong fighters today.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
But one in particular literally
stands above the rest!

00:33:02.467 --> 00:33:07.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
[HAJRUDIN yells]

00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:11.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GATZ]
Let's hear it for Hajrudin!

00:33:11.634 --> 00:33:15.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
[HAJRUDIN] If I can get my hands
on that Flame Flame Fruit,

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll be the King of the Giants!

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:20.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] Who can stop
this raging behemoth?

00:33:20.334 --> 00:33:22.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
Actually, speaking of which.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
We've got another raging
behemoth right here!

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
This fighter once killed
21 death row prisoners

00:33:27.334 --> 00:33:28.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
in a single battle!

00:33:28.701 --> 00:33:33.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course, I'm referring
to the Brutal Bull!

00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:35.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
And yet someone has
found a way to tame,

00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:38.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
or at least ride
this savage beast!

[CROWD laughing]

This guy's nuts! I love it!

00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:43.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] I still don't
know if he can fight,

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
but this bearded bull-rider has
quickly become a crowd-favorite!

root for the madman, myself!

00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:26.534 position:35% line:89% align:start

Not likely.

some fire in you.

old dude, but I won't lose!

You don't know a damned thing!

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
In this state, I am but
a wolf without fangs,

00:46:48.801 --> 00:46:52.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
and yet, for all your mettle,
you still struggle against me.

00:46:52.467 --> 00:46:54.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
Better to quit now.

00:46:54.467 --> 00:46:56.767 position:27% line:83% align:start

[CHIN JAO] If Rayleigh has
chosen a mediocrity such as you

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
as his champion in this new age,

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
then he has grown
senile, I fear.

00:47:04.234 --> 00:47:07.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whitebeard's passing was a
greater loss than I thought.

00:47:07.767 --> 00:47:09.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
Not that I can blame the Navy.

00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:11.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
They had the right
of it two years back.

devil's blood in his veins

00:47:14.634 --> 00:47:17.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
was the genius that
can shape an era!

00:47:20.067 --> 00:47:21.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've already proven that you
can't stand up to the Admirals!

How well do you think you'll
fair against the Emperors, then?

00:47:26.667 --> 00:47:28.801 position:19% line:89% align:start

I'll settle this.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
Consider this your
trial by fire!

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
Fueled by over 30 years
of contempt towards Garp.

00:48:05.667 --> 00:48:07.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
I shall put an end to

with a single blow!

name until my dying day, Garp!

00:48:20.534 --> 00:48:21.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I shall curse your children

00:48:21.834 --> 00:48:23.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
and your grandchildren
all the same!

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the heck is that?

00:48:25.267 --> 00:48:28.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm in awe! It's huge!

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Lucy's arm has become
mysteriously gigantic!

00:48:35.434 --> 00:48:37.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIN JAO] Garp, just as
you took my treasure,

00:48:37.634 --> 00:48:41.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
I shall take the life of
your grandson in one blow!

00:48:41.834 --> 00:48:44.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
I won't be satisfied

Lucy!

He has the momentum,

00:50:09.601 --> 00:50:11.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
but can Lucy take
it all the way?

00:50:11.834 --> 00:50:15.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just one round left,
then the final battle

00:50:15.067 --> 00:50:18.567 position:13% line:83% align:start

They'll not only
face each other,

but Diamante as well
in the last match!

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, Chin Jao's
extremely mighty cranium

00:50:44.434 --> 00:50:46.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
has rendered the arena unusable,

00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:50.701 position:10% line:83% align:start

delay before Block D begins.

When you're worth 400 million,

my crybaby little brother

would turn into such
a force of nature?

That's a ton of cash!
What happened?

We worked hard for this.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wonder how much
it would cost us

to buy a really
cool pirate ship.

We'll kill him.

He and Sabo have quite a
reputation around these parts.

00:53:09.701 --> 00:53:10.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
This isn't good.

00:53:10.801 --> 00:53:12.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
You can say that again.

How was I supposed to know those
guys were working with Bluejam?

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:25.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
just so he can
listen to you scream.

01:08:56.167 --> 01:09:00.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it's got a dark side,
and man, is it ever dark.

01:09:00.567 --> 01:09:02.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
If we can simply
knock out Sugar,

01:09:02.501 --> 01:09:04.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
we'll stop the
effects of her power,

01:09:04.467 --> 01:09:07.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
and all those turned into
toys will be human again.

01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:09.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
Their loved ones
were taken away.

01:09:09.501 --> 01:09:10.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
Their children!

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Once the curse has
finally been lifted,

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
they will be eager to get
revenge on Doflamingo.

01:09:16.367 --> 01:09:19.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since everyone's memories
have also been altered,

01:09:19.234 --> 01:09:22.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
when the truth comes out,
the country will be in chaos!

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is the hottest
spice in the world.

01:09:24.133 --> 01:09:25.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's called Tatababasco!

01:09:25.634 --> 01:09:28.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
If we can make Sugar eat this,
she'll pass out for sure!

01:09:28.434 --> 01:09:31.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
[KYROS] Mm. This operation must
succeed, no matter the cost!

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
In one fell swoop, we can
topple the Don Quixote Family,

01:09:34.367 --> 01:09:37.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
and return this country to its
rightful ruler--King Riku!

01:09:37.501 --> 01:09:39.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ALL cheer]

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a long shot,
and I know it's not the plan,

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
but when I saw all those brave
little dudes, ready to fight,

01:09:45.601 --> 01:09:47.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
I knew I had to stand with them.

01:09:47.467 --> 01:09:49.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the right thing to do!

01:09:49.234 --> 01:09:52.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
Luffy. We got a whole
country that needs us,

01:09:52.367 --> 01:09:54.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I'm not backing down!

01:09:54.734 --> 01:09:56.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
All right then.

01:09:56.367 --> 01:09:58.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
You go ahead and kick some ass!

01:09:58.467 --> 01:10:00.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll join up when I'm through.

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wow! Thank you, Captain.

01:10:03.267 --> 01:10:04.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:10.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
That seems dangerous.
What is it?

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
Looks like it's getting close.

01:10:11.701 --> 01:10:13.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
[KIN'EMON screams]

01:10:15.067 --> 01:10:16.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the heck?

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Traffy! And Mingo?

01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:26.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
[panting]

01:10:26.534 --> 01:10:28.300 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, get up!

01:10:28.334 --> 01:10:30.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
This wasn't supposed to happen!

01:10:30.567 --> 01:10:35.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
You pissed me off
for the last time, Law.

01:10:35.167 --> 01:10:36.267 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:10:45.133 --> 01:10:48.133 position:38% line:89% align:start
Traffy!

01:10:50.067 --> 01:10:51.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Mingo!

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why'd you shoot him?
What is this?

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, hello, Straw Hat.

01:10:55.634 --> 01:10:57.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you mind your
own damned business

01:10:57.601 --> 01:10:59.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
before I shoot you, too?

01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:02.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
A while back,
Law used to work for me.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
All I'm doing is
settling an old score.

01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:06.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll distract him. You grab Law!

01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:08.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
That I shall!

01:11:08.767 --> 01:11:11.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

01:11:17.267 --> 01:11:20.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
So heavy. What's happening?

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ZORO groans]

01:11:24.267 --> 01:11:26.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sir Zoro, no!

01:11:29.434 --> 01:11:30.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
[KIN'EMON groans]

01:11:30.534 --> 01:11:34.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
Damn it! Hold on! I'm coming!

01:11:34.701 --> 01:11:39.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aw man, sea prism stone?

01:11:51.133 --> 01:11:53.133 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MARINES]
Admiral!

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
So he's an Admiral?
Well that explains things.

01:11:59.234 --> 01:12:00.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
That guy?

01:12:00.467 --> 01:12:01.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
We meet again.

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:05.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems that fate works
in mysterious ways.

01:12:05.534 --> 01:12:09.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
We're going to the palace now,
old friend. Come on.

01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:11.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you dare.

01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:13.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not over.

01:12:13.334 --> 01:12:14.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
Move in and capture Zoro!

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.467 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Tch.

01:12:16.501 --> 01:12:21.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:24.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? Now you're all
just gonna fly away?

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
We gotta get moving.

01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:35.100 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mingo!

01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:36.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
Get out of there, okay?

01:12:36.534 --> 01:12:38.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be
an exit somewhere.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll try 'n lose these Marines
and meet up with you later!

01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:42.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

01:12:42.534 --> 01:12:44.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hold on, Traffy,
we'll find a way to save you!

01:12:44.834 --> 01:12:49.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
And after that, I'm gonna
kick Doflamingo's ass!

01:13:00.634 --> 01:13:03.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
All right, good!
Haven't tried this way!

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
More stupid bars!

01:13:07.734 --> 01:13:10.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's gotta be some way out.

01:13:11.133 --> 01:13:12.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey, it's rooster-head guy!

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
Think you could help me?

01:13:15.367 --> 01:13:19.567 position:7% line:89% align:start
[screams] M-M-M-Mister Luffy!

01:13:23.367 --> 01:13:27.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO panting]
So-- So how did things go?

01:13:27.234 --> 01:13:29.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
You-- You talked
with Zoro, right?

01:13:29.601 --> 01:13:30.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
I passed out.

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:32.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that was weird.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
But thank you.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO]
It was all my pleasure!

01:13:35.334 --> 01:13:36.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, my friend is in trouble.

01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:39.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you know of a good way
to get out of here?

01:13:39.734 --> 01:13:42.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
But you gotta win
the tournament!

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
What about the fruit?

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:48.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't want just
anyone to have it.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
But what can I do?

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
My friend could die
if I don't go help.

01:13:51.801 --> 01:13:54.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry one little bit!
You can leave it to me!

01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:56.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know how much
Ace meant to you.

01:13:56.767 --> 01:13:59.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
I didn't even want
the Flame Flame Fruit!

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was only fighting so
I could give it to you.

01:14:01.067 --> 01:14:02.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
What? For real?

01:14:02.501 --> 01:14:04.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO]
Yeah, you go save your buddy.

01:14:04.367 --> 01:14:06.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll win the tournament for you!

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wow, thanks!
Glad I ran into you!

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SABO]
Luffy. Ace.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
I let you down once.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't do it again.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
That prize is going to me.

01:15:16.234 --> 01:15:18.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've got a right to it as well.

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry, Straw Hat Luffy.

01:15:20.467 --> 01:15:22.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you, punk?

01:15:22.467 --> 01:15:25.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't even have the right to
look Mister Luffy in the face!

01:15:25.501 --> 01:15:28.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you had half a brain under
that stupid hat of yours,

01:15:28.634 --> 01:15:30.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'd know that Luffy
is Ace's brother!

01:15:30.567 --> 01:15:31.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
And more than that, you'd know,

01:15:31.601 --> 01:15:33.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
he's gonna be the
King of the pirates someday!

01:15:33.767 --> 01:15:37.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've known he'd be king
ever since I was a kid.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO gasping]

01:15:47.534 --> 01:15:49.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
And what's that
supposed to mean?

01:15:49.267 --> 01:15:50.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do I know you?

01:15:50.667 --> 01:15:52.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
You don't recognize me.

01:15:52.434 --> 01:15:54.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
You want the fruit so bad?

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's go! I'll fight
you for it right now!

01:15:56.734 --> 01:15:59.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
You remember what I said?

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:02.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have a right to it.

01:16:02.133 --> 01:16:04.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
That Devil Fruit is
all that's left of Ace.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:07.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
As his brother,
it belongs to me!

01:16:07.133 --> 01:16:08.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SABO]
Is that so?

01:16:08.701 --> 01:16:10.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you have another
brother, don't you?

[gasps]

01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:17.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I did. But he's gone.

01:16:17.734 --> 01:16:19.634 position:41% line:89% align:start
He...

01:16:19.667 --> 01:16:22.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
He went to sea, but how...?

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
It can't be.

Are you...

It's been a long time,
hasn't it? Little brother.

You found us.

you crying about?

You wanna save Traffy or what?

01:17:16.567 --> 01:17:20.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course I wanna save
him and beat up Mingo.

I don't even have to
worry about Ace's fruit.

01:17:24.234 --> 01:17:26.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just can't believe he's alive.

I never knew.

Who's alive?

01:17:30.234 --> 01:17:33.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was so sure. Dogra said.

01:17:33.133 --> 01:17:36.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
He told me what happened
to him and it was awful.

01:17:36.767 --> 01:17:40.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, all this time,
I thought he was dead.

[KOALA]
So Robin's here, too, huh?

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'd like to see her again.

Glad you ran into Luffy, though.

[SABO]
I was worried.

01:17:49.834 --> 01:17:53.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought he was
gonna be mad at me.

[KOALA giggles]
Are you crying?

01:17:58.567 --> 01:18:00.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KOALA] Even if you
couldn't help Ace before,

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
you can help Luffy now.

01:18:02.467 --> 01:18:04.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
Time to leave the past behind.

01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:07.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SABO] You're right. Let me
know as soon as you find out

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:09.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
what's happening
beneath the city.

Right.

[SABO]
At any rate,

01:18:12.667 --> 01:18:16.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
I found my chance to
get Ace's Devil Fruit.

01:18:16.234 --> 01:18:18.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll carry on his will.

01:18:18.267 --> 01:18:20.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's all that I can do now.

I'll get you into the palace.

Uh, do I know you?

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was once a princess here.

My name's Violet.

You must be Rebecca.

I know you're in a difficult

won't get messy in the process,

Okay, so this is how the
battle is gonna go down!

01:30:49.667 --> 01:30:52.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
The waters here are literally
swimming with the baddest,

meanest fighting fish
the oceans have ever seen.

01:30:55.534 --> 01:30:56.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
And on one of their backs

01:30:56.767 --> 01:30:59.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
is a tiny chest with
the Flame Flame Fruit.

01:30:59.701 --> 01:31:01.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you can
guess the rules.

01:31:01.767 --> 01:31:03.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
You grab the fruit,
you don't get eaten,

01:31:03.701 --> 01:31:06.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
and you don't get
your ass kicked by me!

[CROWD cheering]

01:31:08.434 --> 01:31:09.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
I think I can do that.

[BURGESS laughs]
This'll be fun!

I'm not letting your grimy hands
anywhere near that fruit!

01:31:16.567 --> 01:31:19.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
[GATZ] You know the rules,
you know the players,

01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:22.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
now let's start the game!

01:31:23.701 --> 01:31:25.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SABO] A good,
old-fashioned brawl, huh?

01:31:25.801 --> 01:31:28.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
Haven't done this in a while.

This arena has turned out
to be a real nuisance.

On the upside,
I get to beat up that guy.
