[train rattling]

3
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm really happy that you like it so much. [giggles]

4
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,576
This is incredibly kind of you, Kumiko.

5
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,779
[Kumiko] Mm. It's a thank you for the hair pin.

6
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,215
It's great.

7
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,753
About time to head home.

8
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:27,787
[groans]

9
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:28,421
Really?

10
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,258
Yeah. I mean, unless there's something else.

11
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,228
No, but I kinda wanted to--

12
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,397
Hey! Wait up a sec.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,867
Okay.

14
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:42,469
I, uh...

15
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:43,803
Yeah?

16
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,173
You see...

17
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,243
I...I like...

18
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,378
Like what?

19
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:54,814
I like you!

20
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,419

[indistinct chattering]

29
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,819
Thank you.

30
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,987
What class are you in?

31
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,621
Class three.

32
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,056
I'm with Midori and Hazuki.

33
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,991
Uh, hey!

34
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:18,658
[giggling]

35
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,927
Are you still in college prep?

36
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,062
We never actually have to change or anything.

37
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,566
- I admit I'm a little jealous. - Why?

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,900
It must be nice.

39
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,702
Getting to be with the same friends.

40
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,938
It's not really all that important.

41
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,008
Anyway, I'm mostly fine on my own.

42
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:35,875
[chuckles]

43
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,478
That's the most Reina thing you've ever said.

44
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,414
- Hey! Attention, please. - [clapping lightly]

45
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,583
We've got a lot to cover today,

46
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,084
so let's get this meeting started.

47
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,954
Everyone here?

48
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,790
Raise your hand if you're not here.

49
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,859
- Wow. - Shut up!

50
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,327
[students giggling]

51
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,028
[Yuko] So.

52
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,231
Here's the state of the Kitauji Concert Band

53
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,832
in this brand new year we've got.

54
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,437
The truth is, we're just not ready to compete.

55
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,207
The moment school starts, we need to recruit freshmen

56
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,642
and fill these empty seats.

57
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,577
[Yuko] So we need everyone

58
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,479
out there getting people interested in the band.

59
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,581
[Hazuki] I miss the seniors.

60
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,816
Everything feels so different

61
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,418
without them here to take charge.

62
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,018
I miss them, too.

63
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,587
- I'll meet you in there. - Mm-hm.

64
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,596
[plays slowly]

65
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,668
[playing melody]

66
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,523
[euphonium continues]

67
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,465
[muffled playing]

68
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:21,447
Oh, so sorry.

69
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,784
I didn't mean to eavesdrop or anything, I promise.

70
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,619
No, it's really no problem at all!

71
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:27,887
Are you a freshman?

72
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,956
I-I'll come back later.

73
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,457
Seriously, it's all right!

74
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,426
So, uh, do you play?

75
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,427
What instrument?

76
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:34,961
Uh, well, I...

77
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,165
[girl] I haven't even decided if I wanna join or anything.

78
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,933
[Kumiko] That's fair.

79
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,537
You play the euphonium.

80
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:45,738
Yeah.

81
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,474
I thought about switching to trombone

82
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,777
when I got to high school, but...

83
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,646
If you wanted to, why didn't you?

84
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,848
Because...I like it.

85
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,119
Plus, the band was kind of short on euphonium players.

86
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,126
That was a beautiful piece you were playing.

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,161
Thank you.

88
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,229
I actually learned it from one of the seniors

89
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,697
who graduated last year.

90
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,201
That's really very sweet.

91
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,571
Well, she was a bit of a mystery if I'm honest.

92
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,340
Sorry, that wasn't quite what I meant.

93
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,041
Hm?

94
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,045
Thank you for talking to me about the band.

95
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,214
Uh, excuse me.

96
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:30,817
Uh, wait!

97
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,055
[Kumiko] Reina. Hi.

98
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,758
- A prospect? - Maybe.

99
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,393
Oh, no!

100
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,962
I forgot to ask her name!

101
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,534
[traffic rumbling]

102
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,770
Whatcha looking at?

103
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,538
The birds.

104
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:53,906
Hm.

105
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,875
[Shuichi] They're big this year.

106
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,544
Hope you weren't waiting too long.

107
00:07:59,412 --> 00:07:59,779
It's okay.

108
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,415
Actually, I only just got here, too.

109
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,883
- [birds chirping] - [chains creaking]

110
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,785
[Shuichi] What are you hoping to fill out in the bass section?

111
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,687
[Kumiko] I don't know.

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,622
I don't even know if we'll have any prospects.

113
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,559
Ideally, I guess I'd like one player per instrument.

114
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,028
It's pretty tough playing contrabass

115
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,563
without the full section behind you.

116
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,699
- [Shuichi] Want some? - [Kumiko] Sure.

117
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,267
[Kumiko] What about the trombones?

118
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,303
[Shuichi] I'd like three more, but I wouldn't say no to four.

119
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,272
[chains creaking]

120
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,440
[Shuichi] It's Chikao.

121
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,875
- [Kumiko] A text? - Mm.

122
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,010
[whispering] Excellent.

123
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,545
Hm? What was that?

124
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,413
[indistinct chattering]

125
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,048
[bright music]

126
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,851
- Wow! - [gasps]

127
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,053
This is awesome!

128
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,189
We saw you on TV!

129
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,290
That big concert last year!

130
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,926
Guess Mr. Taki and the nationals

131
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,728
were a better advertisement than we could have hoped for.

132
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,931
I played a little bit back in middle school.

133
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,065
Look at everyone!

134
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,301
I'm just a beginner, but I'll try hard!

135
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,938
Looks like we're gonna fill up the bass section and then some.

136
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,707
I know. I can't believe we got this many.

137
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,478
Would be pretty damn nice if we could see this much interest

138
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,679
from the freshmen every year.

139
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,282
[Takuya] Even so, it's best to remember...

140
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:10,683
We're the bass section.

141
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,020
We'll probably have to settle for whoever's left.

142
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,221
Yeah, I know.

143
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,692
It's not exactly the most glamorous part of the band.

144
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,993
They're dumb.

145
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,362
They just don't see how great the bass section is.

146
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,364
I'm not above bribery.

147
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,134
We offer up free candy for the bass section players only.

148
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,635
I don't think that's gonna work out

149
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,736
the way you think it will.

150
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,773
[Satsuki] Micchan! I can't believe it!

151
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,808
- Satsuki. - [Satsuki speaking Japanese]

152
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,909
This is the best day ever!

153
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,844
Look how tall she is.

154
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,114
Are you gonna join the band and play tuba?

155
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,150
I was thinking abou--

156
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,451
So nice to meet you.

157
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,686
Tuba players can follow me right his way!

158
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,522
- Actually, I wasn't sure. - We're right behind you.

159
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,957
What's your name? - I'm Satsuki Suzuki.

160
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,260
I play the tuba back at Higashi Middle School.

161
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,896
Oh! I went to Higashi, too!

162
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,331
[gasps] Are you for real?

163
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,866
Do you remember Mr. Hanamura?

164
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,702
[low voice] \"Am I interrupting the two of you?\"

165
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,137
- Of course I do. - [laughing]

166
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,939
[Hazuki] That's perfect!

167
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,342
[Hazuki] What about you?

168
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,944
My name is Mirei Suzuki.

169
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,179
I played the tuba back at Minami.

170
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,848
Two Suzukis for the price of one!

171
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,083
- You guys related? - No, we're not.

172
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,418
Micchan and I went to the same middle school.

173
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,153
At long last, we are reunited!

174
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,355
- [humming] - Hello.

175
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,123
Ah! Oh, gosh!

176
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,258
[shouting]

177
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,964
That was a close one. [giggles]

178
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,899
You actually came.

179
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,937
My name is Kanade Hisaishi, and I play the euphonium.

180
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,072
It's a pleasure to join the band.

181
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,341
- You play euphonium, too? - Yeah.

182
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,677
I wasn't totally sure I wanted to join.

183
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,314
But when I thought about it, I wanted to play with you.

184
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,048
[gasps]

185
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,183
I wanted to come by when it started.

186
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,552
Then a friend needed a little help,

187
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,353
so I had to wait a bit.

188
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,022
I was sorta nervous

189
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,356
all the euphonium spots would be taken.

190
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,291
Looks like I made it here just in time.

191
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,862
You definitely didn't need to worry about that.

192
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:03,295
Hey!

193
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,297
I promise I'll play my hardest.

194
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,800
Thank you so much for having me.

195
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,202
[music continues]

196
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,939
I'll go tell the band captain I've decided to join.

197
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:16,976
Hey, Yuko!

198
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,844
[Natsuki] We got another euphonium.

199
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,980
She seems really nice.

200
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,281
She does.

201
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,116
[birds chirping]

202
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,887
So this is where the bass section practices.

203
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,357
When Mr. Taki breaks us out into sections,

204
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,925
this classroom is all ours.

205
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,195
[Hazuki, whispering] Hey. Is that short one Tsukinaga-kun?

206
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:36,829
Yeah!

207
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,432
[Midori] He played contrabass at Ryusei,

208
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,267
so he's supposed to be awesome!

209
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:42,968
Excuse me.

210
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,338
I'd actually rather you call me \"Motomu.\"

211
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,075
Uh, if you're really sure!

212
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:49,742
[sighs]

213
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,110
I assume it won't be a problem.

214
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,514
Sure! I mean, hey, we call Kawashima here \"Sapphire.\"

215
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,083
- Midori! [grumbles] - [chuckles]

216
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,151
Tsukinaga's a unique name,

217
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,920
but I feel like I've heard it somewhere.

218
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,389
I don't know. Seems ordinary.

219
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,292
[chuckles]

220
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:07,960
[groans]

221
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,030
All right, everybody.

222
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,099
Have we got a freshman on every instrument?

223
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,266
You bet we do!

224
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,969
[Natsuki] Hm. That's wonderful.

225
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,106
Can I ask how long we usually practice for?

226
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,807
Till six PM on weekdays.

227
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,877
Though once we hit June, we'll start going to six-thirty.

228
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,047
On the weekends, we try to get started by nine AM.

229
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,851
But everyone usually gets here a little earlier.

230
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,885
That way, we can warm up.

231
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,221
[Satsuki] Wow, you guys are dedicated.

232
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,555
That's real early.

233
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,859
Well, we can't really take the instruments home,

234
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,528
so we try to get in as much rehearsal as we can here.

235
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,266
Is any practice outside of the normal hours mandatory?

236
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,468
No, not totally mandatory.

237
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,337
That's great, thank you.

238
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,573
But most everyone tries to play on their own

239
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,508
a little bit.

240
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,246
Anyway, who wants to go take a look at the instruments?

241
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,114
[Midori] Oh! Kumiko!

242
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,283
- Uh... - [Midori] First things first.

243
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:06,085
Hm.

244
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,054
I'd like to talk a little bit about competition.

245
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,891
And, of course, our many competitors.

246
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,125
- Now? - Yup!

247
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,461
When Asuka senpai graduated,

248
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,897
she officially passed this most important of torches to me.

249
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,600
[Hazuki] Oh! That's why you have the glasses!

250
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,134
[Midori] You betcha!

251
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:23,536
[Yuko] Okay. Now that we're all back,

252
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,706
Kabe-san and Oumae-san will be working with the freshmen.

253
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,908
If you need anything, they're your girls.

254
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,411
A little later, we'll be breaking into sections again.

255
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,078
[sighs]

256
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,615
So sorry, Miss Yoshikawa. Am I early?

257
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:37,416
[Yuko] No.

258
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,287
- He's dreamy. - Mm. Real dreamy.

259
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,057
He's such a great teacher.

260
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,195
It's nice to see so many fresh faces this year.

261
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,097
I have no doubt that each and every one of you

262
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,266
will add depth and harmony to our performance.

263
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,104
Our goal here isn't to create a huge band and overwhelm,

264
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,474
but to strive for utmost quality and profound results.

265
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,046
I say these same words at the beginning of every year.

266
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,849
Each student here should aspire to find personal excellence.

267
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,917
[band music]

268
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,353
We're not aiming to spoil you.

269
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,522
Nor will we leave any of you behind.

270
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:21,327
I believe that having a target in the best way.

271
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,232
Last year this was the goal we set.

272
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,435
I'll leave it to all of you to decide the goal

273
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,069
for this year.

274
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,505
Excuse me. May I borrow the chalkboard just a sec?

275
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,940
Of course.

276
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,011
[Yuko] My fellow bandmates, talk is cheap.

277
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,914
So I will make myself absolutely clear.

278
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,050
The goal we set is not an empty promise.

279
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,319
Whatever we decide, I intend to achieve.

280
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,520
[chalk squeaking]

[wincing]

282
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,260
By a show of hands, let's take a vote.

283
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,029
Do we all wanna take it easy this year?

284
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,131
- Or rather... - [slams]

285
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,534
[music continues]

286
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,403
All right, hands in the air.

287
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,407
Who here wants to claim gold at nationals this year?

288
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,317
Well, okay, then. It looks like we're all agreed.

289
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,419
And now we have ourselves a goal.

290
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,721
This year, we take gold at nationals.

291
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,458
I can guarantee that we will face challenges along the way.

292
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,561
But I also know that we can overcome them.

293
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,464
- We can do this! - [all] Yes!

294
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:34,566
Very well, then.

295
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,637
Tuning. Let's start this off on the right foot.

296
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,473
May I have a B, if you please?

297
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,314
[instruments matching notes]

298
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,725
Going for the gold! We got this!

299
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,227
[whimpering] I'll do my best!

300

- [birds chirping] - [playing scales on tuba]

301
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,901
If you're the last one out,

302
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:09,335
always make sure to lock the door.

303
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,305
Then go ahead and let Mr. Taki know you're heading home.

304
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,406
[Kanade] Will do.

305
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,010
On your left. Be sure to watch the neck, there,

306

Tsukinaga-kun.

307
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,485
Hey. Don't call me that.

308
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,187
What are you talking about?

309
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,422
My God, you're frickin' annoying.

310
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:30,723
[Midori] Everybody, just hold on!

311
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,159
Motomu-kun, we're all friends here in the band, okay?

312
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,697
And Kanade, he doesn't like being called by his last name

313
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,065
and we should respect that.

314
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,135
Just a friendly reminder for us all to think

315
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,037
before we speak, all right?

316
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,539
I will. My apologies.

317
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,676
So you'd prefer I call you \"Motomu,\" then?

318
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,410
I would.

319
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,014
I'd never allow someone like you to call me by my last name.

320
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:56,915
It makes me sick.

321
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:57,683
Hey, that's enough!

322
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,418
[sighs] I'm sorry.

323
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,653
- [Hazuki] Oh! - [Motomu] Excuse me.

324
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,825
Sacchan, Micchan, you guys can go right on in.

325
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,360
- I'm really sorry. - Yes, ma'am!

326
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,596
Would you mind not calling us that?

327
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,264
It's not like we're the Weasley twins.

328
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:12,631
Huh?

329
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,435
But it's way more fun than just calling you \"the Suzukis.\"

330
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,070
It's super cute!

331
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,305
- Right? - Not really.

332
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,473
Huh?

333
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,176
Micchan, wait!

334
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,414
Can you believe those two?

335
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,717
I mean, they're fighting over something so trivial.

336
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,154
It's probably not so trivial to them.

337
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,691
You're too nice for your own good, Oumae senpai .

338
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:40,659
Mm.

339
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,597
Why are they like this?

340
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,799
It's too much!

341
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,533
[Hazuki] Oh, don't say that.

342
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,135
You just gotta take charge of 'em!

343
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,271
I'm just trying to get them to play.

344
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,674
But instead, they keep getting on each other's nerves

345
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,108
about everything.

346
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,545
I'm sure they're all just trying to figure out high school.

347
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,381
Poor Motomu always looks so sullen,

348
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,783
like a little kitten that got left out in the rain.

349
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,420
He totally does, with like that wet-fur-angry-face.

350
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:09,588
Oh, my gosh, exactly!

351
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,725
[Midori] Hm. Oh, Kanade's kinda like one, too.

352
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,627
She's the spoiled house cat

353
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,496
who doesn't know how to play with everyone else.

354
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,164
Animal bandmates!

355
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,132
[PA system chimes]

356
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,201
[man over PA system] Please be careful.

357
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,302
The train will be arriving soon

358
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,138
We'll be back tomorrow to watch more of

359
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,207
the interesting animals in the bass section!

360
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,208
- Bye! - [Hazuki] See ya!

361
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,410
[pleasant music]

362
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,415
[Kumiko, thinking] I have a bad feeling about all of this

363
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:42,754
[gasps]

364
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,656
[Kumiko] Wh-what are they--?

365
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,292
Are you all right?

366
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,694
Did you see something?

367
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,562
What? No, nothing at all!

368
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,798
Those freshmen, huh?

369
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,400
- [train clattering] - [Kumiko] What a pain.

370
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,670
When Ryusei's new advisor came on board,

371
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,173
he took the concert band in a brand new direction.

372
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:01,840
It's really exciting!

373
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,309
[muffled] They got a new teacher?

374
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,544
[TV continues indistinctly]

375
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,812
Is Ryusei any good, sweetie?

376
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:07,679
Yeah, they're okay.

377
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,683
They don't really tend to go for the top competitions that much.

378
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,553
We're taking nationals for Grandpa Gen-chan!

379
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,456
[muffled] They seem close-knit, though.

380
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,659
Hey, Dad, can I borrow the printer?

381
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,360
Mm-hm.

382
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,296
- You left your milk here. - I'll drink it.

383
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,631
[birds chirping]

384
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,200
[Kabe] Anyone ever tell you you're too serious?

385
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,201
[Kumiko] Not often.

386
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,936
Well then, let me,

387
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,839
because your writing is like all determination, all the time.

388
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,474
- You think? - Okay.

389
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,543
Do you remember Kaori senpai

390
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,578
and Kousaka's auditions last year?

391
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:41,980
[Kabe] You were brand new,

392
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,248
but you still stood and applauded.

393
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,284
That's determination.

394
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:46,518
I don't know.

395
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,054
When moments like that come around,

396
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,656
I tend to get overwhelmed.

397
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,425
At the time, I definitely felt like

398
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,760
Kaori should have played the solo.

399
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,461
You really thought so?

400
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,931
[Kabe] But, either way,

401
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,632
I'm glad you're my partner on this.

402
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:04,536
Actually, Kabe senpai ,

403
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,872
was I being determined when you and I met?

404
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,508
\"Kabe senpai \" is way too formal.

405
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,977
Let's find something else to call me.

406
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:12,911
Oh, uh...

407
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,713
Grandpa Gen-chan!

408
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,381
How about \"Kabe-chan\"?

409
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:17,249
[Kabe] Beautiful.

410
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,453
Our first step has to be winning at the Sunrise Festival.

411
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,889
Does anybody have any questions?

412
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,394
- I do. - Sure.

413
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,763
I heard that we have to audition

414
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,498
for spots in the competition band.

415
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:34,399
Is that true?

416
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,635
Well, uh, yes it is.

417
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,003
Why do you ask?

418
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,539
Because...I mean...

419
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,874
Sorry, I thought I was clear.

420
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,343
Um?

421
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:45,744
If I may,

422
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,348
I think she was worried that there may be a little bias

423
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,583
about who gets to play in the competition band,

424
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,819
because of grade level and popularity

425
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,653
and that sort of thing.

426
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,055
I guess the main worry is that

427
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,157
seniority will matter more than skill,

428
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,425
if you know what I mean.

429
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:01,893
Yeah.

430
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,667
- Uh-- - Never.

431
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,336
Grade level is irrelevant

432
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,405
and selection is based on merit alone.

433
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,573
I promise.

434
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,708
Thank you, that's good to hear.

435
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,814
[steady music]

436
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,628
[Yuko] And good!

437
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:39,831
Hiraishi.

438
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,699
Yes?

439
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,833
[Taki] What were you thinking about

440
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,468
as you were playing that section?

441
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,404
Uh, I um...

442
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,740
Playing with intention brings out so much in music.

443
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,477
Feel your breath, the shape of your sound.

444
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,780
What surrounds you? Focus and feel.

445
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,383
[Taki] Create music as a single phrase.

446
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,685
[all] Yes, sir.

447
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,720
[Taki] Same goes for your harmonies.

448
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,923
You must know the role you play with one another.

449
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,025
So that you become one.

450
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,695
The double reeds have got your back!

451
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,597
[together] And we'll do our very best!

452
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,466
[Reina] It's worse than I thought.

453
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,603
Even taking gold at regionals could prove difficult.

454
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,505
Tell me about it.

455
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,741
The problem is that some of the freshmen think they could

456
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,376
walk in and win it with ease.

457
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,379
[sighs] We'll train harder.

458
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,014
[Mirei] Goodnight, you guys.

459
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,782
[sighs] Heading home already?

460
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,553
Yeah. Well, I mean, practice is over, so.

461
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,022
You two...

462
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,025
Are standing kinda close, aren't you?

463
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,094
Uh, are we?

464
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,062
This is pretty normal.

465
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,766
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

466
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,067
[Kumiko] See ya, Mirei!

467
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:50,869
Have a good evening.

468
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,873
Sacchan stays behind after practice is done.

469
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,809
[Kumiko] She's getting closer to everyone.

470
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,077
Making friends.

471
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,480
[Reina] Mirei may be isolating herself.

472
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,950
[Kumiko] No one in the bass section wants her to.

473
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,385
But I'm kind of afraid

474
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,454
she's backing herself into a corner.

475
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,758
[Reina] Have you talked to her about it?

476
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,860
[Kumiko] I want to, if I can,

477
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,062
but it still feels like she has her guard up around me.

478
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,464
Then maybe someone else should try.

479
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,699
Huh?

480
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,034
Maybe she'll open up to another freshman.

481
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,137
Of course!

482
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,508
That's perfect! You're a genius! [giggles]

483
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,143
[Kanade] Once more.

484
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,979
Please, just one more time. Promise.

485
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,747
One mor time.

486
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,617
[plays sliding note]

487
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,987
[laughing]

488
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,791
[plays fast melody]

489
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,560
I don't know if it's that-- [gasps]

490
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:50,962
[Kanade] Huh?

491
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:53,932
[Shuichi] What the heck?

492
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,868
So what exactly was it you wanted to ask me about?

493
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,205
Uh, it's not a big deal or anything.

494
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,775
But you still singled me out specifically to talk to.

495
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,610
I'm kind of honored.

496
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,713
Is this about Tsukamoto senpai , maybe?

497
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,050
I know Michiru Hakase hangs on his every word.

498
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,485
Uh...

499
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,853
No! I mean, wait, wait, what have you--?

500
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,589
Nothing. I just happened to notice

501
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,524
Takigawa likes to tease Tsukamoto senpai

502
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,559
about talking to her.

503
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,860
[Kanade] He's always...

504
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,528
[Kanade and Takigawa] Oh, I'm gonna tell Oumae!

505
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:24,963
Don't be worried or anything.

506
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,666
I'm the only freshman who really notices

507
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,100
that kind of stuff anyway.

508
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:29,701
Besides,

509
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,039
there's really nothing going on between Michiru and Tsukamoto

510
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:34,239
I promise.

511
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,508
- You're sure? - Totally.

512
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:37,809
[Kumiko] Oh, my gosh.

513
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,045
Really, everything's all right.

514
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,881
No, no, no! Look, it totally wasn't about that!

515
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,016
I don't care about the thing with Shuichi at all right now.

516
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,620
I came to you because I'm worried about Mirei.

517
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,021
Oh, that's what this is about.

518
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,158
[Kumiko] I'm...I'm really concerned

519
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,326
that she isn't getting along

520
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,227
with the rest of the bass section.

521
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,964
[Kanade ]So you want me to be friends with Mirei Suzuki?

522
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,633
[Kumiko] Kinda, yeah.

523
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:02,901
[Kanade] Okay.

524
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,204
I was actually curious to get to know her, anyway.

525
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,707
- For real? - Yeah!

526
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,611
[band playing]

527
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,286
[Kumiko] I want you guys to be aware of your sound.

528
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,321
Does it emerge the way you imagine it?

529
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,091
Are you in sync with the instruments around you?

530
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,860
- The music is what you make it. - [all] Yes!

531
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,931
Have you ever listened to the sound you play objectively?

532
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,266
[Motomu] What do you mean?

533
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,802
Like, from the audience instead of onstage.

534
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,505
If you take the contrabass out of it,

535
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,740
then the entire orchestra

536
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,309
sounds like it's playing a totally different song!

537
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:44,876
Hm.

538
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,178
[Midori] The role of the contrabass

539
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:47,913
isn't to add volume,

540
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,614
but to add resonance.

541
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:50,148
To give depth.

542
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,019
Every single instrument has its role to play.

543
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,222
[tuba playing]

544
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,925
[Reina] How's Kanade doing making friends with Mirei?

545
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,162
Mmm...uh...well...

546
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,666
- Have a good evening. - Goodnight, you guys.

547
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,267
- [horn playing] - [Kumiko] Bye, guys!

548
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,071
- I got the whole thing! - That's amazing!

549
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,708
[Kumiko] Let's just say that for the moment,

550
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,043
the issue is yet to be resolved.

551
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,479
And it seems like Kanade knows it, too.

552
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,213
So, she's trying, but...

553
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,749
[Reina] You're overthinking it, Kumiko.

554
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:25,650
[Kumiko] I don't know.

555
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,254
She's been like that since the very beginning, hasn't she?

556
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,791
She doesn't like to show her true feelings.

557
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,898
Sometimes, it's like she almost knows what I want from her

558
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,100
before I even get a chance to ask it.

559
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,071
- I did it! I really did it! - [giggling]

560
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,977
[gasps]

561
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,217
You gotta vibrate your lips like this, okay?

562
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:00,619
[buzzing]

563
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,186
That's perfect!

564
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,289
[trumpet playing in distance]

565
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,727
Awesome.

566
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,131
Wow, Midori, that's beautiful.

567
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,336
[grunts]

568
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,371
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

569
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,374
Just give her a minute to get used to it.

570
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:23,174
Big shoes to fill.

571
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,277
[Natsuki] It's tough to top last year's drum major.

572
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,986
- [band playing] - [drumsticks clicking]

573
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,025
All right, everybody hold there.

574
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,893
[Taki] Kato and Satsuki, you're off time.

575
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,397
I know it's tough, but work on wrapping your head around

576
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,731
the music and steps together.

577
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:47,699
[Kato and Satsuki] Sorry!

578
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,702
And Nakagawa? You need to focus, okay?

579
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,037
Right. I can get it together.

580
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,041
I didn't mean to slow you down, Hazuki senpai , I'm so sorry!

581
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,743
Hey, hey, you're totally fine!

582
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,179
Last year, everybody called me \"wrong-knee-Hazuki.\"

583
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,080
Yeah, you fell on your face a lot.

584
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,151
Okay, maybe you don't have to tell the freshmen that!

585
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,052
You're doing great!

586
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,186
Don't worry.

587
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,022
I still love you no matter how out of time we are.

588
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,824
Aw! Sacchan!

589
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,292
Hazuki senpai !

590
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,265
Have you done marching band stuff before, Mirei?

591
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,767
- Some. - That's wonderful.

592
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,203
It's actually my favorite part.

593
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,238
I'm looking forward to marching with you.

594
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:28,440
That's so kind.

595
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,544
I'm looking forward to marching with you too, Micchan!

596
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:33,178
Mirei!

597
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,245
[gasps]

598
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,982
[Satsuki] Sorry.

599
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,221
Kato and Suzuki Satsuki, I need you guys

600
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,989
to rehearse your stride one more time, okay?

601
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,793
Everyone else, let's line up and take it from the top.

602
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,028
[all] Right!

603
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:51,429
[Kanade] Just a little slower.

604
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,898
I think that should put us on the right step.

605
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,801
You're just a touch ahead of the music.

606
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,105
Bit slower.

607
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,311
[band members] Good work, everyone!

608
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,813
Mirei! You're heading home?

609
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:10,348
Yeah.

610
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,318
Unless there's something else you need from me.

611
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,087
Nope. Good job today!

612
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,123
I'll see you at school.

613
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,324
What about you?

614
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,558
I'm gonna stay for a bit.

615
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,461
I could use a little more practice.

616
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,997
Do you wanna stick around, too?

617
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:26,998
I guess.

618
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,635
Are you gonna stay and practice?

619
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:30,935
[Kumiko] Huh?

620
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,004
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I will.

621
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,407
I'm happy to stick around as long as you need.

622
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,111
If that's okay.

623
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,413
Yeah, of course.

624
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,117
[calm music]

625
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:47,118
[Kanade] Hey, um,

626
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,188
I've kinda been meaning to ask you something.

627
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,656
What's up?

628
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,258
What do you think of Satsuki and Mirei?

629
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,059
Who do you like better?

630
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,498
What kind of question is that?

631
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,002
I'm sorry, that didn't come out right.

632
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:05,904
Lemme try one more time.

633
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,005
Between those two,

634
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,407
which do you think is trying harder

635
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,975
to make the band a success?

636
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,244
Want some?

637
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,147
[music continues]

638
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,150
Thank you.

639
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,391
If I'm really gonna be honest,

640
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,059
the more time I spend with someone,

641
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,028
the more things I find to like about them.

642
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,896
Satsuki always stays after.

643
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,066
[Kumiko] At the same time, I have to think of the band.

644
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,402
There's a lot of merit in a player

645
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,002
with that natural talent.

646
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,872
Who can step into a role and perform.

647
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,841
There's something to like about each of them.

648
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,176
So I honestly like them both.

649
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,446
I'm pretty sure saying both counts as cheating.

650
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,882
That's not the word I'd use for it.

651
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,053
Everyone in the band has something special about them.

652
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,257
[music continues]

653
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:00,525
Hm.

654
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,096
I guess I didn't think about how mean that question was.

655
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,131
Don't worry about it.

656
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,967
It was just something on your mind.

657
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,568
I can't believe you're always so nice.

658
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,637
I wish I could be like that.

659
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,572
What do you mean?

660
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,140
It's incredible.

661
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,342
You're generous and kind.

662
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,546
I've always wanted to have somebody I could look up to,

663
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,313
like you.

664
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,285
[sighs]

665
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,425
I bet Asuka senpai would know what to do with all this.

666
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,429
[panting]

667
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,036
Uh...hey!

668
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,037
Hi.

669
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,573
Kousaka said that you'd left already.

670
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,375
So I thought I'd...

671
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,343
Did you run here?

672
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,513
[chuckles] Little bit.

673
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,516
So there's this freshman on trombone,

674
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,517
named Michiru Hakase.

675
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,920
I've already heard from a very reliable source

676
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,055
that rumor isn't true.

677
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,524
Oh, thank you. Bass player?

678
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,693
I heard from someone on euphonium.

679
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,129
Wait. So it wasn't from Motomu?

680
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:12,697
You guys call him \"Motomu\" too?

681
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,901
He's not subtle about how much he hates his last name,

682
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,169
so yeah. Why not?

683
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,204
He's almost supernaturally pretty,

684
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,307
like a guy in a girl's manga pretty.

685
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,977
Yeah, he's not real crazy about being told that, either.

686
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,011
Why not?

687
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,247
I think he just wants to be more masculine.

688
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,151
He's got a little bit of a complex about his height, too.

689
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,086
How do you do that?

690
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,056
How is it so easy for you to understand him?

691
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:39,991
Well, I mean, we're both human.

692
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,360
When he talks, I'm glad to listen.

693
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:43,761
Oh.

694
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,634
[groans] If it's so easy, why can't I do it?

695
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,703
What are you talking about?

696
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,074
[indistinct chattering]

697
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:01,245
[girl] Look, look!

698
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,981
That's Mr. Taki from Kitauji.

699
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,316
[gasps] Which one is he?

700
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,353
We're back at the Sunrise Festival once again.

701
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,421
[Taki] Use the time before your set wisely.

702
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,358
Watch your competitors. See what they can do well.

703
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:14,292
[band members] Right!

704
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,029
Many people here are looking forward to your performance.

705
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,697
Don't think about them.

706
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,499
You're here to play your part and march in step.

707
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,502
[Matsumoto] Stay sharp out there. Understood?

708
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,104
Yes, ma'am!

709
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,107
Do you need to tune up your euphonium?

710
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,608
I'm all right, thank you.

711
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,343
I could afford to double-check.

712
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,246
[whimpers] Anyone else have butterflies?

713
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,682
Take a breath, you're gonna be great.

714
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,485
- You've got this! - Thanks.

715
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,220
Mi--uh...

716
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,189
You're gonna do great, Mirei.

717
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,494
Hold on, I think your bell's a little crooked.

718
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:50,762
[Hazuki] Take a look at Sacchan's.

719
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,065
If we make just a little adjustment--

720
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:58,603
I could fix it myself!

721
00:33:59,036 --> 00:33:59,937
[both gasp]

722
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,105
- I'm sorry. - Micchan!

723
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,274
She was trying to help you!

724
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,376
I told you to stop calling me that!

725
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,179
[Riko] Hey, everything okay?

726
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,480
We're coming up pretty soon.

727
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,983
U-uh, we're fine! It was nothing!

728
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,184
Totally nothing.

729
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,152
I'm real sorry.

730
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,721
I didn't mean to overstep or anything.

731
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,222
[Mirei] No, I'm sorry.

732
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,925
- [Mirei] I...I have to quit. - What?!

733
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:21,225
Wait, hold on!

734
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,328
All I've done is cause trouble. I won't hold you back.

735
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,432
But that's not true at all! Wait, Mirei!

736
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,601
[bands playing in distance]

737
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,873
Guys? Guys?! Where are you going?

738
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,410
- [upbeat marching band music] - [panting]

739
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,351
[crying]

740
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:52,657
Talk to us.

741
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,627
I don't even know what I'm doing here. [sobs]

742
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,199
You feel you don't belong.

743
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:02,800
[Mirei] That's not...

744
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:07,905
[Kanade] You know you're better than Satsuki.

745
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,376
But if you're better, why does everyone like her more?

746
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,411
[sobbing]

747
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,850
She's not a great musician and she's not improving.

748
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,520
But she's so cheerful and upbeat and happy.

749
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,757
Mirei, you can tell us anything you want to.

750
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,460
We're standing here

751
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,929
because you think Satsuki's more popular than you.

752
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,564
Is that true?

753
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,901
I'm so sorry.

754
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,672
But I promise that I like you better.

755
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,342
[music continues]

756
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,448
And I'll bet you that Oumae senpai

757
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,949
feels the exact same way that I do, doesn't she?

758
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,255
Mirei, I want you to tell me how really feel.

759
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,225
You can trust her. She only wants the best for us.

760
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:13,304
I came here...I came to Kitauji because I wanted to get better.

761
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,240
[Mirei] I wanted to be in a place

762
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,608
where I could give it everything I had.

763
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,310
That's why I joined your band.

764
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,548
But watching them, Hazuki and Satsuki, it just...

765
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:25,883
frustrates me.

766
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,020
If I'm really honest with myself,

767
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,655
I think I'm better than Hazuki.

768
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,258
But they have so much fun out there and I just...

769
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,627
Don't cry, it's not your fault.

770
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,996
Everyone out there is so focused on

771
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,932
trying to make Satsuki feel better about herself.

772
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,968
I'm sorry no one recognizes how great you're doing.

773
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,904
- [applause in distance] - People do recognize it.

774
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,439
- Hm? - Hm?

775
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,576
We all can see how talented you are.

776
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,378
Takuya and Riko see it for sure.

777
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,414
And so do I.

778
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:57,615
You...

779
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,318
[Kumiko] We're worried because it feels like

780
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,486
you made up your mind and built up a wall.

781
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,590
I promise, we all just wanna get to know you.

782
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,360
It's just sometimes you come off as a teeny bit unapproachable.

783
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,698
I'm sorry. I know it's hard for me to open up sometimes.

784
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,001
Uh, heading back is a good start.

785
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,771
I just... I don't know how to be better.

786
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,411
Mm, well it wouldn't hurt to let us call you \"Micchan.\"

787
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,348
- Really? - You really want to?

788
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,383
I think everyone else wants to, too!

789
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,452
Plus, you don't have to say a thing.

790
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,589
Everybody out there understands exactly how you feel.

791
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:40,925
[Mirei] Okay.

792
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,261
But if that's what we're going to do,

793
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:43,961
I want you to start.

794
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,665
- What? - So I can get used to it.

[Kumiko] M-Micchan.

796
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:54,872
Okay.

797
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,643
- Is it that bad? - No. One more time.

798
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,944
Micchan.

799
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,079
[gasps]

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,914
- [Mirei] Again. - Micchan!

801
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,550
- Once more! - Micchan!

I am so sorry for my behavior earlier.

00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,775
Ice cream could solve it!

Oh. Uh, of course!

00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,079
[Hazuki giggles] I'm just kidding!

[Mirei chuckles] I'm not so sure.

[Satsuki giggles]

818
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,317
She changed. But she didn't have to.

819
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,620
It was the others who needed to take this more seriously.

820
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,222
She wasn't wrong about a single thing she said.

821
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,926
The way I see it, Mirei actually wanted to change herself.

822
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,830
I think she really wanted to get along with everybody.

823
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:33,697
[Kanade huffs]

824
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,634
You can be very persuasive, Oumae senpai

825
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:37,501
I hope you know that.

826
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,671
- I wasn't trying to be. - No, it's all right.

827
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,040
As long as Mirei's okay with it.

828
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:44,775
[sighs]

829
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,448
The compulsory piece for sectionals

830
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,182
is the march \"Sky Blue Dream.\"

831
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,985
And for the free piece, we're doing \"Liz and the Blue Bird.\"

832
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,955
[Taki] It's a complex piece and a tough one.

833
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:58,956
But to reach your goal,

834
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,725
I also think it's the perfect choice.

835
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,530
As to auditions, they'll be held the two days before test week.

836
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,066
You'll be auditioning on your own,

837
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,501
so be sure to come prepared.

838
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,803
I think we can do this.

839
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,006
[Taki] There are only 55 spots available

840
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,740
for the competition.

841
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,543
And if we don't have the complete number

842
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,544
at the level we need,

843
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,146
it may be even less.

844
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,714
Practice hard on your part.

845
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,652
This is not the time for anyone to lapse into overconfidence.

846
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:29,887
[all] Yes!

847
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:30,955
[Midori] All right, guys.

848
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,391
So this piece is based on a traditional fairy tale

849
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,193
and is notoriously complex.

850
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,596
Liz is a young girl

851
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,831
who lives all alone in a house in the forest.

852
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,200
Until one day, a blue bird comes to her door

853
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,268
disguised as a human.

854
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,038
They live together and become really good friends.

855
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,774
And at the end of the story, Liz has to say goodbye.

856
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,678
It's sad! What kind of ending is that for a story?

857
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,881
I actually kinda like that part.

858
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,750
It's heartbreaking, but still beautiful.

859
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,852
It's also incredibly complex.

860
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,989
Has anybody actually played it before?

861
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:06,724
I did.

862
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,058
But it's been a while.

863
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,628
So, was it really hard?

864
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,330
A little bit. Too much for Ryusei.

865
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,767
[Motomu] Our performance ended up all over the place.

866
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,302
You think we can do it?

867
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,338
I don't know, but I hope for the best.

868
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,207
We've got Mr. Taki.

869
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,010
There's a chance that may be enough.

870
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:27,711
[sighs]

871
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:28,712
That's enough, guys!

872
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,716
We're gonna stay positive and do our best for the seniors.

873
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,619
Uh, I didn't mean to--I'm sorry.

874
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,589
[Midori] That's all right. Let's get to it.

875
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:39,690
Yeah!

876
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,361
Is that the same Motomu from the beginning of the year?

877
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,065
Well now he follows Midori around like a puppy.

878
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:48,632
Aw.

879
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,637
Once he got to know Midori, he was taken with how she plays.

880
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:54,638
[Kumiko] Oh.

881
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,740
Well that definitely reminds me

882
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,876
of a certain somebody from last year.

883
00:42:59,209 --> 00:42:59,276
[sobs]

884
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,746
[Kanade] Of course, if I wanted to follow somebody,

885
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,248
- it'd be you, Oumae senpai . - Uh...

886
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,884
What would you think about that, huh?

887
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,154
- Stop being silly. - [sighs] Fine.

888
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:11,889
So who wants what part?

889
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,758
How about... I take this higher part?

890
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:15,192
Perfect.

891
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,228
Kanade-chan and I will play the lower.

892
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,630
- Cool? - Yeah.

893
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,032
You planned that out pretty quick.

894
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:22,900
Sorry?

895
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:23,801
It's nothing, really.

896
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,972
I tend to overthink things when I should really just do them.

897
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,240
- [Satsuki gasps] - Hm?

898
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,342
Like actually, really dating?!

899
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,912
Kinda. We weren't really trying to hide it or anything.

900
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,680
Tell me the story.

901
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,882
- Who confessed to who? - [giggles nervously]

902
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,584
[Takuya] Y-you don't have to tell 'em.

903
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,318
Huh?

904
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,089
Don't you have a crush, too?

905
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,191
- [sighs] - [giggles]

906
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,661
[tubas playing]

907
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,742
Kabe-chan, I got the printout for you.

908
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,216
Huh?

909
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:19,356
Huh?

910
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,260
[soft piano music]

911
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,862
[Kabe groans]

912
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,264
- Hey, Oumae. - Uh, you're drooling a bit.

913
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,733
- Ah! Am not! - [Kumiko giggles]

914
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,269
You work with a lot of detail, don't you?

915
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,172
Taking a look at my notes, were you?

916
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,508
Just the one open page.

917
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:37,875
Sorry about that.

918
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,844
I don't really mind. Least, not if it's you.

919
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,414
I'd have been happy to help you out with it.

920
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,849
Seems like you've been pretty busy,

921
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,718
being the freshmen advisor and all that.

922
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,755
Uh, no, really, I just listen to them vent an stuff.

923
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,258
It's more important than you think.

924
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,095
I may be alone here, but I like taking notes.

925
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,363
You really like it?

926
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,666
Way back when, I was a total newbie

927
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,934
when I joined the concert band in my first year.

928
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,938
I like to think I remember how the freshmen must feel.

929
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,207
[sighs] There was a long while

930
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,142
I couldn't even make the right sound.

931
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,279
[Kabe] I felt like I'd never catch up to the veterans.

932
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,015
It actually got kind of depressing.

933
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,350
I'd practice and I'd practice,

934
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,886
but I never seemed to be getting anywhere.

935
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,255
[music continues]

936
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,057
[Kumiko] Senpai .

937
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:29,893
Hey, Oumae?

938
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,162
- Lemme ask. - Yes?

939
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,466
[giggling] It's nothing.

940
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,101
Come on, now you have to tell me!

941
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,938
[Reina] Is something going on with Kabe senpai ?

942
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:42,406
Like what?

943
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,808
[Reina] She's in the teacher's lounge

944
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:45,109
quite a bit lately.

945
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:49,246
The audition's coming up but I haven't seen her practice.

946
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,915
[Kumiko] I think she's just working real hard

947
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,517
to make sure the beginners are ready for competition.

948
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,821
Maybe she's in the teacher's lounge to speaker with Mr. Taki.

949
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,624
[laughs] She's not you!

950
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,493
- [grunts] - [laughs] That hurt!

951
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,294
[Reina] Did he ask you?

952
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,162
Who?

953
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:06,930
I think you know quite well who.

954
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,034
Reina, you really can be such a girl, you know that, right?

955
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,170
That's not at all what it's about.

956
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,906
I am simply a little concerned.

957
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:19,376
[Kumiko] Lemme ask you something.

958
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,013
What would you do if Mr. Taki came in one day

959
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,882
and asked you to go out with him in the future?

960
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:25,949
[Reina gasps]

961
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,651
Asked me out?

962
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,586
- [giggles] - Why are you asking me

963
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,120
something like that?

964
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:31,955
- [laughing] Ow! - You're so mean.

965
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,291
- [water running] - [birds chirping]

966
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,395
[Kumiko] The future, huh?

967
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,297
- Kumiko! - Hm?

968
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,369
[Kentauro] Your sister and I were having a...

969
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,338
spirited conversation about you.

970
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,074
I thought it best just to ask you

971
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,010
what you want to do with your future.

972
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,445
[birds chirping]

973
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:01,118
When he asked me, I honestly had no idea what I wanted to say.

974
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,153
[rain pattering]

975
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,055
[Shuichi] It's really comin' down.

976
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,925
[Kumiko] Well it is the rainy season.

977
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,427
- [indistinct chattering] - [slow, bright music]

978
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,929
[Kumiko] Did the wind section come tonight?

979
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,231
[Shuichi] I think some of them are here.

980
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,271
So. How fares the bass section?

981
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,707
Huh? Why do you ask?

982
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,943
I sit right behind Nakagawa and Hisaishi.

983
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,478
From there, I have a pretty solid view

984
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,280
into everything that goes on.

985
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,783
Kanade doesn't feel like

986
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,018
Natsuki is good enough to play competition.

987
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:36,720
[Shuichi] And, of course,

988
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,155
you're the only one who can help them.

989
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,491
\"Oumae Advisory Services\" to the rescue.

990
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,828
It's not as easy as all that.

991
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,164
[music continues]

992
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,534
[no audible dialogue]

993
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:05,649
[Kumiko] Anything else you wanna do?

994
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,418
[Shuichi] I think we've seen the whole festival.

995
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,388
You're sleeping over at Kousaka's, right?

996
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:12,522
Mm-hm.

997
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,562
[Shuichi] You know, I'm happy to walk you over there,

998
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:18,629
if you want.

999
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,598
[Kumiko] That's okay. It's real close.

1000
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:25,836
[Kumiko gasps]

1001
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,071
Oh, watch out, there. You okay?

1002
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:29,673
I'm sorry.

1003
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,243
[music continues]

1004
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:41,451
- [Kumiko] Hey! - [Shuichi] Ah!

1005
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,187
I-I'm so sorry, I thought you...

1006
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,557
No! Why would you try to kiss me like that?!

1007
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,326
I...I don't know,

1008
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,695
the moment just kind of felt right, didn't it?

1009
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,963
[Kumiko] How did that feel right?

1010
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,098
The competition's coming up.

1011
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,734
We decided that was what we really needed to focus on!

1012
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:58,969
You're right.

1013
00:48:59,469 --> 00:48:59,970
I just thought...

1014
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,240
And right here? Of all places?!

1015
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,174
I can't believe you!

1016
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,412
I'm sorry. I swear, I just thought the moment was right.

1017
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,748
- Stupid, stupid, stupid! - Ow, ow, hey!

1018
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,051
- [Shuichi sighs] - [Kumiko sobs]

1019
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,421
[panting]

1020
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,690
[water rushing]

1021
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,125
[panting continues]

1022
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,267
[trumpet playing in distance]

1023
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,342
[trumpet continues playing]

1024
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,184
[sighs]

1025
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,787
[trumpet fades]

1026
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,427
- [leaves rustling] - [wings flapping]

1027
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,296
[Kumiko panting] Reina.

1028
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,400
What are you... doing all the way up here?

1029
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,135
[panting]

1030
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:07,804
[Reina] I could ask you the same thing.

1031
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,408
[Kumiko] You should have told me you were gonna come out here.

1032
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,644
I almost went all the way over to your house.

1033
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:15,245
Sorry.

1034
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,315
I didn't think you were actually gonna come.

1035
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:19,449
What? Why?

1036
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,118
You were out with Tsukamoto.

1037
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:22,753
[Kumiko] Silly Reina.

1038
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,422
Why on earth would that mean I wasn't gonna come?

1039
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:26,156
Oh.

1040
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,693
Sorry. The stick part cracked a little bit.

1041
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,531
- [Reina] Hey, Kumiko? - [Kumiko] Yeah?

1042
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,701
[Reina] Do you ever think about the future?

1043
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:38,602
[Kumiko sighs]

1044
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,806
Guess we have to. We are gonna be seniors next year.

1045
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,574
I wanna play professionally.

1046
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,478
I wanna spend the rest of my life making music.

1047
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:51,515
Hm.

1048
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,418
But I'm scared.

1049
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:55,752
[Kumiko] Of what?

1050
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:56,686
[Reina] I'm worried...

1051
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,323
that if I do, we won't be able to be together.

1052
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,394
Just like \"Liz and the Blue Bird\"?

1053
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,276
Play something for me.

1054
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:20,677
Okay.

1055
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:35,459
[breathes deeply]

1056
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,529
[trumpet playing]

1057
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,636
[no audible dialogue]

1058
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,209
[trumpet continues playing]

1059
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,621
[tapping]

1060
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,429
[trumpet continues playing]

1061
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,706
[band playing]

1062
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:29,880
- [music stops slowly] - Trombones.

1063
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,382
We need you to be mezzo piano here.

1064
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,418
- We've been over this before. - [all] Right!

1065
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,554
Euphonium, you were off twice.

1066
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,591
If we miss things like that, it's fatal for us.

1067
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,193
It can throw off the whole piece.

1068
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:43,760
[all] Yes.

1069
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,964
All right, everyone split up into sections for practice.

1070
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:48,765
[all] Yes!

1071
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,834
Guys, before we break up,

1072
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,537
I've got an important announcement for everybody.

1073
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,206
So stay in your seats for just a moment

1074
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,641
before we set you all free.

1075
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,877
- It's not that big a deal. - [all murmuring]

1076
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:04,381
- Sure you're okay to tell them? - Mm-hm.

1077
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:06,750
What's this?

1078
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:07,784
[Kumiko] No clue.

1079
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,487
[Kabe] Sorry this is so sudden.

1080
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,390
I would like to announce that form here on,

1081
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:14,925
I will unfortunately not be performing

1082
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,226
with the concert band.

1083
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,527
- [all gasping and murmuring] - [Kabe] Which means

1084
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,563
I won't be auditioning for competition.

1085
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,864
- But senpai ... - No.

1086
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,500
Okay, everyone stop.

1087
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:25,669
It's not that big a deal, really!

1088
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,672
It's not like I'm gonna quit the band or anything.

1089
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:29,806
[girl] So you're not leaving?

1090
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,877
Of course not. You know I'd never abandon you guys.

1091
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,813
I wanna support you guys

1092
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,416
and I know I can do that best as concert band manager.

1093
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,785
So I promise I'll always be there

1094
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,520
for whatever problems you guys wanna talk about.

1095
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:47,057
Ask about performances, your practices,

1096
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,558
annoying bandmates.

1097
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,561
If it's romantic advice, though...

1098
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,697
I charge a little extra.

1099
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,031
[students giggling]

1100
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,702
Most important, I want to assure you this is a positive decision.

1101
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,738
[Kabe] Practice hard. Make us proud!

1102
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,406
Either way,

1103
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,677
I swear manager Kabe Tomoe will be at your service.

1104
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,679
[applause]

1105
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,748
[Kumiko] We need to talk.

1106
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:15,952
I figured.

1107
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,589
[Kabe] It started somewhere around May.

1108
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,860
My jaw had never hurt after I played before, but...

1109
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:24,861
it felt...

1110
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,664
almost like my mouth was cracking.

1111
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,766
I couldn't hold an embouchure anymore.

1112
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,436
I figured it was no big deal and I could just push through it.

1113
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,340
But high notes got farther and farther away.

1114
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:39,743
Arthritis of the jaw.

1115
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,745
[melancholic music]

1116
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,312
Not much I can do.

1117
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,615
I went to Mr. Taki for advice, of course.

1118
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,550
You could learn to play another instrument.

1119
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,352
That's exactly what he said.

1120
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,689
There's no way I can pick up a new instrument

1121
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:53,990
and make the competition roster.

1122
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,926
It's just not gonna be in the cards.

1123
00:54:58,928 --> 00:54:59,663
If I'm really honest,

1124
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,999
I wasn't even that shocked when I found out.

1125
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,602
[Kabe] When they said I couldn't play,

1126
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:07,037
I actually felt relieved.

1127
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,739
- [no audible horns] - [music continues]

1128
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,242
[Kabe] I wouldn't have to worry about failing the audition,

1129
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,643
about being pitied.

1130
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,779
But as manager,

1131
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,648
I still get to be a part of everything with all my friends.

1132
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,252
All part of my master plan.

1133
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,553
- [Kumiko whimpers] - that was a joke!

1134
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,823
You don't have to be so serious, it's okay.

1135
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,458
[music continues]

1136
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,360
- [Kabe] Kumiko. - Hm?

1137
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,662
Here. Gimme your hands.

1138
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,531
What for?

1139
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,569
[Kabe humming]

1140
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:40,837
There!

1141
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,038
[giggles]

1142
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,407
My skill is yours.

1143
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,777
- [indistinct chattering] - [tuba playing]

1144
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,018
- Kanade-chan, you have a sec? - Hm?

1145
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,986
This part right here.

1146
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:02,726
[euphonium playing]

1147
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,862
[footsteps approaching]

1148
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:08,565
[Kumiko] Are you all right?

1149
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:09,165
[shakily] I, um...

1150
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,036
Is \"Oumae Advisory Services\" open today?

1151
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,873
[Kanade] I can't believe Natsuki senpai !

1152
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,210
[Kumiko] She's always struggled with that part.

1153
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,177
It's a tough section.

1154
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,080
[kanade] But there's so much more to it, ya know?

1155
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:25,982
And asking a freshman for advice?

1156
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,285
I mean, she should have more pride than that.

1157
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,488
[somber music]

1158
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,657
Natsuki can see that you're better than her

1159
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,259
when it comes to that sort of stuff,

1160
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,794
so she asked for advice.

1161
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:39,596
I wish she wouldn't.

1162
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,197
Nothing wrong with asking for help.

1163
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,935
Natsuki doesn't care about seniority. She never has.

1164
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:49,672
[Kanade] They held auditions

1165
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,708
for the trumpet solo last year, right?

1166
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,077
Yeah.

1167
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,946
[Kanade] Kousaka senpai was a freshman,

1168
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,682
but she was competing with three seniors for the part.

1169
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,451
Hot!

1170
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:02,819
You okay?

1171
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,123
Wasn't it awkward for her to compete against the seniors?

1172
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:08,658
Hm?

1173
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,629
They determined she was the best and gave her the solo.

1174
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,697
But did the whole band

1175
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,200
really support a freshman playing something so special?

1176
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,002
[music continues]

1177
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,770
They didn't, right?

1178
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,239
[Kumiko] This really gets to you.

1179
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:24,841
It absolutely does!

1180
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,810
Because what happened last year

1181
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,778
could make all the difference in the world.

1182
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:29,979
[sighs]

1183
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:32,382
If I don't tell you what happened,

1184
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,950
You'll just ask someone else, won't you?

1185
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,218
[Kanade] Probably.

1186
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:37,353
[no audible dialogue]

1187
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:38,054
[Kumiko] There was an argument.

1188
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:39,989
In the end, Kaori senpai ,

1189
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,257
one of the seniors, stepped down.

1190
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,660
She thought Reina should have the solo.

1191
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,063
Once we decided, it didn't seem to matter anymore.

1192
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,667
Of course, when you guys made it to nationals.

1193
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,238
You can't argue a decision when it produces results.

1194
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,473
[Kanade] They had to accept it.

1195
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:58,875
Winning is all that mattered.

1196
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,678
But what if you hadn't gotten so far?

1197
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,713
Would everybody just whisper

1198
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,515
that a senior probably should have played something

1199
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,583
so important?

1200
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,820
If we're serious about making it to nationals,

1201
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,189
then every seat has to be earned by merit.

1202
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,925
I don't think that's what they would have done.

1203
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,261
But you can't say for sure.

1204
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,263
[music continues]

1205
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:24,267
[Kanade] Never mind. That's kinda what I figured.

1206
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:28,938
Want some of my dessert?

1207
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:31,608
Sure do.

1208
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,611
- [rain pattering] - [tuba playing]

1209
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:42,018
[sobs] I can't do it! Micchan!

1210
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,553
[tuba continues playing]

1211
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,324
Hazuki.

1212
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,058
Huh?

1213
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,362
Relax. You can afford to take a break.

1214
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:53,963
[sighs] Right.

1215
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,933
[euphonium playing]

1216
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,306
- Great. Sounds good. - [playing stops]

1217
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:05,708
[Kumiko] Thank you very much.

1218
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:07,844
Your sound has a very solid base.

1219
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,813
You've grown so much since you started.

1220
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,649
That really means a lot.

1221
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,218
[Taki] How goes being the freshmen advisor?

1222
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,219
You like it?

1223
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,288
Uh, yeah, I think so.

1224
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,057
[Taki] The view is quite different from the podium.

1225
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:24,694
You can see people's strengths and weaknesses.

1226
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,330
That's true.

1227
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,099
I think we're very fortunate

1228
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,669
to have such a natural talent on our hands.

1229
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,075
All right, Kanade.

1230
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,110
Your turn. Break a leg!

1231
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:42,378
[Kanade] Thanks.

1232
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,619

[rain continues pattering]

00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,159
[Kumiko] It's really coming down.

1235
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,660
[Natsuki] Yeah.

1236

[euphonium playing in distance]

1237
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:04,233
That's not right.

01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:05,268
[gasps]

1239
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,070
[Natsuki] Oh, that idiot!

1240
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,371
- [Kumiko] Wait! - [door bangs open]

1241
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,340
[Taki] Uh...

1242
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,709
is everything all right?

1243
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:13,676
If you can hold on just a moment...

1244
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,879
Hisaishi-san was in the middle of her audition.

1245
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,247
[Natsuki] Hisaishi-san isn't feeling very well today.

1246
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,049
And I think it would be best

1247
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,818
if we put off her audition until later.

1248
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,020
[Kanade] Huh? No, honestly, I feel totally fine!

1249
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,155
I'm more than happy to keep going.

1250
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,124
As the band's vice-captain,

1251
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,560
I feel the fairest thing is to postpone her audition

1252
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:31,661
until she feels better.

1253
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,096
Even through the door,

1254
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,797
we can hear this performance is not up to her true talent.

1255
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,734
That's not-- what are you talking about?

1256
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,068
One moment, please.

1257
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,269
[Kanade] Yes.

1258
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:45,675
We have some time.

1259
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,844
We can hold off on her audition

1260
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,012
until the percussion section is finished.

1261
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,414
- Does that sound all right? - [Kumiko] Yes, sir.

1262
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,116
Thank you, Mr. Taki.

1263
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:53,750
[sighs]

1264

- [rain pattering] - [somber music]

1265
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,987
[Kanade] What is this all about?

1266
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,088
You pulled me out of there, but I was playing my best.

1267
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,693
Be honest. Tell me right now if you have something against me.

1268
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,229
Sorry, but I guess I kinda do.

1269
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:06,796
It's nothing personal.

1270
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,799
[Natsuki] Then why weren't you trying in there?

1271
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:10,700
[Kanade] I was doing my absolute best.

1272
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,469
I know that's not true because I've heard you play!

1273
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,639
Are you trying to throw the audition for me?

1274
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,241
Do you have any idea how insulting that is?

1275
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,043
[sighs]

1276
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,911
You're just being a little self-conscious, senpai .

1277
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,080
We can tell you're not trying.

1278
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,282
If you ever do something like that again,

1279
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,351
I'll go to Mr. Taki and withdraw immediately.

1280
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,787
- Huh? - Are you kidding me with this?!

1281
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,489
Winning a spot that way would make me sick!

1282
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,291
I would never take it and I don't need your pity!

1283
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,060
Hey, maybe you're not listening to me!

1284
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,163
- There is no way that I-- - What's this about?!

1285
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,764
[dramatic music]

1286
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,233
Drop the act and tell me how you really feel.

1287
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:46,769
[Kanade] How I feel?

1288
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,044
[melancholic music]

1289
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,247
It's not right.

1290
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,318
You're my senior and you should be the one to play.

1291
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,622
You don't understand how hard it is

1292
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,224
to play alongside someone who's...

1293
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:09,025
not as good.

1294
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,427
You may not care if I get the spot,

1295
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,328
but the rest of them do.

1296
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,298
Says who? I'll talk to them right now.

1297
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,999
They'll never say it,

1298
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,301
but every last one of them will think it.

1299
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,403
They all want you to play in the show.

1300
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,439
You come to practice, you work constantly,

1301
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:24,440
you're their vice-captain.

1302
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,144
But you've never been able to play in competition.

1303
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:28,478
Not once!

1304
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,813
If I beat you out for that spot,

1305
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:31,547
how do you think they'll all react?

1306
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,550
They'd be miserable for you and angry at me!

1307
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,286
I try to be nice and smile at everybody.

1308
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,922
I just don't want everyone here to hate me!

1309
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,225
[Natsuki] How dare you judge them like that!

1310
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:46,028
Not a single member of this band would ever feel that way!

1311
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,365
You're going to go back in there and audition.

1312
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:52,135
I already have and I am not getting the spot, okay?

1313
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,770
I made Mr. Taki a promise.

1314
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,206
- Please let go of me! - Natsuki, you should--

1315
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,207
Let me go!

1316
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,976
[panting] No!

1317
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,879
I won't. I'm not doing it.

1318
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:04,814
Please excuse me.

1319
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,218
- Kanade! - Natsuki, wait!

1320
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,821
I'm gonna go talk to her, okay?

1321
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,860
- [rain pattering] - [footsteps splashing]

1322
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:19,862
Kanade, stop!

1323
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,030
[Kumiko panting]

1324
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,133
[sighs] What more could you possibly want from me?

1325
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,303
I need you to tell me what happened to you.

1326
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,607
You'd never think like that unless something happened!

1327
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:33,309
Please, Kanade.

1328
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,580
I guess that really is just part of your nature, isn't it?

1329
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,247
Huh?

1330
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,349
You look so kind and caring,

1331
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,084
but you trample on people's hearts

1332
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,452
just like anybody else would.

1333
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,022
Acting so innocent and naïve

1334
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,623
that people drop their guard and let you in.

1335
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,260
I promise you, I'm not trying to put on an act.

1336
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,262
Then maybe you haven't looked in the mirror!

1337
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,435
[Kanade] There was an audition for the competition band

1338
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:00,303
in middle school, too.

1339
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,406
I was chosen because I was the most talented.

1340
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,275
But I took an upper-classman's spot.

1341
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:08,311
- [melancholic music] - Of course, in the moment,

1342
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,613
everyone said it was the right thing.

1343
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,583
I'd play well because I was good.

1344
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:15,384
We'd win the gold for sure.

1345
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:17,520
- I practiced like crazy. - [no audible euphonium]

1346
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,324
Constantly. I was determined to see us win.

1347
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,193
So they wouldn't regret choosing me.

1348
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:26,596
- [music continues] - We didn't.

1349
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,266
The whispers started the moment we earned silver.

1350
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,369
We really should have let a senior play.

1351
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,271
It was our final concert.

1352
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,073
We should have played with

1353
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,474
the people who tried the hardest.

1354
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,610
We wouldn't regret this.

1355
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,381
That's how things work.

1356
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,417
The way people are.

1357
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,155
A good performance doesn't matter at all.

1358
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,124
The only thing that counts

1359
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,127
is that everybody can live with the results we earn.

1360
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,663
You can't live your life that way.

1361
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,599
- It's the only way. - No, it's not!

1362
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,701
It isn't like that here.

1363
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,036
It's like that everywhere!

1364
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:10,072
It's exactly what happened last year, isn't it?

1365
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:11,974
Not everybody thought

1366
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,442
Kousaka senpai should have had the solo!

1367
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,112
[music continues]

1368
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:20,483
What does it mean?

1369
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,251
Why should I try?

1370
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:23,686
When we met,

1371
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,423
I was so sure you were exactly the same as I was.

1372
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,526
You stand a safe distance away from everybody.

1373
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,828
[Kanade] You don't get emotional,

1374
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:33,396
don't make enemies,

1375
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,231
manage people.

1376
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,465
- [no audible dialogue] - I thought you knew it too.

1377
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,268
Doing your best is meaningless.

1378
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,270
[Asuka] You're afraid, Kumiko.

1379
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,206
Afraid you'll hurt someone or be hurt.

1380
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,276
So you sit back and watch from afar.

1381
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,178
Always cautious.

1382
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,114
That's why it's so difficult for them to bare their soul to you.

1383
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:54,417
I guess you're right.

1384
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,287
There is a part deep inside me that feels that way.

1385
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,991
But listening to that part of me never does any good.

1386
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:05,027
I hate that quiet voice in my head.

1387
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,729
Doesn't it make sense?

1388
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,432
It gets in the way.

1389
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,233
It never helps.

1390
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,436
- Really? - Mm.

1391
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,239
I love this. I wanna make music.

1392
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,507
To play!

1393
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,444
But why do you want that, Kumiko?

1394
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,313
[Kumiko] I've never even thought about it.

1395
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:26,415
Without a reason?

1396
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,885
[Kanade] Even if you stay after to practice every day,

1397
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:30,186
what is it for?

1398
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,390
Even if you get better, it won't mean a single thing!

1399
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:34,490
[dramatic music]

1400
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,226
Nothing good will ever come of it!

1401
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,395
Nobody will be happy!

1402
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,799
- [panting] - [splashing]

1403
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:45,668
It's just life, Kanade!

1404
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,037
You can try as hard as you can

1405
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:48,704
and practice until your fingers bleed,

1406
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,008
but you can still fail and see it all amount to nothing!

1407
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,744
It could happen to anybody!

1408
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,545
Failure is just a part of life!

1409
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,849
What you do might not be enough,

1410
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:01,484
maybe it'll never be enough!

1411
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,252
We all think the same way.

1412
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,087
\"What if I fail

1413
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,589
and every moment I spent here was nothing but a waste?

1414
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,127
What if the only thing we have left at the end is regret?\"

1415
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,162
[both panting]

1416
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:18,768
But...but that's all you'll ever have if you don't try.

1417
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:21,070
Trying is never a waste.

1418
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,408
Listen we promised that we would get to nationals.

1419
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,076
[panting]

1420
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:28,744
[Kumiko] And if you're better than me,

1421
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,347
and if you're better than Natsuki,

1422
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,082
then you should be the one we choose

1423
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,683
to play in the competition!

1424
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,688
Then, what if I...

1425
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,159
Just give it your all.

1426
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,361
- Huh? - Go back and audition

1427
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:45,828
and all you have to do is try.

1428
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,833
No matter what happens, Natsuki and I will always support you.

1429
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,168
We promise we will.

1430
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:53,469
Trust us.

1431
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,871
You've worked so hard to get this far.

1432
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:56,539
[gasps]

1433
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,242
You've worked so hard to make incredible music.

1434
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,813
- [no audible euphonium] - [Kumiko] You tried, Kanade.

1435
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:05,548
You've always tried.

1436
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,850
[peaceful music]

1437
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,386
[crying]

1438
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,398
[Matsumoto] Here is the line-up

1439
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,766
for the competition band.

1440
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,168
If I read out your name,

1441
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,137
please respond in the affirmative.

1442
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,372
For the trumpets,

1443
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,808
- Yuko Yoshikawa. - Yes.

1444
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,777
[Matsumoto] Junichi Takino.

1445
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:35,344
Yes.

1446
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,713
- [Matsumoto] Reina Kousaka. - Yes.

1447
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,882
[Matsumoto] Akiko Yoshizawa.

1448
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:40,816
[Akiko] Yes!

1449
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,651
Next up, euphoniums.

1450
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,189
- Natsuki Nakagawa. - [gasps]

1451
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:48,657
Yes.

1452
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,460
- [Matsumoto] Kumiko Oumae. - Yes.

1453
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,362
[Matsumoto] Kanade Hisaishi.

1454
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,531
[gasps] Yes.

1455
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,400
[Matsumoto] Tubas. Takuya Goto.

1456
01:08:58,868 --> 01:08:59,435
[Takuya] Yes.

1457
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,071
- [Matsumoto] Riko Nagase. - [Riko] Yes.

1458
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,305
[whimpers]

1459
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:04,740
- [Matsumoto] Mirei Suzuki. - [gasps]

1460
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:06,709
Yes.

1461
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:09,445
[sighs]

1462
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,147
- [Matsumoto] Contrabass. - You made it.

1463
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,148
[Matsumoto] Sapphire Kawashima.

1464
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,283
- [Mirei] Yeah. - [Midori] Yes!

1465
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,218
[Matsumoto] Motomu Tsukinaga.

1466
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:16,752
[Motomu] Yes.

1467
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,588
Let's win it. Let's do this.

1468
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,623
[Matsumoto] Congratulations contrabass. For the woodwinds...

1469
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,727
- Clarinets. Rie Shima. - [Rie] Yes.

1470
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,629
[insects buzzing]

1471
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,470
[peaceful music]

1472
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,219
Good morning, you two.

1473
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,221
- Morning. - Good morning.

1474
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,427
It feels like it's gonna be even hotter than it was yesterday.

1475
01:09:59,094 --> 01:09:59,962
[groans] Tell me about it.

1476
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,098
We really need to get the school to put AC

1477
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:04,300
in places outside the music room.

1478
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,635
[both] Who knows, maybe it'll rain.

1479
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:08,270
Oh! Happy ice cream!

1480
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,273
I suppose this time it'll be my treat, though.

1481
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:13,542
[Natsuki] For real? Awesome!

1482
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,312
[bright band music]

1483
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:22,785
[music ends]

1484
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:23,786
Good.

1485
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,454
Everybody take 10,

1486
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,656
and we'll start from the top once we're back.

1487
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:28,824
[all] Yes!

1488
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,493
Hey, senpai , can you help me with this part?

1489
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,629
Ten minutes feels like it's not enough.

1490
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,031
This is gonna be cake compared to band camp.

1491
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:37,499
It's gonna be brutal.

1492
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,936
Mr. Taki really chewed you guys out, didn't he?

1493
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:41,704
[Shuichi sighs]

1494
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:43,906
Everything goes so well in section.

1495
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,576
Once we get to ensemble, it all falls apart.

1496
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,446
- Hey, Shuichi-- - [Maki] Tsukamoto.

1497
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:50,512
Hm?

1498
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,383
How do you move over to this section so quick?

1499
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,384
Right, let's see.

1500
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:57,653
[Shuichi] Ah, the tempo actually picks up back here.

1501
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,522
I get why it's weird, it sounds a little different

1502
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:01,690
- without the whole band. - [muffled giggles]

1503
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:02,891
- [laughs] - [Yuko] Guys! Announcement!

1504
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,195
I need all section leaders to gather up

1505
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:08,130
and meet in class 3 so we can discuss

1506
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,498
procedures for summer camp, okay?

1507
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:11,867
- Uh, grade leaders, too. - [exclaims]

1508
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,936
And grade leaders, too!

1509
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:15,404
[all] Yes!

1510
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,908
[insects chirping]

1511
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,847
[euphonium playing]

1512
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,489
[euphonium continues playing]

1513
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:34,423
[no audible dialogue]

1514
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,526
[Asuka] Love and band. The joys of youth!

1515
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,862
[euphonium continues playing]

1516
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,532
[Kumiko] Remember when you asked me about the future?

1517
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:44,533
[Reina] Mm.

1518
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,002
[Kumiko] Why do you wanna go pro?

1519
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,404
[indistinct chattering]

1520
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:49,972
[Reina] Because I wanna leave a mark.

1521
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,509
[Kumiko] Like leave something behind?

1522
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:54,977
How, exactly?

1523
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,346
By making music.

1524
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,881
- Gotcha! - [squealing]

1525
01:11:58,914 --> 01:11:59,982
[splashing]

1526
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,718
I want my performance to be able to reach someone.

1527
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,455
Sharing that moment is my reason for living.

1528
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:08,824
You're so dedicated to it.

1529
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:10,659
What about you?

1530
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,561
[sighs]

1531
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,097
I don't really know.

1532
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,667
[Hashimoto] Hey, hey!

1533
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,602
Hope you guys had a nice summer break, there!

1534
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,938
Hashimoto's back to help you!

1535
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:27,109
So, sorry I couldn't pop in a little more often.

1536
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,378
I got a job overseas.

1537
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:30,713
It got a little crazy.

1538
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,081
[boy] Does that mean you can speak English,

1539
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:32,414
Mr. Hashimoto?

1540
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,217
[Imitating The Terminator] \" Hasta la vista , baby!\"

1541
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,585
Let's keep it on topic, Hashimoto.

1542
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,154
Man, why you gotta harsh my mellow?

1543
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,824
[students laughing]

1544
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:42,524
Good morning.

1545
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,827
I am Miss Niyama, the camp leader.

1546
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,596
It's a pleasure to learn with you.

1547
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:50,032
[applause]

1548
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,601
[Taki] Saxophones on B.

1549
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:53,869
Mezzo piano, please.

1550
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:54,603
[all] Yes!

1551
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:56,772
Trumpets, now. Let's keep our focus.

1552
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,676
Be watchful around the tenuto. That's what trips us up.

1553
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:01,777
[all] Yes!

1554
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:05,948
Vibraphones, what are you guys on now?

1555
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:06,615
Medium soft?

1556
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:08,450
No, we're on the softest.

1557
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,786
[Hashimoto] Let's try it at medium soft.

1558
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,122
Better than a medium rare, am I right?

1559
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,190
Ah, they can't all be winners.

1560
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:16,792
Euphonium, if you please.

1561
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,062
- Let's keep pace today. - [Kanade, Kumiko, Natsuki] Yes.

1562
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:21,864
Three, four...

1563
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,533
[euphoniums playing]

1564
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,637
- Good. - [euphoniums stop playing]

1565
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,773
I think we should make this part a solo.

1566
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:33,008
Oumae-san, you take it.

1567
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:34,610
Yes.

1568
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,048
- [indistinct chattering] - [squeals]

1569
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,418
There's nothing as awesome as a croquette!

1570
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,219
Really?! I think so, too!

1571
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,659
- [door slides open] - Ah!

1572
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,162
[Shuichi] Oh. Hey, Kousaka.

1573
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:55,764
[Reina] What are you doing?

1574
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:57,032
Uh, nothing.

1575
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:00,869
Kumiko's still up, I can go get her if you want.

1576
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,105
- [sighs] - [rattling, beeping]

1577
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,044
- Did something happen? - No. Not really.

1578
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:13,048
Kousaka.

1579
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:14,183
What?

1580
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:18,554
Never mind. You actually scare me.

1581
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,090
[insects chirping]

1582
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,438
- [Shuichi] Sorry. - That's all right.

1583
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,005
I just got here, too.

1584
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:38,740
- [Shuichi] What's up? - [Kumiko] Uh...

1585
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,011
I know this could have waited until after camp, but...

1586
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,949
[Kumiko] I had a chance to think.

1587
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:51,553
And I realized, I can't do everything at once.

1588
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,590
So I think we need to take a break.

1589
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,626
Next year. After band is finished.

1590
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,597
If you still really wanna go out with me, then...

1591
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,833
then you can give it back to me.

1592
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,104
- Sorry. - Hm.

1593
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:12,374
[Shuichi] With the band and college exams

1594
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,675
and the big open future...

1595
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,044
there's a lot that needs focus.

1596
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,182
So let's put our minds where they need to be.

1597
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,086
For right now, let's win.

1598
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:25,587
Mm.

1599
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,727
[bright music]

1600
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,737
We're supposed to set up in space F.

1601
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:43,739
[Kabe] Nice and careful/

1602
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,276
There's the Ryusei kids.

1603
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,980
Look, that's him! That's definitely gotta be Grandpa Gen!

1604
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,316
Mr. Tsukinaga is supposed to be amazing!

1605
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,220
[music continues]

1606
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,124
[no audible dialogue]

1607
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:03,759
[Yuko] Kitauji!

1608
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,061
Everybody form up on me!

1609
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,664
I don't want any of you getting lost in transit.

1610
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:09,998
[woman] I know that voice!

1611
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:11,900
Yuko!

1612
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:13,035
Hey!

1613
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,804
It's Kaori senpai ! [giggles]

1614
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:19,341
- I can't believe you're here! - I wouldn't miss it.

1615
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:20,042
Um, captain?

1616
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,245
You do know you've got a job to do, don't you?

1617
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,780
But it's Kaori!

1618
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:27,749
[woman] I missed this fluff!

1619
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:31,019
- No...? - Surprise!

1620
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:33,055
A-Asuka senpai .

1621
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,924
At first, I wanted to try and be stealth,

1622
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,260
but then I couldn't resist coming to see you!

1623
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:39,761
How's the university?

1624
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,332
You just keep your mind on the task at hand.

1625
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,169
Uh, Asuka graduated last year.

1626
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,305
So sorry, I should let you guys get ready.

1627
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:52,841
- So, break a leg! - [Kumiko] Uh-huh!

1628
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,676
I can't wait to hear your piece.

1629
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,244
You only just got here.

1630
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:59,147
Oh, aren't you just the sweetest!

1631
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,883
Did you really miss your senpai that much?

1632
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,287
I, uh...yes.

1633
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,288
Mm.

1634
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,023
Well, if that's really true,

1635
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,960
then I've got something special for my Kumiko.

1636
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,396
It's a magic ticket.

1637
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,330
Just for you.

1638
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:16,999
[giggles]

1639
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,868
Senpai , would you pretty please lead us

1640
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,203
in a cheer for Kitauji?

1641
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,038
Uh, if you'd like.

1642
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,073
Kitauji, let's go!

1643
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,942
So should we!

1644
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,577
I think she expected me to do it.

1645
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,412
Ah! Wait!

1646
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,114
[indistinct chattering]

1647
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:35,117
[instrument warming up]

1648
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,000
- [Taki] Captain? All yours. - [Yuko] Right!

1649
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,670
Hey! Can you guys hear me?

1650
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:56,672
We hear you.

1651
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:58,206
[students laughing]

1652
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,743
Since I became captain last year,

1653
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,245
so much has happened to us.

1654
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,915
All of you, every last one,

1655
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,751
has grown and overcome so much.

1656
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:11,420
We got through it together.

1657
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:16,024
And it's together that we became our best selves today!

1658
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:17,993
To my vice-captain...

1659
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,227
Mm? Huh?

1660
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:20,929
...you're wonderful.

1661
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:25,000
[stammers] In front of everyone?

1662
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,135
[students laughing]

1663
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:30,572
I love every member of this band.

1664
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:32,307
And I wanna play with you all forever!

1665
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,143
This will not end for us today.

1666
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,046
Is Kitauji gonna go all the way?

1667
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,548
[all] Yeah!

1668
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:42,784
[muffled band playing]

1669
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,392
- Hey, Oumae. - Hm?

1670
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:51,460
I feel like we're gonna do

1671
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:52,961
great things on this stage today.

1672
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:54,629
Two years in a row,

1673
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,064
we earned the right to play here.

1674
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,399
That's the truth.

1675
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,201
We can do this.

1676
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:00,802
Nationals.

1677
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:01,536
Yeah!

1678
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:04,005
Vice-captain? I'm sorry.

1679
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,208
What's up? Uh, one sec.

1680
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,377
Would you mind if I ask you something?

1681
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:10,412
'Course not.

1682
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:11,213
I was wondering,

1683
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:13,749
have you always been this passionate

1684
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,050
about playing the euphonium?

1685
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,052
I mean, like, this dedicated?

1686
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:18,887
This serious about it?

1687
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:19,488
Not at all.

1688
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,725
I started playing in elementary school, although,

1689
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:25,227
I didn't love it the way I do now.

1690
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,430
It was here that I really got serious.

1691
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,398
What made you change?

1692
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,402
After the last middle school competition,

1693
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:36,138
I didn't cry when we finished.

1694
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,876
I was almost relieved when we got the consolation prize.

1695
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,479
But the girl next to me was bawling her eyes out.

1696
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,116
She wasn't just mad, she was furious.

1697
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,085
- [no audible dialogue] - It was almost embarrassing.

1698
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,822
And that girl is now our best trumpet player.

1699
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,457
- [audience applauding] - Huh?

1700
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:57,859
[quietly] Kitauji, let's go!

1701
01:19:59,261 --> 01:19:59,961
[Kumiko, thinking] That moment,

1702
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:04,833
that was when I truly started. My beginning.

1703
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:36,498

1704
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,038

[whispering excitedly]

1735

- [music continues] - [man] And finally,

1736
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,074
we'll announce the three concert bands

01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:14,776
that will represent us

1738
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,978
in the National Competition in October.

1739
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:20,148

[melancholic music]

1754

[music continues]

1756
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,244
You did so good.

1757
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:24,912
I'm sorry.

1758
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,881
Micchan was awesome!

1759
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:29,150
Seriously, you played so great out there!

1760
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:31,686
- Hazuki senpai . - Mm?

1761

[crying] Promise!

1765
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:42,296
- Micchan! - [Hazuki] Oh!

1766
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:45,633
[Yuko] I don't like all these frowning faces.

1767
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,301
This isn't a funeral!

1768
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:48,636
What's with you guys?

1769
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:50,938
You shouldn't be depressed.

1770
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:52,507
You were amazing!

1771
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,774
We played our hearts out!

1772
01:31:54,508 --> 01:31:56,110
An that's the absolute truth.

1773
01:31:57,378 --> 01:32:00,081
For every single one of our club members who supported us,

1774
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:03,918
for all the teachers and the parents who have taught us,

1775
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:06,020
we have to go home proud.

1776
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,924
This year, we didn't make it to nationals.

1777
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,827
But that is no cause to be sad!

1778
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:15,730
When we created that music,

1779
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,598
we played for what led us here.

1780
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:21,302
What we did and felt here will make us better.

1781
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:24,005
Will make us stronger next time.

1782
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:26,841
I am your captain.

1783
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,242
And you can take my word on that.

1784
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:30,645
Kitauji will always get better.

1785
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:32,613
Kitauji will never give up!

1786
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:35,516
Lift your heads! I wanna see you!

1787
01:32:35,549 --> 01:32:37,151
[bright music]

1788
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:39,053
[applause]

1789
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:47,862
[Yuko] This is our first step.

1790
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:50,898
The start of preparing for next year's competition.

1791
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:54,302
Tomorrow we gather together, all of us,

1792
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:55,803
and we play!

1793
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:57,071
[all] Yeah!

1794
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,007
[music continues]

1795
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:03,177
[insects chirping]

1796
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:07,381
[indistinct chattering]

1797
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:17,258
- [Kanade sighs] - You did good.

1798
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:20,294
Why bother with practice tomorrow?

1799
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:24,031
- Hm? - I knew this was gonna happen.

1800
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:27,168
We're going home with nothing to show for all we did.

1801
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,071
- You played so well! - [Kanade] We practiced so hard,

1802
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:31,205
we fought and we shouted,

1803
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:35,242
we came to school to play every day during summer break.

1804
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:37,044
[Kumiko] Yes, we did.

1805
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:39,113
[Kanade] This is stupid.

1806
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:41,716
So stupid.

1807
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:43,751
Yeah, it is.

1808
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,087
It's all pretty stupid.

1809
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:48,756
[music continues]

1810
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:53,894
- Will you tell me something? - What is it?

1811
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:56,664
Are you angry?

1812
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:01,235
[Kanade] I am.

1813
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:04,805
I'm so furious, I could die!

1814
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:15,016
[bus rumbling]

1815
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:33,234
[upbeat band music]

1816
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:53,888
[woman singing in Japanese]

1817
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:53,060
[birds chirping]

1818
01:38:53,627 --> 01:38:57,398
[euphonium playing]

1819
01:39:17,484 --> 01:39:21,221
[playing continues]

1820
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:49,717
- [playing continues] - [footsteps approaching]

1821
01:39:53,854 --> 01:39:56,256
[euphonium fades]

1822
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,395
Sounds beautiful.

1823
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:06,667
Morning.

1824
01:40:11,372 --> 01:40:14,241
I'm a captain of Kitauji's concert band.

1825
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,210
Kumiko Oumae.

1826
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:19,279
[laughing] This is so embarrassing!

1827
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:20,681
[Kanade] No, it's great!

1828
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:25,352
[Kumiko] Let's do this!
