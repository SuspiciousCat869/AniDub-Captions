1
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:46,966
Kenichi, Hideki...

2
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:48,959
Minoru...

3
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,131
Masao...

4
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:53,068
Susumu...

5
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:55,184
Yuta...

6
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:57,452
Yaichi...

7
00:00:58,697 --> 00:00:59,564
Toyoaki...

8
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:01,490
Isao...

9
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:03,653
Ryosuke...

10
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:05,326
Yukio...

11
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,498
Takahiro...

12
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,070
Please, Master, let's go.

13
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:24,806
You must think of your health.

14
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:31,566
I wonder for how much longer I'll
be able to make the journey here.

15
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,865
While I am still in charge,

16
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:45,093
I hope to be able to avenge the lives of these children.

17
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,201
Just this month...

18
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:53,436
I have received as many as seven reports

19
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:55,468
of demon catastrophes.

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,381
Even as we speak, my children in the Demon Slayer
Corps are on the front lines taking them head-on.

21
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,505
No matter how many lives the demons snuff out...

22
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,521
what they can never extinguish

23
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,721
are the bright embers of a human's spirit.

24
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,331
No matter how often we're beaten down,

25
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:30,303
in the end, we will rise up to fight again.

26
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:21,185
Let's hide our swords under our clothing.

27
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,821
Wh... The train's leaving!

28
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,704
Are the police still around?

29
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,667
We have to go, either way.

30
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:31,784
All right!

31
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,887
I'm takin' you on, Master of the Land!

32
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,284
Wait, you idiot!

33
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:37,316
Let's follow.

34
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,702
Huh? Hey, wait for me!

35
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,691
Wait up, you guys!

36
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:49,412
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

37
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:50,460
We got you!

38
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:04,792
Ah.

39
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,075
Uh, sorry, gentlemen.

40
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:11,326
What are you doing?

41
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:12,463
Get over here.

42
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:13,943
Let me go!

43
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,969
There, ma'am. All set.

44
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,502
Ah, thank you, dear.

45
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,163
Sorry to trouble you.

46
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:28,891
Oh, it's no trouble at all, really!

47
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:43,207
This Rengoku, he's a Hashira, right?

48
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,549
You sure you'll recognize him?

49
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,218
Yeah. Along with his fiery hair,

50
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:50,819
I remember his scent, too.

51
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,642
Hey!

52
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,311
I'll tell you when I sense him.

53
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:57,815
Tasty!

54
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:31,291
Tasty!

55
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:32,870
Tasty!

56
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:34,948
Tasty!

57
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:38,409
Tasty!

58
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:41,306
Tasty!

59
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,847
Tasty!

60
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:47,709
Tasty.

61
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:50,119
Tasty.

62
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:52,100
Tasty.

63
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:55,360
Tasty.

64
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:58,625
Tasty.

65
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,180
That's the Flame Hashira?

66
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:01,740
Tasty.

67
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:02,610
Uh-huh.

68
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:04,892
Not just some random glutton?

69
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:05,578
Uh-huh.

70
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:06,945
Tasty!

71
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:09,407
Uh, 'scuse me, sir.

72
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:11,262
Tasty.

73
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,198
R-Rengoku?

74
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:14,558
Tasty!

75
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,289
Yeah, we heard you...

76
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:18,828
the first 50 times.

77
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:27,017
It's you.

78
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,540
You were at the mansion.

79
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:31,669
Yes. I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

80
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:33,890
This is Zenitsu Agatsuma,

81
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,090
and this here is Inosuke Hashibira.

82
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:39,730
I see. Also...

83
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:41,797
isn't there one in that box?

84
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,833
Right, my sister Nezuko.

85
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:48,117
Yes! I remember that demon.

86
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:52,636
Since the Master accepted her, I will keep my peace.

87
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:57,975
Sit down, won't you?

88
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,113
Incredible! I'm actually inside of this titan!

89
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,848
Would you calm down?!

90
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:11,661
You're gonna break the glass like that!

91
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,003
And what brings the three of you here?

92
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:15,791
A mission?

93
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:18,612
Yes. We were ordered to join you.

94
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:21,268
We received a message from a Crow

95
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:25,340
which let us know that casualties
on this train were on the rise.

96
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,779
Ah! That's why you're here. Understood.

97
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:29,692
Sir...

98
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:32,994
there was one more thing...

99
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,840
something I wanted to ask you.

100
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,977
Oh? What is it?

101
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,676
It's about my father.

102
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,423
What about your father?

103
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:46,546
He was a frail man.

104
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:47,806
Was he, now?!

105
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:49,466
And yet...

106
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:52,940
he could perform a kagura dance in freezing weather.

107
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,335
Well, good for him!

108
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:57,747
And then...

109
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:58,673
And then?!

110
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:02,588
Hinokami Kagura, the dance...

111
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:07,354
I found myself doing it, just like my father used to.

112
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,354
I was hoping if you knew anything about that dance,

113
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,488
you'd be willing to tell me.

114
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:20,242
Certainly!

115
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,203
But I don't!

116
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:23,216
Huh?

117
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:26,653
I have never even heard of that dance, not once.

118
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,809
Your father taking this kagura and adapting it for battle

119
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:32,276
is commendable.

120
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,688
There's nothing more to say about it!

121
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:37,301
H-Hang on! Are you sure you can't think of...

122
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:39,115
You should become my Tsuguko!

123
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:40,756
I'll look after you!

124
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,095
Not so fast!

125
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:44,381
And wait! When'd you get so gigantic?!

126
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,157
<i>He's a strange one, huh?</i>

127
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:49,823
Flame Breathing has a long history.

128
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:55,100
A Hashira of flame and of water have always existed.

129
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,175
Flame...

130
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:58,401
Water...

131
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,477
Wind...

132
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:00,712
Stone...

133
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:01,805
and Thunder...

134
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:03,890
the breathing fundamentals.

135
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,612
All other techniques branched off from those five,

136
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,984
like how Mist is a branch of Wind.

137
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:13,616
Mizoguchi...

138
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,721
what color is your sword?

139
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:20,130
Huh? My name is Kamado, and my sword is black.

140
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,577
Is it, now?

141
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,771
How unfortunate!

142
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,457
Why do you say that?

143
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:30,028
I've yet to see one with a black sword become a Hashira.

144
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:34,175
Also, I hear they have no idea what style to master.

145
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:38,738
There is no need for you to worry!

146
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,344
I can train you!

147
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:41,946
Maybe later.

148
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,210
And just how did you get so big again?!

149
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:52,927
<i>He's odd...</i>

150
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,118
<i>but he's got a good heart.</i>

151
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,481
<i>And I can smell he has a strong sense of justice.</i>

152
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:03,720
This is great! It's going so fast!

153
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,811
Get back in here!

154
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:07,358
That's dangerous!

155
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:08,389
Let me at 'em!

156
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,083
I wanna race to see who's faster on foot!

157
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:14,101
You can't be that stupid, can you?!

158
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,087
I wouldn't.

159
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,855
Who knows when a demon might appear?

160
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:19,242
Wha?

161
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:24,764
Wait. Demons show up on this train?

162
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:26,513
They do!

163
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:29,456
Seriously?! No!

164
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,236
I thought we were meeting up with them,

165
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,709
not trapped with them!

166
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:36,496
I'm getting off this train!

167
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:41,106
Over 40 people have gone missing from
this train in a short period of time.

168
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,709
We sent in several swordsmen.

169
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,682
However, they have all vanished,

170
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,746
and that is the reason I'm here.

171
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,446
Oh, I see now.

172
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:59,492
Excuse me. This is my stop. I'm getting off!

173
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,329
May I...

174
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:09,773
see your...

175
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:12,191
tickets, please?

176
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:14,514
What's happening?

177
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:15,747
That man there,

178
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,234
he is going to check that your ticket is valid.

179
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:30,402
Here.

180
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,795
<i>That scent...</i>

181
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:58,353
<i>it's horrible.</i>

182
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,769
Thank you...

183
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:03,973
very much.

184
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:09,682
Conductor...

185
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,768
apologies for the sword.

186
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:13,552
But there is a reason,

187
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,067
so please keep at a safe distance.

188
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,863
What a giant.

189
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:40,131
Did you use a Blood Demon Art?

190
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:42,721
It was difficult to detect you.

191
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,451
Know this...

192
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,160
if you bare your fangs at the innocent...

193
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,236
I will see your bone turned to ash...

194
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:55,399
with my Bright Red Blade of Fire!

195
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,273
<i>Flame Breathing.</i>

196
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,251
<i>First Form...</i>

197
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

198
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,180
Amazing.

199
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:29,445
And with a single slice.

200
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,508
There's still one more.

201
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:35,766
Come with me.

202
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:37,079
Huh?

203
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:39,626
All right!

204
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,111
Hey, don't leave me here!

205
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:05,057
You will not lay a finger on that man!

206
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:12,056
Let me make this clear.

207
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,817
Your opponent stands before you now.

208
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:16,673
What is that thing?

209
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,728
Its... Its arms look so freaking long!

210
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:20,734
All right!

211
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,231
First come, first served!

212
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:24,794
Hang on! There's still a bystander there!

213
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,335
It won't matter once I kill this!

214
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,848
You'll be safe in the back. Now go!

215
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,727
We don't have to hold back now.

216
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,242
Let's finish this.

217
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:00,763
<i>Flame Breathing.</i>

218
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,528
<i>Second Form...</i>

219
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:08,184
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

220
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:31,395
Th-That...

221
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:33,915
was totally cool, Bro!

222
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,108
Talk about genius swordplay!

223
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:38,246
Please let me tutor under you!

224
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:39,368
Very well then!

225
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:41,043
I'll make you a fine swordsman!

226
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,176
Can I join?

227
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,361
Yeah, me, too!

228
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:45,596
I would be willing to take you all in!

229
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:48,533
You're awesome, Big Bro!

230
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,968
Brother!

231
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,271
Brother!

232
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,371
Bro!

233
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:55,093
Thanks so much, Big Bro!

234
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,549
Yeah!

235
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:36,819
As ordered,

236
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,087
I put them all to sleep, sir.

237
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:43,130
Now please, do the same to me as well, won't you?

238
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:47,436
Let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter.

239
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:52,454
Please, I'm begging you.

240
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:55,459
Certainly.

241
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:02,024
You did a fine job.

242
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,554
Now sleep forever.

243
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:12,642
Dream that you are with your family again.

244
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:15,581
Pardon me.

245
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,411
What would you like from us?

246
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,914
Those who are sleeping now

247
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:25,691
will sink even deeper.

248
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:27,910
Wait here until then.

249
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,921
A few demon hunters...

250
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:35,178
will sometimes wake unexpectedly from sensing a demon.

251
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,826
So be very careful when you are tying them up

252
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,557
that you do not directly touch their bodies.

253
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:45,293
I must remain in the first car for the time being.

254
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,112
'Til everything's ready to go, good luck.

255
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:53,709
You all want peaceful dreams as well, don't you?

256
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:54,662
Yes.

257
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,489
<i>What's going on? What happened?</i>

258
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:01,743
<i>Calm down.</i>

259
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,303
<i>Just calm down.</i>

260
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:06,297
<i>Slow your breathing.</i>

261
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:16,453
Huh?

262
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:17,454
Look!

263
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,490
Brother's back home!

264
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:21,864
Welcome home, Tanjiro!

265
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:23,652
You sell the charcoal?

266
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,662
Hey, what's wrong?

267
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,783
Sorry. I'm sorry.

268
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,884
To die while in the rapture of a dream,

269
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:14,378
a blessing indeed.

270
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:18,994
It doesn't matter how powerful a demon hunter you are.

271
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:24,077
The spark that drives these beings comes from the heart,

272
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,896
the human spirit.

273
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,625
All you have to do is stamp out their spiritual core.

274
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:34,136
You can kill them just like that.

275
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,266
All human hearts work in the same fashion.

276
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:40,131
Like a delicate glasswork,

277
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:43,272
they're so pitifully fragile and weak.

278
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:48,838
We have to tie up their wrists, is that right?

279
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,531
Yeah, and don't forget what he warned us about.

280
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,908
Take in a deep, slow breath.

281
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,254
Then start counting upwards.

282
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:11,371
<i>Do that, and you'll fall asleep.</i>

283
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:13,452
<i>One...</i>

284
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:15,116
<i>two...</i>

285
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:16,749
<i>three...</i>

286
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:18,503
<i>four...</i>

287
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:20,593
<i>five...</i>

288
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:22,693
<i>six...</i>

289
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,834
And then he suddenly burst into tears.

290
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,524
We were pretty surprised.

291
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,415
What an odd duck!

292
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,485
Well, maybe you're just exhausted is all.

293
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:42,193
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

294
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,962
You don't have a fever, do you, dear?

295
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:50,050
Don't push yourself.

296
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:52,112
Just rest for today.

297
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:54,310
Really, I'm all right.

298
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,571
Are you sure?

299
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:58,774
Hey! Come back with that!

300
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,667
Whoa!

301
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,211
Just what do you think you're doing, huh?

302
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:04,647
Come on!

303
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,554
You stop that right now!

304
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:08,136
Are you listening?!

305
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:09,285
I guess...

306
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:12,222
I was having a bad dream or something earlier.

307
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:17,501
Hush, my child.

308
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:19,926
Sleep well, my child.

309
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,310
Sleep soundly. Forget to breathe.

310
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:26,337
Should a demon appear, sleep.

311
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:30,774
Even inside its stomach, sleep.

312
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,617
Oh, that's delightful.

313
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:36,848
you must be having such wonderful dreams.

314
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,276
Fall deeper...

315
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,549
and deeper still...

316
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,946
into your dream.

317
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,962
Continue to slumber...

318
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:57,424
and...

319
00:22:58,574 --> 00:23:00,923
you shall never be roused again.

320
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:12,082
Here. Let me show you!

321
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,166
These peaches are delicious!

322
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,378
And with all the white clover in bloom,

323
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:18,198
I can make you a ring of flowers.

324
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:20,992
I'm pretty good at it. You'll see.

325
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:22,674
Come on, Nezuko.

326
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,518
Yeah! Make a lot, okay?

327
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,488
I'd love that!

328
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:33,904
Yahoo!

329
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,939
We have to cross a river, but don't worry. It's shallow.

330
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:39,565
River?

331
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:43,477
But I can't swim at all.

332
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,298
Zenitsu, what do I do?

333
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,734
It's fine! I'll just carry
you on my back and jump over it!

334
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:54,195
Not even your toes will get wet.

335
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:56,735
Hyah!

336
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,604
Just leave it all to me!

337
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:02,511
Here we go!

338
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:19,578
Survey Team! Survey Team!

339
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:21,610
We are the Cave Survey Team!

340
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:23,536
Survey Team! Survey Team!

341
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,365
We are the Cave Survey Team!

342
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,783
Survey Team! Survey Team!

343
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:27,615
Hey, Boss!

344
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,734
Wait, Boss!

345
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,310
What is it...

346
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:32,526
Underling One and Underling Two?

347
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:33,983
Over there!

348
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:37,099
I smell the master of this cave, clear as trash!

349
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,424
And its snoring doesn't squeak by me!

350
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:49,817
There he is, all right! Underlings, go get him!

351
00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:51,745
You got it, Boss man!

352
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:53,042
Hey, you!

353
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:55,337
Don't fall behind, Underling Three!

354
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,263
Come on. Look!

355
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,410
I'll give you these sparkly acorns.

356
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:01,549
Let's go!

357
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:03,206
Yeah!

358
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,516
Hmm?

359
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:33,235
<i>Why am I here?</i>

360
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:40,646
<i>Right. To report to my father</i>

361
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:42,753
<i>about becoming a Hashira.</i>

362
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,195
So what if you've become a Hashira?

363
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:13,205
Worthless. It means nothing.

364
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,234
You'll still never amount to anything.

365
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:21,066
Neither you, nor I.

366
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:29,004
Uh, Brother.

367
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:33,742
Did your news make Father happy?

368
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:37,661
I hope when I become a Hashira,

369
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,740
that father will acknowledge me as well.

370
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,592
<i>He wasn't always like that.</i>

371
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:50,006
<i>In fact, he was once a Hashira himself.</i>

372
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,757
<i>He was full of passion.</i>

373
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,786
<i>And then one day, he quit being a swordsman...</i>

374
00:26:58,635 --> 00:26:59,590
<i>just like that.</i>

375
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:04,724
<i>The man who raised us both with such enthusiasm...</i>

376
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:10,031
<i>Why?</i>

377
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:15,652
<i>There's no use in dwelling on this now.</i>

378
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,253
<i>Senjuro has been through even worse.</i>

379
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:24,934
<i>Our mother died when he was
too young to even remember her...</i>

380
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:28,201
<i>and the anguish Father's in...</i>

381
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,042
Senjuro...

382
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:38,470
to be honest, he was not happy.

383
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:40,971
He said that it meant nothing.

384
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:45,519
Even so, that will not extinguish my passion.

385
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:48,869
This flame in my heart burns strong!

386
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,435
I'll never lose faith!

387
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,634
Listen, Senjuro.

388
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:58,524
Keep this firmly in mind.

389
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,010
You have an older brother...

390
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,929
a brother who believes in you.

391
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:08,377
Whatever path you take, you're going to become a fine man.

392
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:12,744
Just keep that burning passion inside your heart.

393
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:15,290
Let's both do our best,

394
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:17,543
no matter how lonely it gets.

395
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:26,131
Everything's set.

396
00:28:26,577 --> 00:28:32,561
The ropes which I created allow one to invade
the dreams of whoever it is you're tethered to.

397
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:37,946
I always use the utmost caution when I engage in battle.

398
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,945
Hashira or not, once asleep,

399
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,239
you are no different from that of a newborn.

400
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:49,429
I will enjoy this savory feast after
I have disposed of the demon hunters.

401
00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:00,381
There's no need to tense up quite so much.

402
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:02,585
Relax your shoulders.

403
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:05,300
Like this?

404
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,515
That's right.

405
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:08,778
He's here.

406
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,313
Gotta be careful.

407
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:13,831
<i>I don't want his True Self to see me.</i>

408
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:18,907
<i>I have to get to the corner of this dream... and quickly!</i>

409
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:23,976
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

410
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:29,021
It's circular, with the dreamer presiding at the center.

411
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:34,506
The realm of the subconscious
exists just outside the dream,

412
00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:37,099
where you'll find the spiritual core.

413
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:40,867
That's what you must destroy.

414
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:43,861
Once you do that, the owner of the dream

415
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:45,635
will cease to be.

416
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:54,729
I found it!

417
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:58,948
Even though I can see further, I can't move beyond this.

418
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:05,577
<i>I'll destroy his spiritual core as soon as possible.</i>

419
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:11,891
<i>And then I'll get to experience a happy dream myself!</i>

420
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:24,321
This is his "realm of the subconscious"?

421
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:25,989
All this fire...

422
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:27,429
so hot.

423
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:29,618
I've gotta hurry.

424
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:49,196
There it is, the spiritual core.

425
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,539
I've never seen a red one before.

426
00:30:57,826 --> 00:30:59,674
All I have to do now is...

427
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,561
destroy this!

428
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:30,274
<i>I thought that humans weren't able to
move while they were under a spell like this.</i>

429
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,559
<i>What kind of survival instinct is this?</i>

430
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:48,978
Tanjiro, I'm going to make your
favorite rice crackers today, all right?

431
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:50,413
Really?!

432
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:53,763
Yes. Let me break up some old rice cakes.

433
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:56,598
Hear that, Rokuta? Rice crackers!

434
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:57,951
No fair!

435
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:01,310
Brother's not the only one who likes rice crackers.

436
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,880
I want some, too!

437
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:03,959
Me, three!

438
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:06,697
Well, let's eat them together then!

439
00:32:07,077 --> 00:32:08,709
Can you all get the grill ready?

440
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:09,500
Yeah!

441
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,390
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

442
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:15,578
Okay, then I'll be in charge of flipping them over!

443
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:16,265
I'll help!

444
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:19,011
Then I'll be in charge of eating them!

445
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:20,868
No fair!

446
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:38,834
Nezuko, ready?

447
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,549
What am I saying?

448
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,868
I'm back!

449
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,574
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

450
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,835
It's good to be home.

451
00:33:02,071 --> 00:33:03,490
Welcome home, Brother.

452
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:08,552
Eh? Where's Nezuko?

453
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,023
She went up the mountain to go pick vegetables.

454
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,264
Huh? In broad daylight?

455
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:15,486
Eh?

456
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:17,832
Is that wrong?

457
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:18,966
Uh...

458
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,819
well, I guess not.

459
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:25,369
Tanjiro, could you get the bath ready for me?

460
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:27,509
I still have more to do here.

461
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:34,210
I've been saying lots of strange things.

462
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,431
Maybe I'm tired.

463
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,986
Huh.

464
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:45,221
It's gone.

465
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:49,211
I wonder what that was just now.

466
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,097
Maybe a toolbox?

467
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:57,454
I must be tired.

468
00:34:01,297 --> 00:34:02,235
<i>Wake up!</i>

469
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:06,535
<i>Wake up!</i>

470
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:13,202
<i>We're in danger! You've gotta wake up!</i>

471
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:15,927
<i>All of this, it's all a dream!</i>

472
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:17,483
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

473
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:20,546
<i>So that must mean I'm still...</i>

474
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:23,552
<i>onboard the train!</i>

475
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,587
<i>Wake up, and fight!</i>

476
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:26,971
<i>You have to!</i>

477
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,659
<i>You have to fight!</i>

478
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,657
Hey, give me your pickled radishes.

479
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:40,487
Hold it right there, Takeo! That's so not fair!

480
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:43,681
Why are you always taking food away from Tanjiro, huh?

481
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:45,036
Mind your own business!

482
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:46,667
And you just had seconds!

483
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:50,400
<i>Damn.</i>

484
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:52,756
<i>I'm still trapped inside this dream.</i>

485
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:54,716
<i>How do I get out?</i>

486
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:57,387
<i>Even knowing that it's a dream,</i>

487
00:34:58,444 --> 00:34:59,913
<i>what am I supposed to do?</i>

488
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:09,756
Hmm?

489
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:12,576
Hmm.

490
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:14,730
Hmm?

491
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,624
I've gotta wake up.

492
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:24,742
Hmm?

493
00:35:58,471 --> 00:35:59,263
Brother!

494
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,627
What do we do?!

495
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:01,654
Tanjiro!

496
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:06,257
<i>This scent of blood...</i>

497
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,891
<i>I know it.</i>

498
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,780
<i>Nezuko.</i>

499
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:12,453
<i>It's Nezuko!</i>

500
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,637
<i>My uniform, my sword.</i>

501
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,408
<i>I'm waking up.</i>

502
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,240
<i>I can feel it, little by little.</i>

503
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,222
What happened?

504
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:29,166
We were really scared there.

505
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:30,659
You all right?

506
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:33,880
Sorry, everyone.

507
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:40,869
<i>There's no other choice.</i>

508
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,075
I have to go.

509
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:45,796
Brother!

510
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:46,537
Wait!

511
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:48,209
Where are you going?

512
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:56,644
<i>If the demon who's showing me this dream is nearby,</i>

513
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:59,197
<i>I have to defeat it quickly!</i>

514
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,356
<i>Time's running out.</i>

515
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:03,745
<i>Where is it?</i>

516
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,194
Where are you running off to?

517
00:37:15,948 --> 00:37:18,663
I picked lots of vegetables from the mountain.

518
00:37:23,423 --> 00:37:25,591
He went this way, Mom! Hurry! Come on!

519
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:28,504
Brother just suddenly bust into flames!

520
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,187
What happened?

521
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:35,317
Tanjiro, are you all right?

522
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:37,217
Tanjiro.

523
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:46,001
What's the matter, dear?

524
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:48,136
And why are you dressed like that?

525
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:58,026
I wish...

526
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:02,561
I wish I could stay. I do.

527
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:08,188
<i>I'd live with you all forever.</i>

528
00:38:09,932 --> 00:38:11,529
<i>Just like how it should have been...</i>

529
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:13,375
<i>from the very beginning...</i>

530
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:15,877
<i>right here.</i>

531
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,674
<i>If things had been as they should have,</i>

532
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:21,660
<i>you'd all be alive.</i>

533
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,609
<i>And Nezuko would be able to be in the sunlight,</i>

534
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:28,783
<i>under the blue sky.</i>

535
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:32,941
<i>That's how it'd be...</i>

536
00:38:33,684 --> 00:38:35,085
<i>how it should have been.</i>

537
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,919
<i>I would still be here making charcoal.</i>

538
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,463
<i>I would have never laid a hand on a sword.</i>

539
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,468
<i>If only...</i>

540
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,929
<i>if only it could have stayed that way.</i>

541
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:05,565
<i>But now...</i>

542
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:07,282
<i>they're all gone.</i>

543
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:09,670
<i>I can never go back!</i>

544
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:14,718
Tanjiro!

545
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,750
Please don't leave us behind!

546
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:27,564
<i>Rokuta, I'm so sorry.</i>

547
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:31,659
<i>But we can't be together anymore.</i>

548
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:37,204
<i>I promise I'll always be thinking of you.</i>

549
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:41,163
<i>I'll be thinking of you all.</i>

550
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:46,955
<i>There are so many things I have to thank you for</i>

551
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,354
<i>and things to apologize for.</i>

552
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:52,837
<i>But I'll never forget you.</i>

553
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,629
<i>No matter what, you will always be in my heart.</i>

554
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,644
<i>So please...</i>

555
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:01,441
<i>forgive me. I beg you!</i>

556
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:09,475
I guess...

557
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,849
I still need to destroy his spiritual core.

558
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:34,158
<i>This is what's inside his soul?</i>

559
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:38,766
<i>How is it this beautiful?</i>

560
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:42,069
<i>It's like it stretches forever</i>

561
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:43,409
<i>and feels...</i>

562
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,137
<i>so warm.</i>

563
00:40:56,937 --> 00:41:00,468
Where the heck's this spiritual core thing?

564
00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:03,393
This subconscious,

565
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:05,627
I don't like being here at all.

566
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:10,665
That topless boar-man I saw was also creepy.

567
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:13,794
This is all so overwhelming.

568
00:41:19,866 --> 00:41:22,635
What are you even doing here, you weird creature?

569
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:25,372
I don't want you anywhere near me!

570
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:37,746
It's pitch dark.

571
00:41:39,634 --> 00:41:41,656
I can't see a damn thing in here.

572
00:41:42,203 --> 00:41:43,183
This sucks.

573
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:47,246
What is with this blond brat's subconscious realm anyway?

574
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:52,164
Do I really have to grope around
like this to find his spiritual core?

575
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:54,637
You've gotta be kidding me!

576
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:58,225
What was that?

577
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,613
What the hell is a guy doing in this area?

578
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:12,796
You parasite!

579
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:16,430
The only person who's allowed here is Nezuko!

580
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:20,418
So I'm gonna kill you.

581
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,018
Where is Nezuko?

582
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,813
What?! How would I know?!

583
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:26,986
Well, then...

584
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,731
just die!

585
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:33,216
No!

586
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,240
No results yet?

587
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,361
It seems that they're struggling
to destroy the spiritual cores.

588
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:47,688
I wonder why.

589
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:49,929
Well...

590
00:42:50,189 --> 00:42:51,788
they're buying me some time,

591
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:53,599
so I guess it doesn't matter.

592
00:42:58,711 --> 00:42:59,676
<i>Not here.</i>

593
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:02,203
<i>But I can smell him, just barely.</i>

594
00:43:03,087 --> 00:43:04,231
<i>What's happening, though?</i>

595
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:06,686
<i>It's like there's a film over everything.</i>

596
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:09,490
<i>The faint, demonic scent is all around,</i>

597
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:11,760
<i>so I can't pinpoint the location.</i>

598
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:14,281
I've got to hurry.

599
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,908
I could smell that Nezuko's hurt.

600
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:21,064
If everyone else is asleep, then we're in big trouble.

601
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:23,271
<i>What should I do?</i>

602
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:27,043
<i>If I'm asleep right now, then...</i>

603
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:31,402
<i>does that mean I'm not able to
use Total Concentration Breathing?</i>

604
00:43:33,169 --> 00:43:34,166
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

605
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,096
...take up your sword.

606
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:45,848
What you must cut is within your reach.

607
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:57,804
<i>What I must cut...</i>

608
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:00,501
<i>is within my reach?</i>

609
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:03,689
<i>So to wake up...</i>

610
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:05,753
<i>does that mean...</i>

611
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:09,525
<i>I think I understand.</i>

612
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:12,649
<i>But what if I'm wrong?</i>

613
00:44:13,977 --> 00:44:16,963
<i>If what happens here has an effect out there...</i>

614
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:19,049
<i>it'll be over.</i>

615
00:44:22,345 --> 00:44:23,465
<i>Don't hesitate.</i>

616
00:44:23,558 --> 00:44:24,169
<i>Do it!</i>

617
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:25,896
<i>You have to.</i>

618
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:28,659
<i>My death will put an end to this dream.</i>

619
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:30,566
<i>In other words,</i>

620
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:32,694
<i>what I have to slash...</i>

621
00:44:36,128 --> 00:44:37,918
<i>is my very own neck!</i>

622
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,321
It's all right. I'm alive.

623
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:04,615
Nezuko!

624
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:05,562
You okay?

625
00:45:08,451 --> 00:45:09,567
I'm so glad.

626
00:45:11,704 --> 00:45:12,691
Zenitsu.

627
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:14,586
Inosuke.

628
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,639
Mr. Rengoku.

629
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:22,451
<i>Who are these people?</i>

630
00:45:23,844 --> 00:45:25,827
<i>They're tied to the others with rope.</i>

631
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,638
<i>The rope.</i>

632
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:34,152
<i>It looks like it's been singed off, but how?</i>

633
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:36,466
<i>Her flaming blood maybe?</i>

634
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:39,683
<i>There's a faint scent of demon on it, too.</i>

635
00:45:42,037 --> 00:45:44,004
This smell, that's it!

636
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:46,578
<i>It's subtle,</i>

637
00:45:46,603 --> 00:45:48,258
<i>but I can tell it's the same one.</i>

638
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:51,964
<i>So we were put to sleep when these were punched.</i>

639
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:54,739
<i>A demon must be behind it.</i>

640
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,897
<i>But using such a strong Blood Demon
Art with this discreet of a smell...</i>

641
00:46:03,418 --> 00:46:04,511
<i>For some reason...</i>

642
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:08,654
<i>I have this feeling that I shouldn't
sever this rope with my sword.</i>

643
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,328
Nezuko, listen.

644
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:15,477
Can you burn the other ropes?

645
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,267
Zenitsu, wake up!

646
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,024
Can you hear me?

647
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:28,831
You've gotta wake up, Zenitsu!

648
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,907
Inosuke, wake up, please!

649
00:46:35,164 --> 00:46:36,131
Inosuke.

650
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:40,985
There, there. It's fine.

651
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:44,861
Sorry for worrying you. You did a great job.

652
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:49,615
<i>It's no good.</i>

653
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:50,704
<i>They won't wake up.</i>

654
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:52,872
<i>What do I do?</i>

655
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:57,609
Mr. Rengo...

656
00:47:00,763 --> 00:47:01,731
What are you...

657
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:07,679
<i>Is this girl under the control of a demon?</i>

658
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,365
You're all interfering!

659
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:13,597
Now that you people are here,
we won't get any happy dreams!

660
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:17,498
<i>I don't think she is.</i>

661
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:20,563
<i>Him, too?</i>

662
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:25,884
What are you doing?

663
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,631
Get off your ass, and come help us out!

664
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:34,216
I don't care if you have tuberculosis.
If you don't do your job, I'll go tell him,

665
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:36,518
and then he won't show you any more dreams!

666
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:42,256
<i>Was he connected to my dream?</i>

667
00:47:43,376 --> 00:47:46,372
<i>She said he has tuberculosis.</i>

668
00:47:47,149 --> 00:47:48,066
<i>How awful.</i>

669
00:47:49,564 --> 00:47:50,911
<i>It's unforgivable...</i>

670
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,826
<i>taking advantage of them like this.</i>

671
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,526
I'm sorry,

672
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:00,740
but I have no choice but to fight back.

673
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:19,085
You just wanted a happy dream, didn't you?

674
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:21,266
I know.

675
00:48:22,993 --> 00:48:25,791
I wanted that as well.

676
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:33,794
I wish this was just a bad dream.

677
00:48:45,283 --> 00:48:46,161
<i>To think...</i>

678
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,738
<i>I was willing to inflict pain on others</i>

679
00:48:50,313 --> 00:48:53,310
<i>if it meant I could escape from the pain of my illness.</i>

680
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:56,855
<i>But inside your dream...</i>

681
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,890
<i>inside your soul,</i>

682
00:48:59,702 --> 00:49:00,637
<i>it was warm.</i>

683
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,931
You must be incarnations of this boy's soul.

684
00:49:10,277 --> 00:49:12,715
The sky is so clear and relaxing.

685
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:23,794
Is that his spiritual core?

686
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:26,311
Why bring me here?

687
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:34,154
You're saying because I was searching for it?

688
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:44,355
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

689
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,015
I don't understand.

690
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,961
Why would you do that?

691
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:52,028
<i>The glimmering fairies inside of your heart</i>

692
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:54,499
<i>brought light into mine.</i>

693
00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:59,435
Are you all right?

694
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:03,114
I am now.

695
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:06,331
Be careful.

696
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:11,547
Thanks.

697
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:13,066
Let's go.

698
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,416
<i>It's the demon.</i>

699
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,699
<i>His scent is overwhelming,</i>

700
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:32,161
<i>even in such a strong wind.</i>

701
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:35,207
<i>How did I manage to sleep through it?</i>

702
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:39,010
<i>Even if each car was closed off and airtight,</i>

703
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:40,818
<i>it's unbelievable.</i>

704
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,706
<i>I'm so ashamed!</i>

705
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:45,090
<i>The demon's upwind.</i>

706
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:46,616
<i>Is he in that first car?</i>

707
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:53,614
It's dangerous, Nezuko, so don't follow me past here!

708
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,545
Go wake everyone up!

709
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:06,111
What's this? You're awake now?

710
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:07,786
Good morning.

711
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:09,492
What a shame.

712
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:11,629
You could have stayed dreaming forever.

713
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:14,311
<i>He's the one.</i>

714
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,470
Why are you awake?

715
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:22,006
Did I not show you a dream tailored to your every desire?

716
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:28,258
If I had so wished it, it could have been a
dream where your family was being slaughtered.

717
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:31,019
Would you have liked that one better?

718
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:33,844
Of course not. Much too distressing.

719
00:51:37,348 --> 00:51:38,879
Or here's an idea.

720
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:42,857
A dream where your dear father comes back to life.

721
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:57,109
<i>I really do love showing people happy, little dreams</i>

722
00:51:57,241 --> 00:52:00,712
<i>right before submerging them into a terrible nightmare.</i>

723
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:06,015
<i>Seeing the look of utter confusion
and horror on a human's face</i>

724
00:52:06,488 --> 00:52:08,565
<i>is simply exquisite.</i>

725
00:52:09,352 --> 00:52:13,492
<i>To look upon someone shattered
to the absolute core by misfortune,</i>

726
00:52:13,517 --> 00:52:17,720
<i>squirming in agony, is like a sweet nectar to me.</i>

727
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:21,237
<i>My methods may seem roundabout,</i>

728
00:52:21,453 --> 00:52:23,754
<i>but do not mistake me for distracted.</i>

729
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,296
<i>I will kill those demon hunters.</i>

730
00:52:27,242 --> 00:52:30,457
<i>By mixing my blood with the ink on those tickets,</i>

731
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,067
<i>the conductor simply needs to punch the holes in them,</i>

732
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:36,020
<i>at which point...</i>

733
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:39,625
<i>the spell activates.</i>

734
00:52:42,984 --> 00:52:44,231
<i>So why...</i>

735
00:52:44,837 --> 00:52:47,723
<i>why is it that this one managed to wake up?</i>

736
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:51,962
<i>It didn't take him long to figure out how to, either.</i>

737
00:52:53,265 --> 00:52:54,636
<i>How can this be,</i>

738
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:59,559
<i>when the human desire to wrap themselves in
a cheerful world of their own imagination...</i>

739
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:03,580
...is of such a giant magnitude?

740
00:53:06,274 --> 00:53:09,767
Intruding on one's soul is something I won't allow!

741
00:53:10,113 --> 00:53:12,069
This trespassing of yours...

742
00:53:12,714 --> 00:53:14,201
shall not stand!

743
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:17,783
<i>What's this?</i>

744
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:19,660
<i>Those earrings he's wearing...</i>

745
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:25,334
What good fortune!

746
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,647
Like a moth to flame, he came right to me!

747
00:53:29,482 --> 00:53:35,886
Could this be a dream? Now I can receive an
even greater share of Master Muzan's blood!

748
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:39,558
Once I've done so and become even more powerful,

749
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:44,955
I can challenge an Upper Rank
demon in a duel and usurp their place!

750
00:53:47,778 --> 00:53:48,851
Water Breathing.

751
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:51,906
Tenth Form...

752
00:53:52,637 --> 00:53:54,246
Constant Flux!

753
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,181
Blood Demon Art!

754
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:07,344
<i>Whispers of Ordained Unconscious Mesmerism.</i>

755
00:54:08,015 --> 00:54:11,125
<i>Go to sleep, dear child.</i>

756
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:21,561
<i>It didn't work?</i>

757
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:28,570
Sleep now.

758
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,832
Sleep now.

759
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:40,958
Sleep now!

760
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:42,600
Sleep now!

761
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:51,899
Go to sleep!

762
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,083
<i>Why is he not affected?</i>

763
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:56,360
<i>No...</i>

764
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:57,446
<i>he is.</i>

765
00:54:58,558 --> 00:55:01,550
<i>He's falling under the spell over and over.</i>

766
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:11,696
<i>But each time he does, he remains self-aware...</i>

767
00:55:14,925 --> 00:55:18,269
<i>and takes his own life in order to reawaken.</i>

768
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:27,049
<i>To commit suicide, even in the middle of a dream,</i>

769
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,394
<i>to take his own life with his own hands,</i>

770
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:33,195
<i>requires incredible willpower.</i>

771
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:34,811
<i>This rascal...</i>

772
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:39,362
<i>is out of his mind!</i>

773
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,347
Why didn't you save us?

774
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:52,970
We needed you, Brother.

775
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,508
While we were being murdered,

776
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:00,168
where the hell were you?

777
00:56:03,063 --> 00:56:04,360
Why were you...

778
00:56:05,135 --> 00:56:06,764
the sole survivor?

779
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:17,723
You couldn't even save your own family.

780
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:20,058
You're so useless.

781
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,754
You're the one who should have died that day.

782
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:35,009
But instead you've gone and just left us all behind.

783
00:56:42,438 --> 00:56:45,306
Don't put words in the mouths of my family!

784
00:56:45,345 --> 00:56:47,390
They would never say that!

785
00:56:47,795 --> 00:56:49,219
Your visions...

786
00:56:49,918 --> 00:56:53,796
they insult their memory!

787
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:20,862
<i>That was too easy.</i>

788
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:24,546
<i>Could this be a dream, too?</i>

789
00:57:25,439 --> 00:57:28,051
<i>Or maybe this demon was just weaker than him.</i>

790
00:57:30,165 --> 00:57:31,861
I understand now.

791
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:37,160
I understand why the Master
ordered me to have you disposed of.

792
00:57:39,283 --> 00:57:42,087
Disposed with the Hashira!

793
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:45,590
It's the nature of your very existence.

794
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:49,340
You're like a gaping, blistering sore on one's heel.

795
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,631
<i>He's not dead?</i>

796
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:55,013
What a lovely expression on your face,

797
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,708
one that I have been longing to see.

798
00:57:59,735 --> 00:58:02,612
You're wondering why I'm still alive,

799
00:58:02,752 --> 00:58:04,811
even after you decapitated me.

800
00:58:05,504 --> 00:58:09,452
Well, I'll tell you, since I'm feeling so ecstatic.

801
00:58:09,933 --> 00:58:14,337
I'll try to use small words so even you can understand it.

802
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:19,826
It's because that wasn't actually my true self.

803
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:23,412
The same can be said about what's before you.

804
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:27,369
It may look like my head, but that is not the case.

805
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,975
While you were sleeping like a helpless little baby,

806
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:35,566
I fused my being with this entire train!

807
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:39,765
Every inch of it has become my blood, my flesh,

808
00:58:39,918 --> 00:58:42,511
right down to my bones!

809
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:45,490
The look in your eye.

810
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:47,707
You're starting to understand.

811
00:58:47,994 --> 00:58:54,243
For, you see, the more than 200 passengers
on this train... or should I say hostages...

812
00:58:54,342 --> 00:58:56,412
will soon become part of my body.

813
00:58:59,857 --> 00:59:02,285
Do you think you can protect them?

814
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:06,906
Can you alone prevent me from
feasting on all the tasty human flesh

815
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:09,876
that's been packed from stem to stern?

816
00:59:10,656 --> 00:59:13,808
Or will my appetite be satiated in full?

817
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:23,058
<i>Damn it. What do I do?</i>

818
00:59:24,085 --> 00:59:26,147
<i>I can only protect two cars at most.</i>

819
00:59:27,337 --> 00:59:29,230
<i>Any more is too much for me to handle.</i>

820
00:59:30,556 --> 00:59:33,890
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

821
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:36,045
I really need your help!

822
00:59:36,246 --> 00:59:38,285
Please wake up! I'm begging you!

823
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:43,552
Nezuko! I'm trusting you to
look after the other passengers!

824
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,068
Comin' through!

825
00:59:55,093 --> 00:59:55,835
All right,

826
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,335
listen up, my minions!

827
00:59:57,382 --> 00:59:58,723
Follow me!

828
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:00,637
Keep those eyes open...

829
01:00:01,492 --> 01:00:03,607
and keep them forward!

830
01:00:03,632 --> 01:00:07,256
'Cause Lord Inosuke is comin' through!

831
01:00:07,796 --> 01:00:11,319
Inosuke, the whole train has turned into a demon!

832
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,442
There's nowhere on it that's safe!

833
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:16,105
So we have to protect the passengers!

834
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:19,802
I repeat! This entire train is a demon!

835
01:00:19,835 --> 01:00:20,550
Huh?

836
01:00:20,948 --> 01:00:22,410
What do you know?

837
01:00:22,543 --> 01:00:24,214
I was right all along!

838
01:00:24,647 --> 01:00:28,844
Talk about having absolute
killer instincts as a leader, huh?

839
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:35,040
Beast Breathing.

840
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:39,252
Fifth Fang, Crazy Cutting!

841
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:46,751
I'll be sure to save every last one of you!

842
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:53,197
As thanks, it's only fair you should fall
onto one knee and worship me as your savior!

843
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:58,180
Lord Inosuke Hashibira, I'm comin' through!

844
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:00,663
I have to save the others.

845
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:03,907
If Inosuke's handling those cars,

846
01:01:04,185 --> 01:01:05,587
I should go on ahead.

847
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:31,813
It's gotten this far already?

848
01:01:35,968 --> 01:01:37,225
<i>Water Breathing.</i>

849
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,603
<i>First Form, Water Surface Slash!</i>

850
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:46,861
<i>No good. This is never going to end.</i>

851
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,841
<i>How do I fend it off?!</i>

852
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:58,253
<i>I feel you scurrying around inside me</i>

853
01:01:58,545 --> 01:02:00,961
<i>like a loathsome parasite.</i>

854
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:05,021
<i>Flail all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.</i>

855
01:02:05,302 --> 01:02:09,230
<i>And then once all of your energy is wasted,</i>

856
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:12,953
<i>I'm going to enjoy dining on the passengers here</i>

857
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,650
<i>like an exquisite banquet.</i>

858
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,028
<i>Thunder Breathing.</i>

859
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:30,699
<i>First Form...</i>

860
01:03:31,665 --> 01:03:33,476
<i>Thunderclap and Flash.</i>

861
01:03:37,176 --> 01:03:38,180
<i>Sixfold.</i>

862
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,020
Nezuko...

863
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:42,539
I will protect you.

864
01:03:45,203 --> 01:03:46,897
Protect you.

865
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:48,863
I...

866
01:03:51,389 --> 01:03:52,829
Hmm?

867
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,731
<i>That sounded like thunder.</i>

868
01:03:54,803 --> 01:03:56,409
<i>Did it come from back there?</i>

869
01:03:56,842 --> 01:03:58,149
<i>What's happening?</i>

870
01:03:58,848 --> 01:04:00,503
<i>Is Zenitsu awake now?</i>

871
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:02,149
<i>What about Mr. Rengoku...</i>

872
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:03,815
<i>and Nezuko!</i>

873
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:11,807
<i>It's all I can do to protect the ones here.</i>

874
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:15,990
<i>What should I do? We can't fight together.</i>

875
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:19,058
<i>Are the passengers in the back all right?</i>

876
01:04:19,904 --> 01:04:20,861
<i>Damn it!</i>

877
01:04:20,886 --> 01:04:22,396
<i>There's no room to move here.</i>

878
01:04:23,813 --> 01:04:25,575
<i>It's hard to swing my sword.</i>

879
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:30,950
Hmm.

880
01:04:32,053 --> 01:04:35,478
It would appear that a lot
has gone on since I was napping.

881
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:38,850
What an ugly mess.

882
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,643
If the other Hashira were here...

883
01:04:43,026 --> 01:04:45,083
to see what I let happen...

884
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:48,029
I'd be ashamed!

885
01:04:55,502 --> 01:04:56,657
What happened?

886
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:05,080
<i>What was that? Did a demon attack?</i>

887
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:09,174
Young Kamado!

888
01:05:10,978 --> 01:05:12,397
Mr. Rengoku!

889
01:05:12,837 --> 01:05:15,568
I was quite thorough with my strikes on the way here,

890
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:18,631
so it should take the demon a while to recuperate,

891
01:05:19,364 --> 01:05:21,192
but there's still no time to waste.

892
01:05:21,435 --> 01:05:22,135
Right!

893
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:24,512
This train has eight cars.

894
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,789
I will protect the rear five.

895
01:05:27,317 --> 01:05:30,710
The other three will be handled by
your sister and that boy in yellow.

896
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:36,562
During all this, you will go with the
boar-headed lad and search for the demon's head.

897
01:05:37,182 --> 01:05:38,134
Its head?

898
01:05:38,492 --> 01:05:39,924
But, sir, how can we...

899
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:41,576
Kill something without a head?

900
01:05:41,716 --> 01:05:43,622
It's still a demon. It has one.

901
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:45,712
I will search for it as well.

902
01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:47,731
I hope you're fired up.

903
01:05:52,096 --> 01:05:53,703
<i>It's like he just disappeared.</i>

904
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:56,109
<i>Is that what made the train shake earlier?</i>

905
01:05:58,266 --> 01:06:00,739
<i>His tactical mind is just as quick, too.</i>

906
01:06:01,276 --> 01:06:02,982
<i>Handling five cars?</i>

907
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:06,313
<i>This is no time to get distracted.</i>

908
01:06:06,566 --> 01:06:07,985
<i>You have to get a move on.</i>

909
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,802
<i>The demon's scent is getting stronger by the moment.</i>

910
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,969
<i>Let's go!</i>

911
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,028
Inosuke, where are you?!

912
01:06:16,781 --> 01:06:18,441
Shut up, or I'll end you!

913
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:19,309
Up there?

914
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:24,265
I already got my marching orders from Mr. Bug Eyes!

915
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:26,814
Even with him bossing me around, though...

916
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,137
he... he was really cool!

917
01:06:30,509 --> 01:06:33,395
And for some reason, that pisses me off!

918
01:06:33,654 --> 01:06:37,178
Inosuke, keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

919
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:38,644
You don't have to tell me!

920
01:06:38,756 --> 01:06:41,364
Besides, using my awesome Seventh Form,

921
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:44,148
I've already found what it is we're looking for,

922
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:46,135
the Master's weak spot!

923
01:06:46,665 --> 01:06:49,473
You found it? So it is up front then?

924
01:06:49,697 --> 01:06:50,873
It sure is.

925
01:06:50,961 --> 01:06:53,819
And that area creeps me out even more.

926
01:06:54,579 --> 01:06:57,357
<i>I can't pick up on the scent because of the strong winds,</i>

927
01:06:57,517 --> 01:06:59,437
<i>but I trust Inosuke's senses.</i>

928
01:07:00,556 --> 01:07:02,647
Is it around where the coal's loaded?

929
01:07:02,813 --> 01:07:03,840
That's right!

930
01:07:04,014 --> 01:07:04,659
Got it!

931
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,761
Inosuke, ready?

932
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:08,208
Let's go!

933
01:07:20,528 --> 01:07:22,183
This is it, huh?

934
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:27,305
All right!

935
01:07:34,736 --> 01:07:35,976
Inosuke!

936
01:07:36,382 --> 01:07:39,038
What the hell's going on over here, huh?

937
01:07:39,384 --> 01:07:41,373
This seems pretty suspicious.

938
01:07:41,573 --> 01:07:43,274
Just who the hell are you?

939
01:07:43,783 --> 01:07:45,069
Le-Leave this area!

940
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:46,891
It's there, isn't it,

941
01:07:47,227 --> 01:07:48,631
the weak spot?

942
01:07:48,704 --> 01:07:50,152
It's mine!

943
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:54,029
Eep!

944
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:56,315
Aw, crap!

945
01:07:56,415 --> 01:07:59,014
Keep away from me, you foul beast!

946
01:08:01,047 --> 01:08:02,931
How many hands you got?!

947
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:04,271
Not good.

948
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:08,371
<i>Water Breathing.</i>

949
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:11,295
<i>Sixth Form, Whirlpool!</i>

950
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:20,803
Are you all right, Inosuke?

951
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:23,405
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay!

952
01:08:23,546 --> 01:08:24,425
I'm sorry!

953
01:08:27,235 --> 01:08:28,049
<i>It's here.</i>

954
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:30,581
<i>Right below.</i>

955
01:08:31,347 --> 01:08:32,580
<i>I can smell it.</i>

956
01:08:33,054 --> 01:08:34,585
<i>There's no doubt in my mind.</i>

957
01:08:35,026 --> 01:08:37,648
Inosuke, the demon's head is under here!

958
01:08:37,835 --> 01:08:39,217
Don't order me around!

959
01:08:39,297 --> 01:08:40,683
I'm the leader, remember?!

960
01:08:40,856 --> 01:08:41,833
Then what's next?

961
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:43,362
Just you watch.

962
01:08:43,675 --> 01:08:46,674
This is Beast Breathing, Second Fang!

963
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,201
Slice!

964
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:57,066
This is...

965
01:08:57,751 --> 01:08:59,011
his neck bone.

966
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:00,848
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

967
01:09:00,907 --> 01:09:01,998
<i>Eighth Form...</i>

968
01:09:02,683 --> 01:09:04,431
<i>Waterfall Basin!</i>

969
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,250
<i>It deflected.</i>

970
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:28,648
<i>It's healing so fast, the wound's already closed up.</i>

971
01:09:29,996 --> 01:09:33,292
<i>Just exposing the bone took
everything I could muster, too.</i>

972
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:36,242
<i>I have to sever it.</i>

973
01:09:36,928 --> 01:09:40,350
Inosuke, let's synchronize our attacks!

974
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,434
You'll slash at the flesh,

975
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,839
which will allow me to strike at the bone!

976
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,374
You wanna know somethin'?

977
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:47,965
That's not half-bad!

978
01:09:48,165 --> 01:09:49,014
Good thinkin'!

979
01:09:49,278 --> 01:09:50,067
Thank you!

980
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:52,846
Let's do it.

981
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:03,547
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

982
01:10:04,054 --> 01:10:05,335
Dream.

983
01:10:05,886 --> 01:10:07,417
<i>A Blood Demon Art!</i>

984
01:10:08,007 --> 01:10:08,994
<i>He got me.</i>

985
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,487
<i>I'm falling asleep.</i>

986
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,768
Inosuke, in your dream, slice your own neck!

987
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,411
It'll wake you up!

988
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:22,103
<i>It's all right.</i>

989
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:24,173
<i>I'm still able to break the spell.</i>

990
01:10:25,538 --> 01:10:30,124
<i>Idiot. When you wake up, keep your eyes
closed, or you'll just fall asleep again.</i>

991
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:33,529
<i>Okay, I'm awake.</i>

992
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:40,978
<i>Damn! The moment I wake up,</i>

993
01:10:41,011 --> 01:10:44,171
<i>I can't help but look directly
into one of those demon eyes.</i>

994
01:10:44,831 --> 01:10:46,852
<i>I've got to make sure when I wake up</i>

995
01:10:47,228 --> 01:10:48,983
<i>that I keep my eyes shut!</i>

996
01:10:50,951 --> 01:10:51,698
<i>Again!</i>

997
01:10:52,312 --> 01:10:53,026
<i>Wake up!</i>

998
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,430
<i>Wake up!</i>

999
01:10:55,323 --> 01:10:56,203
<i>Come on!</i>

1000
01:10:56,616 --> 01:10:57,253
<i>Your neck...</i>

1001
01:10:57,409 --> 01:10:59,608
<i>slash it. Wake up!</i>

1002
01:10:59,947 --> 01:11:01,282
<i>This is a dream!</i>

1003
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:04,862
<i>There's no time left.</i>

1004
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:07,311
<i>Wake yourself up!</i>

1005
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:13,189
You're not dreaming right now.

1006
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:15,502
Don't go falling for his trickery.

1007
01:11:15,728 --> 01:11:17,963
You wanna look like a damn fool?

1008
01:11:22,304 --> 01:11:25,549
I'm wearing the hide of the Mountain God on my head.

1009
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,777
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

1010
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,753
I'm right, aren't I?!

1011
01:11:32,206 --> 01:11:36,693
<i>Or it's having a hard time
telling which way Inosuke's looking!</i>

1012
01:11:37,176 --> 01:11:38,289
Okay!

1013
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:40,849
Now we just gotta cut this thing to pieces!

1014
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:46,393
Inosuke!

1015
01:11:46,728 --> 01:11:49,989
I won't let you take away my chance to dream!

1016
01:11:56,696 --> 01:11:58,233
Did he just stab you?!

1017
01:11:58,406 --> 01:11:59,420
I'm okay.

1018
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:04,043
Forget about that bastard!

1019
01:12:04,372 --> 01:12:06,667
I can't just leave him to die.

1020
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,348
If we don't chop this thing's head off soon,

1021
01:12:10,395 --> 01:12:11,835
the others won't make it!

1022
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:12,763
I hear you.

1023
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:14,067
Let's hurry then.

1024
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:32,285
Inosuke...

1025
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:34,250
let's combine our strength.

1026
01:12:34,503 --> 01:12:36,405
Once we've synchronized our breathing,

1027
01:12:36,684 --> 01:12:38,079
we'll attack as one!

1028
01:13:13,658 --> 01:13:16,260
<i>Damn it. If we fall asleep now...</i>

1029
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:17,793
Not today!

1030
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:20,092
Come on! Follow the leader!

1031
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:21,725
Beast Breathing.

1032
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:23,252
Fourth Form...

1033
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,961
Slice 'n' Dice!

1034
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:34,367
<i>Father, please guide my blade.</i>

1035
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:39,571
<i>My chance to sever the bone with one strike... is now!</i>

1036
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:41,824
<i>Hinokami Kagura!</i>

1037
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:45,420
<i>Clear Blue Sky!</i>

1038
01:14:06,534 --> 01:14:07,374
Careful!

1039
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:10,284
The train feels like it's about to tip over!

1040
01:14:10,637 --> 01:14:11,652
Are you all right?

1041
01:14:12,034 --> 01:14:14,835
Am I all right? You're the one still bleeding!

1042
01:14:14,961 --> 01:14:15,903
It's fine.

1043
01:14:16,336 --> 01:14:18,725
Inosuke, protect the passen...

1044
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,047
<i>I can't die.</i>

1045
01:14:22,755 --> 01:14:25,617
<i>I don't want him to live with
his hands stained with blood.</i>

1046
01:14:26,555 --> 01:14:27,952
<i>I have to live.</i>

1047
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:32,715
<i>I won't let anyone die!</i>

1048
01:14:58,654 --> 01:15:02,106
Santaro! Are you all right?

1049
01:15:04,488 --> 01:15:05,969
Pull yourself together.

1050
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:08,882
You see me bounce off that demon's flesh just now?

1051
01:15:08,989 --> 01:15:10,480
Wait! What am I saying?!

1052
01:15:11,233 --> 01:15:12,652
You got stabbed, right?

1053
01:15:13,072 --> 01:15:14,553
How's your stomach?

1054
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:17,588
I'm... I'm all right.

1055
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,702
What about you?

1056
01:15:20,064 --> 01:15:21,721
I've never felt better.

1057
01:15:21,894 --> 01:15:23,129
Not a scratch on me.

1058
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:24,788
I don't...

1059
01:15:24,974 --> 01:15:26,442
think I can move now.

1060
01:15:28,103 --> 01:15:30,259
Can you go help the others?

1061
01:15:32,014 --> 01:15:33,628
See if anyone's hurt.

1062
01:15:35,287 --> 01:15:36,810
That engineer...

1063
01:15:37,269 --> 01:15:38,567
is he all right?

1064
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,098
Let him die for all I care!

1065
01:15:44,045 --> 01:15:44,945
We can't.

1066
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,075
Did you somehow forget he's the one
who stabbed you in the first place?!

1067
01:15:50,305 --> 01:15:51,976
But if you really wanna know,

1068
01:15:52,054 --> 01:15:54,771
his leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore.

1069
01:15:54,877 --> 01:15:56,017
Just let him rot!

1070
01:15:56,531 --> 01:15:57,266
Then he's...

1071
01:15:57,478 --> 01:15:59,647
already suffered enough, don't you think?

1072
01:16:00,642 --> 01:16:01,933
Help him, Inosuke.

1073
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:05,706
For me.

1074
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:12,669
Fine!

1075
01:16:13,081 --> 01:16:14,537
But only 'cause you asked.

1076
01:16:14,758 --> 01:16:16,202
You are my underling.

1077
01:16:16,422 --> 01:16:18,664
It's the least I can do as a leader!

1078
01:16:18,984 --> 01:16:20,468
And after I've rescued him,

1079
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:22,851
I'm gonna pluck out all of his hair!

1080
01:16:23,986 --> 01:16:26,984
You really don't have to do that last part.

1081
01:16:31,594 --> 01:16:33,044
<i>It's almost dawn.</i>

1082
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:37,126
<i>Take control of your breathing.</i>

1083
01:16:38,262 --> 01:16:39,609
<i>Focus your thoughts...</i>

1084
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:42,992
<i>to save the injured on this train.</i>

1085
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,558
<i>Think of Nezuko...</i>

1086
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:49,952
<i>Zenitsu, Mr. Rengoku.</i>

1087
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:53,247
<i>I'm sure the three of them are safe.</i>

1088
01:16:53,628 --> 01:16:55,133
<i>You just have to believe.</i>

1089
01:17:02,153 --> 01:17:04,126
<i>I can't regenerate.</i>

1090
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:06,093
<i>Have I lost?</i>

1091
01:17:07,432 --> 01:17:09,185
<i>Am I going to die?</i>

1092
01:17:10,362 --> 01:17:11,176
<i>Me?</i>

1093
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:14,515
<i>Ridiculous. Absurd!</i>

1094
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,216
<i>There was so much more to do!</i>

1095
01:17:17,662 --> 01:17:20,156
<i>I couldn't devour a single human.</i>

1096
01:17:20,462 --> 01:17:25,665
<i>My plan to fuse with the train and
eat everyone was a complete failure!</i>

1097
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:28,739
<i>And now look at what I've been reduced to.</i>

1098
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:32,174
<i>After all the preparations I had taken...</i>

1099
01:17:33,205 --> 01:17:34,513
<i>It was him!</i>

1100
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:36,468
<i>This is his fault!</i>

1101
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:40,557
<i>Even with all the human hostages I had in my possession,</i>

1102
01:17:40,596 --> 01:17:43,555
<i>I still wasn't able to get the upper hand.</i>

1103
01:17:44,455 --> 01:17:46,830
<i>Is this the power of a Hashira?</i>

1104
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:49,824
<i>That sun-colored boy was fast, too,</i>

1105
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:53,238
<i>while still under the effects of my spell.</i>

1106
01:17:53,749 --> 01:17:55,204
<i>And then there's her,</i>

1107
01:17:55,517 --> 01:17:58,598
<i>a demon fighting alongside the Demon Slayers?</i>

1108
01:17:58,894 --> 01:18:00,552
<i>What treachery is this?</i>

1109
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:03,926
<i>Why does Master Muzan allow her to live?</i>

1110
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:06,075
<i>Damn it.</i>

1111
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:07,863
<i>Damn it all.</i>

1112
01:18:08,256 --> 01:18:14,355
<i>It all started going to hell when that
little brat was able to wriggle out of my spell.</i>

1113
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:16,731
<i>He's to blame for this!</i>

1114
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:21,031
<i>If I had the strength... I would kill him right now.</i>

1115
01:18:21,555 --> 01:18:23,833
<i>And that beastly boar child,</i>

1116
01:18:23,984 --> 01:18:27,307
<i>I should have killed him when I had the chance, too.</i>

1117
01:18:27,683 --> 01:18:31,698
<i>But I was never able to catch
his gaze and put him back to sleep.</i>

1118
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:34,309
<i>His instincts were too strong.</i>

1119
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:37,594
<i>Have I truly lost?</i>

1120
01:18:37,826 --> 01:18:39,241
<i>Is this the end?</i>

1121
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:45,118
<i>What a terrible, wretched nightmare this is.</i>

1122
01:18:46,331 --> 01:18:50,508
<i>Am I no different from those other
lesser demons who are killed off?</i>

1123
01:18:51,255 --> 01:18:55,991
<i>The Upper Ranks of our kind have
stayed the same for hundreds of years.</i>

1124
01:18:56,358 --> 01:19:00,721
<i>Even Hashira with high body
counts have fallen by their hands.</i>

1125
01:19:01,387 --> 01:19:04,108
<i>Do they have otherworldly powers?</i>

1126
01:19:04,968 --> 01:19:07,507
<i>Even after receiving so much of his blood,</i>

1127
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:09,478
<i>I couldn't compete with them.</i>

1128
01:19:10,451 --> 01:19:12,799
<i>It's not fair.</i>

1129
01:19:12,837 --> 01:19:15,394
<i>If only I could turn back time.</i>

1130
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:20,646
<i>Then I could undo this awful, horrible nightmare.</i>

1131
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:30,812
You've mastered Total Concentration, Constant.

1132
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,769
That's quite impressive.

1133
01:19:33,962 --> 01:19:35,428
Mr. Rengoku.

1134
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:38,467
You're one step closer to being a Hashira.

1135
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:41,864
That's one step out of ten thousand, mind you!

1136
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:44,927
I'll do my best.

1137
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:47,678
You're bleeding from the gut.

1138
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:49,794
Regulate your breathing.

1139
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:51,314
Take full control of it.

1140
01:19:51,895 --> 01:19:54,969
Picture your nerves reaching all though your body.

1141
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:56,939
Can you see it?

1142
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:59,101
The torn blood vessel?

1143
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:04,628
Concentrate harder.

1144
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:16,963
That's it.

1145
01:20:17,498 --> 01:20:19,220
Now stop the bleeding.

1146
01:20:25,226 --> 01:20:26,126
Focus.

1147
01:20:35,866 --> 01:20:37,967
Good! You succeeded.

1148
01:20:38,607 --> 01:20:42,086
Mastering your breathing, it will open many doors for you.

1149
01:20:42,892 --> 01:20:46,657
Now, it won't solve everything, but it will help.

1150
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:49,078
You will continue to grow stronger.

1151
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,583
Thank you.

1152
01:20:54,122 --> 01:20:58,486
As for the others, there are many who are
injured, but they're safe for the time being.

1153
01:20:59,602 --> 01:21:01,113
So don't strain yourself.

1154
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:02,700
Make sure to rest up.

1155
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:09,054
Thank you. I will.

1156
01:21:10,251 --> 01:21:10,767
Good.

1157
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,431
<i>Those eyes. He's Upper Three.</i>

1158
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,584
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

1159
01:21:56,797 --> 01:21:58,123
<i>Flame Breathing.</i>

1160
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,488
<i>Second Form...</i>

1161
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,138
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

1162
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,934
That's a fine sword.

1163
01:22:16,858 --> 01:22:21,166
<i>His speed of regeneration and
sheer malice behind his attack.</i>

1164
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:23,436
<i>So this is an Upper Rank.</i>

1165
01:22:24,096 --> 01:22:27,111
Why would you go after a wounded person first over me?

1166
01:22:28,828 --> 01:22:32,600
I thought that he'd get in the
way of our little chitchat is all.

1167
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,303
What is it you would like to discuss?

1168
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:37,849
While this is our first time meeting,

1169
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:39,669
I already dislike you.

1170
01:22:40,356 --> 01:22:41,538
Is that right?

1171
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:44,574
Well, I dislike weak human beings.

1172
01:22:44,813 --> 01:22:47,200
The mere sight of them makes my skin crawl.

1173
01:22:48,073 --> 01:22:51,903
If that is the case, I do not
believe we will ever get along.

1174
01:22:53,429 --> 01:22:55,886
Be that as it may, let me make you an offer.

1175
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:58,956
Why don't you become a demon as well?

1176
01:22:59,216 --> 01:23:00,444
No, thanks.

1177
01:23:00,989 --> 01:23:04,113
I can tell just by looking at you that you're strong.

1178
01:23:04,287 --> 01:23:05,928
A Hashira, huh?

1179
01:23:06,351 --> 01:23:09,760
Your fighting spirit has been tempered like quality steel.

1180
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:11,173
Your name?

1181
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:15,161
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1182
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:17,574
I am Akaza.

1183
01:23:18,262 --> 01:23:24,407
Kyojuro, let me tell you why, despite
being a Hashira, your strength is not enough.

1184
01:23:24,887 --> 01:23:26,802
Because you're merely human,

1185
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:29,882
destined to grow old and eventually die.

1186
01:23:31,467 --> 01:23:33,714
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1187
01:23:34,689 --> 01:23:40,597
Doing so would allow you to better
yourself for another hundred, even 200 years.

1188
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:44,685
<i>Of all the demons I've met so far,</i>

1189
01:23:44,904 --> 01:23:47,266
<i>he smells the most like Kibutsuji!</i>

1190
01:23:47,946 --> 01:23:49,535
<i>I have to help fight him!</i>

1191
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:53,397
Both growing old and passing way,

1192
01:23:53,782 --> 01:23:56,532
these are things that make being human beautiful.

1193
01:23:57,473 --> 01:23:59,739
Those may seem like weaknesses to you,

1194
01:24:00,425 --> 01:24:03,962
but our lives are all the more
precious and honorable because of them.

1195
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:07,511
You see, true strength

1196
01:24:07,536 --> 01:24:09,878
does not just refer to the physical body.

1197
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:16,016
This boy is not weak.

1198
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:19,300
Don't insult him.

1199
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:21,192
Let me be clear.

1200
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,487
The two of us will never see eye to eye.

1201
01:24:25,531 --> 01:24:29,265
No matter what twisted reasons you give, I will not yield.

1202
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:35,234
I see.

1203
01:24:38,246 --> 01:24:40,044
Technique Development.

1204
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:43,016
Destructive Death, Compass Needle.

1205
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,096
I guess I'll just have to kill you then.

1206
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:17,566
<i>I can't keep track of either of them!</i>

1207
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:22,572
In all my years, I've never
gotten to kill a Flame Hashira!

1208
01:25:22,837 --> 01:25:25,773
No one has yet to take me up on my offer, either.

1209
01:25:30,177 --> 01:25:31,919
Why do you think that is?

1210
01:25:31,944 --> 01:25:36,274
As a fellow master of the martial
arts, I just can't comprehend it.

1211
01:25:36,767 --> 01:25:40,075
Not when only the chosen ones can become demons!

1212
01:25:45,201 --> 01:25:49,366
Watching the hideous decline of
someone blessed with your powers,

1213
01:25:49,792 --> 01:25:52,562
it pains me more than you know!

1214
01:25:52,755 --> 01:25:56,888
While you're still young and
strong... your life should be cut short.

1215
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:00,807
Destructive Death...

1216
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:02,786
Air Type!

1217
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:17,686
<i>In that case...</i>

1218
01:26:19,923 --> 01:26:21,347
Flame Breathing technique.

1219
01:26:21,881 --> 01:26:22,836
Fourth Form,

1220
01:26:23,316 --> 01:26:25,100
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1221
01:26:27,347 --> 01:26:30,778
<i>If he strikes the air, the attack will still reach me.</i>

1222
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:35,819
<i>The strikes travel instantly.</i>

1223
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:46,341
<i>I can't slice his head off if I continue
fighting him at a distance like this.</i>

1224
01:26:47,116 --> 01:26:48,047
<i>Very well.</i>

1225
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,149
<i>Close combat, it is!</i>

1226
01:26:55,862 --> 01:26:58,517
Those reflexes! Brilliant!

1227
01:27:01,351 --> 01:27:05,031
Those breathtaking sword skills will be lost, too!

1228
01:27:05,056 --> 01:27:07,598
Doesn't that thought make you sad, Kyojuro?

1229
01:27:07,905 --> 01:27:10,704
They are simply aspects of being a human being!

1230
01:27:10,729 --> 01:27:11,757
Why would it?

1231
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:14,328
Stay there!

1232
01:27:14,721 --> 01:27:16,982
We can't reopen that wound of yours!

1233
01:27:17,007 --> 01:27:18,369
It'll kill you!

1234
01:27:19,494 --> 01:27:21,663
Don't bother with that weakling!

1235
01:27:22,212 --> 01:27:23,883
Show me your strength!

1236
01:27:26,961 --> 01:27:28,842
Keep your eyes on me.

1237
01:27:40,795 --> 01:27:43,047
Such skilled movement.

1238
01:27:48,661 --> 01:27:49,721
Rengoku!

1239
01:27:49,838 --> 01:27:51,416
Watch out, Bug Eyes!

1240
01:27:54,838 --> 01:27:57,506
You sure you won't turn into a demon?

1241
01:28:00,895 --> 01:28:05,559
Think of it this way. If you did, we
could spar with each other endlessly.

1242
01:28:09,536 --> 01:28:12,086
Imagine how much stronger we'd become!

1243
01:28:13,992 --> 01:28:14,865
Never.

1244
01:28:15,604 --> 01:28:17,400
Let me make this clear.

1245
01:28:17,846 --> 01:28:19,503
I do not like you.

1246
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,402
I will not become a demon!

1247
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,746
<i>Flame Breathing.</i>

1248
01:28:28,151 --> 01:28:29,541
Third Form!

1249
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:31,877
Blazing Universe!

1250
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:37,024
What a magnificent attack!

1251
01:28:38,337 --> 01:28:40,914
Destructive Death, Air Type!

1252
01:28:49,544 --> 01:28:51,286
<i>I wanna join the fight,</i>

1253
01:28:51,311 --> 01:28:54,916
<i>but they're moving so fast, I can't find an opening!</i>

1254
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:57,610
<i>These two are on a whole other level!</i>

1255
01:28:58,104 --> 01:29:01,694
<i>Getting between them would get me killed for sure.</i>

1256
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:04,736
<i>Even if I did find an opportunity,</i>

1257
01:29:04,828 --> 01:29:07,417
<i>I know I'd only end up slowing him down.</i>

1258
01:29:10,799 --> 01:29:12,281
Mr. Rengoku...

1259
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:18,789
This struggle is futile!

1260
01:29:19,076 --> 01:29:23,086
Continuing this meaningless assault
will only result in one outcome,

1261
01:29:23,172 --> 01:29:24,047
your death!

1262
01:29:33,858 --> 01:29:36,751
<i>Flame Breathing. First Form, Unknowing Fire!</i>

1263
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:41,314
Killing you now would be a waste.

1264
01:29:41,595 --> 01:29:43,784
You haven't reached your peak yet.

1265
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:51,219
Second Form...

1266
01:29:52,232 --> 01:29:53,912
Rising Scorching Sun!

1267
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:57,733
In just a few short years, your abilities

1268
01:29:57,765 --> 01:30:00,688
would be sharpened to an even finer point.

1269
01:30:12,844 --> 01:30:15,446
Third Form, Blazing Universe!

1270
01:30:17,148 --> 01:30:20,299
Fourth Form, Blooming Flame Undulation!

1271
01:30:22,331 --> 01:30:24,203
Destructive Death...

1272
01:30:25,576 --> 01:30:28,993
Fifth Form, Flame Tiger!

1273
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,621
Disorder!

1274
01:30:37,664 --> 01:30:39,724
Come at me!

1275
01:30:55,102 --> 01:30:55,755
Wait.

1276
01:30:56,205 --> 01:30:58,801
Is that it? Did he win?!

1277
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:28,292
<i>No way.</i>

1278
01:31:35,278 --> 01:31:36,279
<i>It can't be.</i>

1279
01:31:44,231 --> 01:31:45,994
Don't tell me it's over.

1280
01:31:47,486 --> 01:31:49,374
I won't have you die on me.

1281
01:32:06,007 --> 01:32:07,293
<i>Mr. Rengoku.</i>

1282
01:32:08,123 --> 01:32:09,166
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1283
01:32:12,087 --> 01:32:13,116
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1284
01:32:18,384 --> 01:32:24,159
Don't you see that fighting to death in that
frail human body will never measure up to mine?

1285
01:32:25,849 --> 01:32:29,206
Those impressive attacks that you inflicted upon me

1286
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:31,651
have already healed completely.

1287
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,152
You, on the other hand...

1288
01:32:34,571 --> 01:32:41,412
a smashed left eye, shattered ribs, damage
to the internal organs... all irreparable.

1289
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:44,662
If you were a demon, you'd heal in the blink of an eye,

1290
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:48,006
and those wounds would be but mere scratches.

1291
01:32:48,869 --> 01:32:52,529
In the end, a human can never surpass a demon.

1292
01:32:55,297 --> 01:32:56,841
<i>I want to go help him.</i>

1293
01:33:00,111 --> 01:33:02,275
<i>But I don't have the strength to move.</i>

1294
01:33:02,888 --> 01:33:07,627
<i>This injury and using Hinokami
Kagura have taken their toll.</i>

1295
01:33:21,216 --> 01:33:23,378
So this is how it is, then.

1296
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,131
I...

1297
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:30,325
I will see my duty fulfilled!

1298
01:33:30,845 --> 01:33:34,215
No matter what it takes, no one shall die here!

1299
01:33:35,645 --> 01:33:38,591
<i>I'll inflict as much damage as quickly as possible.</i>

1300
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:40,655
<i>Flame Breathing.</i>

1301
01:33:40,943 --> 01:33:42,248
<i>Esoteric Art!</i>

1302
01:33:48,436 --> 01:33:50,629
What an impressive fighting spirit.

1303
01:33:50,776 --> 01:33:53,499
To press on, despite your bodily injuries!

1304
01:33:53,686 --> 01:33:55,559
That brilliant strength of mind!

1305
01:33:55,899 --> 01:33:57,899
And that ironclad stance!

1306
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:03,204
Now you have to become a demon!

1307
01:34:03,409 --> 01:34:04,838
Just imagine it!

1308
01:34:04,998 --> 01:34:08,219
We'd be able to fight each other for the rest of eternity!

1309
01:34:08,245 --> 01:34:09,808
<i>Set your heart ablaze.</i>

1310
01:34:10,206 --> 01:34:12,208
<i>Overcome your limits.</i>

1311
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:15,638
I am the Flame Hashira,

1312
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:17,742
Kyojuro Rengoku!

1313
01:34:18,382 --> 01:34:21,860
Ninth Form, Rengoku!

1314
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:25,265
Destructive Death, Annihilation Type!

1315
01:34:42,246 --> 01:34:43,720
Rengoku!

1316
01:35:16,732 --> 01:35:17,875
<i>Mr. Rengoku.</i>

1317
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:24,298
<i>Where is he?</i>

1318
01:35:27,325 --> 01:35:27,845
<i>There.</i>

1319
01:35:28,725 --> 01:35:30,731
Did he win?

1320
01:35:41,954 --> 01:35:45,280
Kyojuro, you must know this wound will kill you!

1321
01:35:45,613 --> 01:35:46,624
Save yourself.

1322
01:35:46,703 --> 01:35:48,569
Say that you'll become a demon!

1323
01:35:49,089 --> 01:35:50,340
Can't you see?!

1324
01:35:50,725 --> 01:35:53,368
Your strength makes you truly special!

1325
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:07,484
Kyojuro.

1326
01:36:07,857 --> 01:36:09,159
Yes, what is it, Mother?

1327
01:36:10,506 --> 01:36:12,078
I want to ask you something,

1328
01:36:12,825 --> 01:36:14,733
and I want you to answer honestly.

1329
01:36:15,793 --> 01:36:17,207
Do you know why it is

1330
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:20,470
you were born with greater strength than so many others?

1331
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:23,424
Uh...

1332
01:36:25,172 --> 01:36:26,319
no, ma'am, I don't.

1333
01:36:27,139 --> 01:36:29,372
It is so that you can protect the weak.

1334
01:36:31,345 --> 01:36:35,149
Those who are born blessed with
more bountiful gifts than others

1335
01:36:35,683 --> 01:36:39,007
are obligated to use those
gifts for the sake of the world,

1336
01:36:39,273 --> 01:36:41,958
for all of our fellow brothers and sisters.

1337
01:36:43,325 --> 01:36:50,481
You must never use that God-given strength to
bring harm to mankind or for your own selfish desires.

1338
01:36:52,078 --> 01:36:54,411
It is the duty of those born strong

1339
01:36:54,782 --> 01:36:57,163
to help those who may be less fortunate,

1340
01:36:57,943 --> 01:37:01,982
a responsibility you must carry onward with due purpose.

1341
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:06,102
Be sure you never forget that.

1342
01:37:06,928 --> 01:37:07,662
I won't!

1343
01:37:15,043 --> 01:37:15,524
Uh...

1344
01:37:25,059 --> 01:37:25,939
Kyojuro...

1345
01:37:26,859 --> 01:37:28,617
I don't have much time left.

1346
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:32,368
Having such a strong, gentle child...

1347
01:37:32,775 --> 01:37:34,062
was a true blessing.

1348
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:37,884
I believe in you.

1349
01:37:51,737 --> 01:37:52,444
<i>Mother...</i>

1350
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:56,986
<i>it was I who was blessed to have
been born to such a woman as you.</i>

1351
01:38:06,438 --> 01:38:07,631
<i>He stopped it?</i>

1352
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:09,683
<i>What unbelievable strength!</i>

1353
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:12,949
<i>And even after I've skewered his body with my arm!</i>

1354
01:38:15,109 --> 01:38:17,582
<i>Damn it. The sun will rise soon.</i>

1355
01:38:19,048 --> 01:38:21,177
<i>I have to kill him and make my escape!</i>

1356
01:38:22,955 --> 01:38:25,039
<i>Why can't I pull my arm out?</i>

1357
01:38:27,581 --> 01:38:29,185
<i>I won't let you escape.</i>

1358
01:38:36,579 --> 01:38:39,888
<i>I know Mr. Rengoku ordered me to stay back,</i>

1359
01:38:41,661 --> 01:38:43,847
<i>but I just can't any longer!</i>

1360
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,817
<i>This is my only chance.</i>

1361
01:38:46,896 --> 01:38:49,730
<i>I have to slice that demon's head off, and fast!</i>

1362
01:38:52,478 --> 01:38:53,971
<i>The sun is rising.</i>

1363
01:38:54,571 --> 01:38:56,459
<i>I have to get away!</i>

1364
01:38:57,483 --> 01:38:58,663
<i>Let go of me.</i>

1365
01:38:58,698 --> 01:39:00,529
<i>Let go of me!</i>

1366
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,759
<i>I won't let go!</i>

1367
01:39:12,033 --> 01:39:15,029
<i>Not 'til I remove your head from your shoulders!</i>

1368
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,481
Let go!

1369
01:39:24,681 --> 01:39:26,257
Inosuke, move!

1370
01:39:26,464 --> 01:39:27,145
Huh?

1371
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,102
If we don't help him now, it'll be too late!

1372
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:35,121
Beast Breathing!

1373
01:39:35,414 --> 01:39:36,651
Fang One...

1374
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:38,531
Pierce!

1375
01:39:56,147 --> 01:39:59,134
<i>I've got to find sanctuary from the sunlight.</i>

1376
01:40:10,268 --> 01:40:11,710
<i>That took too long.</i>

1377
01:40:11,933 --> 01:40:13,694
<i>I've got to get away from the sun!</i>

1378
01:40:20,922 --> 01:40:22,735
Don't run away!

1379
01:40:23,335 --> 01:40:25,328
I'm not done with you, coward!

1380
01:40:25,367 --> 01:40:27,017
Turn and face me!

1381
01:40:29,677 --> 01:40:32,404
<i>What the hell are you babbling about, kid?</i>

1382
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:35,734
<i>Don't you have a brain inside that head of yours?</i>

1383
01:40:36,168 --> 01:40:38,162
<i>I'm not running away from you.</i>

1384
01:40:38,382 --> 01:40:40,362
<i>I'm running from the sun!</i>

1385
01:40:40,661 --> 01:40:43,920
<i>And besides, this battle's already been decided!</i>

1386
01:40:44,207 --> 01:40:47,408
<i>With a wound like that, he'll die before long.</i>

1387
01:40:50,153 --> 01:40:54,802
Don't forget that the Demon Slayer Corps is
always fighting you demons in the dead of night,

1388
01:40:54,855 --> 01:40:56,630
where you have the advantage!

1389
01:40:56,655 --> 01:40:58,397
We're not like you at all!

1390
01:40:58,842 --> 01:41:00,609
We don't regenerate as fast,

1391
01:41:01,108 --> 01:41:03,904
and when we lose a limb, it's gone for good!

1392
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:07,109
Don't run away, you bastard!

1393
01:41:07,183 --> 01:41:09,804
You're a coward, a coward!

1394
01:41:10,624 --> 01:41:14,098
Mr. Rengoku is stronger than you'll ever hope to be!

1395
01:41:15,055 --> 01:41:16,275
Much stronger!

1396
01:41:16,715 --> 01:41:18,442
You didn't win against him!

1397
01:41:18,879 --> 01:41:20,967
He kept everyone safe!

1398
01:41:21,106 --> 01:41:24,411
He fought to the very end so no one would die!

1399
01:41:24,498 --> 01:41:26,161
You're the one who lost!

1400
01:41:26,541 --> 01:41:30,248
Rengoku is the true victor!

1401
01:42:05,207 --> 01:42:06,789
Don't work yourself up like that.

1402
01:42:13,287 --> 01:42:14,787
You would reopen your wound...

1403
01:42:15,938 --> 01:42:17,500
and that would be very bad.

1404
01:42:19,012 --> 01:42:21,009
You dying, my young Kamado,

1405
01:42:21,838 --> 01:42:23,417
would truly spell my defeat.

1406
01:42:25,879 --> 01:42:27,039
Mr. Rengoku.

1407
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:29,567
Come here, lad.

1408
01:42:30,459 --> 01:42:32,392
Let us speak one last time.

1409
01:42:50,814 --> 01:42:52,740
When I was dreaming of the past...

1410
01:42:54,448 --> 01:42:56,155
there was something I remembered.

1411
01:42:57,794 --> 01:42:59,185
My old residence...

1412
01:43:00,136 --> 01:43:01,838
you should go pay it a visit.

1413
01:43:03,849 --> 01:43:06,924
There are notes left by the previous Flame Hashira there.

1414
01:43:09,048 --> 01:43:11,852
I recall my father used to read them often,

1415
01:43:12,338 --> 01:43:15,237
but I'm afraid I don't know their contents myself.

1416
01:43:17,534 --> 01:43:19,156
Within those notes...

1417
01:43:19,916 --> 01:43:22,113
you may find the dance you mentioned,

1418
01:43:23,472 --> 01:43:25,239
the Hinokami Kagura.

1419
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:29,138
Please! Mr. Rengoku...

1420
01:43:29,418 --> 01:43:30,440
enough of that.

1421
01:43:30,817 --> 01:43:32,577
Just think about yourself now.

1422
01:43:33,231 --> 01:43:35,507
Can you heal up with a breathing technique?

1423
01:43:36,021 --> 01:43:36,729
No.

1424
01:43:37,272 --> 01:43:39,399
Very soon, I'll be dead.

1425
01:43:42,045 --> 01:43:43,462
Before that happens,

1426
01:43:43,904 --> 01:43:45,742
I need you to hear me out.

1427
01:43:47,198 --> 01:43:49,519
I have a younger brother named Senjuro.

1428
01:43:50,704 --> 01:43:52,778
Please tell him to follow his heart

1429
01:43:53,709 --> 01:43:56,101
and walk down the path he feels is right.

1430
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,000
And tell my father...

1431
01:44:02,191 --> 01:44:04,237
that I want him to look after himself.

1432
01:44:07,269 --> 01:44:08,295
And lastly...

1433
01:44:08,991 --> 01:44:10,289
about your sister...

1434
01:44:12,605 --> 01:44:14,684
know that I believe in her.

1435
01:44:16,139 --> 01:44:18,523
I accept her as part of our ranks.

1436
01:44:21,115 --> 01:44:25,864
Your sister shed blood to protect the
people inside that train from demons.

1437
01:44:27,273 --> 01:44:28,944
And anyone who does that,

1438
01:44:29,231 --> 01:44:34,430
regardless of what is said to the contrary,
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1439
01:44:36,245 --> 01:44:37,936
So hold your head high.

1440
01:44:43,423 --> 01:44:45,353
If you are feeling disheartened,

1441
01:44:45,975 --> 01:44:47,944
that you are somehow not enough...

1442
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:51,785
set your heart ablaze.

1443
01:44:55,044 --> 01:44:57,117
Dry your eyes, and look ahead.

1444
01:44:58,769 --> 01:45:01,004
You may feel like digging your heels in,

1445
01:45:01,891 --> 01:45:04,288
but the flow of time waits for no one.

1446
01:45:05,287 --> 01:45:08,300
It won't patiently stand by as you grieve.

1447
01:45:10,506 --> 01:45:12,654
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die.

1448
01:45:13,727 --> 01:45:17,602
As a Hashira, it's natural I'd protect you all.

1449
01:45:19,181 --> 01:45:21,880
The young buds must be allowed to bloom.

1450
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:25,730
Any other Hashira would have done the same as I.

1451
01:45:27,249 --> 01:45:28,301
Young Kamado...

1452
01:45:30,198 --> 01:45:31,099
Young Boar...

1453
01:45:32,714 --> 01:45:33,874
Boy of Yellow...

1454
01:45:35,692 --> 01:45:37,538
you must continue to grow.

1455
01:45:38,603 --> 01:45:43,562
And eventually you will lend your
aid by becoming the next Hashira.

1456
01:45:45,429 --> 01:45:46,597
I believe...

1457
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:50,612
in each and every one of you.

1458
01:46:17,012 --> 01:46:17,823
<i>Mother.</i>

1459
01:46:22,171 --> 01:46:23,195
<i>Did I do well?</i>

1460
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:30,211
<i>The responsibility I-I took upon myself to fulfill...</i>

1461
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,187
<i>was I successful?</i>

1462
01:46:41,943 --> 01:46:44,228
<i>I'm so proud of you, my son.</i>

1463
01:47:20,749 --> 01:47:22,636
When the train went off the rails,

1464
01:47:23,049 --> 01:47:25,648
Mr. Rengoku used a bunch of his techniques.

1465
01:47:26,962 --> 01:47:30,897
That must be how we somehow
avoided suffering any casualties.

1466
01:47:33,142 --> 01:47:34,166
It must be.

1467
01:47:36,412 --> 01:47:38,105
I can't believe he's gone.

1468
01:47:38,942 --> 01:47:41,170
Was it really an Upper Rank demon?

1469
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:42,541
Yeah.

1470
01:47:43,829 --> 01:47:46,053
Why would something like that come here,

1471
01:47:46,755 --> 01:47:49,348
something that strong? I don't get it.

1472
01:47:53,756 --> 01:47:55,130
I'm so frustrated.

1473
01:47:57,393 --> 01:47:59,689
Soon as I manage to break through one wall...

1474
01:48:01,143 --> 01:48:05,113
it feels like I just hit an even higher, thicker wall.

1475
01:48:07,422 --> 01:48:11,781
And all the while, I can hear the sounds
of my heroes fighting just beyond it...

1476
01:48:13,008 --> 01:48:15,311
but I can't make it over to join them!

1477
01:48:16,904 --> 01:48:19,648
If I'm still here fumbling around in the dark...

1478
01:48:21,362 --> 01:48:22,589
how can I ever...

1479
01:48:25,558 --> 01:48:29,504
Is becoming someone like him even possible for me?

1480
01:48:40,168 --> 01:48:42,567
Stop blubbering like a little baby!

1481
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:48,391
This "can I or can't I" talk is really pissing me off!

1482
01:48:48,864 --> 01:48:51,062
He already said he believes in you,

1483
01:48:51,222 --> 01:48:53,979
so you just have to worry about how to get there!

1484
01:48:54,293 --> 01:48:57,685
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1485
01:48:58,112 --> 01:49:00,991
Feeling sorry for yourself isn't gonna change that!

1486
01:49:01,244 --> 01:49:03,604
Remember what Bug Eyes said to you!

1487
01:49:04,024 --> 01:49:09,744
No matter how pathetic or humiliated
you feel, you just gotta keep on living!

1488
01:49:10,144 --> 01:49:11,794
But you're crying, too.

1489
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,586
I can see all the tears coming
out of that headpiece of yours.

1490
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:18,157
I am not crying!

1491
01:49:28,965 --> 01:49:32,173
Come on! Let's go train our asses off!

1492
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:16,964
Is that right?

1493
01:50:17,232 --> 01:50:19,105
Mr. Rengoku has...

1494
01:50:39,767 --> 01:50:41,567
An Upper Rank demon...

1495
01:50:41,904 --> 01:50:43,938
even Rengoku couldn't kill it.

1496
01:50:49,418 --> 01:50:51,196
I won't believe it.

1497
01:50:58,227 --> 01:51:00,007
<i>Namu Amida Butsu.</i>

1498
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,844
Those repulsive demons...

1499
01:51:09,091 --> 01:51:11,003
I'll exterminate them all.

1500
01:51:19,155 --> 01:51:20,712
Is that so?

1501
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:34,728
Not even a single one of those
200 passengers lost their lives?

1502
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:38,063
He did a splendid job indeed.

1503
01:51:38,246 --> 01:51:39,650
A remarkable child.

1504
01:51:41,503 --> 01:51:43,239
I feel no sadness.

1505
01:51:43,885 --> 01:51:46,573
My life will soon reach its end as well.

1506
01:51:49,745 --> 01:51:54,310
And then I'll be able to see Kyojuro and the others again

1507
01:51:54,664 --> 01:51:55,999
in the world after.

1508
01:52:07,963 --> 01:52:09,291
Mr. Rengoku.

1509
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,299
Rengoku.

1510
01:52:15,316 --> 01:52:16,782
Rengoku!
