1
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:39,461
My name is Isabella York,

2
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,731
and this is my prison.

3
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:51,717
Here there are only sheltered girls who are well off

4
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,028
as well as their handmaids and teachers.

5
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:57,660
It's a girls' school separated
from the world by high walls.

6
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:01,187
All the students are from respectable families,

7
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,730
or will be marrying into one.

8
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,218
I am, no doubt, the latter.

9
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,626
She is free to go anywhere.

10
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,715
But not me.

11
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,570
May I introduce myself?

12
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:30,256
If it is your wish, I will travel
anywhere to meet your request.

13
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:32,855
Auto Memories Doll at your service.

14
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,309
Violet Evergarden.

15
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,060
What's a Doll doing here?

16
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,796
I was sent here by your family.

17
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:54,067
They instructed me to help you
achieve success as a debutante.

18
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,103
A debutante?

19
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,493
In only three months?

20
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:04,293
Yes. I'm to be your tutor in culture, conversation,

21
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:08,987
etiquette, and dance. Everything
that is befitting of a lady.

22
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,451
I will be serving in that capacity until your debut.

23
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:15,652
Dolls do that kind of work, too?

24
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:19,386
No. We normally just write letters for our clients.

25
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:23,933
If it wasn't for the royal Drossel
family's introduction, I would've declined.

26
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:27,944
Hmph. It sounds like you're a snob.

27
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:31,543
And people like that are the worst.

28
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:36,969
I heard you're prone to coughing fits.

29
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,381
Don't touch me!

30
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:50,539
Your hand...

31
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:55,306
It's a prosthetic.

32
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,046
I lost both of them in the war.

33
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,902
A Doll who serves the royal family?

34
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:09,098
No. I'm a civilian Doll. Our
company is in Leidenschaftlich.

35
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:10,672
Leiden...?

36
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,604
That's right. It's the southern-most nation.

37
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,875
It's about four days from here.

38
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:20,150
That is, if you only use local trains
on the trans-continental railroad.

39
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:26,617
So that means... you can go anywhere you want.

40
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:28,729
For a job, yes.

41
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,480
Must be nice.

42
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:35,562
Until I complete my duty,

43
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,120
I will remain with you.

44
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:45,200
I don't wanna be with friends with you. So keep
quiet unless it's absolutely necessary for my education.

45
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,772
You've got that grumpy look again.

46
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,299
Is the matter really that difficult?

47
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,650
Mm-hmm.

48
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,327
It's a request that was made for Violet.

49
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:01,964
They want her to tutor an aristocrat's daughter.

50
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,045
To tutor her?!

51
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,528
Apparently, it's for three months.

52
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,481
Can't say no to the royal family.

53
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,182
But three whole months?

54
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:15,580
Oh, I can go check on her every now and then.

55
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:19,544
It's at a girls' boarding
school, which means no men allowed.

56
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,555
A girls' boarding school, huh?

57
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,466
These public love letters are so dreamy.

58
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,472
I just made this the other day.

59
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:33,559
It's lovely!

60
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,404
Well, if you like it, you can have it.

61
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:38,191
Who is that?

62
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:43,252
Whoa... Who is she?

63
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:45,009
I've never seen her before.

64
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:46,271
Do you know her?

65
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:48,527
No, I've never seen her, either.

66
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:02,327
Good day to you, Miss York.

67
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:05,251
Good day to you, Miss York.

68
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,057
And who do we have here?

69
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,437
Ah... Well, um, she's...

70
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,777
I will be serving as Miss Isabella's handmaid.

71
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,560
My name is Violet. It's a pleasure.

72
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,412
Well, my name is...

73
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:23,892
Miss Lancaster, I presume.

74
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,706
I was already informed of your name.

75
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,518
That was such a perfect curtsy!

76
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:34,194
She looks more like a princess than a handmaid.

77
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,022
Please use the outer most knife.

78
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:13,967
Huh?

79
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,010
I'm sorry, Miss, but why have you stopped working?

80
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:34,448
It's important that you continue on with your lesson.

81
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,578
This is mandatory curriculum.

82
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:37,904
Later.

83
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:42,171
The correct phrase would be, "I wish to continue later."

84
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,896
Taylor?

85
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:10,502
Hmm?

86
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,350
Tee-hee! Sister!

87
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,006
Taylor!

88
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:31,883
Do you know that you've always
been my precious treasure, Taylor?

89
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,852
Miss York, which salon will you be entering?

90
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,321
Huh? Oh...

91
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,683
Well, of course, it will be Miss Lancaster's salon, right?

92
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:14,967
The prime minister's family, the Lancasters, and the
Yorks, the two titans of trade, have ties to the Drossels.

93
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,649
I'm terribly sorry.

94
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,892
Miss Isabella is quite frail, you see.

95
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,587
Before coming here, she had spent much of her life alone.

96
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:32,607
Now, she is trying to acclimate to living with others.

97
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,634
So, in knowing that, would you please allow her more time?

98
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,374
Ah, yes!

99
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:43,062
Oh, wow! She's just like a knight from a romance story!

100
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:53,327
Miss Isabella. I left your side earlier... I apologize.

101
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:56,884
Just being around you...

102
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,570
It really makes me miserable.

103
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,296
Taylor...

104
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:30,915
Good day to you, Miss York.

105
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,775
After this, we'll be holding a
tea party back at the dormitory.

106
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:37,746
If you would like to come...

107
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:38,866
Just go away.

108
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:42,687
Uh... I'm sorry, have I offended you?

109
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,897
My apologies, ma'am.

110
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:49,687
My master has instructed me to
limit her interactions with others.

111
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:52,278
At least until she becomes a debutante.

112
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,703
You truly are a princess knight. Very well.

113
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,388
Let us forget this ever happened.

114
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,628
Good day to you both.

115
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,287
They're only able to see me for who my family is.

116
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,307
It's like I'm trapped in that identity.

117
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:14,013
Is that so?

118
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,602
You're no different, you know.

119
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:20,072
This is simply a duty I must complete.

120
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:23,528
You really are perfect in every sense, aren't you?

121
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:27,150
So much so, you could even pass as royalty.

122
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,645
I'm an orphan.

123
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,996
Huh?

124
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,742
You're really gonna stay here for three months?

125
00:12:58,576 --> 00:12:59,391
Are you?

126
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:06,748
You told me to keep quiet unless it's absolutely necessary
for your education. I'm following your instructions.

127
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:09,530
Forget that right now.

128
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:14,121
Our company has other dolls, so
business will continue as usual.

129
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,606
That's not what I meant.

130
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,920
Is there anyone that you'll miss? From back there?

131
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:24,586
So there is.

132
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:27,651
There is someone, but...

133
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:31,951
Unfortunately, we cannot see each other.

134
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:37,947
Really?

135
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:56,006
I hope you're doing all right, Violet...

136
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,413
Taylor...

137
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,986
I'm sorry, it's me, Violet.

138
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,363
Hmm? Uh!

139
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,254
How are you feeling this morning?

140
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:41,820
Were you up all night?

141
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:45,052
I've undergone endurance training in the past.

142
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,438
So a little missed sleep is...

143
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:52,935
It is not an issue.

144
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:06,577
Listen. Since we're close in age, I wanna talk to you.

145
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,413
You know, like normal.

146
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:17,740
Very well.

147
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:24,256
Although... what do you mean,
precisely, when you say, "like normal"?

148
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:29,961
Um. For example, I, uh... What's wrong?

149
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:31,613
It's time to get ready.

150
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:38,215
You're going to be late for school.

151
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:48,632
At this school, it is customary to learn
the dance as both the male and the female.

152
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:55,071
Miss Isabella, let's begin our lesson
by you learning the woman's part first.

153
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,209
And I will be the man.

154
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:05,768
But I've always been clumsy,
and I might step on your feet.

155
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:11,701
The secret to enhancing your performance is to
relax your body. Just try and follow the lead.

156
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,368
Miss Isabella.

157
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:36,505
Huh...?

158
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:42,578
Violet, why don't you come and join me?

159
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:44,570
No, thank you.

160
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:48,782
Friends are supposed to bathe together, though.

161
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:53,221
Is that really what they do?

162
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,022
Yes, it is, so come on!

163
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:02,374
What do you say? Huh? Get in!

164
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,212
I've never done this before.

165
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,467
Taken a bath with someone.

166
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:34,115
You haven't?

167
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,873
Come here.

168
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,187
Is this also what friends do?

169
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:51,428
I don't know. I slept like this with my little sister.

170
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:54,898
I see.

171
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,370
Wah!

172
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,313
Open wide, Taylor!

173
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,367
So is it good?

174
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:28,983
Sister!

175
00:19:32,776 --> 00:19:33,788
Why don't...

176
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,175
You have the basic steps down nearly perfect.

177
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:31,201
For today, I was thinking we could add some new steps.

178
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:33,648
Mm-hmm.

179
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:37,421
I'm all done.

180
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:39,338
Thank you for doing that.

181
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:42,735
I just noticed something.

182
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:44,771
You always wear your hair the same, huh?

183
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,618
I do.

184
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,041
Miss Isabella?

185
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:51,339
Just relax.

186
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,127
We can't do this. You'll miss the morning lecture.

187
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,406
Don't worry so much.

188
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:03,945
I have a sister. I used to do her hair all the time.

189
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:07,399
Your hair is just like velvet.

190
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,308
Bet it's worth a lot.

191
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:12,446
You're going to sell it?

192
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:16,639
Of course I won't.

193
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:19,205
And done.

194
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:20,873
Like it?

195
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:25,394
It seems like it could block
my line of sight in an emergency.

196
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,642
Oh? But it's so cute.

197
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,208
Okay, then. How about this?

198
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,937
Ta-dah! Just like cinnamon buns.

199
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:35,698
Miss Isabella, it appears you're having fun.

200
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:37,707
That obvious?

201
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:48,570
Hey.

202
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,185
Let's forget about school. Can't we go somewhere else?

203
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,467
Where exactly do you want to go?

204
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,317
Anywhere is fine.

205
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,615
Just the two of us.

206
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,237
We can't do that.

207
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,997
I'm sorry, Miss Isabella.

208
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:26,339
Hmm?

209
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:42,819
Now, why don't we try that again?

210
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,243
Miss Isabella?

211
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:51,262
I can't do it.

212
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,401
I can't be a lady. I never could.

213
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:58,479
You've learned to dance, and now you're going to...

214
00:22:58,562 --> 00:23:00,011
I don't need your flattery!

215
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,865
I'm not able to be a good at everything like you are.

216
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:09,236
I'm not... I'm not like you.

217
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:10,895
Like me?

218
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,351
Yes, that's right! I'm totally different!

219
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:17,069
It's not fair. Not at all.

220
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:20,596
You don't realize how lucky you are.

221
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:26,545
Sorry.

222
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,873
It's okay. It seems you're just a little tired.

223
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:48,363
What sorts of letters have you written?

224
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:54,169
I've written many different kinds before.

225
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,342
Letters from kids writing to parents,

226
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:01,169
from sisters to brothers, and even love letters.

227
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:04,896
Love letters? A strait-laced girl like you?

228
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:07,187
Yes. They were all well-received.

229
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,202
Really?

230
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:11,079
It's more common than you think.

231
00:24:11,562 --> 00:24:14,478
Every one I wrote was filled with all kinds of love.

232
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:21,048
I think people request them because letters
let you express the things you normally can't say.

233
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,799
Hey, I was wondering...

234
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:38,084
I'm always so mean. But you're... still so nice to me.

235
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,039
You really think that I'm nice?

236
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,166
Yes, you are.

237
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:43,899
Thank you.

238
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,927
I guess I'm just doing what I've learned.

239
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,620
Miss Isabella, if you're unable to sleep,

240
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:56,253
I could always tell you about the constellations.

241
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,282
I learned all about them back when
I used to work at an observatory.

242
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:01,457
Mm.

243
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,286
Okay, I'll tell you a story about the stars.

244
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,343
The ones that shine this time of year.

245
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:16,837
What's all this?

246
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:18,594
It's from your father.

247
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,565
You're to wear this when you become a debutante.

248
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:41,490
This one is for you.

249
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,046
Huh? What's that?

250
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,271
It says, "Having fun?"

251
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:53,328
Who's that from?

252
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:56,189
It's a dress that was sent over by my company.

253
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:01,123
And, from the looks of it, it was most
likely delivered to me by one of my coworkers.

254
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:05,963
How nice. I bet it means he wants to see you soon.

255
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,445
You're leaving today, aren't you?

256
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:15,878
Yes. I'll be leaving tonight.

257
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,340
Okay.

258
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:22,035
Well then, let's have lots of fun at the ball.

259
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:26,275
Will you escort me?

260
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,041
I'd love to.

261
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:07,447
They're all looking at you, you know.

262
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:09,910
Is it because I've done something wrong?

263
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,626
No, silly.

264
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,676
It just means you look beautiful.

265
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,480
Everyone else is dressed up, though.

266
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:19,220
But you're the most beautiful.

267
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,600
Hey... Don't leave my side, okay?

268
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,135
Okay. I promise.

269
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:44,787
Miss Isabella.

270
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,943
I wanted to say... thank you, Violet.

271
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:17,432
Of course.

272
00:29:58,661 --> 00:29:59,588
Are you tired?

273
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:02,259
I am, but...

274
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:05,580
That was fun.

275
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,854
I didn't even step on your feet.

276
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,004
Yes.

277
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,906
So what will you do now?

278
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:19,021
I'll go back home and start writing letters again.

279
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:24,002
I...

280
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:24,885
Hmm?

281
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,978
I want you... to write a letter for me.

282
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:32,242
Who is it for?

283
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:36,294
My little sister.

284
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:42,421
The truth is, I wasn't actually born into the York family.

285
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,169
Amy.

286
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:54,329
Hmm?

287
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:57,873
See that you do better next time around.

288
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,644
Yeah, well, it's tough out there with the war going on.

289
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:16,994
Huh?

290
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:23,668
Where's your mom?

291
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:37,636
Another abandoned child?

292
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:42,045
Well, even if we could sell
her, she's probably not worth much.

293
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:13,870
I've decided.

294
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:14,608
Hmm?

295
00:32:16,024 --> 00:32:17,978
She'll be my little sister.

296
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:20,672
What? Don't be stupid.

297
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:24,185
How exactly do you think you're going to support a child?

298
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,769
I mean, you're still a kid yourself.

299
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:30,724
It's about revenge.

300
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:33,472
I was forced to live like this, too.

301
00:32:34,524 --> 00:32:38,550
This child was about to suffer the same fate, but...

302
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:40,917
... I'll make sure she has a happy life.

303
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,009
I may have nothing, but I'll give her a fighting chance.

304
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,115
You call that "revenge"?

305
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:53,060
Well, it's not my fault if you two die.

306
00:32:56,477 --> 00:33:00,000
You're going to be my little sister now. I'm Amy.

307
00:33:00,318 --> 00:33:00,977
Hmm?

308
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:04,759
Uh... Let's see...

309
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,888
I'm sister.

310
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:17,670
Ah... Si... Si... Sister!

311
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:10,729
I'm home.

312
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,418
Sister!

313
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:24,916
Open wide, Taylor.

314
00:34:27,937 --> 00:34:28,935
Mm!

315
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:29,919
Is it good?

316
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:34,020
Sister!

317
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:40,050
Our room was filthy.

318
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:43,882
And we pretty much had next to nothing.

319
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:47,829
But during that time...

320
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:50,863
... there was nothing more I could do.

321
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,076
Sister...

322
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:07,825
Huh?

323
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,824
Amy Bartlett, I presume?

324
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,889
How dare you barge in here? What is this?

325
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:18,955
So this is the child of that
woman from all those years ago.

326
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:22,562
The blood of the York family flows in her veins.

327
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,269
She is my daughter.

328
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:28,912
Hmm...

329
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:35,029
I want you to leave your name and
your past behind, and come with me.

330
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:39,406
Do that, and I'll see that the child is cared for.

331
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,636
It's in her best interest.

332
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:49,719
Did you truly think you could keep living like this?

333
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:57,171
Sister...?

334
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,385
I had nothing to offer her.

335
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:09,502
No dreams, no hope. The one true thing I had,

336
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,068
the best thing I had was...

337
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:18,892
Sister...!

338
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:21,791
Sister!

339
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:25,414
... my desire to protect her no matter the cost.

340
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:30,516
My desire to save her. It became my reason to keep living.

341
00:36:34,346 --> 00:36:38,068
That was the day I sold my life to
the man who said he was my father.

342
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:44,715
And so ended Amy the homeless girl.

343
00:36:45,397 --> 00:36:48,791
As for Taylor, I've been separated from her ever since.

344
00:36:49,896 --> 00:36:51,531
We're not even allowed to meet.

345
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,913
In some ways, I can relate.

346
00:36:59,937 --> 00:37:04,890
I never knew my parents. I was found
abandoned and was raised as a human weapon.

347
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:12,149
But then, someone new entered my life. He taught me to
write and he helped me to grow into the person I am today.

348
00:37:12,722 --> 00:37:14,499
He always treated me kindly.

349
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:20,270
Because of him, I now... have a purpose in life.

350
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,711
I wasn't able to give anyone anything.

351
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,119
No. You're wrong about that.

352
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:34,164
What you did was give me my very first gift of friendship.

353
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,476
Also, you taught me something.

354
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:44,665
You taught me... that even the smallest
gesture like holding hands can warm the heart.

355
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:49,256
Miss Isabella, I believe you have given Taylor

356
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:50,933
more than you'll ever know.

357
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:57,664
Even if you can't see her,

358
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,756
you can write a letter. With a
letter, your feelings can reach anywhere.

359
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:17,367
Dear Taylor...

360
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:43,222
I'll pay you back someday.

361
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:47,194
Unfortunately, I have nothing to give you right now.

362
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:50,481
But I will repay your kindness.

363
00:38:51,187 --> 00:38:52,452
There's no need.

364
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:54,644
Hmm? Why not?

365
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:56,249
You've done so much.

366
00:38:57,512 --> 00:39:00,207
I don't know, I... I can't explain this feeling.

367
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:05,848
But I promise you don't have to.

368
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:11,837
Hey...

369
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,228
Will I ever see you again?

370
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:17,907
I don't know the answer to that.

371
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:22,586
But remember this... Miss Amy.

372
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,290
I am an Auto Memories Doll.

373
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,468
I go wherever I'm needed, if it is what you request.

374
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,742
So I see the Princess Knight is gone.

375
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,089
Now we can finally talk.

376
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:17,803
Uh, okay.

377
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,935
At the debutante ball, your waltz was beautiful.

378
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:26,083
Thank you, but... I couldn't have done it without Violet.

379
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,347
She helped me, Miss Lancaster.

380
00:40:28,907 --> 00:40:30,444
Please, call me Ashley.

381
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:31,525
Huh?

382
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,960
Putting aside our ranks and our family names for a moment,

383
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:40,408
I was hoping that... That the two of us could talk alone.

384
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:06,530
Hey.

385
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:08,008
Hmm?

386
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:10,885
I have a couple letters here for you.

387
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:14,411
Me? For Taylor?

388
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:16,190
That's right, for you.

389
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:22,071
Oh, hey, you, over there!

390
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:23,710
Does she know how to read?

391
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,055
Nuh-uh.

392
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,828
Just my luck...

393
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:35,427
I guess I'll read them to you, then. Ready?

394
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,452
Taylor!

395
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:38,326
Okay, here goes.

396
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,961
Brother!

397
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:41,956
What? I'm not your brother.

398
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,897
All right. Listen up.

399
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:48,622
The first letter is from my co-worker, Violet Evergarden.

400
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:52,675
The gist is, "Come and see me
if you're ever in need of help

401
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:55,137
or want a shoulder to lean on."

402
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:57,895
This one doesn't have a name or address.

403
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,762
What is this? It's so short.

404
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:05,181
It says, "Here is a magic word that will protect you:

405
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:09,305
Amy. That's all you have to say."

406
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,258
Mean anything?

407
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:22,739
Hi, Taylor. I'm no longer known as Amy.

408
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:25,781
I had to abandon the name I've always had.

409
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:29,198
But I did it for you, because I love you.

410
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:37,931
Si... Sister...

411
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,490
But as long as you keep saying it like a magic word...

412
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:44,110
Si... ster...

413
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:48,416
... my hope that you'll have a better life someday...

414
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,677
... will never... fade away.

415
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,215
Sister!

416
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:07,548
So please, Taylor...

417
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:20,269
Amy.

418
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:57,808
Postal service.

419
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:05,616
Postal service!

420
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:12,473
Hmm? What's the matter?

421
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:17,034
Mr. Felitz... guess he isn't home again.

422
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:23,595
That's strange. He's always making such a racket
at nighttime. I could hold it for him if you'd like.

423
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:27,018
Uh... No, it's collect on delivery.

424
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:28,528
I'll come again this evening.

425
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:32,353
Hey, you three!

426
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,604
Hands off my bike!

427
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:35,304
Run!

428
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:37,299
What a beat-up bike!

429
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:47,804
Postal service.

430
00:44:48,193 --> 00:44:49,869
Postal service?

431
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:51,908
Thank you.

432
00:44:53,045 --> 00:44:55,350
You're welcome. Always happy to serve.

433
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,635
Where did that postman go?!

434
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,683
Postal service.

435
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,687
Hold on. One question.

436
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:34,203
Huh?

437
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:37,940
You see the tall building over there?

438
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:40,617
What on earth is that?

439
00:45:41,982 --> 00:45:44,698
I told you before. It's a radio tower.

440
00:45:44,984 --> 00:45:50,394
What's a radio, though? It's not something
that's going to give me headaches, is it?

441
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:54,900
It's nothing like that, no. War ended four years ago.

442
00:45:55,062 --> 00:45:56,439
We're just rebuilding.

443
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:02,069
Lots of progress has been made since then.

444
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:10,086
Despite considerable growth worldwide,

445
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:14,352
the work of a mail carrier hasn't change. Not one bit.

446
00:46:17,092 --> 00:46:19,125
It's the same thing every day.

447
00:46:21,454 --> 00:46:23,168
What a boring job.

448
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:33,511
The same symbol...

449
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:36,253
Huh?

450
00:46:44,124 --> 00:46:45,148
Bro...

451
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:47,812
Brother!

452
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:48,478
Huh?

453
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:51,861
What?

454
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:54,580
Brother!

455
00:46:56,067 --> 00:46:56,662
Huh?

456
00:46:57,702 --> 00:47:01,279
Oh, my! Are you lost?

457
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:04,489
Is that Benedict's little brother?

458
00:47:05,514 --> 00:47:07,302
Or is it his lovechild?

459
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:10,829
Give me a break. She's just visiting.

460
00:47:14,522 --> 00:47:16,361
Uh. My name's...

461
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:22,534
... Taylor! Taylor Bartlett!

462
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:25,599
What?! You're a girl?!

463
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:34,966
You said Taylor, is that right?

464
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:38,826
Mm! You're Wyalet Evergaldian?

465
00:47:39,063 --> 00:47:40,669
That wasn't even close.

466
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:46,858
Look, this is the letter you wrote three years ago.

467
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:50,267
It said to come and see you if I'm ever in need.

468
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:52,031
That's why I'm here.

469
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,289
She's that kid?

470
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:00,142
Miss Taylor, does that mean you're in trouble?

471
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,471
I have a favor to ask you.

472
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:05,949
I want...

473
00:48:07,006 --> 00:48:08,682
I want to work here!

474
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:09,595
Huh?!

475
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:12,917
Work here?

476
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:19,372
"If there ever comes a time when you leave
the orphanage, and you find that you need help,

477
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,794
please don't hesitate to come and find me.

478
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:24,972
From Violet Evergarden."

479
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:29,904
I see.

480
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:38,975
Taylor? Did you happen to... run away from your orphanage?

481
00:48:39,642 --> 00:48:43,027
The letter is addressed to an
orphanage run by the kingdom of Drossel.

482
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:47,587
I can't imagine they'd let a
girl your age wander around alone.

483
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:50,368
Is that true?

484
00:48:51,907 --> 00:48:52,584
Hmm?

485
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,176
Yeah.

486
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,793
I'm sorry. In order to work here,

487
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:05,162
I'm afraid you would have to be a
little bit older than you are now.

488
00:49:05,194 --> 00:49:07,973
No, please! I'm all out of money!

489
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,088
I have nowhere else to go!

490
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,437
Nevertheless...

491
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,447
I ask that you allow her to stay.

492
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:16,362
Violet, you, too?

493
00:49:17,301 --> 00:49:20,811
She's the little sister of... a friend of mine.

494
00:49:21,373 --> 00:49:22,948
I promised I would help her.

495
00:49:29,305 --> 00:49:32,229
I want to know! I want to know what...

496
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:34,492
... "I love you" means.

497
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:47,308
Well, I suppose it will take some time to
send her back. It'll require some looking in to.

498
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:48,961
So then...?

499
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:53,625
Mm-hmm. Until everything is all sorted
out, I suppose you can look after her.

500
00:49:54,332 --> 00:49:55,827
Does that sound good to you?

501
00:49:58,105 --> 00:49:59,409
Yay!

502
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:02,396
Great! You'll be helping the ghost writers, then.

503
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:05,128
Nuh-uh, no I won't!

504
00:50:05,432 --> 00:50:09,618
Wanna know why? 'Cause I'm gonna deliver mail like you!

505
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:10,603
You are?

506
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:13,171
D-Deliver mail?!

507
00:50:13,196 --> 00:50:16,316
Mm-hmm! Tee-hee.

508
00:50:16,586 --> 00:50:19,041
You really don't want to help the ghost writers?

509
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,057
Are you sure?

510
00:50:20,336 --> 00:50:25,144
Yeah! Before I even came here, I
decided I wanted to be a mail carrier!

511
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,702
There's no way! A little kid
couldn't do that sort of work.

512
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:31,896
Don't say that! Please, Brother, come on!

513
00:50:31,939 --> 00:50:32,890
Just let me do it, please!

514
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:34,511
Quit it! I'm not your brother!

515
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,273
Won't you do this for her?

516
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:38,283
Seriously, guys?

517
00:50:38,395 --> 00:50:40,304
I agree with her on this, Benedict.

518
00:50:41,353 --> 00:50:44,648
She came all this way. Why
not at least show her the ropes?

519
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,382
So. It seems the boss has spoken.

520
00:50:57,153 --> 00:51:03,406
Listen up. Just from looking at it, it may
seem easy, but delivering mail is really hard work.

521
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,839
So how about we have you start with delivering this mail.

522
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:08,355
Here you go.

523
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:11,573
Uh. Where's it go?

524
00:51:12,128 --> 00:51:14,645
It goes to the addresses on the envelopes.

525
00:51:14,729 --> 00:51:16,418
Take this. Read it.

526
00:51:19,031 --> 00:51:20,137
Let's see...

527
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:23,378
Two... One...

528
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:25,936
It's in the Mill District, Leiden.

529
00:51:26,006 --> 00:51:29,178
Alexander Street. The numbers 2125.

530
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,156
Hm? Don't tell me...

531
00:51:32,196 --> 00:51:35,129
Oh, yeah! Mill District! I knew that.

532
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:39,568
Here?

533
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:41,737
Yeah.

534
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,187
Next address.

535
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,878
Uh.

536
00:51:56,882 --> 00:51:59,375
Hey, there are no mailboxes here.

537
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,568
That means we have to go to each unit.

538
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,437
The fourth floor?

539
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:06,349
Next one.

540
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:08,000
What?!

541
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:12,516
There. Huh?

542
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:31,576
That's it for today. Let's head back.

543
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,419
Wow.

544
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:36,029
Huh?

545
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:39,631
You really deliver that much mail every day?

546
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:44,692
You never... You never even looked at a map! Not once!

547
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,264
That's amazing!

548
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:51,906
Well, yeah. Any decent mailman
has his entire route memorized.

549
00:52:54,368 --> 00:52:55,290
Brother...

550
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:02,172
Hey! Can I call you "teacher"?

551
00:53:02,227 --> 00:53:04,427
Huh? You kidding? No way.

552
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:13,199
It lit up all by itself!

553
00:53:13,312 --> 00:53:15,270
They're really changing things around here.

554
00:53:15,343 --> 00:53:17,607
They're switching to electric lights all over the city.

555
00:53:17,814 --> 00:53:19,063
Really?

556
00:53:22,382 --> 00:53:25,425
So why exactly do you want to be a mail carrier anyway?

557
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,390
That's a silly question.

558
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:38,518
It's 'cause mail carriers don't just
deliver mail, they deliver happiness.

559
00:53:40,894 --> 00:53:42,333
Wow!

560
00:53:43,016 --> 00:53:44,589
I can sleep here?!

561
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:45,676
Yes.

562
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:48,926
Where's your room, Wyalet?

563
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:52,247
At the bottom of the stairs. Across from it, actually.

564
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,672
So then, I have this whole room to myself!

565
00:54:00,439 --> 00:54:01,503
Teacher!

566
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,078
Will you teach me again tomorrow?

567
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:09,973
Well, it's just... You don't know how to read yet, do you?

568
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:14,089
You... didn't read a single address today.

569
00:54:15,258 --> 00:54:17,204
You were only able to read the numbers.

570
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:18,108
Mm...

571
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:24,845
Yeah... I can't read...

572
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:26,258
I want to, but...

573
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:29,238
I've always had trouble learning the alphabet.

574
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,174
Whenever I received a letter,

575
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:33,792
I would just have the nuns read them to me.

576
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,970
"Here is a magic word that will always protect you: Amy.

577
00:54:39,581 --> 00:54:41,387
That's all you have to say."

578
00:54:43,397 --> 00:54:44,684
Sister...

579
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:46,010
Hmm?

580
00:54:48,824 --> 00:54:51,365
Read it... again?

581
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:59,590
I know I... wasn't honest.

582
00:55:00,456 --> 00:55:01,828
I'm sorry...

583
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:09,152
Miss Taylor.

584
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:13,866
I'll teach you the alphabet if you want me to.

585
00:55:14,203 --> 00:55:16,574
Huh? You will?

586
00:55:17,261 --> 00:55:20,509
Yes. We'll start training together tomorrow.

587
00:55:21,564 --> 00:55:22,819
Training?

588
00:55:23,908 --> 00:55:27,785
No. What I meant to say was "study."

589
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:30,726
Study hard, and then,

590
00:55:31,243 --> 00:55:33,903
we'll make you into a fine young mail carrier.

591
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:38,726
Wyalet!

592
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,779
It's Violet, actually.

593
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:20,492
Do you think that since I can't sleep by myself,

594
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:22,184
that makes me a baby?

595
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:23,725
No.

596
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:25,576
Hmm?

597
00:56:27,523 --> 00:56:29,112
Is it looking outside?

598
00:56:29,937 --> 00:56:31,607
The one I have is a bear.

599
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:34,865
Your sister always wanted to do this, too.

600
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:36,962
Sleep in the same bed together.

601
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:40,718
Is that true? You slept in the same bed?

602
00:56:41,249 --> 00:56:41,790
Yes.

603
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:43,786
I see.

604
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:51,389
I wonder if I also used to
sleep in the same bed as Sister.

605
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,625
I wanna hear some more about Sister.

606
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:18,966
It's time to wake up, Miss Taylor.

607
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:32,225
I hope you slept well.

608
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:12,518
Ah!

609
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:19,784
They come undone if you only do
it with two strands, Miss Taylor.

610
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,890
By braiding three strands together,

611
00:58:41,972 --> 00:58:43,413
it'll stay in place better.

612
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,147
Good morning.

613
00:58:49,214 --> 00:58:49,638
Good morning.

614
00:58:49,723 --> 00:58:50,380
Good morning.

615
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:54,225
Good morning, everyone!

616
00:58:56,043 --> 00:58:56,535
Huh?

617
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:05,666
Well, good morning, you little apprentice.

618
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:09,370
Mr. Roland. I thought that you had retired already.

619
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:13,436
I just have so much free time,

620
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:17,138
I couldn't help myself. And what about you, Violet?

621
00:59:17,296 --> 00:59:20,936
I hear that you're going to be
helping out with some deliveries today.

622
00:59:26,324 --> 00:59:32,479
A is for the animals, and I is for the ice

623
00:59:32,562 --> 00:59:38,198
U is for the umbrella, but the weather's so nice

624
00:59:38,395 --> 00:59:40,312
Hah! E is for Err...

625
00:59:40,395 --> 00:59:41,288
Violet?

626
00:59:42,723 --> 00:59:43,625
Luculia.

627
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:48,583
It's been ages!

628
00:59:48,938 --> 00:59:50,815
Wait, why're you dressed like that?

629
00:59:51,896 --> 00:59:53,447
We're delivering mail!

630
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:57,132
You're delivering mail? With this girl?

631
00:59:58,632 --> 01:00:02,511
She's an apprentice. I've been
helping her learn since she arrived.

632
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,395
Helping an apprentice... Is that part of the job?

633
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:09,088
Where are you headed?

634
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:10,645
To New Town.

635
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:13,911
Ah! It's just that way, right over the bridge.

636
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:15,244
Luculia!

637
01:00:15,729 --> 01:00:16,200
Hmm?

638
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:23,773
I have to go, Violet. Good to see you.

639
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,079
... And you are...?

640
01:00:25,103 --> 01:00:26,281
... My name's Taylor!

641
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:29,604
Well, then. Good luck with your job, Taylor.

642
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:30,468
Tee-hee.

643
01:00:35,634 --> 01:00:36,991
Who was that lady?

644
01:00:37,245 --> 01:00:39,016
She's a Doll, just like I am.

645
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:40,821
And that man with her?

646
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:46,636
That man? I don't know. I've never seen him before.

647
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,267
This place is New Town?

648
01:00:50,331 --> 01:00:53,200
Yes. Try reading the address.

649
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:59,181
Okay, I'll try. L-E-I... Lei-den. Leiden.

650
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:01,312
And then... What's this one?

651
01:01:01,822 --> 01:01:03,804
Rhetorica District. What's next?

652
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:08,137
Rhetorica District, 6, 7, 8, 9...

653
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:11,257
... 10, 11... It's 12!

654
01:01:13,576 --> 01:01:14,804
Here it is!

655
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:28,187
Miss Taylor.

656
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:28,811
Hmm?

657
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:30,239
It's this way.

658
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,248
What's this?

659
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:35,189
This is a machine that's called an elevator.

660
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:41,719
It's a new device that's being introduced
at New Town's latest apartment buildings.

661
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:44,063
I... think it's for transportation.

662
01:01:50,626 --> 01:01:52,342
So how does this thing work?

663
01:01:53,652 --> 01:01:54,669
Well, let's see...

664
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:56,917
I believe you use this.

665
01:02:02,015 --> 01:02:03,520
It didn't work...

666
01:02:09,003 --> 01:02:12,339
Wow! It's moving!

667
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,899
Ah! That was our floor!

668
01:02:16,729 --> 01:02:17,956
I'll bring it back down.

669
01:02:19,021 --> 01:02:20,417
Wah!

670
01:02:22,437 --> 01:02:24,486
Whew, we made it.

671
01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:27,625
The stairs would've been faster.

672
01:02:29,572 --> 01:02:30,484
Ah!

673
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,010
Oh, my!

674
01:02:35,323 --> 01:02:36,824
Postal service!

675
01:02:37,196 --> 01:02:40,201
Why, thank you, dear. Oh!

676
01:02:40,434 --> 01:02:42,092
This is from my mother.

677
01:02:42,335 --> 01:02:45,674
Marty! There's a gift from your grandma here!

678
01:02:46,858 --> 01:02:47,664
Really?!

679
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:50,831
What is it?

680
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:52,854
Slow down.

681
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:58,458
Uh. Ooh! It's candy! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hoo...

682
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:05,172
Uhh...

683
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,432
Hey, um... Was it that obvious I wanted some?

684
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:21,245
Yes.

685
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:37,367
Really? So Luculia is in Leiden now?

686
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:41,823
She is. She was there with a gentleman.

687
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,979
Do you think that... That it's
the man she's going to marry?

688
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:51,127
I guess marriage means her Doll days are over.

689
01:03:51,346 --> 01:03:54,090
No way. She said she wasn't going to quit.

690
01:03:54,353 --> 01:03:57,363
She wants to keep working even after she gets married.

691
01:03:57,578 --> 01:04:00,368
Wait, seriously? Wow...

692
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:03,923
Times have changed.

693
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,219
Changed how?

694
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:11,099
Seems like there's now more to a Doll's life
than finding the man of your dreams and retiring.

695
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,270
Is that supposed to be the optimal life for a Doll?

696
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:17,447
Yeah. Until now, at least.

697
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:20,979
Do you two share that ideal? Finding a man and retiring?

698
01:04:21,339 --> 01:04:21,879
Huh?

699
01:04:22,562 --> 01:04:24,676
I wouldn't call it an ideal, exactly.

700
01:04:25,168 --> 01:04:28,427
I think I'm more interested in
becoming the top Doll in the world.

701
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,841
Oh. I want to write novels.

702
01:04:30,937 --> 01:04:34,083
I think that's always been my
dream more than anything else.

703
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,283
Writing novels?

704
01:04:35,347 --> 01:04:36,587
Are you serious?

705
01:04:36,776 --> 01:04:38,581
Yeah, I'm really interested in it.

706
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:40,877
I already wrote and submitted a short story.

707
01:04:41,198 --> 01:04:43,436
So there are many dreams and ideals, then.

708
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:46,747
Well, how about you?

709
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,348
You want to know... my ideal?

710
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:55,615
Ah! Teacher!

711
01:04:55,814 --> 01:04:59,372
I'm not your teacher. Time for afternoon deliveries.

712
01:05:58,312 --> 01:05:59,356
Miss Taylor!

713
01:06:00,854 --> 01:06:01,525
Huh?

714
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:10,797
You sure it's okay?

715
01:06:10,994 --> 01:06:11,757
Yes.

716
01:06:13,426 --> 01:06:16,548
You know that no one's ever bought me clothes before?

717
01:06:17,537 --> 01:06:18,669
Oh, is that true?

718
01:06:20,862 --> 01:06:23,738
Yeah, at the orphanage, it's all hand-me-downs.

719
01:06:24,437 --> 01:06:26,954
I love having something that's all my own.

720
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,250
I'll treasure it.

721
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:36,308
This, too! My teddy bear is also
my precious, precious treasure.

722
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:42,036
Having something to treasure... That feeling...

723
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,722
It's wonderful, isn't it?

724
01:06:49,158 --> 01:06:51,492
I can't remember much from back then.

725
01:06:51,687 --> 01:06:54,283
I wonder if Sister used to do this for me.

726
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,429
I forgot almost everything.

727
01:07:08,082 --> 01:07:11,719
"Here is the magic word that will always protect you:

728
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:14,620
Amy. That's all you have to say."

729
01:07:16,312 --> 01:07:21,001
Miss Taylor. Why is it that you
want to be a mail carrier so badly?

730
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:26,263
I wanna be like Teacher. 'Cause he's
the one who delivered Sister's letter.

731
01:07:26,787 --> 01:07:30,853
I know that I forgot what it
was like when I lived with Sister,

732
01:07:30,951 --> 01:07:33,951
but I still have this letter from her.

733
01:07:34,141 --> 01:07:41,283
I've always kept it close to me. It reminds me of
her and her love for me. That's what Teacher delivered.

734
01:07:44,113 --> 01:07:45,956
He delivered happiness.

735
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:50,207
Mail delivery is a great career.

736
01:07:50,395 --> 01:07:52,008
I believe you've chosen well.

737
01:07:52,522 --> 01:07:53,605
Mm-hmm.

738
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:57,966
Amy...

739
01:08:00,462 --> 01:08:03,560
I also want to be able to deliver happiness.

740
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:11,187
I was thinking...

741
01:08:11,222 --> 01:08:13,222
Why don't you write a letter to your sister?

742
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:17,035
Um. Yeah, but... I can't read.

743
01:08:17,981 --> 01:08:22,404
I'm still learning. But even if
I could, I dunno what I'd write.

744
01:08:25,228 --> 01:08:29,206
Miss Taylor. I am a Doll, you know.

745
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:33,663
So please, let me help you with this.

746
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:03,705
Will she like it? The letter?

747
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,405
I believe that your feelings will reach her.

748
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,532
Um... Dear Sister...

749
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:42,013
What is it? You know how early it is?

750
01:09:46,745 --> 01:09:48,608
Is she going back to the orphanage?

751
01:09:49,206 --> 01:09:52,865
No. We want to know if you can deliver a letter for us.

752
01:09:53,395 --> 01:09:53,873
Hmm?

753
01:10:06,771 --> 01:10:08,571
Did you write this yourself?

754
01:10:08,907 --> 01:10:09,581
Mm!

755
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:13,800
I learned to read and write.

756
01:10:17,032 --> 01:10:19,354
You're sending it to Amy Bartlett?

757
01:10:20,777 --> 01:10:22,134
Where's the address, though?

758
01:10:22,353 --> 01:10:23,341
We don't have it.

759
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:23,889
Huh?

760
01:10:24,468 --> 01:10:28,831
Amy Bartlett is now called Isabella York.

761
01:10:29,073 --> 01:10:32,191
She attended a girls' school as heir to the York family.

762
01:10:32,849 --> 01:10:34,734
But her current whereabouts are unknown.

763
01:10:37,187 --> 01:10:39,162
Isn't she a friend of yours, Violet?

764
01:10:40,771 --> 01:10:43,529
Well, we did exchange letters for a period of time,

765
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:47,238
however... she stopped writing.

766
01:10:48,876 --> 01:10:52,618
I imagine she was married off to an important aristocrat.

767
01:10:53,265 --> 01:10:56,458
But we've no way of knowing who that is.

768
01:10:56,977 --> 01:10:59,418
Wait, are you asking me to track her down?

769
01:10:59,683 --> 01:11:00,491
But that's...

770
01:11:00,671 --> 01:11:03,406
Please? Please, Teacher?

771
01:11:04,925 --> 01:11:05,998
Will you?

772
01:11:12,988 --> 01:11:16,595
I need it... I need it get to her.

773
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:44,959
No matter how difficult, every letter
deserves to be delivered. But listen up.

774
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:47,707
If I do it, I have one condition.

775
01:12:54,445 --> 01:12:55,986
I thought you might be here.

776
01:12:58,528 --> 01:12:59,035
Hmm?

777
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,762
Hard work is all fine and dandy,

778
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:03,566
but you also need your sleep.

779
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:06,235
Thanks.

780
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,645
Ah, that hit the spot!

781
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,666
Oh, I almost forgot. A letter arrived for you.

782
01:13:21,581 --> 01:13:22,054
Huh?

783
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:30,134
I found it...

784
01:13:35,312 --> 01:13:36,769
This was his condition?

785
01:13:38,067 --> 01:13:40,438
Mm-hmm. Can't say I blame him.

786
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:42,225
His old bike was on its last legs.

787
01:13:42,605 --> 01:13:45,808
You have to be careful out there. Promise me you will?

788
01:13:46,107 --> 01:13:46,824
Mm-hmm!

789
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,875
Let's go.

790
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:52,799
Hmm.

791
01:13:55,562 --> 01:13:56,453
Violet.

792
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:57,511
Yes.

793
01:14:06,186 --> 01:14:09,627
Thanks a lot. For all that you've done.

794
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:13,742
Ah... Of course.

795
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:23,364
Good luck, Miss Taylor! I hope it goes well!

796
01:14:29,222 --> 01:14:31,540
You worked so hard... I hope that...

797
01:14:33,256 --> 01:14:35,105
I hope that your love is delivered.

798
01:14:45,187 --> 01:14:50,141
It seems like the York family went to great
lengths to keep Isabella's true identity a secret.

799
01:14:51,856 --> 01:14:57,401
But she's from one of the great houses with
ties to the royal Drossel family, so in reality,

800
01:14:58,047 --> 01:14:59,926
there were only a few worthy suitors.

801
01:15:05,943 --> 01:15:08,498
The rest was just process of elimination.

802
01:15:44,187 --> 01:15:44,991
Whoa...

803
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:48,186
She lives here?

804
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:53,301
Yes. This is Count Neville's manor.

805
01:15:54,562 --> 01:15:57,233
The local villagers say that
they see the count pretty often,

806
01:15:58,045 --> 01:16:01,325
but, apparently, they've actually
never seen the lady of the manor.

807
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:08,376
However, merchants who visit here
say that, around this time of day,

808
01:16:09,153 --> 01:16:11,846
they've managed to catch a glimpse
of her at the back of the mansion.

809
01:17:10,828 --> 01:17:11,839
Excuse me, ma'am.

810
01:17:19,688 --> 01:17:22,445
Um... I have a letter for you.

811
01:17:23,353 --> 01:17:25,352
A letter? For me?

812
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:29,959
Yes, that's right. For Isabella...

813
01:17:30,142 --> 01:17:32,995
Wait, make that "Amy Bartlett."

814
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:41,750
Here.

815
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:05,967
Taylor... Bartlett.

816
01:18:10,448 --> 01:18:11,551
It can't be...

817
01:18:27,988 --> 01:18:28,713
It says...

818
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:31,421
"Dear Sister"...

819
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:35,791
The nuns told me what happened.

820
01:18:36,283 --> 01:18:39,096
They helped me understand everything better.

821
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:44,261
They said that the reason you went off
to somewhere far away was to protect me.

822
01:18:45,158 --> 01:18:47,184
But you still sent me a letter.

823
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:51,752
You were thinking of me, even when we were so far apart.

824
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,167
That's why...

825
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:57,352
... I know that...

826
01:19:01,339 --> 01:19:04,178
"I know that I'm Taylor Bartlett."

827
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,793
"I am Amy Bartlett's"...

828
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:19,868
... "little sister."

829
01:19:32,555 --> 01:19:33,748
My sister...

830
01:19:36,755 --> 01:19:38,179
My little sister...

831
01:20:19,256 --> 01:20:21,759
Good morning, Taylor.

832
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:39,103
Sister...

833
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:42,926
Just so you know, Violet helped her write it.

834
01:20:46,732 --> 01:20:49,447
Is... Is that true?

835
01:20:51,557 --> 01:20:52,635
I'm so glad!

836
01:20:54,172 --> 01:20:55,962
I'm so very glad!

837
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:58,656
Thank you for this.

838
01:21:04,997 --> 01:21:06,417
Sister...

839
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:16,562
Huh?

840
01:21:20,982 --> 01:21:22,330
Like peas in a pod.

841
01:21:27,006 --> 01:21:28,696
So she's able to write now.

842
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:32,811
The last time I saw her, she was so little.

843
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:40,415
I think that... I'm going to write Taylor a letter.

844
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,814
And Violet, too.

845
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,452
Will you deliver them?

846
01:21:47,599 --> 01:21:48,493
Of course.

847
01:21:51,383 --> 01:21:54,255
But someday, it just might be someone else.

848
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:56,191
Huh?

849
01:22:15,156 --> 01:22:17,755
Teacher, I saw you crying.

850
01:22:18,312 --> 01:22:19,804
You were the one who was crying!

851
01:22:20,456 --> 01:22:22,179
Yeah, but you were, too.

852
01:22:22,516 --> 01:22:23,307
Enough!

853
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:29,888
So. You really okay with not meeting her?

854
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:34,267
Mm-hmm.

855
01:22:37,396 --> 01:22:41,043
I don't wanna do it until I become a real mail carrier.

856
01:22:41,966 --> 01:22:46,938
Once I do, I'll come back and deliver my letters myself!

857
01:22:48,488 --> 01:22:50,903
Heh. Still haven't given up, huh?

858
01:22:51,063 --> 01:22:53,605
Course not! 'Cause what mail carriers deliver...

859
01:22:53,691 --> 01:22:55,026
What we deliver is...

860
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,178
... happiness.

861
01:22:59,299 --> 01:23:00,149
Is that right?

862
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:05,417
Mm-hmm!

863
01:23:18,097 --> 01:23:19,121
Amy.

864
01:23:28,454 --> 01:23:34,226
Soon after, Taylor Bartlett ended up
being adopted by the Evergarden family.

865
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:37,793
And when she's old enough to work...

866
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:39,442
Wow!

867
01:23:39,475 --> 01:23:40,551
So cool!

868
01:23:42,534 --> 01:23:44,698
She'll become a mail carrier once again.

869
01:23:46,573 --> 01:23:47,676
Postal service.

870
01:23:51,649 --> 01:23:53,565
Excuse me, one moment.

871
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:54,136
Huh?

872
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:58,432
When is that big building going to be finished?

873
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,655
They're taking forever to finish it!

874
01:24:06,261 --> 01:24:07,330
Someday...

875
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,070
Someday.

876
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:09,039
Taylor...!
