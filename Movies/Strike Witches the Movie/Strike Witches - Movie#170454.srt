[NARRATOR]
Since the beginning of time,

8
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,083
mankind has always
been at war with things

9
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,833
"out of this world."

10
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,333
Luckily, the humans have
had a secret weapon.

11
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,416
At the forefront of these
battles were "The Witches."

12
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,458
Teenage girls with
extraordinary magical powers.

13
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,291
[NARRATOR]
However, in the year 1939,

14
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:17,166
an enemy unlike any known
before overwhelmed Europe

15
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,875
and was poised to
take over the world.

16
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:24,875
This enemy became
known as "The Neuroi."

17
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,500
No one knew where
they came from or why,

18
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,666
but their attacks
were so deadly,

19
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,041
they left behind nothing but
heartbreak and devastation.

20
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,125
People were driven
from their homes.

21
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:40,125
Cities were destroyed, and
countries were left in ruins.

22
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,458
[NARRATOR] In an effort
to overcome their new,

23
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,375
vicious enemy, mankind
developed "Striker Units."

24
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,208
These modern day magical
brooms would boost

25
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,916
the Witches' power and,
more importantly,

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,708
allow the girls to take
their battle to the skies.

27
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,791
The best and most
powerful Witches

28
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,208
from around the world
were then dispatched

29
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,708
to take their place on
the front lines in Europe

30
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,541
with this new weapon.

31
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,708
They became known as
"The Strike Witches."

pretty quiet the past few weeks,

49
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,166

expecting to hear.

Roger that.

162
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,250
that the 501st Strike Witches
are the best of the best!

163
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,125
Your squadron fought to save
both Gallia and Venezia.

164
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,125
You truly are a legend.

165
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,583
[YOSHIKA]
I don't know what to say.

166
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,958
Major Sakamoto has told me

167
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,875
so many stories of your bravery.

168
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,166
About all of your missions in
Europe and what a hero you are.

169
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,750
What? Sakamoto?

170
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,875
Yes!

171
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,291
In fact, the reason
I came here today

172
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,583
was to bring you orders
directly from Major Sakamoto.

173
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,000
She wants you to come to
Europe and study abroad.

174
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,291
Go to Europe?

175
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,291
To study abroad?

176
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,666
[MICHIKO] Yoshika, I didn't
know that you were an Ensign.

177
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,208
[YOSHIKA]
Yeah!

178
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,458
They gave me a promotion right
after we liberated Romagna.

179
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,125
Wow! That's amazing.

180
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,083
[GRANNY MIYAFUJI]
Well, wouldn't that be nice?

181
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,333
Yoshika studying abroad at
a Medical School in Europe.

182
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,541
[HATTORI]
Yes, ma'am!

183
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,041
And I'm honored to say
I have been asked

184
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,833
to accompany Ensign Miyafuji.

185
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,291
Is something the
matter, Yoshika?

186
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,916
It's just that this is
all a little sudden.

187
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,083
Understandable.

188
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,541
Well, there's a school
interested in you.

189
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,666
And I think their
offer is incredible.

190
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,791
The Helvetia Medical School
asked me to tell you

191
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
that they would like
you to come to Europe

192
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,000
and enroll to be a
student of theirs.

193
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,041
Huh? How wonderful!

194
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,958
Helvetia has one of
the best Medical Schools

195
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,166
in the whole world.

196
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,583
What? Do they really?

197
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,000
Yep!

198
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,833
It's one of the top three
Medical Schools in Europe.

199
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,333
Uh...

200
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,041
Helvetia, here I come!

201
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,416
Wait, are you sure?

202
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,333
It's a big decision.
Shouldn't you think about it?

203
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,000
Nope! Don't need to.

204
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,500
This is my chance to
become a great doctor.

205
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,041
Excellent! I was
hoping you'd go.

206
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,416
Promise me this, though.

207
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,791
Study hard and do your best,
learn all that you can

208
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,666
about Western Medicine,
and then, bring it home to us.

209
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,625
Yes, I promise.

210
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,250
[ship horn blows]

211
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,791
Goodbye! Wish me luck, everyone!

212
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,791
Please, take care
of yourself, Yoshka.

213
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,791
Good luck and do your best!

214
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,958
Goodbye, Yoshika!
Have fun in Europe!

215
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,708
Don't forget to write!

216
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,666
Bye-bye, I'll miss you!

217
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,750
It's kinda crazy
how fast they were able

218
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,583
to rebuild, don't you think?

219
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,125
Yeah, totally! Look!

220
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,000
They're already working
on the bell tower!

221
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,416
It's my favorite
part of the city.

222
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,583
I hope they finish it soon.

223
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,291
[gasps]

224
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,833
[FRANCESCA]
It's the Regata Storica!

225
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,833
Uh, what? I don't speak Italian.

226
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,541
It's one of the
biggest gondola races,

227
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,916
and it starts next week!

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,625
[chuckles] Now there's
a language I do speak.

229
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,125
[CRESPI] I was afraid there
wouldn't be a Regata this year.

230
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,291
Weren't you, Captain?

231
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,916
Of course, and
luckily, the Neuroi

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,166
aren't occupying
this area anymore.

233
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,375
Um, Martina.

234
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,375
Could you please stop
rocking the gondola?

235
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,666
[laughing] Oh, the
sweet taste of victory

236
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,416
will be ours, yet again.

237
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,583
That's the truth.

238
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,458
As long as we have
Luciana rowing for us,

239
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,375
we'll be unstoppable.

240
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,083
[SHIRLEY]
I'm the fastest there ever was!

241
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,333
Oh, no!

242
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,125
[SHIRLEY]
I will not be beaten!

243
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,625
[CRESPI]
Not the 501st...

244
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,375
[MAZZEI] Charlotte Yaeger
and Francesca Lucchini!

245
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,250
Hiya, losers!

246
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,083
You wanna race, Squad Redpants?

247
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,083
What?

248
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,666
Oh, it's so on!

249
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,458
No!

250
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,041
Why in the world do you
always have to do this to me?

251
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,000
The first one to the
Rialto Bridge wins!

252
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,958
It's time to kick it
into high gear, Luciana,

253
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,958
and that's an order!

254
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,125
Okay, here goes!

255
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,333
[WITCHES shouting]

256
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,291
[MAZZEI]
Can we settle this another way?

257
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,083
[SHIRLEY]
Now, that's a winner talking!

258
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,041
Ha, ha! Hope you
enjoy the view!

259
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,208
Ugh! Shirley!

260
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,625
[laughs] What are you
worried about? I got this.

261
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,416
[MALVEZZI]
Why won't they just give up?

262
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,291
[CRESPI]
You're doing great, Luciana?

263
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,208
Seriously-- No more
jumping! Please!

264
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,625
No!

265
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,958
They're cathing up, Captain Fer!
We gotta do something!

266
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,416
Luciana, I need you to
activate your magic power!

267
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,250
Huh? But, Captain,
wouldn't that be cheating?

268
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,583
Are you questioning an order?
Quit messing around and do it!

269
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,750
[laughing]

270
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,000
[FRANCESCA]
Hey! That's not fair!

271
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,666
Oh, no, you did not!

272
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,541
You messed with the wrong witch!

273
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,250
[FRANCESCA]
Go get 'em, Shirley!

274
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,166
[SHIRLEY]
You got it!

275
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,625
It's time for the 501st
to teach you how to lose.

276
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,583
[CRESPI]
They're gonna pass us!

277
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,500
[MALVEZZI, MAZZEI yelp]

278
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,208
How 'bout this view? Enjoy!

279
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,583
[SHIRLEY yells]
We're not slowing down.

280
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,583
[FRANCESCA, SHIRLEY screaming]

281
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,666
[FRANCESCA screams]

282
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,958
Guess we lost.

283
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,250
[FRANCESCA]
Owie!

284
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,958
[MALVEZZI]
That looks pretty swollen.

285
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,000
[CRESPI]
And pretty painful.

286
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,041
[sobs]

287
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,791
It's like a clown nose
sitting on your head.

288
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,875
Do you think you could use magic
to try and heal her, Captain?

289
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,541
[MALVEZZI sighs]
I'll see what I can do.

290
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,958
Hey-- That's super itchy.

291
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,250
[MALVEZZI] Oh, relax.
It always feels that way.

292
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,541
That's how you
know it's working.

293
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,750
Not Yoshika's.

294
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,000
Her healing magic
was never itchy.

295
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,000
True. I wish I knew
how Yoshika did it.

296
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,041
And Miyafuji's patients
saw results immediately.

297
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,958
If I remember
correctly, that is.

298
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,250
Are you actively trying
to hurt my feelings?

299
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,375
No, sir! That was
nothing against you!

300
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,750
I'm just joking.

301
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,041
Come on, everyone knows
that Ensign Miyafuji's gift

302
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,291
for healing is like
one in a billion.

303
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,791
Agreed.

304
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,583
Which makes it extra sad that
she lost all of her magic

305
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,666
and healing abilities
during the Mars Operation.

306
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,791
[sighs]

307
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,291
If it wasn't for Yoshika,

308
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,625
we wouldn't be able to have
a Regata Storica this year.

309
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,333
I wonder where she is.

310
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,666
And what she's doing right now.

311
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,000
[CRESPI] Oh, wow!
It looks so much better!

312
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,750
Very impressive, Captain Fer!

313
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,708
Yeah, but it still itches!

314
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,833
[MALVEZZI]
Oh, quit being such a baby!

315
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,375
You poor thing. All better now?

316
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,083
[alarm blares]

317
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,500
No way!

318
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500

A Neuroi?

This can't be happening!

320
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,416
[FRANCESCA]
How'd we miss it?

321
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,458
[CRESPI] This area was clear!
Where did it come from?

322
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,541
And why wasn't there an
alert from the lookouts?

323
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,708
Captain Fer!

324
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,041
I'm not getting a
response back from base!

325
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,000
What's going on?

326
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,125
Francesca!

327
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,541
I'm on it!

328
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,083
[gasps] They brought
their Striker Units!

329
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,958
The 501st is always prepared!

330
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,416
[grunts]

331
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,708
[growls] Well, what
are we waiting for?

332
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,583
We don't have any
Striker Units, sir.

333
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,500
[MALVEZZI growling]
Why weren't we prepared?

334
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,125
Francesca, the radios
aren't working

335
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,583
and we need to keep
each other posted,

336
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,500
so don't go too far.

337
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,541
Ah--

338
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,166
You ready? Let's do this!

339
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,416
[FRANCESCA]
Roger that!

340
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,833
[SOLDIER E]
All units, hold your fire!

341
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,291
[SOLDIER F]
We've got reinforcements!

342
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,416
The Strike Witches are here!

343
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,208
[gasps]

344
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,000
[SHIRLEY]
Almost there, Francesca!

345
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,625
Just a lead 'em
out a little more!

346
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,291
You got it!

347
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:38,250
[yelling]

348
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,416
[SHIRLEY]
It's time to finish him.

349
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,333
The shot's all yours! Take it!

350
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,833
[FRANCESCA]
Copy that!

351
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,666
[FRANCESCA]
I've got him!

352
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,916
Look down! He's below you!

353
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,875
[FRANCESCA]
How'd it-- What?

354
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,416
[SHIRLEY]
It transformed!

355
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,666
[FRANCESCA]
You're mine!

356
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,875
[FRANCESCA grunts]

357
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,083
So you wanna play rough, huh?

358
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,375
Hey! Hey!

359
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,541
[gasps]

360
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,166
What is she doing?

361
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,333
[FRANCESCA] Shirley, I think
she means the bridge.

362
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,833
Oh, I get it!

363
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:35,083
[laughing] Follow me,
big guy! Let's dance!

364
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,791
[SHIRLEY] There's the bridge!
Time to put an end to this!

365
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,000
They're almost here!

366
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,791
Exactly as planned.

367
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,125
You are not getting past me!

368
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,666
He's all yours!

369
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,375
[yelling]

370
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,875
Woo-hoo!

371
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,750
[MALVEZZI] Another brilliant
plan from yours truly.

372
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,375
[MAZZEI] I must agree.
It was a wonderful plan, sir.

373
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,375
Shirley.

374
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,666
I'm glad we got him,
but where do you figure

375
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,375
that Neuroi came from?

376
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,541
He put up a pretty good
fight for just a straggler.

377
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,416
You don't think
there's more, do you?

378
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,083
Our job is to be
ready either way.

379
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,500
[HATTORI]
I feel so lucky!

380
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:27,000
I still can't believe
Major Sakamoto trusted me

381
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,333
with the honor of bringing
Ensign Miyafuji to Europe.

382
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,458
I'll do my best, I promise.

383
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,000
And I'll make you very
proud of me, Father.

384
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,083
[door clicks]

385
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,208
Can I come in?

386
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,458
Oh, yes, of course,
Ensign Miyafuji.

387
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:44,333
[YOSHIKA] This ship is
so big. I kinda got lost!

388
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,708
That might be because the Amagi

389
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:48,041
is the largest aircraft
carrier in Fuso's arsenal,

390
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,541
coming in at exactly
260 meters long.

391
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,833
Wow.

392
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,166
You sure know a lot
about ships, Miss Hattori.

393
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,666
Just like Michiko does!

394
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,166
Sir, It's not necessary
to call me "Miss."

395
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,333
Sgt. Hattori is fine.

396
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,750
[sighs] Hey.

397
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you mind if I ask
you how old you are?

398
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,750
No, not at all, Ensign.

399
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,833
I just turned 14 years old.

400
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,291
Whoa!

401
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,041
I can't believe that you're
two years younger than me.

402
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,375
I guess I just thought
you were older

403
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,500
because you seem so mature.

404
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, I didn't mean to
confuse you, Ensign Miyafuji.

405
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,000
[giggles] Don't
worry about that.

406
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,125
And call me Yoshika.

407
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,541
No, that's out of the question.

408
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,250
Military Regulations.

409
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,583
Well,

410
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,208
a few years ago, Major
Sakamoto told me something

411
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,625
I'll never forget.

412
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:29,500
She said that we didn't
necessarily have to worry about

413
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,375
each other's' rank all the time
if we were friends, first.

414
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,958
Major Sakamoto said that?

415
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:37,166
Yep! So I'll call you Shizuka.

416
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,500
Or maybe Hattori
if you'd rather?

417
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,333
And you can call me Yoshika
or Miyafuji, I guess.

418
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:43,875
I'll let you decide.

419
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:47,375
Okay. Ensign, uh, Yoshika, sir.

420
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,625
[giggles] Thanks, Shizuka!

421
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,916
Of course. Uh, Yoshika, sir.

422
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,375
Would you like me to
help you get settled

423
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,666
and unpack your things?

424
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,791
Military regulations state
that all belongings

425
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,041
be stored in one of these
while you're on the ship.

426
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,083
It helps us to stay
organized, otherwise,

427
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:08,291
personal items tend to pile up
over time, as you may know.

428
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,500
Yoshika. Where's all your stuff?

429
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,000
It's in the bag, right here.

430
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,250
That's all you brought?

431
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,708
One bag? You fit
everything in there?

432
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:17,875
I sure did.

433
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,375
But... I don't understand--

434
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:22,291
Where are your uniforms?
What about all your books?

435
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,708
Or your first and
second military dresses?

436
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,250
Oh, I didn't bring them.

437
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,833
What?

438
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,958
So, wait.

439
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:32,875
You're an Ensign and
you didn't think to pack

440
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,791
your officer's uniforms?

441
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,291
Well, no, why would I?

442
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,958
I'm not in the military anymore.

443
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,041
What are you talking about?

444
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,500
Of course you are!

445
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,833
You're an Ensign in the Fuso
Navy who's studying abroad

446
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,833
at a Medical School
in Europe, now.

447
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,666
And as a responsible,
high-ranking officer,

448
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,166
you're expected to abide
by Military Regulations--

449
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,791
including uniforms!

450
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,958
U-Uh... I'm so sorry.

451
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,375
[HATTORI]
Hm?

452
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,041
Where did Yoshika go?

453
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,291
[YOSHIKA humming, giggling]

454
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,916
Okay, I'm all done
chopping up the vegetables!

455
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,375
Great! That was quick!

456
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,541
Now, would you mind
starting on the mackerel, too?

457
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,291
[YOSHIKA] Sure! You want
three pieces, right?

458
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,666
What are you doing?

459
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,958
Oh, hi, Shizuka.

460
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,625
Are you having a good morning?

461
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,208
Just a few more minutes
and breakfast will be ready.

462
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,166
[HATTORI]
You are violating regulations.

463
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,750
Don't you understand
you're an officer?

464
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,458
And, as an officer, you
should know that cooking

465
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,958
isn't one of your duties.

466
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,208
But we're a team.

467
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,583
Which means that we
should work together

468
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:52,833
and help each other out.

469
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:53,875
That may be true.

470
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,333
But an officer
is still an officer.

471
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,791
[YOSHIKA]
Whoa, wait a second!

472
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,416
What about the fish?

473
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,208
[HATTORI] I am quite sure
it will all be fine.

474
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,791
Ready, Set, Take-off!

475
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,125
[YOSHIKA]
And a hard left turn--

476
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,875
Comin' at ya, Yoshika!

477
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,416
[gasps]

478
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,708
[YOSHIKA]
Got it! Yes! Thank you so much!

479
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:33,041
I love this stuff--
it's my favorite!

480
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,500
Ah! So delicious!

481
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,916
What exactly are you doing, now?

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,083
Oh. Just drinking a Ramune.

483
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,166
Do you want one? It's good!

484
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,125
[HATTORI] The Naval Officer
Regulations clearly state

485
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,625
that "One must behave
according to one's rank."

486
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,916
Therefore, an Ensign must
always act appropriately

487
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,708
in a way that respectfully
reflects the title of Ensign.

488
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,041
It's of the upmost importance
that you respect the rules

489
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,875
and traditions of the military.

490
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,125
I know.

491
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,416
You're one of the
most courageous

492
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,166
and admired Strike Witches ever.

493
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,208
Personally, I've always
looked up to you.

494
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,208
You're a hero of Fuso,
and it's about time

495
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:17,500
you started acting like it.

496
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,458
But when people
are so kind to me,

497
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:22,166
I feel the least I can
do is help them out.

498
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,791
Plus, I don't exactly
have what it takes

499
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,083
to be a Witch anymore.

500
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:28,541
[gasps] My apologies.

501
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,000
Even so, you're still
an Ensign, sir.

502
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,208
And because of that, it's part
of your job to set an example.

503
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,791
Our traditions have taught
us diligence and respect.

504
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:37,916
They've helped us...

505
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,250
[YOSHIKA]
Why do I think this must be

506
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:42,041
what Hartmann feels like
after talking to Barkhorn?

507
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,666
A-Achoo!

508
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,125
Cover your mouth!

509
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,041
Hygiene is an important part
of being a great soldier.

510
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,416
We must always be
in perfect health

511
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,916
so we can serve at our best.

512
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,583
Coming down with a cold
makes it impossible

513
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,666
to fight in battle.

514
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,125
And, even worse,
your compromised germs

515
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,333
could make others sick.

516
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,500
A multi-vitamin would--

517
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,833
[screams]

518
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,833
[BARKHORN] Di-Did you just
rub your snot on me?!

519
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,541
I just got finished--

520
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,125
[HATTORI] Do you understand
what I'm saying?

521
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,625
Yes, I understand.

522
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,375
I just don't know what to do.

523
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:12,458
[HATTORI] Study this.
And follow Regulations.

524
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,291
Right. Got it!

525
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,916
I can't believe it's
taken three weeks.

526
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,833
But at least we're
in Cape Town, now.

527
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,375
Looks like it.

528
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,958
But it's hard to tell in all
this fog we've got to deal with.

529
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,583
I mean, have you ever
seen anything like this?

530
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:43,625
[YOSHIKA grunts]

531
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,458
Yay. We're almost to
Cape Town, Africa!

532
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:57,958
[creaking]

533
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,291
[alarms ringing]

534
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,708
Oh, no! It's a Neuroi!

535
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,291
Captain!

536
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,333
It appears the ship's path has
been intercepted by an iceberg.

537
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:08,708
[CAPTAIN]
That's not possible!

538
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,875
The spotters should've seen it!

539
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:11,250
[OFFICER B]
Sir!

540
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,083
A fire alarm triggered near
the auxiliary generator.

541
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,541
Not now!

542
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,250
What's the status?

543
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,875
We have a fire in the corridor!

544
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,500
That's right by the ammunition!

545
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,916
Have you contained it?

546
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,625
The extinguishers
aren't working.

547
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,666
So we keep trying!

548
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,041
What about emergency valve?

549
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,916
[SAILOR C] It's on the other
side of the fire, sir.

550
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,083
Chief Petty Officer Yuki
is trapped there.

551
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,041
Tell me how it's looking, Chief.

552
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,458
[YUKI]
Not good, sir.

553
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,583
The collision with the iceberg
has damaged the valve.

554
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:41,833
It won't turn!

555
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,875
Then we're gonna need to
think of something else.

556
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,041
[HATTORI] I got here as soon
as I could, Lieutenant!

557
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:50,291
Is there anything you can do
to help get this fire contained?

558
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,125
I'll give it a shot, sir!

559
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:02,291
[grunting]

560
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:11,500
[HATTORI grunting]

[gasps]

562
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,250
[OFFICER D]
What do we do now?

563
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,875
Chief! Are you all right?

564
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,041
[YUKI]
Sir, the fire is spreading fast.

565
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,541
I need you to seal
this compartment

566
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,791
and flood it with water!

567
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:24,750
Hurry!

568
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,208
There's gotta be another way!

569
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:27,500
[gasps]

570
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,083
Sir, we don't have time!

571
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,375
Please, I'm telling you--
It's our only choice!

572
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,541
[OFFICER C]
Chief, you won't make it.

573
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,333
And if the fire gets
to the ammunition,

574
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,375
none of us will survive! Please!

575
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,125
We're running out of time!

576
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,125
What's the order?

577
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,500
The "Chief" has served this ship

578
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:47,291
longer than anyone. We must
respect his decision.

579
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,250
Flood the corridor.

580
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:52,250
The captain has okayed
the Chief's call.

581
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,208
This is our only choice.
Time to move.

582
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,958
You have your orders, Soldier.

583
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,708
Sir, yes, sir.

584
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,625
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

585
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,041
[water splashes]

[YOSHIKA panting]

588
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,708
Yoshika, what are you doing?

00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,333
[SAILOR C]
Ensign Miyafuji, stay back!

590
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,416
[YOSHIKA]
I can't!

591
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,250
[HATTORI]
Ensign, you have to stop!

592
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,750
They're flooding
the compartment!

593
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,416
But there's still
someone in there!

594
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,916
The Captain gave the order!

595
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,416
I'm not letting him die!

596
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,583
[gasps] Yoshika! No!

597

[YUKI coughing, wheezing]

598
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:53,541
Forget me. Just save the others.

599
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,916
You have to hang on!

600
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,833
You have to get outta here!

601
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,041
You help me, and we can do it.

602
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,375
[grunts]

603
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,041
What's the status?

604
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,208
[OFFICER C] The ammunition room
has taken severe damage

605
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:08,625
and will approach critical
temperature in three minutes.

606
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,208
Then you are to begin
the flooding in two.

607
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:12,666
[OFFICER C]
Yes, sir.

608
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,166
If there's another way,
she needs to find it fast.

609
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:19,625
There's nothin' else we can do.

610
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:22,916
It's not gonna budge.
We've got no other option.

611
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,541
Keep going. We can
do this, Yuki!

612
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,916
It's been two minutes.

613
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,666
We have to start flooding.

Yes!

618
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,458
[SAILOR D]
They got it!

They really did it!

we'd lost 'em for sure!

Thank you for saving him!

something, isn't she?

627
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,500
[YOSHIKA]
Wow, it sure is cold.

628
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,583
For some reason, I always
imagined that Africa

629
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,458
would be really hot.

630
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,208
I shouldn't have yelled
at you back there.

631
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,708
I'm sorry.

632
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,250
It's okay.

633
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,958
But, yet again, you neglected
to follow Military protocol.

634
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:53,708
And you disrespected the Captain
by not following orders.

635
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,083
I know I did.

636
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,750
And I'm sorry
about that, but hey,

637
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,208
everyone made it out okay!

00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,500
You don't get it!

639
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,375
Your reckless choice
could have sunk the ship!

640
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:04,166
When will you understand
you have to follow orders?

641
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,333
It was just dumb luck,
and if it hadn't worked,

642
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:08,208
we would all be dead.

643
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,333
I was just--

644
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:12,500
You follow orders! End of story.

645
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,250
Now, if you'll excuse
me, Ensign Miyafuji.

646
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,500
Uh--

647
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,583
I'm so sorry.

648
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:08,208
[HATTORI panting]

649
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,000
[HATTORI]
I see land!

650
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,500
We made it!

651
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:21,958
[YOSHIKA] Hey, Shizuka,
is that really Pas-de-Calais?

652
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,083
Uh--

653
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,958
[motor humming]

654
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,250
Huh?

655
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,333
[gasps] I know that sound.

656
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:33,583
[HATTORI]
Witches!

657
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,708
[HATTORI] That's a Hispano-Sulza
12Z and a Griffon 61!

658
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:40,375
That's--

659
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,041
The 501st!

660
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,541
Lynne, is that you?
Hello, Perrine!

661
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,333
Hi, Yoshika!

662
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,625
[YOSHIKA]
It really is you!

663
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,625
I was so excited to see you,
I flew straight here!

664
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,083
I'm glad you did!
It's great to see you!

665
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,458
[BOTH laugh]

666
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,708
[gasps] Wait.

667
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,250
Is this the real Master
Sergeant Lynette Bishop?

668
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,083
[PERRINE] Well, it's clear
they haven't changed a bit.

669
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,750
I mean, really, it's
only been two months.

670
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,750
[gasps] And you! You're--

671
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,583
[gasps] Lieutenant
Perrine Clostermann.

672
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:17,666
It's a real honor
to meet you, sir.

673
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,916
Hello. I'm Sergeant
Shizuka Hattori.

674
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,083
And I am reporting
for duty, sir.

675
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,375
[PERRINE chuckles] I've heard
quite a bit about you,

676
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:27,666
Sergeant Hattori.
You must be exhausted.

677
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,750
Yoshika can be a handful, huh?

678
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,250
What? No! It's not that!

679
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,291
[LYNNE] It's like I haven't
seen you in forever!

680
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,583
[YOSHIKA]
I know!

681
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:39,041
[BOTH giggling]

682
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,208
[YOSHIKA]
I missed you!

683
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,083
[LYNNE]
I missed you more!

684
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:04,416
Wow, I can't believe
you traveled so far

685
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,083
all by yourself!
That's so brave!

686
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,416
Thanks!

687
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,541
My father thought I should
take a trip to celebrate

688
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,041
my independence
now that I'm 14.

689
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,208
[PERRINE] I've been meaning
to ask you, Yoshika.

690
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,958
How is Major Sakamoto
doing these days?

691
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,791
Good? Did she say anything?

692
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,083
About me or about
the good ol' days?

693
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,666
I dunno.

694
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,958
When I came to visit the base
a while back, she wasn't there.

695
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,125
Someone did tell me that
she'd been sent away

696
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,833
on a big emergency
mission, though.

697
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,208
I wonder why I didn't
hear about that.

698
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,416
Wow! Look at all those grapes!

699
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,208
I'll bet they're delicious!

700
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,583
[LYNNE] They look sweet, but
they're actually pretty sour,

701
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,458
because these grapes
are used to make wine!

702
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,625
[PERRINE]
What do ya think?

703
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,541
Gallia's beautiful, isn't it?

704
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:48,666
Yeah.

705
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,375
It's almost hard to
believe it's real!

706
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:51,833
[LYNNE]
What's even more unbelievable

707
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,916
is that this area
belongs to Perrine.

708
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
[YOSHIKA]
Wow!

709
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,125
Good morning!
And what lovely news!

710
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,916
[gasps] Is that a real castle?

711
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,416
[PERRINE laughs]

712
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:16,791
[PERRINE] It looks so
much better than it did

713
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,541
right after the liberation.

714
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:21,041
We've worked to restore
everything we can.

715
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,708
Hello, ladies! Welcome back!

716
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:27,625
Good to see you!

717
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:28,625
Good day, Perrine!

718
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,666
We've made a lot of progress!

719
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,291
Hi, Perrine. Do you
wanna play with us?

720
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,250
[BOY A] We can't now,
it's almost time for class!

721
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,083
[PERRINE] Of course,
I promised you we would,

722
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:38,250
as soon as we finish math.

723
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,375
Good morning, Miss
Perrine. Welcome back.

724
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,958
I trust I didn't
miss anything eventful

725
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,208
while I was gone.

726
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:45,916
No, but a senator stopped by,

727
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,250
hoping to have a
word with you today.

728
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:54,208
Would he mind waiting
until after class?

729
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,375
I'm sure something
can be arranged.

730
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,500
[PERRINE] Okay! Shall we
get this class started!

731
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,125
--[GIRL A] Yeah!
--[KIDS giggling]

732
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,541
[PLANCHARD] Hey! Where are
you off to now, little buddy?

733
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:06,708
Hey, Lynette, who
are those kids?

734
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,666
All of these children
lost their parents

735
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,541
during the war
against the Neuroi.

736
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,541
Perrine was devastated and
decided to take them in.

737
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:16,583
Since then, they've
become one big family.

738
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:31,583
[PERRINE]
Now, raise your hand

739
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,208
if you know the
answer to this one.

740
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,333
[BOY B, GIRL B, GIRL C]
Me!

741
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,833
[PERRINE]
That easy, huh?

742
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,333
Uh?

743
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:43,791
[KIDS giggling]

744
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,208
You're a great teacher, Perrine!

745
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,333
It's so amazing what
you've done for them.

746
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:51,250
Well, it was the
right thing to do.

747
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,291
Besides, my mother and
father told me to always

748
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:55,208
help those in need.

749
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:56,750
Now, I have to run
to a quick meeting

750
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,791
with the Senator.

751
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,125
But if it's not
too much trouble,

752
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:00,416
would you do me a favor?

753
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,166
Yes, of course!

754
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,208
[PERRINE]
Would you mind making dinner

755
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,708
for all of the kids?

756
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,750
I think it would be a
special treat for them.

757
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,333
Especially from their
three new friends.

758
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,416
Sure!

759
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,000
Sounds good!

760
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,833
Cooking...?

761
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:16,083
Did you say something?
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

762
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:19,541
Sir! No, sir, not at all.
I'm very excited to cook.

763
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,916
[BOTH giggle]

764
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,041
[HATTORI grunting]

765
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,125
[YOSHIKA] How's everything
going over there?

766
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,208
Going great!

767
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,125
[GIRL B]
Whoa! This looks really fancy!

768
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:38,333
[BOY B]
I can't wait to eat it!

769
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,500
And now, let's show our thanks.

770
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:43,833
[ALL]
Thank you for the food!

771
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,250
This is so yummy!

772
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:51,791
It's delicious!

773
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,583
I can't believe we made
it all by ourselves!

774
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:54,666
Me neither!

775
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,583
We should do this again!

776
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,416
This soup sure smells good!

777
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,041
Sergeant Hattori, you said this
was your specialty, didn't you?

778
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,000
Yes, it was my
Mother's recipe, sir.

779
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,583
This is gross and
tastes like boogers.

780
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:14,708
U-Uh...

781
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,083
So yucky.

782
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:19,041
It's... unique.
An interesting flavor.

783
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:22,916
Yes.

784
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,958
That's exactly what I
was thinking, Lynette.

785
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:30,458
[screams] I'm sorry. I failed
you. It's awful. Forgive me!

786
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,416
[PERRINE]
Are you still thinking about

787
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,541
the soup mishap at dinner?

788
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,625
[HATTORI]
Lieutenant.

789
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:15,000
No! Well, yes.

790
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:18,125
I'm sorry I let you
and the children down.

791
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,083
Wanna hear something funny?

792
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,958
When I was young, I used
to think that cooking

793
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,541
was only done by cooks.

794
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,041
Me, too.

795
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,333
I come from a Military family
and everyone had a title.

796
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:33,750
That's just the way it was.

797
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,291
I bet when you were a child,

798
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,208
you had the talents of
a Witch, so they expected

799
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,291
you to behave as
a soldier would.

800
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:43,166
Why would they teach you to cook
when that wouldn't be your job?

801
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,583
[HATTORI]
Exactly. My family isn't like

802
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,250
the other Witches' families.

803
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,291
My father and grandfather
expect a lot from me.

804
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,458
[PERRINE]
Oh, now it makes sense why

805
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,916
Yoshika's getting
under your skin.

806
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,958
You come from a home with
very strict boundaries.

807
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:57,000
And she likes to
do her own thing.

808
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:57,833
[HATTORI]
That doesn't bother me!

809
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,458
I admire Ensign Miyafuji!

810
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,583
She's brave, and she
helped to liberate Europe.

811
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:03,916
She's a hero and I respect her.

812
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,791
I know you do,
but it frustrates you

813
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:08,875
that she doesn't act the way
you think a hero should.

814
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:10,708
She ignores Military rules.

815
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:11,958
She never follows orders,

816
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,916
just thinks for herself,
and trusts her "gut."

817
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,291
When we first met,
I didn't like her.

818
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,625
[gasps]

819
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,583
[PERRINE] Originally, she
didn't even wanna fight.

820
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:25,541
In fact, she hated
the idea of war.

821
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,875
The Neuroi wanted to kill us,

822
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:31,166
and she didn't wanna
go to war with them.

823
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,291
At first, I didn't
understand why she bothered

824
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:37,083
to join the 501st Unit.

825
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:39,791
It's kind of funny, now.

826
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:42,416
The truth is, she made
our squadron stronger.

827
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,750
Without her, who knows
would've happened

828
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,666
to my home here in Gallia.

829
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,125
[gasps]

830
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,208
[PERRINE] Myafuji and I may
not agree with each other,

831
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,625
but we're a family.

832
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,916
That's stronger than anything.

833
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,583
Thanks, Lieutenant.

834
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:57,208
There's no need to thank me.

835
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,916
Now, go get some rest, Sgt.

836
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,958
And you can consider
that an order.

837
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,333
[HATTORI] We're estimating our
arrival at 1800 hours. Over.

838
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,041
[HQ] Eighteen hundred
hours. Copy That. Over.

839
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,833
[HATTORI]
Sgt. Hattori out.

840
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:22,166
[PERRINE]
So you're going to want to head

841
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,000
southeast towards Reims.

842
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,416
Then, if you
continue from there,

843
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,750
you should make it
to Dijon by evening.

844
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,166
And that's where
we're staying tonight,

845
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,375
correct, Lieutenant?

846
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,458
Yes, that's correct.
But whatever you do,

847
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:35,125
stay clear of the border on
the freeway's eastern side.

848
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,750
If you cross the Rhine,
you will be in enemy territory.

849
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:40,416
And as soon as you enter
their camp, we can't help you.

850
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,708
[HATTORI]
Yes, sir.

851
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,583
[LYNNE] Here, Yoshika.
I want you to have this.

852
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:46,041
[YOSHIKA]
Uh, what is it?

853
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:52,666
It's a lab coat!

854
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,583
It's perfect! Exactly what
a real doctor wears!

855
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:57,125
Yep!

856
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,125
Every physician needs their
very own lab coat, don't they?

857
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,125
Lynette, how did you
hurt your fingers?

858
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:05,541
It's nothing. Really.
Just a little accident.

859
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:08,083
I guess I've still got
a lot of learning to do.

860
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,791
She learned to sew
just so she could make it

861
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,125
and has been working on that
coat for the past month.

862
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,958
You're the best
friend ever, Lynette.

863
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,250
I promise.

864
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,291
I'm gonna study hard
and be an amazing doctor!

865
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,416
I know you will.
I believe in you.

866
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,750
[YOSHIKA]
Thanks!

867
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,500
[engine revs]

868
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,625
I packed you a lunch.

869
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,375
Don't forget to eat, okay?

870
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:32,583
[YOSHIKA]
Okay!

871
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,000
And here's a little
something for healing

872
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:36,125
from our herb garden.
It's called Saint John's wort.

873
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:37,416
Never know when you'll need it.

874
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,208
Thank you, both. For
everything. See you later!

875
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,125
All right. We should get going.

876
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,625
Goodbye, Lynette!
Goodbye, Perrine!

877
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,166
See you later!

878
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,708
Have fun, Yoshika!

879
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,791
I promise, I'll send
you lots of letters!

880
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,958
[EILA]
Wonder what Nikka's deal is?

881
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:12,750
I mean, what could be so
important that you can't

882
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,666
take a minute to say
goodbye to your friends?

883
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,416
You know finishing her
assignment takes priority.

884
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,541
If she can find a way
to be here, she will.

885
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,541
Yeah, I guess you're right.

886
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,875
[POKRYSHKIN] I know that
Nikka's doing everything

887
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:29,166
she can to get back in time
to give you a proper send off.

888
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,791
Thank you for that.

889
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,041
And, Captain, it's been
an honor to serve you.

890
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,875
Yes, thank you, Captain.

891
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,125
You're both great soldiers
and you will be missed.

892
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,750
The 502nd won't
ever be the same.

893
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,166
[KATAJAINEN]
I made it!

894
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,666
Guys!

895
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,833
Hold on! Don't
leave yet! Please!

896
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:50,041
I told you.

897
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,791
She made it back just
in the nick of time.

898
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,166
I'm so glad.

899
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,208
And it looks like there was
no activity to report.

900
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,250
I dunno.

901
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:58,250
Wouldn't bet on that
if I were you.

902
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,625
[KATAJAINEN screams]

903
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,166
[EILA]
Really?

904
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,083
[SANYA]
I hope she's okay!

905
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,583
[EILA]
Seriously.

906
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,708
She has gotta have the worst
luck of anyone in the world.

907
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,500
[POKRYSHKIN sighs]

908
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:15,083
[POKRYSHKIN] That's the
second time this month.

909
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,250
What are we going to do?

910
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,125
These repairs will be expensive.

911
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:21,708
And, unfortunately, our
budget is tight as it is.

912
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,333
I'm sorry, but it's not
like the lightning

913
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:24,750
was my fault.

914
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,333
[sighs] The weather's getting
pretty bad out there.

915
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:28,250
You'll need to be careful!

916
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,458
Huh?

917
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,416
[SANYA]
Got it.

918
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,666
We'll do everything we can to
try and stay above the clouds.

919
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,458
See ya later, Nikka.

920
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,958
Try not to get struck
by lightning again!

921
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,791
See ya. Wait up--
Hold on a sec!

922
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,458
Nikka?

923
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,458
[KATAJAINEN]
Bye!

924
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:51,916
Don't forget to come visit!

925
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,375
You guys be careful out there

926
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,750
and watch out for
storms and Neuroi!

927
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,625
Oh, I almost forgot!

928
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:02,333
Remember, strikers
don't like lightning!

929
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,625
Yeah, we know!

930
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,458
[EILA sneezes]

931
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,125
Cold?

932
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:35,875
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

933
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:38,416
How about we try to
fly a little lower.

934
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,791
[EILA] I can't stop
thinking about Yoshika.

935
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:00,958
[SANYA]
I know.

936
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,500
Why'd your Tarot reading
have to worry me?

937
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:03,875
[EILA] It was your
idea to use the cards

938
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:06,375
to see the future
in the first place!

939
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,708
Let's hope for the best.

940
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:12,666
but it's not a good sign.
She's in Gallia, right?

941
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,291
On her way to that
medical school?

942
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,250
Yeah, and Gallia was
declared a safe zone

943
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,291
a while ago.

944
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:18,791
That's why it
doesn't make sense.

945
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:22,791
[BIRDS squaking]

946
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:25,125
That's strange.

947
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,541
Eila!

948
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:30,125
[EILA]
No! There's no way!

949
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,958
[SANYA]
I can't believe it. A Neuroi.

00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,666
Oh, sorry. Hey, Shizuka,
did you want some?

00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,833
It's really good.

I'll pass. I'm not
all that hungry.

953
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,791
I'm busy looking at the route.

954
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:03,666
Hope they're okay.

955
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,875
I need help!

956
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:06,583
Can I borrow
your radio, please?

957
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,250
[YOSHIKA]
Tell us what happened, sir.

958
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:11,083
[DRIVER] My village was
devastated by a landslide.

959
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,875
--People are badly hurt!
--[HATTORI] A landslide?

960
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:13,666
Oh, no!

961
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,791
I tried to call for help,

962
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,375
but all the phone
lines are down.

963
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:17,416
We have to help!

964
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,791
[HATTORI]
Understood, Ensign!

965
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,583
How strange, I can't
seem to get a signal.

966
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:26,583
I'll keep trying to see
if I can get it working.

967
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,041
I'll go back to
the village with you

968
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,291
to treat the injured.

969
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:30,791
We haven't got much time;
we have to hurry!

970
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,125
Wait. Are you some
sort of doctor?

971
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,458
Ensign, you can't!

972
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,541
That village is on the
other side of the border!

973
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,458
Perrine made it very clear
to stay on this si--

974
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:40,833
We're going! That's an order!

975
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:42,416
Yes, sir.

976
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,208
[DRIVER]
Right this way.

977
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:02,666
[panting]

978
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,958
This is awful.

979
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,458
First, we'll need
to stop the bleeding.

980
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:08,416
Those herbs that Perrine
gave me will hopefully

981
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,000
take care of that.

982
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,916
But I need-- Ma'am.

983
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,541
Do you have any bandages?

984
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,583
I'm sorry.

985
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,416
We've already used up
what we had.

986
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,041
Okay, well, what about
any clean sheets or towels?

987
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,541
[OLD WOMAN]
No. We have nothing left.

988
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,291
I have to do this. Sorry, Lynne.

989
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,708
[gasps]

990
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,333
They're alive. And it's
all thanks to you.

991
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:58,500
There's no way to repay
you for all you've done.

992
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:11,250
[sighs] Goodness. I can't
believe it's so late.

993
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,333
Any luck getting
in touch with base?

994
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:18,708
[HATTORI]
No. And it's not looking good.

995
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:21,666
I've tried to contact Saint
Trond, Sedan and Dijon.

996
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,041
But there's too
much interference.

997
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:26,583
Do you think it might
just be broken?

998
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:27,750
[HATTORI]
I checked before we left

999
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,791
and the radio was working fine.

1000
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,125
I'd offer our phone,
but we still can't call out.

1001
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:33,833
Can we offer you
a place to stay?

1002
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:36,666
We don't want you on
the road after nightfall.

1003
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,583
That's very kind! Thank you!

1004
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,458
What a terrific idea,
don't ya think?

1005
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:41,625
It is.

1006
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:42,875
But we have to get
back on the road now.

1007
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,083
We haven't made any of
our scheduled check ins.

1008
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:48,833
[YOSHIKA whines]
Can't we do that tomorrow?

1009
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:51,083
It's our duty to make
our appointments.

1010
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,208
But you do whatever you want.

1011
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:11,291
[DELIVERY MAN]
Sign here, please.

1012
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:12,708
I can't believe it's
been almost a month

1013
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:14,666
since the last delivery.

1014
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,250
Well, I consider it
to be a good thing

1015
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,333
that we're not busy.

1016
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,791
Yes, sir, the rest
of the front line

1017
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,125
is the same way.

1018
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:23,125
I, for one, would love
for it to stay like this.

1019
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,041
Me, too.

1020
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:27,250
Well, that's gonna
do it for me, sir.

1021
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,958
[MINNA] Much appreciated,
but stay alert out there.

1022
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:37,916
[HARTMANN grunting]

1023
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,625
Ugh. I broke a nail.

1024
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:44,541
I can't feel my fingers.
This hurts so bad!

1025
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,166
Please tell me I can
stop. I don't wanna...

1026
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,666
[BARKHORN] Maybe you'll
be a little more careful

1027
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,041
with your loader.

1028
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,250
I don't wanna hear
it from you, okay?

1029
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,666
This is so hard!

1030
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:55,916
No, it's not. Now pay attention.
You just have to focus.

1031
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,791
Only because you
have troll hands.

1032
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,041
What did you say?!

1033
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,541
Tell me something,
how do you even

1034
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,416
lose your loader
in the first place?

1035
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,375
Because, as every good
Karlsland soldier knows,

1036
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,958
securing and inspecting
your weapons are of...

1037

[SCHNAUFER] Lieutenant Colonel.
Pardon the interruption.

1038
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:13,625
You have a call, sir.

1039
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:18,083
[MINNA] So, a Neuroi has been
spotted in Venezia as well.

1040
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,583
[SHIRLEY]
I'd say, I just don't know

1041
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:21,041
where it could have come from.

1042
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,125
There are no hives within
a 200-mile radius,

1043
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,791
and the lookouts at
the Romagna border

1044
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,166
haven't picked up anything.

1045
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,250
We'll have to figure it out.

1046
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:29,541
Go forth with the joint mission,

1047
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:31,541
and keep me updated
on any changes.

1048
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:32,958
[SHIRLEY]
Roger that!

1049
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,416
First, they attack in Belgica,
and now we have Venezia.

1050
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,083
[MINNA] We know the closest
hives are in Berlin,

1051
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:47,333
Nuremberg, and Prague.

1052
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:50,041
So, let's look at their
spheres of action.

1053
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:53,916
Well, would you look at that.

1054
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,958
These attacks are out
of the hives' range.

1055
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,875
Tell me again about that Neuroi.

1056
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:00,083
Of course.

1057
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,750
Sir, it was a single
pilot, mid-sized craft,

1058
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,541
spotted south of base, appearing
to be headed northeast.

1059
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:07,166
So it didn't match the specs
of a normal scout, then?

1060
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,208
Its mobility and firepower
were of a higher caliber.

1061
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:12,250
And the shape was unlike
anything I've seen.

1062
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:13,500
Interesting.

1063
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:15,625
That description matches
with the Neuroi attack

1064
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,541
that Shirley reported.

1065
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,458
Do you think they could be
from the same hive, sir?

1066
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:23,333
[MINNA] Venezia is approximately
800 kilometers away.

1067
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,041
So, I can't rule it out.

1068
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,583
However...

1069
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:28,916
[gasps]

1070
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,083
[MINNA] There aren't any
hives on that direct line.

1071
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:32,250
Which means, the lookouts

1072
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,875
should've been able
to intercept them.

1073
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:36,625
But both of the recent attacks
somehow went undetected

1074
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:37,833
by the border patrol.

1075
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,708
I just don't understand
how these Neuroi

1076
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,125
could slip through
our surveillance

1077
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:42,875
and attack out of range.

1078
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:45,416
Maybe there's a new hive
we don't know about.

1079
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,333
If there is, we need to
investigate and find it.

1080
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:49,583
I don't wanna.

1081
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:52,125
How do we know the
lookouts didn't slip up?

1082
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,958
I really don't see why it's
up to us to conduct recon.

1083
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,291
The surveillance team
has been getting

1084
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,958
a reputation for slacking
off and I don't see why

1085
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:00,541
--it's on us...
--[HARTMANN] Hey, guys?

Waiting for the go-ahead, sir.

1091
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:20,083
So, I take it Captain
Barkhorn is rather fond

1092

of this Ensign Miyafuji.

00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:24,833
Yes. Yoshika Miyafuji is
basically her little sister.

1094
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:26,375
Huh? Really?

1095
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:29,416
That is very misleading.
We share no biological bond.

1096
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,833
You shouldn't take
her seriously.

1097
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:33,666
She has a habit of
manipulating the truth.

1098
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,583
I'm gonna go on ahead
to find your sis.

1099
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:38,416
She is not my sister, Hartmann!

1100
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,666
We've almost made
it to the Rhine.

1101
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,166
I need you to stay alert.

1102
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,916
But everyone knows
this side of the river

1103
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,041
is out of the range
of Neuroi activity.

1104
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,666
We're completely safe here.

1105
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,750
That's why we
need to investigate.

1106
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,250
[HARTMANN]
Okay.

1107
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:13,250
The Karlsland side is
looking pretty awful.

1108
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,458
There's nothing we can do.

1109
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,875
Any closer, and we would
be in grave danger.

1110
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:19,125
Yeah, I know that,
but it's still my home.

1111
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,500
[sighs] It'll be different soon.

1112
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:24,291
'Cause we're gonna get our
land back from the Neuroi.

1113
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,958
[HARTMANN]
Yeah! You got that right.

1114
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,500
[HARTMANN]
Seems to be all clear to me.

1115
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,500
Looks like we can head back?

1116
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:37,916
Not yet.

1117
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,958
I think we should keep heading
south towards Lorelei.

1118
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,708
Aw...

1119
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,708
[stomach growls]

1120
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:00,000
Ugh. My stomach can't take it.

1121
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:02,125
Can we go now? I'm so
hungry, I'm about to die!

1122
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:04,708
I suppose it would be nice
to get something to eat.

1123
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:07,166
[gasps] Yay, food!

1124
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,041
[BARKHORN]
Honestly.

1125
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,375
Could you be any more immatu--

1126
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,750
[gasps] Over there!
Do you see that?

1127
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:14,750
It's a Neuroi!

1128
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:15,958
Coming from underground?

1129
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:17,875
I've never seen that before!

1130
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,500
This is why we couldn't
predict the attacks!

1131
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,791
Right, Hartmann. Let's go!

1132
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:26,166
Yes, sir!

1133
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,291
[BARKHORN yells]

1134
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,541
One down!

1135
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,166
Let's get the other.

1136
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,458
Back to back!

1137
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,750
Whoa! He transformed!

1138
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:11,666
[BARKHORN]
I'm overheated.

1139
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,833
Done with you.

1140
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,875
So, I'm still hungry.

1141
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,583
Well, you'll have to suck it up.

1142
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,750
[growls]

1143
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,458
Get 'im!

1144
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:50,916
[yelling]

1145
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:00,125
Can we eat now?

1146
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,708
We still got that
chimney-looking one.

1147
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:02,500
Where is he?

1148
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,583
[sighs] He went that way.

1149
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:07,541
[BARKHORN] Ugh! He just crossed
over into a safe zone.

1150
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:09,875
Well, what do we do?
I'm out of ammo and magic.

1151
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:13,416
And my empty stomach is
seriously eating itself.

1152
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,750
[BARKHORN]
Picus! Do you read me?

1153
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:18,250
This is Captain Barkhorn.
Minna, do you read me?

1154
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:21,291
We've got a Neuroi on the
move at grid position G-14.

1155
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:24,000
It has officially breached
the Rhine River barrier.

1156
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:30,541
[HARTMANN]
He's moving fast.

1157
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,291
I'm getting too
much interference.

1158
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,458
Hey, what's this stuff?

1159
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:34,666
Ah--

1160
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,000
Maybe the reason I
can't get a response.

1161
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,375
We need to get back to base!

1162
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,583
I don't have the
strength to move.

1163
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:43,541
I swear. You're so difficult!

1164
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:52,083
This is the end. I don't
think I can make it.

1165
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,875
Hang in there, okay?

1166
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,458
No! I'm dying!

1167
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:59,250
You are not!
You're unbelievable.

1168
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:03,375
[HARTMANN giggles]

1169
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,000
[BARKHORN]
Here. Eat it.

1170
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:06,166
You have chocolate?

1171
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:10,625
Yay! Here you go! We can split!

1172
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,000
Thanks, but I'm okay.
You can have it all.

1173
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,291
What? Really? Thank you!

1174
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,000
No way! There can't
seriously be more!

1175
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,541
[HARTMANN]
He's coming right for us!

1176
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:24,708
[BARKHORN]
This isn't good.

1177
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:26,666
We don't have any
weapons or magic left!

1178
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,166
Hartmann!

1179
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,125
I love chocolate!

1180
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,250
Get out of there!

1181
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:49,583
And sturm!

1182
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:58,083
[sighs] I must admit.

1183
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:00,833
I've never thought
of doing that!

1184
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:03,083
Oh, no! She's fallen asleep!

1185
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:05,458
Wake up! Hartmann!

1186
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:08,750
Minna, what are you doing here?

1187
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,500
I was worried when
we lost contact

1188
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,666
that something had happened.

1189
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,083
[BARKHORN]
Minna! We've got a problem.

1190
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:17,208
The Neuroi have
crossed the border.

1191
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:24,583
[YOSHIKA] That breakfast was
really delicious, huh?

1192
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:25,833
[HATTORI]
Yes.

1193
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:28,000
[YOSHIKA]
Did you get the radio working?

1194
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,375
[HATTORI]
No.

1195
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:33,083
We'll be arriving in
Helvetia tonight, right?

1196
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,208
Yes.

1197
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:35,250
So after that, then,

1198
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:37,208
I guess I'm going
to be on my own?

1199
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:39,083
I was assigned the
duty of delivering

1200
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,583
you to your destination.

1201
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:43,958
I'm going to miss
seeing you every day.

01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:00,125
It can't be!

1207
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:01,333
A Neuroi!

1208
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,541
I'll try to get through
to the nearest base!

1209
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,166
I still can't call out!

1210
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:13,833
We need to get to the
Bastogne base, immediately!

1211
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,833
I won't! Those people need us!

1212
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,333
It's too dangerous, Ensign!

1213
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:19,625
It'll be my job to
evacuate the village.

1214
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:21,291
It's up to you to try
and figure out a way

1215
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,500
to buy us more time.

1216
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:24,833

[yelps]

1220
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:06,333
I can do this.
Ammunition loaded.

1221
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:08,041
And safety off!

1222
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,458
[HATTORI]
I know what to do.

1223
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:14,166
Just follow the training
and everything will be fine.

1224

You hold the rifle steady...

1225
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:18,958
Close in on the target...

1226
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:21,625
Until it's right in your sights.

1227
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,541
Place the upper part
of the index finger

1228
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,791
on the trigger...

1229
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,541
And finally, you
focus on the shot.

01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:29,833
And fire!

01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,458
with Büllingen, as well, sir.

1265
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:58,708
Send the 101st Air Division
to Bastogne, now.

1266
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:01,041
I want these Neuroi contained!

1267
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,833
We're dealing with
a constant increase

1268
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,333
of Neuroi activity.

1269
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:10,708
This is bad.

1270
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:12,708
They've got us
completely surrounded.

1271
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:13,708
All right, it's up to us

1272
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:15,375
to figure out a
way to stop this.

1273
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,500
Otherwise, the Allied Forces
on the front lines

1274
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,166
will be surrounded as well.

1275
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,458
What about HQ?
What are they doing?

1276
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:23,750
The enemy is interfering
with the radio.

1277
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,250
That way, we can't
organize and retaliate.

1278
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:28,416
It's not just the radio,
it's the phones, too.

1279
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,833
I never imagined
they'd go underground.

1280
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:32,958
They've literally been right
under us the whole time.

1281
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,708
It almost reminds
me of the strategy

1282
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:37,083
we used to defeat
the Neuroi at Malta.

1283
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,541
So, what should
we do now, Minna?

1284
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,375
[MINNA]
Given the scale of this attack,

1285
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:43,083
we're either looking at
an unknown Neuroi hive,

1286
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,500
or we've got an
enemy mother-ship

1287
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:48,208
carrying a large number
of smaller Neuroi.

[door creaks]

1289
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,666
We've got a big problem!

1290
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:53,083
We've officially lost
contact with Yoshika.

1291
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,833
What? Where is she?

1292
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,708
It's heading straight
to the shelter!

1293
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:10,083
I've got to get it
away from the village!

1294
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:25,083
[grunting]

1295
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,125
Hey! Over here!

1296
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:51,958
He saw me!

Did I lose him?

1301
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:58,916

Ensign! Come on,
Miyafuji. Talk to me!

[grunts]

1310
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,916
Huh? Hey, Shizuka.
Where's the Neuroi?

1311
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,708
[groans] Is everyone safe?

1312
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,250
The target's been destroyed.

1313
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:09,333
Everyone's alive and the village
is safe, all thanks to you.

1314
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:13,666
That's good.
I'm glad to hear it.

1315
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,833
Yoshika! Please,
you have to hang on.

1316
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,208
What are we gonna do now?

[static]

1318
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,500
This is Sergeant Hattori.

1319
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,333
I'm near Saint Vith,
do you read me?

1320
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:58,625
We've been attacked by Neuroi,

1321
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:01,500
and Ensign Miyafuji has
been seriously injured.

1322
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:03,458
Again, this is Sergeant Hattori.

1323
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:06,916
I'm requesting emergency
medical aid. Do you copy?

[static]

1325
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,291
Why won't they respond?

1326
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,458
Please, someone, we need help!

1327
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,500
[HATTORI]
What is this?

1328
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:19,333
Maybe whatever it is, is what
they're using to jam the signal.

1329
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:20,375
[grunts]

1330

[YOSHIKA grunts, pants]

Please, just hang on
a little longer, Yoshika.

1333
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,458
I promise, I'll be right back.

1334
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,208
Minna, are we getting close?

1335
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:51,500
This is it.

1336
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,958
The center of all the
recent enemy activity.

1337
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:54,916
Be on alert!

1338
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,125
Roger that.

1339
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,166
Especially since we
still have no signal.

1340
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,625
Sir, do you think
the enemy might

1341
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:01,291
be causing this interference?

1342
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:02,833
[BARKHORN]
Yes.

1343
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:04,333
Most likely they're trying to
keep us isolated to cut off

1344
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,583
our supplies and
catch us off guard.

I hope Yoshika's okay.
Please be okay.

That antennae of yours
is our only hope.

We're really counting on you.

1348
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:18,875
[gasps] Yes... sir.
I will not let you down.

1349
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:20,625

This is Sergeant Hattori.

[SCHNAUFER]
Wait...

1351

There's too much interference.

1355
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:28,708
I'm not sure.

1356
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,500
Just a little higher.

1357
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,375
I need to get above the Neuroi.

1358
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:36,750
Then I should be
able to get a signal.

1359

Anyone! Come in! Do you read me?

This is Sergeant
Shizuka Hattori, over.

But with the Neuroi,
it's not safe.

I have to find them.
I need to hurry.

It's Yoshika!

How'd she do it?

She couldn't. There's no way!

anything can happen.

was gonna be okay.

How did they know they
were needed in the Rhine?

1420
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,375
I guess they broke
through the interference.

1421
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,875
How did they get this far south?

1422
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:06,208
They're insane!

1423
01:21:06,291 --> 01:21:09,250
[SAKAMOTO laughs] When one
of my own is in trouble,

1424
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,208
I'll do whatever it takes.

1425
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:12,916
I know that voice!

1426
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,833
[PERRINE]
It's Major Sakamoto!

1427
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,208
[MINNA]
Mio!

1428
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,708
[SAKAMOTO] I did what I
had to in order to keep her

1429
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:21,833
off the river bottom.

1430
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:23,958
[HARTMANN]
I don't know about that.

1431
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:26,666
[EILA]
Hey! Good to see ya!

1432
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:29,041
[LYNNE]
Eila! Sanya!

1433
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:34,458
[HARTMANN]
Um, guys? We got a complication.

1434
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:38,250
[SHIRLEY]
Yahoo!

1435
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,166
[FRANCESCA]
Let's do this!

1436
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,250
[BARKHORN]
Shirley! Lucchini!

1437
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:43,541
Just like old times!

1438
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,000
[SAKAMOTO]
Hey, Minna!

1439
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,000
I've got a little
surprise for Yoshika.

1440
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:48,708
I need you to cover me.

1441
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:52,625
Yes, sir. Battle
Formation immediately.

1442
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:55,500
We will cover the Major
and show the enemy no mercy.

1443
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,291
They need to know who we are!

1444
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:59,333
[WITCHES]
Roger!

1445
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,208
No. There's no way!

1446
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,250
They're really gonna
take them on?

1447
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,833
Time to sturm!

1448
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,166
Tonnerre!

1449
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,833
Are you ready
for this, Francesca?

1450
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,166
Born ready!

1451
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,416
[SHIRLEY]
Combine!

1452
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,500
[LYNNE]
Huh?

1453
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:24,041
[LYNNE screams]

1454
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:50,916
Wow! They did it!

1455
01:22:53,541 --> 01:22:55,000
They're here!

1456
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:58,583
[MINNA]
Looks like more are on the way!

1457
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:00,750
[BARKHORN] And we're
gonna take 'em all down!

1458
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:06,875
You won't be getting past me!

1459
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:10,416
[SHIRLEY yelling]

1460
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:14,916
[SHIRLEY]
You're going down!

1461
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:34,666
[SAKAMOTO]
Incoming!

1462
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:37,416
It's Major Sakamoto!

1463
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,250
Got something for ya!

1464
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,500
[gasps] The Shinden...

1465
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:09,541
I missed you.

1466
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:12,166
I wish I could be a Witch again.

1467
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,125
I just wanna fight
alongside them.

1468
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:17,500
I would give anything.

1469
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:22,625
If I could fly... one last time.

1470
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:35,583
Take off!

1471
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,791
[laughing]

1472
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:48,375
[LYNNE]
Yoshika!

1473
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,666
Hello, Lynette!

1474
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:55,166
I don't think so!

1475
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:04,708
[LYNNE, YOSHIKA giggle]

1476
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:06,708
You're back! I'm so happy!

1477
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:08,958
I am, too! Can you believe it?

1478
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:10,375
Oh, honestly.

1479
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:13,875
I don't think she's ever
gonna stop being so reckless.

1480
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,750
Yoshika's got her magic back!

1481
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,958
[SHIRLEY]
Now, that's more like it!

1482
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:20,541
[SCHNAUFER] We gotta know
how you did that, Yoshika!

1483
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:24,125
[SHIRLEY] Yeah! What
changed to make it happen?

1484
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:25,791
I'm not really sure.

1485
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:28,708
I just remember hearing
all of your voices

1486
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:31,000
and knowing that I
wanted to help, too.

1487
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:32,791
I wanted to fight
alongside you guys

1488
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,041
one more time.

1489
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:38,208
[BARKHORN] Hey. Yoshika.
If you wanna fight...

1490
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:39,916
...then you're gonna
need one of these.

1491
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,375
[gasps]

1492
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,833
Right!

1493
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:47,708
[gasps] Where's Shizuka?
Is she okay?

1494
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,958
[SCHNAUFER]
Sergeant Hattori is fine.

1495
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:50,875
[gasps]

1496
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:52,625
[SAKAMOTO]
Yoshika, look up.

1497
01:25:58,166 --> 01:26:00,458
It's good to see you, Yoshika.

1498
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:04,875
You saved me. Thank you.

1499
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:07,916
[SAKAMOTO laughs]
It's good to have you back.

1500
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,208
It suits you.

1501
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:12,000
Being up here in the sky,
back with your unit.

1502
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,916
It's where you belong.
Welcome home.

1503
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,666
Thank you, Sakamoto.

1504
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,666
Lieutenant Colonel Minna!

1505
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24,041
I've got a mission
for you, Yoshika.

1506
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:25,750
Are you ready?

1507
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:26,916
Yeah!

1508
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:46,166
[HARTMANN]
That's a pretty big Neuroi.

1509
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,208
[BARKHORN] It must be
the enemy's mother ship.

1510
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:50,250
[MINNA]
All right, Formation Julius.

1511
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:53,875
Our target is the giant
Neuroi dead ahead.

1512
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,166
[ALL]
Roger!

1513
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:39,958
Amazing.

1514
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:42,083
That's the 501st
from the stories.

1515
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,125
Yes, they are.

1516
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:45,083
Also known as
the Strike Witches.

1517
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:46,250
Major...

1518
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:48,208
How was Ensign Miyafuji
able to fly again

1519
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,833
and get her magic back?

1520
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:52,541
A Witch's magic can
work in mysterious ways.

1521
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,500
And when it comes to
the power of genuine love

1522
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:57,458
and real friendship,
anything can happen.

1523
01:27:57,541 --> 01:27:59,125
Friendship?

1524
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:04,458
Maybe someday. Maybe...

1525
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:07,458
I hope that one day I'll be able
to fly with friends like that.

1526
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:12,833
[laughs] I know you will.

1527
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:27,125
The core is revealed.
Witches, fire on my call.

1528
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:35,791
What do we do now, Minna?

1529
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,083
[LYNNE]
Yoshika, wait!

1530
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:40,041
[BARKHORN]
What are you doing?

1531
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,833
I'm gonna take him down.

1532
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,250
Okay, everyone, deploy shields.

1533
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:47,083
Follow Ensign Miyafuji.

1534
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:48,458
[WITCHES]
Yes, sir!

1535
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:55,958
Are they crazy?

1536
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:57,625
Pay close attention.

1537
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,041
This is what makes
them legendary.

1538
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:01,791
The mark of true Witches.

1539
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,083
Attack!

1540
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:32,583
[gasps]

1541
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,083
[HATTORI]
You did it!

1542
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:46,916
Huh?

1543
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,416
You really saved us, Ensign!

1544
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,916
Shizuka!

1545
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:58,250
You know, you really don't
have to call me that, right?

1546
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,833
Right. Got it, Yoshika.

1547
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,333
[SCHNAUFER]
Lieutenant Colonel.

1548
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,416
I've just received word
of enemy movement.

1549
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,625
HQ has detected Neuroi
ships heading toward

1550
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,583
the Karlsland border.

1551
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:26,083
You all heard her. Let's move!

1552
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,458
It's up to us to take
down this new threat.

1553
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:30,333
We must work as a team,
follow our instincts,

1554
01:30:30,416 --> 01:30:31,750
and stick together.

1555
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:35,000
I think it's time for the
501st Joint Fighter Wing,

1556
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:37,708
the Strike Witches,
to be reinstated.

1557
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:38,791
What do ya say?

1558
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,291
[WITCHES]
Yes, sir!
