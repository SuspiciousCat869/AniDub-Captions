"Sengoku Basara"
"Recap"


2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,208
It was a turbulent era of
warlords vying for supremacy.

3
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:32,500
Warriors bent on conquest raised
their battle cries all across the country.

4
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,458
The one closest to conquering the country

5
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,458
was the Devil King of the
Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga.

6
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:42,458
Nobunaga ruthlessly destroyed
those who would stand in his way.

7
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,666
And he made no exception,

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,000
even for his younger sister, O-Ichi,
and her husband, Azai Nagamasa.

9
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,291
Through the actions of the Oda Army,

10
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,333
fear and carnage spread
across the land of the rising sun.

11
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:59,666
Meanwhile, there was the
One-Eyed Dragon of Oshu, Date Masamune,

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,333
and a young Takeda warrior
of Kai, Sanada Yukimura.

13
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,791
These two, who recognized
each other as worthy rivals,

14
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,333
set out for Azuchi in order
to bring Nobunaga down.

15
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,541
The Azuchi Castle will
be the Devil King's grave!

16
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,583
We absolutely cannot hand over our
future to a compassionless general!

17
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,666
All we will offer him are prayers for the dead!

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,333
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

19
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,625
And throwing their support behind these two,

20
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:28,000
warriors from other lands
converged on Azuchi in great numbers.

21
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:33,291
From Oshu, Masamune's most
trusted vassal, Katakura Kojuro.

22
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,208
From Kai, the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen,

23
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:42,833
and Shingen and Yukimura's
trusted ninja, Sarutobi Sasuke.

24
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:47,041
From Echigo, the War God, Uesugi Kenshin,

25
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,333
and his devoted female ninja, Kasuga.

26
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,708
Furthermore,

27
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,250
through the agency of the vagabond
of the Maeda family, Maeda Keiji,

28
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,458
mobilizing from the west,
came Chosokabe Motochika

29
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,541
and Mori Motonari. With their cooperation,

30
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,208
the encirclement of the Oda was complete.

31
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,250
You finish this.

32
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,500
I shall, though it may cost me my life.

33
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,416
With the aid of the other lands,

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,708
Masamune and Yukimura
succeeded in slaying Nobunaga.

35
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,083
After the fall of the Oda

36
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,791
came one who advocated for a
strong and prosperous country.

37
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,125
A warlord who plotted to
make incursions out into the world.

38
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,750
Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

39
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,583
He and his strategist, Takenaka Hanbei,

40
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,291
brought turbulent times
down upon them once again.

41
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,833
Masamune faced the
Toyotomi's overwhelming strength

42
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,750
and though he suffered a defeat,

43
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,458
he set out for Osaka in order
to make a triumphant comeback.

44
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,666
And under orders from Shingen,
who sensed the threat of the Toyotomi,

45
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,458
Yukimura took a military expedition westward.

46
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,083
Though their paths differed, these
two acting to bring down the Toyotomi

47
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,416
--Master Oyamada!
--overcame numerous trials and tribulations,

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,625
--Master Oyamada!
--and each followed the path that he believed in.

49
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,083
And when the Toyotomi were
about to put the finishing touches

50
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,875
on bringing the country under their rule,

51
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:23,458
Mori Motonari, who was allied with
the Toyotomi, moved to attempt a coup.

52
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,541
As the situation threatened
to grow even more chaotic,

53
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,291
Yukimura, with the Satsuma Army at his back,

54
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,541
successfully obliterated this menace.

55
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,250
Meanwhile, in the land of Odawara,

56
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,333
Masamune engaged Hideyoshi in mortal combat

57
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,708
--No limit!
--and just barely managed to emerge victorious.

58
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,625
Blast off!

59
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:49,791
With this, the turbulent times
appeared to come to an end,

60
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,666
but the Toyotomi's demise summons
the maelstrom of war for a third time.

61
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,666
Two men who served under Hideyoshi.

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,291
One, who seeks to rule the country

63
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,583
with his faith in the bond that
people share, is Tokugawa Ieyasu.

64
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,625
The other, who seeks to avenge
Hideyoshi's death against Masamune,

65
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,541
is Ishida Mitsunari.

66
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,041
And amidst the tangle of ambitions

67
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,416
of Masamune, Yukimura,
and generals from other lands,

68
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,875
the greatest battle these
warring states had ever seen

69
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,541
was about to begin!

70
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:27,541
"End"


71
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:40,125
With the Oda destroyed and the
end of the Toyotomi era heralded,

72
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,958
the ravages of the many wars

73
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,666
brought upon the world of man
sorrows and regrets innumerable.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,583
At times, this turned the
souls of those left behind

75
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,458
into a field of carnage burning with hellfire,

76
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,291
cruelly trapping what should
have been humble destinies

77
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,041
and twisting them.

78
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,000
And here, too, was one such soul.

00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,375

Here I had thought it was a large

If anything, you must take
this as a favorable turn of events.

some lucky tea stalks floating upright.

You haven't changed at all, old man Fox.

who can get the Dragon all fired up!

Cool off.

154
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,791
You won't defeat me with hatred.

155
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,333
Raise your own banner first.

156
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,125
Then, we'll talk.

00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,500
The country can go rot for all I care!

159
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:05,375
My greatest wish is nothing
short of making you cease to live!

160
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,250
If you want to mourn that
wild monkey boss that badly,

161
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,916
go visit his grave or something.

162
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,083
You blackguard!

163
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,958
How dare an evildoer go even further

164
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,166
and insult Lord Hideyoshi
by calling him vulgar names?!

165
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,875
Keep it up.

166
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,375
Why you!

167
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,291
Accept your execution at my hands!

168
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,833
You will not get away with it!

169
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,625
I will not let you get away
with the crime you committed!

170
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:44,416
Date Masamune!

171
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:55,666
"Bi"


172
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,375
You have been all that I
expect of my lifelong archrival.

173
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,166
I admit complete defeat, Tiger of Kai.

174
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,875
Thanks to you,

175
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,333
this half of my life has been
filled with a sense of purpose.

176
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:12,083
You have my heartfelt gratitude, Kenshin.

177
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:20,291
I shall entrust the future
of Echigo to the Tiger of Kai.

178
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,916
You are all to put your faith in this
man and make every effort to serve him.

179
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,666
Is that understood?

180
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,958
My lord!

181
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,750
Bear close witness, Yukimura.

182
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:45,500
Someday, such a time will
likely come for you as well.

183
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,166
Yes, Sir!

184
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:57,250
This is goodbye, my beautiful blade.

185
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,333
Farewell, Kenshin.

186
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,875
Lord Shingen!

187
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,208
That is...

188
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,333
...Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu!

189
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,958
You must not sever this bond, Lord Shingen!

190
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,333
Lord Tosho...

191
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,875
Is that you, Takechiyo?

192
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,500
I am sorry I have not kept in touch.

193
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:45,958
You have grown so much.

194
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,916
I had thought so, but...

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,291
Even then, you are still a large man.

196
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,333
I am glad to see that you
are looking better than ever.

197
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,291
You look well, Sanada Yukimura.

198
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,625
It has been a long time, Lord Ieyasu.

199
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,416
Today, I have come to relay my intentions

200
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,000
to none other than you, Lord
Shingen, and you, Lord Kenshin.

201
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,166
I, Tokugawa Ieyasu,

202
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,250
have hardened my resolve to
unite the land of the rising sun

203
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,875
with the strength of the
bonds that people share!

204
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,333
"This will be the last time."

205
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,583
All have said so and all have believed it.

206
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,583
And thus, to this day, we have done
the same thing over and over again.

207
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,000
But no matter who comes to rule this country,

208
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,916
someone else is sure to appear

209
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,708
to plunge the world into
the chaos of war once again.

210
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,791
This world where those who believe
in the future cannot live the future...

211
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,708
I want to end it this time, once and for all!

212
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,583
Therefore, you have led the way yourself,

213
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,458
removing your headpiece
and discarding your spear.

214
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,583
Indeed.

215
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,041
Rather than that the time is finally right,

216
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:03,083
what you are saying is that
we can no longer afford to wait...

217
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,416
That is exactly right, Lord Shingen.

218
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,041
Waiting any longer is the same
as wishing for this country's ruin.

219
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,000
Rather than the time being right,

220
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,875
one could say that we
have nearly missed our chance.

221
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,375
Tiger of Kai and War God of Echigo,

222
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,791
the two of you share a deep bond.

223
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,333
If you would work hand-in-hand
and lend me your support,

224
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,666
nothing would be more heartening!

225
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,250
Ieyasu,

226
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,541
I understand how you feel,

227
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,500
but I doubt there are
any who would heed you.

228
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,708
It is true.

229
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,791
If it were easy to gain support for this cause,

230
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,833
everyone would have done so
from the start instead of going to war.

231
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,666
The only two who have listened to me

232
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,125
are the Maeda vagabond, who came
to see me after hearing some rumors,

233
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,250
and the Ogre of the Western Sea.

234
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,541
But even so, I...

235
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,041
M-My lord!

236
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:20,125
Then show me that you can make it so.

237
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:27,708
Thank you, Lord Shingen. Lord Kenshin.

238
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,208
Let us meet again, Sanada.

239
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,916
My lord!

240
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,708
What do you want?

241
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,833
Takeda's territory is expanding and
I am about to become busier than ever.

242
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:08,166
There is a matter that
I wish to bring to you, my lord!

243
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,541
Speak.

244
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,208
Yes, Sir!

245
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:16,916
Since returning from my journey
to Satsuma and my battle with Mori,

246
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,791
I have felt something lurking in my heart.

247
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:25,333
But it was nothing more
than an elusive, vague feeling

248
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,833
and I struggled to put it into words.

249
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:32,916
And yet, Lord Ieyasu
expressed it through his very actions!

250
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,041
You are soft, Yukimura.

251
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,875
I must beg your forgiveness.

252
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,791
Nonetheless, living in this war-torn world,

253
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,583
everyone has given up on it to begin with...

254
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,333
No, it is something that
no one would even attempt...

255
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:53,125
And Lord Ieyasu is trying to
achieve it with his fists alone.

256
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:58,750
His incomparable resolve has
set my heart hopelessly ablaze!

257
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,125
For the sake of the future,

258
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:11,333
you have trained and honed
your skills with the spears.

259
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,500
Do you claim to be prepared,
as of this day, to put them down?

260
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,166
Yes, Sir!

261
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,041
Yukimura!

262
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,166
Yes, Sir!

263
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,750
For you, that is how...!

264
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,583
Yes, Sir!

265
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,625
That is how it should be, Yukimura!

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,958
My lord...

267
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,333
Now <i>that</i> makes you a real warrior.

268
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,041
After all that you have been through,

269
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,916
that is no longer thoughtless
youthful enthusiasm.

270
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,666
<i>That</i> is the way a true
human being ought to be.

271
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,375
It is the duty of one who clears the way

272
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,041
and forges the future on behalf of all of us!

273
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,750
M-My lord!

274
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,375
Only now that you have been plunged
into the depths of agony many times

275
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,208
and persisted in being a diligent student...

276
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,291
Only now that you have acquired

277
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,500
the spirit, skills, and strength
of a warrior beyond compare,

278
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,291
are you and Ieyasu

279
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,000
capable of attempting to
undertake this. Know that.

280
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,916
I understand, Sir!

281
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
My lord!

282
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,000
Yukimura!

283
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,916
My lord!

284
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,125
Yukimura!

285
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,750
My lord!

286
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,541
Yukimura!

287
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,291
My lord!

288
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,500
Yukimura!

289
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,000
Hold on a second! This is getting dangerous!

290
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,916
My... lord!

291
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,791
Yuki... mura!

292
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,666
My lord!

293
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,250
My lord!

294
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,750
Yukimura...

295
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:56,041
I, Takeda Shingen, have imparted
to you all that I have to impart.

296
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:01,333
You have surpassed the
man who defeated the War God.

297
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:06,791
I have entrusted you, beyond all
doubt, with the spirit of the Tiger.

298
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,958
Yuki... mura...

299
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,666
My lord! My lord!

300
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,000
My lord!

301
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,833
I feel like he could've just settled
this by retiring like a normal lord.

302
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,000
Sasuke!

303
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,166
There's trouble brewing all over the place.

304
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,750
So, I guess I can make my
report to you, Commander?

305
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,083
"Oshu"


306
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,625
Number One.

307
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,875
Lord Masamune!

308
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,708
You ordered us to ready for war
and then left. Where have you been?

309
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,708
The unidentified enemy
force that has set foot in Oshu

310
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,708
must be intercepted before it
gets through Mogami territory...

311
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,041
The enemy was one man, Kojuro.

312
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,000
What?!

313
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,208
One man?

314
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,041
It was no big deal.

315
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,750
I politely asked him to take his leave.

316
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:03,041
He was a guy all worked up,
driven by vengeance. A surviving...

317
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,166
...member of... the Toyotomi...

318
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,041
Lord Masamune!

319
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,500
N-Number One...

320
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,291
Number One...

321
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,291
Number One!

322
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,166
Have you tired of your
meandering stroll, Mitsunari?

323
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,125
Date Masamune...

324
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,250
I do not mind being belittled myself.

325
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,875
However,

326
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,875
carving up the bastard who
slighted Lord Hideyoshi with impunity

327
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,958
would be meaningless!

328
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,458
Through my presence,

329
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:39,458
he further profaned the
memory of Lord Hideyoshi!

330
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:43,750
I must vindicate his honor
before I execute that bastard!

331
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:50,041
I doubt many take the words
of strangers to heart as you do.

332
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,958
Whatever it is you wish to say,
speak briefly and plainly, Gyobu.

333
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,500
There is no knowing what foul
trick the One-Eyed Dragon used

334
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,958
to send the Elder Regent to his grave,

335
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:03,500
but declaring that he would not
fight a man who has no army at his back

336
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:07,458
may have been an
expedient excuse. That is all.

337
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,750
You may have failed to bring him down,

338
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:12,541
but you sensed your superiority
and that sense must remain with you.

339
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,458
Are you unable to put stock in that?

340
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:18,750
If that were true...

341
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,958
Then it would be even more unforgivable!

342
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:26,791
It would mean the brazen weakling
played Lord Hideyoshi for a fool!

343
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:31,916
You need not go to the trouble of
leading an army to face a weak man.

344
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,041
Better to prod your opponent to
act and wait for him to come to you.

345
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,791
I would make the preparations.

346
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,166
I will leave it all to you.

347
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,666
Do you not wish to hear the stratagem?

348
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,583
I have no reason to question your actions.

349
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,041
Fine, understood.

350
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:52,875
All for the sake of master and justice.

351
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,083
"All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony"


352
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,875
Lord Masamune, you must
not move so vigorously yet.

353
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:34,416
Did you find out who that bastard was?

354
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,916
Yes, Sir.

355
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,666
Ishida Mitsunari.

356
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,583
After he attempted to invade Oshu on his own,

357
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:44,291
it appears he is now leading
an army, attacking various lands.

358
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,958
I am told he not only kills soldiers,

359
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,791
but mercilessly slays the
people, who are unarmed.

360
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:53,541
After which, he leaves his
banner behind as if to flaunt it.

361
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,541
Wholesale murder, huh?

362
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:59,041
Generals everywhere are
now nervous and terrified.

363
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:02,125
Reports say they fear
and abhor Ishida Mitsunari,

364
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,416
referring to him as
"The Great Malevolent Sansei."

365
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,625
Kojuro.

366
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,083
Yes, Sir.

367
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,291
I'm going out there to defeat Ishida.

368
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,625
That time, I threw up a
smokescreen with empty talk.

369
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,583
I, the One-Eyed Dragon,

370
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:22,708
tucked my tail between my legs
and fled in the face of the enemy!

371
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,000
It just means that the world is vast.

372
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,500
Eh?

373
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,083
There was the assassin driven
by the need for vengeance

374
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,166
and then there was the way
you assessed and dealt with it,

375
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,208
by retreating instead of fighting needlessly.

376
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,708
As the man carries the
weight of Oshu on his shoulders,

377
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:42,083
it is entirely consistent with your duties.

378
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:46,916
I did criticize you for acting
rashly and going alone, but...

379
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,333
Thanks to that, this land
has escaped devastation

380
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:53,833
and both the soldiers and the people
carry on with their days as always.

381
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,875
Never ever think

382
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:01,875
that only one who has mastered
the sword can rule the country.

383
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,083
There is not the slightest reason

384
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:08,500
that you should feel
responsible for Ishida's later deeds.

385
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,333
I'm the one who baited him,

386
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,708
telling him to come
again under his own banner.

387
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:17,208
I have to finish what I started there.

388
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,375
In that case, just one thing.

389
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,333
Next time, I will not let you go alone.

390
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:37,541
The Great Malevolence, huh?

391
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,708
It's true, that bastard was crazy.

392
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,291
But...

393
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:50,583
What was with that clarity in his eyes?

394
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,958
The force believed to be the Ishida Army

395
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,000
had just begun its covert maneuvers,

396
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,916
but in the meantime, in the hopes of
advocating to generals from all lands

397
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,500
and bring about the end of this
era of war as quickly as possible,

398
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:10,916
Tokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Keiji,
and Chosokabe Motochika

399
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,166
were about to set out on an
all-out cross-country circuit.

400
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,666
Ieyasu.

401
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:31,250
Why do you make no move to avenge
Lord Hideyoshi's death with me?!

402
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,958
How could you think no more of the
kindness Lord Hideyoshi showed you

403
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,000
and leave the Toyotomi?

404
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:39,458
Lord Hideyoshi was too obsessed with strength.

405
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:44,083
If the Toyotomi had gone on to take
the horrors of war out into the world,

406
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,666
an even greater number
of people would have died

407
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,958
and been consigned to sorrow.

408
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:52,750
You were by their side
and what did you even see?

409
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:56,500
Lord Hideyoshi worked to keep
the land of the rising sun from ruin!

410
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:59,083
To protect this country's pride!

411
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:03,458
That is why he tirelessly
fought and sought to grow strong!

412
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,291
Listen to me, Mitsunari.

413
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:09,375
I have seen examples set by
more great men than anyone else.

414
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,750
And there is something I have learned.

415
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:15,958
Ironic as it is, that
something wasn't valor in arms.

416
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:21,000
One's strength is there to remain unused.

417
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,916
Strength for the sake of
protecting the bonds that people share.

418
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,500
Strength that you acquire and hone
single-mindedly, never to be used.

419
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,250
<i>That</i> is true military might.

420
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:35,000
Of all people, that is what I should
have relayed to Lord Hideyoshi.

421
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,166
And that I did not is my crime.

422
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,166
It may have kept Lord Hideyoshi from his death.

423
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,291
Do not be so conceited, Ieyasu!

424
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,791
Your pompous preaching disgusts me!

425
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,125
You are not Lord Hideyoshi!

426
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,583
What can you possibly
accomplish with your bare fists?!

427
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:58,250
Face my sword stained with
bitter tears and show me that!

428
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,750
I came to talk to you, Mitsunari!

429
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:06,583
As my friend, I want
your understanding first!

430
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:09,541
I have nothing to discuss with you.

431
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,708
I have no friends!

432
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,208
Why do you think so?

433
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:16,916
Just as Lord Hideyoshi had
Lord Hanbei, you also have...

434
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,541
Do not speak of them so lightly!

435
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,125
The bond between Lord
Hideyoshi and Lord Hanbei

436
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,375
was so deep, no mere
mortal could ever comprehend!

437
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,666
That's right! A bond!

438
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,041
Those two shared a deep bond.

439
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,666
So did Lord Hideyoshi and Keiji.

440
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,833
Maeda Keiji...

441
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:39,208
His was the act of folly to stand in the way

442
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,291
as Lord Hideyoshi set out for Odawara.

443
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,083
He deserves a thousand deaths for that!

444
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,875
Such supreme self-righteousness!

445
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:47,916
I will execute him after Date Masamune!

446
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,208
I do not believe so!

447
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:53,458
Keiji's act of placing his faith in the
bond he shared with Lord Hideyoshi

448
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,416
is an example for us all
to live by in the future!

449
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,291
Do not glorify someone
who defied Lord Hideyoshi.

450
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,750
Do not speak of Lord Hideyoshi as the past!

451
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,375
Lord Hideyoshi was the
one who should have lived on,

452
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:11,916
clearing the way to the future with his
strength, and forging what was to come next!

453
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,708
Lord Hideyoshi was everything to me!

454
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,458
Mitsunari!

455
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,125
I refuse to engage in further dialogue.

456
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,583
That man who stole away Lord Hideyoshi...

457
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,000
I will never let him get away with it.

458
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,250
I will hold the whole world responsible

459
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,541
for trying to consign
Lord Hideyoshi to oblivion!

460
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,333
A beautiful field of flowers...

461
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,875
Once I get lots of flowers to bloom,

462
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,625
he said something
really wonderful will happen.

463
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:09,875
So Ichi will work hard to get them to bloom.

464
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,583
My brother is smiling, too.

465
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,083
He must be happy.

466
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,500
This is so good.

467
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,916
Yes.

468
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,333
Let us gather more and more, Lady O-Ichi.

469
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:44,333
I-I'm scared, Venerable Tenkai.

470
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,291
You are so easily frightened, Kingo.

471
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,208
You will be fine as long as you
chant some prayers to Amitabha.

472
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,333
If it's prayers, you chant
them, Venerable Tenkai.

473
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:53,958
You're a priest, aren't you?

474
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,375
Not to worry.

475
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,916
I will hold a service for them all later.

476
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,958
Is all going to plan?

477
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,583
D-Don't scare me like that, Otani!

478
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,875
Everything will be ready shortly.

479
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,208
How are things on your end?

480
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,708
Mitsunari says he does not question me.

481
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:18,416
You must be ever so friendly
with the Great Malevolence.

482
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,833
Trust is not something one comes by easily.

483
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:27,083
The things I do are bound
to be in his interest as well.

484
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:31,875
It is merely that Mitsunari
does not question this.

485
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,750
Lady O-Ichi, the Devil
King of the Fifth Heaven,

486
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,500
and Ishida Mitsunari, the Great Malevolence...

487
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,583
For the purposes of
the true feast that I crave

488
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:43,375
and the ruin that you desire,

489
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:46,250
they are the best instruments one could ask for.

490
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,666
For the finishing touches,

491
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,000
we have Kingo here.

492
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,791
What?!

493
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,291
Okay.

494
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,833
Just wait for us, Number One!

495
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,333
Number One!

496
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,958
Let's shake it up!

497
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,375
Yoshinao?!

498
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,291
Hey...

499
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,625
Y-Yoshinao...

500
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,333
Where did you hit yourself?

501
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,333
A c-crow?

502
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:37,916
What?!

503
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,500
Hey, long time no see.

504
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,166
Keiji!

505
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,125
What are you doing here?

506
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:47,541
I'm here for a quick visit
with the One-Eyed Dragon.

507
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,375
Is he doing good?

508
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,208
Number One says he's going to finish
what he started with Ishida Mitsunari.

509
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:55,000
We're about to go chase after him.

510
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:58,458
Once we defeat Ishida, we're
going to go take down Tokugawa, too!

511
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,500
What?

512
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:03,000
Number One feels responsible.

513
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,875
The Ishida Army's rampaging all over the place

514
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,375
and now, even the
Tokugawa are getting in on it...

515
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,125
I've heard the rumors, too,

516
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:15,000
but there's no way Ieyasu
would do something like...

517
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,666
Hey, what's that you
got stuck in your head?

518
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,333
Huh?

519
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,333
Wh-What's that doing there?!

520
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,833
This is...

521
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:28,666
...a letter addressed to Number One.

522
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,166
It's from Tokugawa Ieyasu!

523
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,875
What?!

524
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,583
I'm going to take a quick look.

525
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,833
Oh, wait!

526
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:37,750
But uh, that's...

527
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,125
It's addressed to Number One...

528
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,916
That's a bad idea!

529
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:44,666
This is...!

530
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,041
"I am Tokugawa Ieyasu.

531
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,666
I am someone who sincerely
wishes to rule this country

532
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,750
with the strength of the bonds we share.

533
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:57,000
I have traveled the length
and breadth of the entire country

534
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:00,000
and advocated to all the
value of the bonds people share.

535
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:06,458
But unfortunately, not one
would take me up on my proposal.

536
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,458
No matter how much the
frequent wars have sapped our strength

537
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:15,708
and how many times we experience
the grief of losing loved ones,

538
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,583
in this land of the rising sun

539
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:22,041
there are none who will put
their faith in the strength of bonds.

540
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:25,666
The reality of that fact has
become painfully clear to me now.

541
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,916
Therefore, I have no choice
but to change my methods.

542
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,750
Though it pains me,

543
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,875
it is precisely because
I refuse to compromise my ideals

544
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:36,083
that I have decided to resort to force.

545
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:40,000
Ishida Mitsunari is currently
on an unfettered rampage

546
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:44,541
and I believe you now see that the
Tokugawa are capable of the same.

547
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,250
Perhaps this land of the rising sun,

548
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,875
filled with people too
small-minded to work hand-in-hand,

549
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:54,791
would be better off being destroyed
along with the brutal Ishida Army.

550
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,291
Such are the thoughts
that I have begun to entertain.

551
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:03,500
However, I also know
that this is too rash of me.

552
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:07,458
So, I would like to speak with
all of you just one more time.

553
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12,708
To that end, I want you to all
gather at dawn on September 15th

554
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:16,541
at Sekigahara in Mino.

555
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,125
To every warrior who fears for the
future of the land of the rising sun,

556
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,416
where we were born and raised.

557
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,750
Tokugawa Ieyasu."

558
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:31,958
I still find it impossible that Lord
Ieyasu would commit such violence!

559
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:35,416
After he toured the various
lands trying to reconcile the country

560
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,291
and got completely ignored,

561
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,541
maybe he decided on brute force, after all.

562
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,583
That's the rumor going around.

563
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:44,375
Well, you'd normally find it fishy, right?

564
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:47,791
Suddenly bringing up shared
bonds and stuff in this day and age.

565
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,083
That is not true!

566
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,375
No...

567
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,000
Regrettably...

568
00:39:56,083 --> 00:40:00,000
I can imagine that thoughts along
those lines must be all too common.

569
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,333
But that does not mean that
Lord Ieyasu would do such a...

570
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:07,875
The brushstrokes on this
letter are a dead ringer, but...

571
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,500
There's something about this that smells...

572
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,166
It is definitely suspicious.

573
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,458
That is why...

574
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:17,250
No, it's kind of a tasty smell, actually...

575
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,041
Like the smell of hot pot or...

576
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,500
H-Hot pot?

577
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,166
What bothers me is that

578
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,708
the ninja squads I dispatched to
various areas haven't spotted a thing

579
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:35,333
and yet, the sneak attacks
keep happening over and over.

580
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:38,333
No one has seen a likely force on the move,

581
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:43,583
but some place is attacked and
overrun practically every night.

582
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:47,708
Do they have some unprecedented weapon?

583
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:52,250
Either way, I cannot believe it is
something Lord Ieyasu would do.

584
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,083
Lord Masamune!

585
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,791
Long time no see.

586
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,958
Where are you going looking
all worked up, Sanada Yukimura?

587
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,416
It has been a long time.

588
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,916
I am currently on my way
to see Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu.

589
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,958
It's so like you to be
driven by moral indignation.

590
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,250
I hear he's grown pretty formidable.

591
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,416
You just watch yourself over there.

592
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,375
Oh, no, that is not it...

593
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,583
I'm off to break things up for Ishida Mitsunari.

594
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,750
I was going to turn
right back around after that,

595
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,750
but if that's the case,
I'll leave Ieyasu to you.

596
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,166
Lord Masamune...

597
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,125
I heard you've taken over for old man Tiger.

598
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,583
Indeed.

599
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,083
Excellent.

600
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,708
Once we've each taken care of business,

601
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,791
let's throw a party to settle
things while we're celebrating.

602
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,666
I would like nothing more than
to settle the matter between us.

603
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,291
However, on this occasion, it is
not my mission to destroy Ieyasu.

604
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,416
Eh?

605
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,083
I am going in order to make certain.

606
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:00,625
That the one devastating other
lands, as if to imitate the Ishida Army,

607
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:05,333
and making veiled threats to bring
us generals together at Sekigahara

608
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:08,125
is not Lord Ieyasu.

609
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,708
Sekigahara, you say?

610
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,750
There's something I want
to check on with Ishida, too.

611
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:18,750
Though, either way, it won't
change the fact that we'll be fighting.

612
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,166
Let's meet again,

613
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,333
Sanada Yukimura.

614
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,625
Come to think of it,

615
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:54,833
this is where you and
I fought for the first time, isn't it?

616
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,500
You are right.

617
00:42:57,583 --> 00:43:02,375
How about it? What do you
say to settling things right now?

618
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,041
What are you say...

619
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,041
Lord Masamune!

620
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:11,958
If we hadn't met in this place,
I could've resisted the urge, but...

621
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:17,125
In my beef with that bastard,
there's no cool or hot.

622
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,833
One of us will win and one of us will die!

623
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:23,208
It's a death match dripping with animosity!

624
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,083
Had no choice!

625
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:28,291
That's why I want to
have this fight with you now!

626
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,875
Sanada Yukimura!

627
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:34,541
Lord Masamune...

628
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:39,625
Commander!

629
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,166
If I do not accept, it will
surely become a lifelong regret!

630
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,416
That is what my instincts tell me!

631
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:41,041
Death Bite!

632
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,333
Great Wheel!

633
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,666
Who are you?!

634
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,958
What's the big idea, vagabond?!

635
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,791
What are you two doing out here?!

636
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:55,791
The country's fate hangs in the balance!

637
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,958
Sorry, but this is none of your business!

638
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,458
Move aside!

639
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:02,625
I know full well I'm butting in.
But I'm not backing down.

640
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,541
Please do not interfere!

641
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,583
Whoa-oh!

642
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,333
Shit!

643
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,000
Heads up!

644
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,583
I understand how you feel,

645
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:33,750
but this is as far as it
goes for you two right now.

646
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:39,000
You are...

647
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,416
I'm Maeda Keiji.

648
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,166
This guy here's Yumekichi.

649
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,041
You're the one who always gets the
One-Eyed Dragon looking all keen.

650
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:48,125
Sanada Yukimura of Kai.

651
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:49,541
Isn't that right?

652
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,250
How about it?

653
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,166
Until the murkiness hanging over
this country gets all cleared up,

654
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,541
what do you say to letting me
declare this match postponed?

655
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,208
Oh, that's right.

656
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:07,458
To me, you're always the goal at the end.

657
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:10,958
And I'd almost forgotten about that.

658
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,416
You've got my thanks, softie.

659
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:17,375
What a refreshingly plainspoken gentleman!

660
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:20,250
I shall wait, Master Maeda.

661
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,166
Lord Masamune.

662
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:26,208
"Lord Date Masamune"


663
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,125
"Lord Date Masamune"
So this is the letter you were talking about.

664
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,166
"Lord Date Masamune"
Looks like I don't need to read it.

665
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,791
I just have to go to Sekigahara

666
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:39,083
to find out what's going on
right now, who's behind it, and why.

667
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,208
Sounds like the plan
that'll get me everything.

668
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,958
Yeah, probably.

669
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:46,833
Chosokabe Motochika, who should
be traveling around out west about now,

670
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:49,083
and Ieyasu should both
be rushing over there, too.

671
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:53,583
Sounds like it's going
to be one hell of a party.

672
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,916
If that Ishida bastard's the ringleader,

673
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,750
I'll get to straighten things
out smack in the middle of it all.

674
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,416
Number One.

675
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:03,125
Here...

676
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,916
What's this?

677
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,416
All of us in the Date Army
discussed it and we want you to use it.

678
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:16,541
You may get angry,

679
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,125
but we got permission from
Master Katakura and made it in a hurry.

680
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:24,625
The old blacksmith was real stern
about giving us his stamp of approval,

681
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,875
so it took us longer than we wanted, but...

682
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:29,625
This is for your fight with Ishida...

683
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,833
The Great Malevolence, Ishida Mitsunari...

684
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:38,000
Is he <i>that</i> powerful?

685
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,833
--Number One!
--Number One!

686
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,416
Please accept it!

687
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:45,583
Lord Masamune.

688
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,958
Lord Masamune, your life...

689
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:50,750
...is the life of everyone of Oshu!

690
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,750
Not bad.

691
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:19,250
It's a cool accessory. I'll be wearing it.

692
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:27,875
♪ The girl comes and it's dark as under roots. ♪

693
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:32,333
♪ Backs ashiver and hearts clutched close. ♪

694
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:36,916
♪ Devouring the innards
are the roots that are his. ♪

695
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,416
Um, O-Ichi?

696
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,625
♪ Moans of the dying, so like flowers. ♪

697
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,875
W-Want some hot pot?

698
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:49,208
♪ Open your gates, land and shrine of roots. ♪

699
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,916
Kingo.

700
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:57,208
I have unfortunate news.

701
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:59,500
Huh? What? What is it?

702
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:02,291
Everyone has found out

703
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:06,291
that you forged those letters
in Tokugawa Ieyasu's name.

704
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:07,916
What?!

705
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,541
The generals are quite angry

706
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,708
and once they reach Sekigahara,

707
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:16,500
it seems they have decided to
kill Kobayakawa Hideo first thing.

708
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:19,458
I-Is that true?! It's not, right?!

709
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:24,291
I did like you said, Venerable Tenkai,
so everyone would get along...

710
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:29,666
I know your desire for peace better than anyone.

711
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:34,750
But warriors driven by anger are
beyond the control of a mere priest.

712
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,750
G-Get it in your control!

713
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,208
I feel sorry for you that
they will gang up on you

714
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,875
and torture you to death,

715
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,500
but I doubt that you can avoid it.

716
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,291
D-Don't say that!

717
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:51,583
Well, let me think...

718
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,375
Why not treat them to some hot pot?

719
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,625
This endless darkness...

720
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:08,625
Though I may carve death into his flesh,

721
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:11,416
it will never be banished.

722
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,083
What awaits me there is
unvarnished nothingness.

723
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:19,666
My second death!

724
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,041
Mitsunari.

725
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:31,333
Wield your strength to your heart's content.

726
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:36,416
Let us pry open the world together!

727
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:53,125
Are you ready, guys?!

728
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,833
Yeah!

729
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,750
Don't slack off!

730
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,000
Step on it!

731
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,750
Yeah!

732
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:02,458
All right, let's ride on!

733
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:05,541
Yeah!

734
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,375
Ishida Mitsunari,

735
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:11,833
if you really are the one
waiting in the middle of all this,

736
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:15,500
this time, I'll be the one
to hold you responsible!

737
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,958
Uh, um...

738
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:45,625
Well...

739
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:56,583
Th-They're all mad!

740
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:03,625
I-I'm scared! What should
I do, Venerable Tenkai?!

741
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,250
Ieyasu...

742
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:17,875
Kingo, so it was you.

743
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,958
I'm sorry, Ieyasu. I...

744
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,166
I see. It's okay, Kingo.

745
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,333
I know you didn't mean any harm.

746
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,833
So don't be scared anymore.

747
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:33,541
You watch the pot for me.
Let's serve it to everyone.

748
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:35,666
O-Okay!

749
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,125
I am Tokugawa Ieyasu!

750
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,166
I am grateful to you for
responding to my appeal

751
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,833
and for gathering here today!

752
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,500
Thank you!

753
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:57,750
Everyone gathered here

754
00:52:57,833 --> 00:53:01,583
has personally witnessed two
great powers, the Oda and the Toyotomi,

755
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:04,458
and how frightful they were.

756
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:08,750
And I believe it is now carved
deep in our bones that military might

757
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:11,125
is something that severs
the bonds that we share.

758
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,666
Ieyasu...

759
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,458
I see!

760
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:17,958
Only those who demonstrate their
strength rise to power and survive.

761
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:19,750
That is our war-torn era.

762
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:23,625
But at that rate, the fighting will never end.

763
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:30,208
We have seen the downfall of those
who rely only on their strength, twice!

764
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,833
There shouldn't be anyone
here who wields their strength

765
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:35,208
in the hopes of engineering their downfall!

766
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,666
I'm Maeda Keiji of Kaga!

767
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:42,791
Do you know why you all are so strong?

768
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,666
It's to protect your sweethearts.

769
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,333
Having the homeland you grew up in

770
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:49,041
and the priceless things
you value taken from you...

771
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,250
How about we put a stop to all that?

772
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:57,666
I am Sanada Genjiro Yukimura
of the Takeda of the land of Kai.

773
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,791
I have been on numerous battlefields

774
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:04,458
and I have fiercely crossed
swords with countless warriors.

775
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,166
The end to which warlords
bring to bear their valor in arms...

776
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,166
The thing they have their sights
set on after the country is theirs...

777
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,250
That, for everyone alike, is peace.

778
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:16,666
With the hearts of true warriors,
devoid of private ambitions or greed,

779
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,208
let us join together with
Lord Ieyasu and Master Maeda

780
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:22,916
and seize this moment to
speak in earnest of the future!

781
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,458
Sanada...

782
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,750
Let us protect the bonds we already share

783
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,166
and forge new bonds

784
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,958
with our former foes and
those who were unknown to us,

785
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,666
and grow from there.

786
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,625
Come, let us all share Kingo's hot pot

787
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,041
and speak of a world at peace.

788
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,708
--Sanada Yukimura...
--Maeda Keiji of Kaga, huh?

789
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:45,666
It's the Tiger of Kai...

790
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:14,916
Wait!

791
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,583
Hold up for one second!

792
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,291
Before we do this,

793
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:23,750
let's get to the bottom of who was
leading all those raids everywhere!

794
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:42,166
Ishida Mitsunari...

795
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,458
It's the Great Malevolence!

796
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,750
It's the Great Malevolent Sansei!

797
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,125
Mitsunari, I've been waiting for you!

798
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:52,250
Come over here and you
talk to everyone for me, too!

799
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,708
Do as you please. Do not draw me into it.

800
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:58,458
A true shared bond is a miracle.

801
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:01,583
The resentment and hatred of
one who has been robbed of that joy

802
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:05,541
will never be erased by the kind of
sugarcoated words that you spew!

803
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,125
"All for One, One for All, for Peace and Harmony"


804
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,500
Mitsunari!

805
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,333
So you <i>were</i> in collusion after all!

806
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:32,250
We've been deceived by Tokugawa and Ishida!

807
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,541
Why you! We almost fell for it!

808
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,416
Hold on! That's not how it is!

809
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,375
What foolishness.

810
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:04,750
Bonds are nothing more than invisible threads.

811
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:07,666
Man cannot help but quarrel with one another.

812
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,125
To fight this natural
order is the act of a fool.

813
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:14,875
To all of you pawns who have
gathered here at Sekigahara,

814
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:19,208
cut down every last unfamiliar face you see!

815
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,000
Anyone with a different banner is your enemy!

816
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:24,375
Be the last one standing
and the country will be yours!

817
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:28,875
This is the battle that shall
determine the fate of the country!

818
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:32,958
That is Mori Motonari!

819
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:36,333
I am not one to be slain
by a mere sacrificial pawn.

820
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:39,125
I see! If I survive to the end...

821
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,083
...the country will be mine!

822
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,166
Mine...

823
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:08,750
That Mori. He is an unexpected agitator.

824
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:11,958
Thanks to him, the
battlefield will churn even more.

825
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:17,083
I have made the preparations, so
feel free to kill as you please now.

826
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,875
You have my gratitude.

827
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:31,000
Go. Onward.

828
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,125
Commander, we can't keep
fighting defensively anymore!

829
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,291
Sanada Yukimura!

830
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:39,041
I guess it was a momentous decision
for you to take part in this gathering,

831
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:41,041
but it's time to accept reality!

832
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:44,750
What will you do as the
general of your own army?!

833
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:02,958
To eradicate the root of all evil,
here and now in Sekigahara...

834
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,166
To every man in the Takeda Army!

835
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,166
I order you to fight back!

836
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,500
Understood!

837
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,833
Good!

838
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,666
This isn't giving up.

839
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:22,666
Even if you get hacked apart
once or twice, if you're serious...

840
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:26,333
Live through it and take up the struggle again!

841
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:28,625
That is exactly right, One-Eyed Dragon.

842
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:31,916
And when that time comes, join us.

843
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,833
Too bad for you, I don't like making nice.

844
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:37,708
I'll probably end up
fighting with you, too, someday.

845
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:41,416
When that time comes,
I will face you with these fists!

846
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:45,541
I, Tokugawa Ieyasu,

847
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:49,083
will not let the land of the rising
sun become a deserted country!

848
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:54,166
It's to protect our bonds and ties of love.

849
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:59,708
I guess I'll treat myself to
a little contest of strength!

850
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:00,541
Kojuro.

851
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,625
Yes, Sir.

852
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:03,291
Men!

853
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,000
Date Masamune.

854
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:16,291
What ignoble means did you
employ to murder Lord Hideyoshi?

855
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:18,250
Ishida Mitsunari.

856
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,833
What about you?

857
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,250
How many innocents did you
drag into your vendetta against me?

858
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,416
What's the big idea
with this crazy free-for-all?

859
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,541
Such things do not matter!

860
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,916
I will hold responsible any who
think no more of Toyotomi's influence!

861
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,125
And especially any who dishonor it!

862
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:38,208
So the only successor he's got
is this one miserable bastard.

863
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:40,958
That boss monkey's totally
got to be rolling in his grave!

864
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:44,333
Recant every last bit of abuse
you heaped upon Lord Hideyoshi!

865
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:47,208
I will hear no other words from you!

866
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:55,083
Repent and die!

867
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,291
Hell or Heaven!

868
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:02,083
X-Bolt!

869
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:06,791
Be carved to pieces!

870
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,250
With this, they will all
die at each other's hands.

871
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:16,625
Mori's entry into the battle was a
most unexpected stroke of good luck.

872
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:20,375
His intent was a surprise attack,
when in fact, he is helping us.

873
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:23,541
Even the exceptionally clever general
does not seem to have noticed this.

874
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:30,041
The Great Malevolence's bitter hatred
for those who have forgotten Toyotomi

875
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,583
and Tokugawa Ieyasu's honorable idealism,

876
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:36,583
wishing for peace for the
whole of the land of the rising sun.

877
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:39,333
These choicest, unadulterated ingredients

878
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:42,083
look like they will make a tasty hot pot.

879
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:46,166
The one who whisked it
all together is my puppet,

880
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,666
Lady O-Ichi, the Devil's younger sister.

881
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,958
Wh-Who's this woman?

882
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:09,500
Mitsunari, you must be happy as well.

883
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:13,541
You declare that you will hold
this entire world responsible

884
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:17,375
and to your eye, this must
truly be a transcendent sight.

885
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:21,458
A-Are we really going to get peace this way?

886
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,541
Mori!

887
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:29,416
You bastard! Long time no see!

888
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,041
Inciting an uproar and aiming
to profit from the sidelines, eh?

889
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:38,541
Your methods are dirty as ever! Eh, Mori?!

890
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:44,166
Hurling insults at your adversary,
while beaming joyfully like that...

891
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,916
Chosokabe,

892
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,875
have you become a different person
in the time that I have not seen you?

893
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:51,875
I'll temporarily return the land of Aki to you!

894
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:57,166
I'll beat you into the ground
here and take it back all over again!

895
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:00,958
Return it and all will be fine.

896
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,708
After your demise,

897
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,208
Shikoku will surely become
Aki's distant little island.

898
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:07,791
Keep yapping, you bastard!

899
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:24,458
You tarnished Lord Hideyoshi's rule!

900
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:28,958
You stole from me the
one and only light in my life!

901
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,083
Hang your head before Lord Hideyoshi!

902
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,541
Beg and plead for forgiveness!

903
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:36,750
And then,

904
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,916
be beheaded!

905
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:46,291
Once you're done with this revenge,

906
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,708
what will you raise your voice for then?

907
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:51,583
Come at me with everything you've got!

908
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:55,083
This is your climax!

909
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:23,791
What?!

910
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,166
What is the matter, Gyobu?

911
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,041
Pay me no mind.

912
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:52,791
I realized that even those
who have died once can die again

913
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:56,333
and I was merely struck by that impermanence.

914
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:01,708
Why... you...!

915
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,666
If you've died once, then all the more reason!

916
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,458
Bring that strength to bear to live your life!

917
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:18,791
I'll bring that death wish of yours to an end!

918
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:25,041
Jumping Jack Breaker!

919
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:58,958
What do you think you are doing, Ieyasu?

920
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:01,750
Both hatred and anger...

921
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:05,375
The cure to both things is bonds, Mitsunari.

922
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:08,416
I believe... you...

923
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,708
I told you not to be conceited.

924
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:14,541
I did not ask you to help me.

925
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:18,791
Go die... in some ditch... somewhere...

926
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:26,541
Don't say things like that...
so lightly, Mitsunari...

927
01:06:33,666 --> 01:06:35,791
Look at that, Gyobu.

928
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:40,166
The Great Malevolence has finally
been dragged into Ieyasu's farce!

929
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:50,250
As an appetizer to the feast,
I could not have asked for anything better.

930
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:23,333
Let's all make them bloom.

931
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:27,333
Look. Not much longer now...

932
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:45,041
You guys, watch out for those black hands!

933
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:47,458
Don't touch them!

934
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:55,500
Curse that Kingo. Blathering on needlessly.

935
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:59,541
The venerable Tenkai said that it
was to unite everyone's hearts as one!

936
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:02,458
He said sacrifices had
to be made for that and...

937
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:07,958
He's a priest, so I thought
what he said was right, but...

938
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:11,708
In the end, I think it's wrong!

939
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:24,541
It looks like you were too late, Kingo.

940
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:28,666
These black hands look familiar!

941
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:33,833
Lady O-Ichi...

942
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:19,250
What the hell is that?

943
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:26,791
Moans of the dying, so like flowers.

944
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:32,583
--Open your gates, land and shrine of roots.
--Open your gates, land and shrine of roots!

945
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:20,708
I have awakened and returned!

946
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:26,583
Offer up all that you have and bow your heads!

947
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:29,583
Rejoice!

948
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,750
Followers of...

949
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:38,750
...foolish greed!

950
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:02,875
The Devil King of the Sixth Heaven...

951
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,833
Is that... Oda Nobunaga?!

952
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:08,833
We haven't seen him in a while.

953
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:11,041
I don't know who cooked this up,

954
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:15,666
but it looks like someone used you
guys to get this surprise party going.

955
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,833
So... it was all for this?

956
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:27,541
To all, I say, regale me and do your duty!

957
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,791
He's got unbelievable power...

958
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:47,583
It is incomparable to before...

959
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:57,666
Putrescence drawn up by the
black hands of the Fifth Heaven

960
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,875
will form the Devil King's
new flesh and blood

961
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:05,208
and blanket this world
in death and destruction.

962
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:06,916
With this,

963
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,291
all people will be equally reduced
to worms writhing in the dark abyss.

964
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:22,291
Stop this...

965
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:26,000
I absolutely refuse to permit your savagery.

966
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,625
At this rate,

967
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:31,666
the world that Lord Hideyoshi
aspired to rule will be destroyed!

968
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:39,125
Lord Hideyoshi's dream...
Lord Hanbei's hope...

969
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:43,291
I will not let the likes of you erase them!

970
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:50,208
A grasping monkey and
his tail without a cause.

971
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:56,791
Such frail souls, not
worthy of eternal scrutiny.

972
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:06,375
Revering a feral monkey
obsessed with strength is supreme folly.

973
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,166
Hup!

974
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:24,958
Useless fools!

975
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:51,458
You will never... get away with this!

976
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:56,375
The rightfully abhorred Devil King...

977
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:58,708
I will not let the likes of you...

978
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:01,541
...take Lord Hideyoshi's...

979
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:06,166
May you be reduced to ashes!

980
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,625
Impertinence!

981
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,583
Gyobu! What are you doing?!

982
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,625
Why are you here?!

983
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,375
Get back!

984
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,125
Get back, Gyobu!

985
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:41,708
You need not suffer any more!

986
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:51,458
Know it to be futile!

987
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:00,208
Gyobu!

988
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:07,041
I had not realized until this very moment...

989
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:09,250
So, the way you saw me

990
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:16,083
was the same as the way I saw you...

991
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:23,541
That no one in this world
could be more unfortunate.

992
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,333
A hilarious circumstance...

993
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:33,916
Gyobu!

994
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:35,750
Gyobu!

995
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:39,000
I will not permit you to die!

996
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:45,083
Gyobu!

997
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,791
What a clichéd way to make amends.

998
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:53,166
In the end, it turns out that you
were a mere mortal as well, Gyobu.

999
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,750
Mitsunari, take a good look at Nobunaga!

1000
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,166
During Toyotomi's era...

1001
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,791
In the eyes of the people, how Lord Hideyoshi...

1002
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:06,625
How <i>we</i> appeared to them!

1003
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,833
It cannot be...

1004
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,625
Those are...

1005
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:42,666
Are they the Devil King's roots?

1006
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:47,166
So those countless black hands
serve as the Devil King's roots?

1007
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,916
The Devil King has not
been fully resurrected yet!

1008
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,333
If we cut him off while we still have time...

1009
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:53,833
Kojuro.

1010
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:56,041
Understood.

1011
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,708
Good hunting.

1012
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:02,583
Sasuke, I place you in
charge of the Takeda Army.

1013
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:04,041
Roger that, but...

1014
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:07,166
Do I get paid for being second in command?

1015
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,291
Now's our only chance.

1016
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,583
I'll leave the rest to you, Kojuro.

1017
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:28,333
My lord, please forgive me.

1018
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:32,166
I, Yukimura, am going to
sacrifice myself for this country.

1019
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:36,750
Toshi, Matsu, I wish you happiness forever.

1020
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:42,166
With faith that everyone will forge
their own bonds after I am gone...

1021
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:59,166
Wind, Forest, Fire, Shadow,
Mountain, Lightning, Water!

1022
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:02,458
Smile, pale dawn of the east!

1023
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:06,541
Snatch and cherish tousled hair!

1024
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:19,791
It's the One-Eyed Dragon!

1025
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,333
Oh, I can finally fight to the death with you,

1026
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:56,250
Lord Nobunaga.

1027
01:19:06,416 --> 01:19:10,708
I cannot be destroyed...

1028
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:15,625
For I am already destroyed.

1029
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:23,666
Ichi.

1030
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,083
Do not run away, Ichi.

1031
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:29,250
Now is the time to pay close attention.

1032
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,208
My lord... Nagamasa?

1033
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:39,041
Why, Lady O-Ichi, you were still here?

1034
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:42,083
You played your role well.

1035
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:47,708
I, Tenkai, shall deliver
you to the depths of Hell.

1036
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:54,041
Huh?

1037
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,083
Oh?

1038
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:04,000
Um, am I...

1039
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:05,875
...shifted to one side?

1040
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:06,916
Yes.

1041
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,166
P-Please wait one moment...

1042
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,333
Don't...

1043
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:18,541
Don't eat me!

1044
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,458
I am not tasty!

1045
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:23,083
Oh, but not there...

1046
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:27,958
Eat that... last!

1047
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:36,583
A Devil has fifty years!

1048
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,708
Lord Hideyoshi...

1049
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:48,791
For the unsightly death I am about to die...

1050
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:52,833
I beg for your permission!

1051
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:03,000
The crime in the blade,
the atonement in the sheath!

1052
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,333
Mitsu... nari...

1053
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:19,500
I felt not the slightest irritation!

1054
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:40,500
Now is the time for atonement, Ichi.

1055
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:44,125
You are the only one who can do this.

1056
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,125
My lord Nagamasa...

1057
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,500
Brother...

1058
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:06,375
Lady O-Ichi!

1059
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:12,916
The Devil King's... younger sister?

1060
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,375
Come to sleep with Ichi.

1061
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,916
Keraku...

1062
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,041
You simpleton...

1063
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:28,125
Ichi will stay by your side forever.

1064
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:51,375
Wh-What comfort I feel in these arms...

1065
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:56,375
This was inevi--

1066
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,375
You guys!

1067
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:21,791
Tadakatsu!

1068
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:25,166
Hey!

1069
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:04,666
Do not forget your crime of
robbing Lord Hideyoshi of his future.

1070
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:07,458
If you ever expose yourself
to be the unsightly little snake,

1071
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,000
I will execute you whenever that may be.

1072
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,875
Refusal will not be tolerated.

1073
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:13,666
Excellent.

1074
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:16,291
It'll give me more things to look forward to.

1075
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:20,083
So you are Maeda Keiji.

1076
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,333
Yeah.

1077
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:24,250
I have a request.

1078
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:29,458
What is it? If it's anything
I can do, just name it.

1079
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:33,000
Someday, I want you to tell me the story

1080
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:36,083
of the Lord Hideyoshi I never knew.

1081
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:45,833
Sure. Any time. No problem.

1082
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,875
Lord Ieyasu.

1083
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:51,791
What is it, Sanada?

1084
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:55,541
If I were unable to carry out
my resolve upon this occasion,

1085
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:59,375
it had been my intention
to relinquish the title of Tiger.

1086
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:03,541
Thinking that perhaps the one who
was truly worthy in the next generation

1087
01:25:03,625 --> 01:25:05,625
to succeed the spirit of the Tiger was you...

1088
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:10,041
I have always looked up to
Lord Shingen as my teacher in spirit.

1089
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:12,125
And I will continue to do so.

1090
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:13,916
But you are different.

1091
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,083
The bond you share with Lord Shingen

1092
01:25:16,166 --> 01:25:19,375
is probably thicker than
blood, something deeper.

1093
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:21,875
I want you to put your heart and
soul into carrying out your duties

1094
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:24,958
and pass it on to the next Tiger after you.

1095
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:28,000
Very well.

1096
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,250
Mitsunari.

1097
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:34,708
I will wish for you and I

1098
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:39,458
to someday unite the country with
the strength of the bonds we share.

1099
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:43,291
Carrying on the ideals of someone
for whom you feel undying respect

1100
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:46,625
is also a precious bond.

1101
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,791
I will take no part in collusion.

1102
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:51,583
That is so like you.

1103
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:58,625
Then how about we settle this with brute force?

1104
01:26:00,916 --> 01:26:03,083
Fine.

1105
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:06,916
Let's treat ourselves to the
party we've been waiting for, too,

1106
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,833
Sanada Yukimura.

1107
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:12,916
There is nothing I would like better.

1108
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,833
Good luck.

1109
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:24,500
Farewell.

1110
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:32,041
All right, everyone, this is the
honest-to-goodness last big fight!

1111
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:36,041
No hard feelings now! Let's settle this!

1112
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:44,166
You're tougher than I thought, Mori.

1113
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,666
Foolishness.

1114
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,375
Strategy and valor in arms.

1115
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:50,958
There is no way I am lesser
than you in any of those areas.

1116
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:52,791
Putting up a front, eh?

1117
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:55,458
You can't wait to be put out of your
misery. It's written all over your face.

1118
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:58,000
I'll settle this for you with my next move!

1119
01:26:58,083 --> 01:27:01,500
I imagine a pirate would be
happy to go to a watery grave.

1120
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:05,000
Turn that anchor of yours into a
grave marker at the bottom of the sea.

1121
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:19,833
The battle between the
warlords continued without end.

1122
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:31,208
Lord Hideyoshi. Lord Hanbei.

1123
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:34,375
For the brash act I am about to commit,

1124
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:36,416
I beg for your permission!

1125
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:41,958
I will carry your teachings in
my heart for the rest of my life!

1126
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:46,541
Will the one to emerge
victorious on this battlefield

1127
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:48,750
become the supreme ruler of the warring states?

1128
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:52,291
Or will these turbulent times still not end,

1129
01:27:52,375 --> 01:27:54,875
even after this battle
upon the field of Sekigahara?

1130
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:57,083
Let us forge bonds, Mitsunari!

1131
01:27:57,166 --> 01:28:00,291
I know that you will be able to
forge stronger bonds than anyone!

1132
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:03,041
Because you are capable of loving
someone with your entire heart

1133
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:05,708
and risking your life for them.
So I'm certain of it!

1134
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:10,166
Only the bonds shared by these warriors

1135
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:13,125
and their fiery souls know the answer!

1136
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,750
One-Eyed Dragon, Date Masamune!

1137
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:20,958
I will now fulfill the oath
we swore on the summit!

1138
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:23,166
Be satisfied!

1139
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:27,666
Don't let me reach the goal
too easily, Sanada Yukimura.

1140
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:13,916
Unrivaled Spear of World Domination!
Sanada Yukimura is here!

1141
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:20,208
Number One of Oshu,
Date Masamune, pressing on!

1142
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:56,500
<i>Cool and wild suit a</i>
<i>bewitching night under a hazy moon</i>

1143
01:29:56,583 --> 01:30:01,083
<i>In devouring grace,</i>
<i>I'm as good as any out there</i>

1144
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:04,541
<i>For the trigger, snap your fingers</i>

1145
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:07,208
<i>Send up a flare or nothing gets started</i>

1146
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:11,750
<i>Chasing down, getting in too deep, I'm done for</i>

1147
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:17,625
<i>My way of life, drawing blades</i>

1148
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:23,125
<i>Even casts the shadow behind me in darkness</i>

1149
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:33,000
<i>Pitched forward, sober, I invited,</i>
<i>"Don't be cheap, show me the future"</i>

1150
01:30:34,291 --> 01:30:39,541
<i>Party On! Burning Soul!! It's priceless</i>

1151
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:44,708
<i>There's no end to the festival burning up</i>

1152
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:50,166
<i>Let's Dance! Warriors!!</i>
<i>Straight up, the world's going to hell</i>

1153
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:55,541
<i>Super flashy means</i>
<i>business, right? On the rise</i>

1154
01:30:55,625 --> 01:31:00,916
<i>The one to master the decisive battle wins</i>

1155
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,916
<i>Keep the party going</i>

1156
01:31:13,791 --> 01:31:16,458
<i>I'm prepared for what's to come, but...</i>

1157
01:31:16,541 --> 01:31:19,250
<i>Every last one of them's way too desperate</i>

1158
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:23,791
<i>Looks likely my destiny'll get tied up,</i>
<i>too, so I brace for a different fate</i>

1159
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:35,250
<i>I see myself in the rich colors</i>
<i>and briefness of the burning sunset</i>

1160
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:40,083
<i>From the back of an unruly horse</i>

1161
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:45,083
<i>The tail's to the east, which way is tomorrow?</i>

1162
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:51,541
<i>Party On! Burning Blood!!</i>
<i>I dream a lasting dream</i>

1163
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:56,833
<i>Drunk on awakening, I can't stop</i>

1164
01:31:56,916 --> 01:32:02,250
<i>Let's Dance! Warriors!!</i>
<i>Let them get away with it this time</i>

1165
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:07,291
<i>Sitting back and watching, I make a mistake</i>

1166
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:12,958
<i>At the decisive battle, I grab on to a burning hot</i>

1167
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:17,083
<i>Shooting star</i>

1168
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:41,458
<i>With my way of life, drawing blades</i>

1169
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:46,250
<i>Show me the passing time!</i>

1170
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:52,833
<i>Party On! Burning Soul!! It's priceless</i>

1171
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:58,000
<i>There's no end to the festival burning up</i>

1172
01:32:58,083 --> 01:33:03,416
<i>Let's Dance! Warriors!!</i>
<i>Straight up, the world's going to hell</i>

1173
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:08,875
<i>Super flashy means</i>
<i>business, right? On the rise</i>

1174
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:14,041
<i>Party On! Burning Blood!!</i>
<i>I dream a lasting dream</i>

1175
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:19,375
<i>Drunk on awakening, I can't stop</i>

1176
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:24,708
<i>Last number one!! Don't hold back this time</i>

1177
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:30,208
<i>Radiant enough to embrace the era</i>

1178
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:35,416
<i>The one to master the decisive battle wins</i>

1179
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:42,291
<i>Keep the party going</i>
