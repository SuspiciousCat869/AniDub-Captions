[Kiwa] Pretty, isn't it?

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.936 position:19% line:83% align:start
The flowers bloom even
with no one to tend to them.

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.906 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm so excited to
finally live out here.

Goodness.

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:45.980 position:13% line:83% align:start
You really outdid yourself
getting this place ready.

00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.454 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:57.625 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's actually pretty nice.

[Kiwa] In the old
days, this end of the house

00:05:59.861 --> 00:06:02.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
probably would've
had built-in stables.

00:06:12.874 --> 00:06:14.709 position:24% line:89% align:start
All right, you two.

00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:15.843 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come sit down.

[creature howls]

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.517 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that a wolf?

00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:25.987 position:30% line:89% align:start
Never you mind.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.890 position:24% line:83% align:start
I promise there are
no wolves around here.

00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:30.591 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now, come sit with me a moment.

00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:36.197 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now, starting
today, the three of us

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.165 position:7% line:89% align:start
will build new lives together.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.034 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm very glad you came.

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.069 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks, I guess.

00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:53.114 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all right.

00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:55.616 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't force yourself to speak.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.685 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just rest, and you'll
recover before you know it.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:02.023 position:30% line:83% align:start
To that point,
go grab your bags and relax.

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:04.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll need your help
with something in a while.

What's your name?

00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:45.252 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, never mind.

Hey, everyone!

We have some provisions here,
courtesy of Senda Foods!

Some of the packaging
is a little damaged,

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:34.135 position:33% line:83% align:start
but the food
inside is perfectly fine.

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:36.337 position:13% line:89% align:start
There we go. Gather round.

00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:48.282 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you want?

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:49.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
Apologize to that girl.

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.452 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I don't
take orders from children.

[inhales sharply]

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:56.991 position:33% line:89% align:start
There, there.

00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:57.825 position:19% line:89% align:start
You all right, darling?

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Hey, what happened?
- [man grunts]

00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:05.266 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now let's get you dried off
before you catch a cold, huh?

00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're just about
soaked to the bone.

00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:10.771 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tanaka, will you get
a towel for this young lady?

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:12.239 position:27% line:89% align:start
You got it!

00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:15.809 position:24% line:89% align:start
Such a sweetheart.

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:17.444 position:13% line:89% align:start
I feel bad that she's mute.

00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:20.714 position:41% line:77% align:start
- Huh?
- More accurately,
she lost her voice.

00:11:20.748 --> 00:11:23.050 position:27% line:83% align:start
Poor thing's been
through terrible trauma.

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:25.252 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her parents died in
a car wreck around New Year's,

00:11:25.286 --> 00:11:27.288 position:10% line:89% align:start
and she hasn't spoken since.

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:29.056 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not a single word.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.726 position:7% line:83% align:start
She had just come to live with
some relatives in this area,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.096 position:19% line:83% align:start
but then the earthquake
hit and well, you know.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.499 position:33% line:83% align:start
She showed up
here all on her own.

Uh, thanks.

00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:58.819 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now then, Hiyori.

00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:00.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you excited to
get back to school soon?

[woman]
Yoshi, could you lend me a hand?

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.260 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:10.931 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, you're a high
school student, aren't you?

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.068 position:7% line:83% align:start
Have you gotten to put yourself
down for registration yet?

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:16.036 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, no. I...

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.771 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's your name, hun?

00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:19.541 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you staying
with family or...

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:21.275 position:35% line:83% align:start
- I'm not.
- Where do you live?

00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:23.811 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be
somewhere you call home.

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:26.013 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know
what? I'm actually fine.

00:12:26.548 --> 00:12:28.749 position:41% line:83% align:start
- Wait.
- Oh, she's with me.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:30.117 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm her grandma.

00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:32.119 position:30% line:89% align:start
Her name is...

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:37.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, it's not Akemi,
and I know it's not Sanae,

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.893 position:7% line:89% align:start
it's one of those trendy names.

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:42.930 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Yui] Yui.
- Ah, there we go.

00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:44.398 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yui, I knew that.

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:46.800 position:21% line:89% align:start
And this little one.

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:48.202 position:24% line:89% align:start
Really? Hiyori too?

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.137 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's right, Hiyori too.

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:52.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
[woman] You're really
her grandmother, ma'am?

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.141 position:30% line:89% align:start
Of course I am.

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:56.076 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why else would
I have come to pick her up?

00:12:57.111 --> 00:13:00.047 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've had to go through
so much at such a young age,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.082 position:7% line:89% align:start
but you've never once given up.

00:13:02.116 --> 00:13:03.250 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm very proud of you.

[gentle music]

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.056 position:19% line:89% align:start
They are my grandkids,

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:11.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it's our first time meeting.

00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.561 position:30% line:83% align:start
And my memory's
foggy these days,

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:16.063 position:30% line:83% align:start
so it can take
a while for names to sink in.

00:13:16.864 --> 00:13:20.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, shall we get going?
Get your things.

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:23.003 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but may
I ask your name first?

00:13:23.037 --> 00:13:25.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I'm Kiwa Yamana.
- [woman] And you live...

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.276 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's a place ready and
waiting for us in Kitsunezaki.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.878 position:7% line:89% align:start
We'll discuss the details soon,

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:34.448 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I think it's
going to be wonderful.

00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:42.524 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you girls are all alone,
know you have a place with me.

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:47.161 position:13% line:89% align:start
Never you mind, all right?

00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:50.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
It just means don't worry, dear.

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.833 position:35% line:83% align:start
Looks like
it stopped raining too.

I was just going
with the flow before,

but can we trust this old lady?

[Kiwa] Yui, Hiyori.

00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:17.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
Could I trouble you ladies
to follow me for just a moment?

[metal clangs]

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:22.129 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why? What for?

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.399 position:27% line:83% align:start
At least tell us
where we're going.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.875 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ugh! Here.

[Kiwa] For today,
just cut up to the well,

00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.313 position:7% line:89% align:start
then go clean the halls, okay?

with your change of

Don't forget, you still
have to do move out paperwork

you're not in school?

[Yoshi] Hello, hello.

00:36:00.494 --> 00:36:02.262 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi Yoshi!

00:36:02.295 --> 00:36:04.666 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm glad to see
you looking so well, Yui.

Are Grandma
and Hiyori doing okay?

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.435 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Yui] Uh, yeah.

00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:10.705 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's wonderful to hear.

00:36:10.738 --> 00:36:13.708 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to get going,
but please remind your grandma

00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:15.475 position:13% line:89% align:start
about the paperwork for me.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.577 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Yoshi] Take it easy.

00:36:20.414 --> 00:36:22.650 position:33% line:83% align:start
Is the house
treating you all right?

00:36:22.684 --> 00:36:23.651 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know it's quite old.

00:36:23.685 --> 00:36:25.419 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it's great.

00:36:25.452 --> 00:36:27.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
My great-grandfather
used to live there, you know.

00:36:27.655 --> 00:36:29.456 position:10% line:89% align:start
It had quite a bit of damage,

00:36:29.489 --> 00:36:31.993 position:27% line:83% align:start
but Kiwa had some
repairs done here and there,

00:36:32.026 --> 00:36:33.795 position:41% line:83% align:start
and now
she says it's good as new.

00:36:33.828 --> 00:36:34.996 position:33% line:89% align:start
Repairs, huh?

00:36:35.029 --> 00:36:36.496 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, you're all right?

00:36:36.531 --> 00:36:37.999 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm kind of the land lady,

00:36:38.032 --> 00:36:40.500 position:24% line:83% align:start
so please do let me
know if you ever need my help.

00:36:41.002 --> 00:36:43.004 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you. We're all good.

of the way though, huh?

00:36:44.972 --> 00:36:46.206 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you have a bicycle?

00:36:47.307 --> 00:36:49.544 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't, but
the hills would make that

00:36:49.577 --> 00:36:51.012 position:13% line:89% align:start
kind of a nightmare anyway.

00:36:51.045 --> 00:36:52.714 position:35% line:83% align:start

you have your license?

Oh, thanks for this.

00:37:01.022 --> 00:37:02.489 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're good.

00:37:02.523 --> 00:37:04.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
My old man's gone,
and I quit doing deliveries.

- No, I insist.

I insist right back.

So, this will be
your first fox dance?

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.955 position:7% line:89% align:start
We could put her on the flute.

00:39:13.988 --> 00:39:15.857 position:21% line:89% align:start
The flute. Good idea.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:17.024 position:33% line:83% align:start

At the very least, it's bound
to be easier than traveling
on land.

00:51:19.614 --> 00:51:21.281 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's probably
just a little salty.

00:51:21.315 --> 00:51:22.149 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:51:23.751 --> 00:51:25.687 position:7% line:89% align:start
You gave me a fright, my child.

[Kiwa] Hiyori, meet the Kappa
of the Sarugaishi River.

00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:44.237 position:38% line:83% align:start
- Hello!
- [Kiwa] The Shizukuishi River.

00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:45.840 position:38% line:83% align:start
- Howdy.
- [Kiwa] The Kitakami River.

00:51:45.873 --> 00:51:47.407 position:35% line:83% align:start
- Regards.
- [Kiwa] The Kozuchi River.

00:51:47.441 --> 00:51:49.443 position:44% line:83% align:start
- Hi.
- Toyosawa River here.

00:51:49.476 --> 00:51:50.845 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I'm from the Mabechi River.

00:51:51.613 --> 00:51:52.412 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:51:53.748 --> 00:51:56.551 position:30% line:83% align:start
This little one
is my granddaughter, Hiyori.

00:51:56.584 --> 00:51:59.486 position:21% line:83% align:start
It seems she's unable
to use her voice these days.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.457 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry to hear that,
but don't worry too much.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you just take it easy,
it'll be back in no time.

00:52:23.578 --> 00:52:26.313 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kiwa] You see those
three openings down there?

00:52:26.346 --> 00:52:28.783 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's a fourth cavern
just to the left of them.

00:52:28.816 --> 00:52:30.618 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the entrance
is below sea level,

00:52:30.652 --> 00:52:34.154 position:16% line:83% align:start
so could I trouble you to
poke around inside for me?

00:52:34.488 --> 00:52:36.791 position:38% line:83% align:start
I believe
the original cap is long gone,

00:52:36.824 --> 00:52:38.960 position:30% line:83% align:start
and the shrine
was there to replace it,

00:52:38.993 --> 00:52:41.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
but as you can see,
the shrine was destroyed.

00:52:41.929 --> 00:52:43.865 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah, wiped out by the tsunami.

00:52:43.898 --> 00:52:45.633 position:19% line:89% align:start
I see the problem here.

00:52:45.667 --> 00:52:48.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
You think something
has broken free of its seal.

00:52:48.569 --> 00:52:50.437 position:30% line:77% align:start
- Makes sense.
- All right then,
let's find out.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:51.506 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:52:54.676 --> 00:52:55.843 position:10% line:83% align:start
- [Kitakami Kappa] Let's go!

00:53:04.952 --> 00:53:07.287 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's been a busy
morning, hasn't it?

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.924 position:16% line:83% align:start
I may need both of you to
help me prepare dinner today.

00:53:11.726 --> 00:53:12.960 position:21% line:89% align:start
Were you frightened?

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:18.966 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you know they're not
evil creatures, right, Hiyori?

00:53:22.302 --> 00:53:24.539 position:30% line:83% align:start
No matter what
we look like outside,

00:53:24.572 --> 00:53:25.807 position:19% line:89% align:start
the heart matters most.

00:53:27.709 --> 00:53:29.711 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now, let's go wake your sister.

00:53:31.546 --> 00:53:33.346 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Yui] What exactly
have we been making all day?

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.415 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's almost all cucumbers.

00:53:35.449 --> 00:53:37.484 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, they're
kappa's favorite food.

00:53:37.518 --> 00:53:39.754 position:35% line:89% align:start
What? Uh...

00:53:42.757 --> 00:53:44.759 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, you're in on it too?

00:53:44.792 --> 00:53:45.960 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, what's the end game here?

00:53:47.562 --> 00:53:49.831 position:35% line:89% align:start
[bird caws]

00:54:05.079 --> 00:54:07.715 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Kiwa] Thank
you for your help today.

00:54:07.749 --> 00:54:10.417 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll have dinner after
you wash off the saltwater.

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:13.020 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure being in
the ocean for that long is rough

00:54:13.054 --> 00:54:14.488 position:24% line:89% align:start
even for you guys,

00:54:14.522 --> 00:54:15.590 position:19% line:89% align:start
but I do appreciate it.

00:54:16.456 --> 00:54:18.458 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:54:20.828 --> 00:54:22.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah, there you go.

00:54:22.429 --> 00:54:26.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yui, don't be
afraid, but kappa are real.

00:54:26.067 --> 00:54:28.435 position:19% line:83% align:start
They aren't just things
you hear about in stories.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:30.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
There was something
I wanted them to check on,

00:54:31.005 --> 00:54:32.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I invited them to dinner.

00:54:33.074 --> 00:54:35.009 position:33% line:83% align:start
Keep in mind,
there aren't many humans

00:54:35.042 --> 00:54:36.811 position:16% line:89% align:start
who know kappa are real,

00:54:36.844 --> 00:54:40.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
which means that you and
Hiyori are among a precious few.

00:54:40.915 --> 00:54:43.618 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we're going to be
living together as a family,

00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:46.453 position:10% line:83% align:start
I felt like it would be wrong
of me not to introduce you.

00:54:46.486 --> 00:54:47.955 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:54:47.989 --> 00:54:50.758 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kiwa] I do have to ask that you
don't tell anyone about this.

00:54:50.792 --> 00:54:53.426 position:35% line:83% align:start
But what do
you think? Are you angry?

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.394 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you feel sick?

00:54:55.495 --> 00:54:56.664 position:19% line:89% align:start
You look a little pale.

00:54:59.499 --> 00:55:00.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
How are you, Hiyori?

00:55:00.902 --> 00:55:01.936 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're not scared?

00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:20.320 position:30% line:89% align:start
[calming music]

00:55:21.656 --> 00:55:24.959 position:7% line:83% align:start

then I'm okay with it too.

00:55:28.162 --> 00:55:30.531 position:16% line:89% align:start
What a great big sister.

00:55:30.565 --> 00:55:32.967 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're sincere
and very tenacious.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.036 position:10% line:89% align:start
I really love that about you.

00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:36.737 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now then, back to work.

00:55:40.174 --> 00:55:41.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kitakami Kappa] Coming through.

00:55:41.474 --> 00:55:42.577 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kitakami Kappa]
Sorry for barging in.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:43.811 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Toyosawa Kappa]
I wiped my feet.

[Mabechi Kappa] Yeah, thank you.

00:55:53.921 --> 00:55:56.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kiwa] So you were able to
enter the fourth cave, right?

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:57.424 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, did we ever!

00:55:57.457 --> 00:55:59.627 position:10% line:89% align:start
And man, it's huge in there.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.995 position:13% line:89% align:start
And we're sorry to report,

00:56:01.028 --> 00:56:02.930 position:30% line:83% align:start
it was just as
you feared, Granny.

00:56:02.964 --> 00:56:05.498 position:10% line:83% align:start
We sensed that something had
definitely been sealed there.

00:56:06.033 --> 00:56:07.735 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Mabechi Kappa]
But it must have run off.

00:56:07.768 --> 00:56:09.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
The cavern was completely empty.

00:56:09.904 --> 00:56:12.506 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think you were right about
the function of the shrine too.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.542 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's what
broke the seal in the end.

00:56:14.575 --> 00:56:16.544 position:21% line:83% align:start
All we can do is hope
that thing doesn't hurt anyone.

00:56:16.878 --> 00:56:19.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
Call us again if anything
happens. We'll always help.

00:56:19.714 --> 00:56:21.115 position:33% line:83% align:start
Whoa! What do
you call this stuff?

00:56:21.148 --> 00:56:22.583 position:33% line:89% align:start

own! I'm serious! Give it back!

My kappa-rbonara.

You know,
I've seen these before,

00:56:39.033 --> 00:56:41.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I've never had
the pleasure of trying one.

00:56:41.135 --> 00:56:42.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Toyosawa Kappa] Go eat
a cucumber or something!

00:56:42.737 --> 00:56:44.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kitakami Kappa]
Can say the same to you.

00:56:44.572 --> 00:56:46.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
So who are you really, Granny?

00:56:46.908 --> 00:56:48.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are we even sure
that you're human?

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.779 position:7% line:83% align:start
All the creatures from folklore
are what I call enigmas.

00:56:51.812 --> 00:56:53.748 position:5% line:89% align:start
And very rarely there are humans

00:56:53.781 --> 00:56:56.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
who can truly engage
and communicate with them.

00:56:56.217 --> 00:56:58.418 position:5% line:89% align:start
I fall into the latter category.

00:56:58.886 --> 00:57:01.222 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Toyosawa Kappa] Everybody
shut up. I'm gonna sing a song!

from a school by my river.

something bad happened to you?

[Kiwa] I understand
that you were worried,

01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:23.638 position:13% line:89% align:start
but you do stick out a bit.

01:08:23.671 --> 01:08:25.138 position:21% line:89% align:start
Surely you know that.

01:08:25.472 --> 01:08:27.307 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tanaka] Okay, I get it.

01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:29.409 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't have
to get so mad at me.

01:08:32.847 --> 01:08:34.481 position:10% line:89% align:start
Though as long as we're here,

01:08:34.515 --> 01:08:36.884 position:30% line:83% align:start
where have all
the others come from then?

01:08:36.918 --> 01:08:39.252 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tanaka] There's the Jizo

Nishine and Hanamaki.

The Jizo from Ichinoseki.

the Ikkeijima shrine in Miyagi.

01:08:49.262 --> 01:08:50.464 position:24% line:89% align:start
I think that's it.

01:08:50.497 --> 01:08:52.800 position:38% line:83% align:start
So then,
everyone else is significantly

01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:53.935 position:21% line:89% align:start
smaller than you are.

01:08:53.968 --> 01:08:55.903 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a relief at least.

01:08:55.937 --> 01:08:58.506 position:21% line:83% align:start

01:09:08.616 --> 01:09:09.751 position:41% line:89% align:start

01:09:09.784 --> 01:09:10.885 position:19% line:89% align:start

She said she was
moving to Kanagawa Prefecture,

01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:17.191 position:10% line:83% align:start

01:20:15.115 --> 01:20:17.084 position:21% line:89% align:start

- [Kiwa] I know.

And we'll be here a while,

There's a sense of dread

no matter what.

Some of us have discussed
hiding out in the mountains

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.108 position:10% line:83% align:start

It's too dangerous.

Yes, I promise. I'll be careful.

And all you enigmas
being there too

01:22:00.588 --> 01:22:03.123 position:33% line:83% align:start
would give me
enormous peace of mind.

What do you want to do?

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:45.098 position:41% line:83% align:start
- Huh?
- With your future.

You don't have to answer now.

Let yourself get lost

Eventually, you'll come
across something you can't live
without,

01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:09.990 position:27% line:83% align:start

across this mayoiga.

will last the rest of your life.

It certainly
wouldn't be a surprise.
