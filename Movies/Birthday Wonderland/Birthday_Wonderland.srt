1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,760
(mellow orchestral music)

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,080
(birds chirping)

3
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,990
(calm orchestral music)

4
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,790
- [Akane] The weather's so nice, I almost feel like crying.

5
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,970
I'm gonna drown if keep staring at this big blue sky.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,110
(groans)

7
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,460
- [Midori] Akane, you'll be late for school.

8
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,860
(scratching)

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,470
Did you hear me?

10
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,670
- [Akane] I've got a tummy ache so I'm staying home.

11
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,900
- Oh?

12
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,510
It doesn't seem like you have a fever.

13
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,910
It might be a cold.

14
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,310
Wanna see a doctor?

15
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,750
- No, I'll be fine if I rest.

16
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,850
- Mm, hope you feel better when you wake up.

17
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,200
(phone dings)

18
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,810
(gasps)

19
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,150
(sighs)

20
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,390
- Huh, hairpin?

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,160
- Didn't you get the text that Riya sent out last night?

22
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,730
All of us were going to wear our hairpins to school today.

23
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,390
- Yeah, Riya's mom made them for us by hand

24
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,530
so we thought it made sense to show them off

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,600
at the same time.

26
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,830
- So why did you not wear yours, huh?

27
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,670
Do you hate it?

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,830
- No, I'm telling you,

29
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,070
I stayed at my grandma's house last night

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,770
and left my phone at home so I missed the text.

31
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,840
- Akane, good morning!

32
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,410
- Hey, morning.

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,580
- Oh, good you're wearing it.

34
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm so glad you actually remembered it.

35
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,520
- Yeah.

36
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,750
(bell chiming)

37
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,120
- Seeing all of us wear them like this

38
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,590
makes it feel like we're a hairpin squad.

39
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,490
- Yeah, team hairpin.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
I like the sound of that.

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,730
- The way that the kamineko was portrayed by this writer-

42
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,670
- I really didn't know about the hairpins.

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,940
I wasn't lying, I swear.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,970
So, can you try to convince the others

45
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,740
to believe I'm telling the truth?

46
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,610
Please, Akane?

47
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,950
(students laughing)

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,610
- [Girl] Are you still coming over later?

49
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,780
- [Girl] Yeah, of course.

50
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,120
(students chattering)

51
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,360
(lighthearted orchestral music)

52
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,500
BIRTHDAY WONDERLAND

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,890
(groans)

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,790
- Gorobeh, why would you sit on my face like that?

55
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,490
Why are you so nasty?

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,360
(Gorobeh yowling)

57
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,360
(Gorobeh purring)

58
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,900
(laughing)

59
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,310
I'm getting hungry.

60
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,590
(Gorobeh yowling) (Akane grunting)

61
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,970
Hi, Mom.

62
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,440
I.

63
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,290
- Go wait on the terrace.

64
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,290
I'll make something for you to eat.

65
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,960
(sighs)

66
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,690
(dog barking)

67
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,400
(sighs)

68
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,630
I feel guilty.

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,910
Being a cat must be chill.

70
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm jealous.

71
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,650
(gasps)

72
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,560
- Here.

73
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,130
- It looks delicious.

74
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,710
Man, housewives have it pretty good too, don't they?

75
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,780
Still, Mom's cooking never ceases to amaze me.

76
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,580
- Do you feel any better?

77
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,850
- Yeah, I think my headache's just about gone.

78
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,820
- I thought it was a stomachache.

79
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,060
- Well, I also had a headache.

80
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,560
(giggling)

81
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,600
(humming)

82
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,990
- Would you mind running an errand for me?

83
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,950
(gulps)

84
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,390
- Huh?

85
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,160
- I need you to make a quick visit to Chii's shop.

86
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,060
- Huh, seriously?

87
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,330
I don't wanna.

88
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,460
Are you really gonna make me go see her?

89
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,100
Why mom?

90
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,100
- It's because,

91
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,200
because tomorrow's your birthday, isn't it?

92
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,970
I asked Chii if she could prepare a present for you.

93
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,240
And so, I want you to go get it.

94
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
- Wait, you mean I have to go out

95
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,180
and pick up my own birthday present?

96
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,950
That's totally weird.

97
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,780
I won't do it!

98
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,320
(dog barking)

99
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,360
- Ride carefully, okay?

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,500
(groans)

101
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,140
(lively music)

102
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,300
Have a safe trip, Akane!

103
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:15,220
"Restaurant"

104
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,390
"Chii's Curiosities"

105
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,600
- [Customer] No, I don't think you understand.

106
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,260
I'm telling you, I like this one more.

107
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,070
- But I honestly think this one suits you much better

108
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,600
than the mushroom.

109
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,740
- [Customer] Hmm.

110
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,200
- You should pick this one.

111
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
To give a little backstory,

112
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,140
I got it when I stayed at a hotel

113
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,810
in a town in Bolivia from an old man

114
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,350
who made beautiful sculptures of precious stones.

115
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,110
I instantly fell in love with it and asked to buy it.

116
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,680
But he said it wasn't finished yet.

117
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,850
However, I loved it so much that I kept insisting,

118
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,990
and he finally agreed to trade it for some chocolate.

119
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,360
Then when I returned to Japan,

120
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,760
I threw a light bulb in it and made it this little lamp.

121
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,230
I'm actually quite fond of it.

122
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,160
But if you promise to take good care of it,

123
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,430
I think we could work something out.

124
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,540
- [Akane] That witch is really trying to sell that thing.

125
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,270
- How much?

126
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,540
- Let's see. $10.

127
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,740
- Yah!

128
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,280
- [Akane] What a rip-off!

129
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,610
She said she got it for chocolate.

130
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,380
- How about you try it out first?

131
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,120
And if you decide that you like it,

132
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,820
then you can pay me for it later.

133
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,600
- I'm curious why you thought this would suit me.

134
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,600
(giggles)

135
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,830
- Because like I said, it's not finished.

136
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,710
No, way, it's Akane!

137
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,010
How have you been or more like where have you been?

138
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,550
I haven't seen you in so long!

139
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,850
- I just saw you last month.

140
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,050
You came over to the house

141
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,920
with some super stinky durian sweets

142
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,250
you picked up from Thailand.

143
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,190
- Oh, really, did I?

144
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,290
(laughs)

145
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,160
Ah, seems like you haven't filled out yet, have you?

146
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,860
(Akane grunts)

147
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,060
What's the matter?

148
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,900
(groans)

149
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,130
Wait a few years.

150
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,370
It just takes a little bit more time

151
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,170
for some girls to develop.

152
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,470
Oh, is that a bouquet from Midori?

153
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,540
Oh, thanks, Akane.

154
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,180
(giggles)

155
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,180
So, what brings you here?

156
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,410
- Huh?

157
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,280
- You came to pick up your birthday present?

158
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,450
I don't think I got an order like that.

159
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,560
- Are you going away again?

160
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,200
- I planned a trip to visit a flea market in Sorgue.

161
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,960
It's located in South France.

162
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,500
I've wanted to go there for a while.

163
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,740
It looks so beautiful, don't you think?

164
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,610
Are you thirsty at all?

165
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
- Mm-mm.

166
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,480
- Okay.

167
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,520
(enchanting music)

168
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,110
- Being around Chii is hard

169
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,770
but this place makes it worth it.

170
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,520
Hm?

171
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,290
Is this a piece of the Berlin Wall?

172
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,890
No, it couldn't be.

173
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,400
Huh?

174
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,300
(enchanting music)

175
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,770
(grunting)

176
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,240
Help me, Chii!

177
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,280
- Help you, with what?

178
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,340
- I'm stuck. I can't get out!

179
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,980
(knocking on wood) (Akane grunting)

180
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,290
- Did you just hear a knock too?

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,120
- Who cares?

182
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,220
Focus on getting me out!

183
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,250
(knocking on wood)

184
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,320
Huh? - Hm?

185
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
From the basement?

186
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,290
- [Akane] Wait, you have a basement?

187
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,260
- [Chii] It came with the place.

188
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,330
I use it for storage.

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,230
(creaking)

190
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,200
(exciting music)

191
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,200
(gasps)

192
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,470
(gasps)

193
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,140
- This place is just extremely difficult to navigate.

194
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,540
- Who are you?

195
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,110
Why are you in my basement?

196
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,080
Are you a thief?

197
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,780
I'll call the police!

198
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,480
- No, please.

199
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,420
Wait, please.

200
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,590
I assure you, I am not a thief.

201
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Hm?

202
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,420
- Hm?

203
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,290
- Although I wonder if you're perhaps

204
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,360
a bit too old for the job.

205
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,930
- Yeah, I'm calling the cops.

206
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,100
- Listen carefully.

207
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,900
I came to this place to find the Goddess of the Green Wind.

208
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,000
- Huh?

209
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,240
- In other words, the girl who fits that hand print

210
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,470
on the table over there.

211
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,170
Oh!

212
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,010
(grunts) (energetic music)

213
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
(thuds)

214
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,850
What was that for?

215
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,220
How rude?

216
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,590
- Who are you calling rude?

217
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,290
- You are not who I seek!

218
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
(Chii grunts)

219
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,560
- [Chii] Hey!

220
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
- And you must be. (gasps)

221
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,530
Pipo, well done.

222
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,730
- Thank you, Master Hippocrates.

223
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm glad to be of help. (giggles)

224
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,470
(gasps)

225
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,910
- Hm?

226
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,380
Hey, Chii, does that figurine normally talk?

227
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,850
- I guess I never checked.

228
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,580
- My body's stiff from staying still all morning.

229
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,650
Being able to move feels great!

230
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,460
(gasping)

231
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,190
- It flies too?

232
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,890
- I mean, maybe.

233
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,960
- Apologies for the delayed introduction.

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,230
I am Hippocrates and this little wee is my apprentice.

235
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,170
- Nice to meet you.

236
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,240
My name's Pipo.

237
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,310
- Now, it's saying nice to meet you.

238
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,070
- Well, it is the first we've met.

239
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,780
Mm-hm, so I guess that kinda makes sense.

240
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,980
- Huh?

241
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,710
- Pipo and I,

242
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,210
we come from a world beyond

243
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,150
that is connected to the basement of this establishment.

244
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,550
It is likely you've been completely unaware of this.

245
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,430
Well, what I should say is that I'm certain

246
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,430
you will not believe me.

247
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,200
- That's incredible!

248
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,560
- Huh?

249
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,870
- You're talking about a real alternate world?

250
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,470
We have books and films about worlds that are similar,

251
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,740
yet, totally different from ours

252
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,810
but you're telling me it's not just fiction?

253
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,070
Wait, then could our worlds

254
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,640
be part of a much larger multiverse?

255
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,210
And all of it's connected to my basement?

256
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,180
I've lived in this place ever since I was born

257
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,720
but I never knew this existed.

258
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,590
For how long, huh?

259
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,920
I need to know!

260
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,420
- I believe since ancient times.

261
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,360
(sighs)

262
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,860
- Now, I feel ripped off.

263
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,200
I can't believe something so cool was right under me.

264
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,730
Hey, what does it look like?

265
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,600
Give me all the details on your world.

266
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,100
- Can we maybe focus on getting my hand out of here?

267
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,810
- Oops, sorry, I forgot.

268
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,140
Since you look pretty important, you help her.

269
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,640
- Simply relax yourself.

270
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,210
- Huh?

271
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,120
- I'm terribly sorry but I must ask

272
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,520
that you come with us to our world immediately.

273
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,760
- Huh?

274
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,260
- Because you fit that hand print,

275
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,360
you were destined to be the Goddess of the Green Wind.

276
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,430
- Hold on a minute.

277
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,630
What is this guy even talking about?

278
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,270
- I honestly have no idea.

279
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,400
You know, you can't just ask a little girl you don't know

280
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,500
to follow you to a strange place.

281
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,940
So can I go instead?

282
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,810
- Huh?

283
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,180
- No, because you are not the goddess.

284
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,480
- Oh.

285
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,610
(Pipo grunts)

286
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,580
- Please, forgive us.

287
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,680
We know it's a sudden request.

288
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,720
However, our world is undergoing a major crisis right now

289
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,290
and when we need the goddess's help,

290
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
which means you're the only one who can save us.

291
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,660
- Oh, sorry.

292
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,360
- What are you talking about?

293
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,700
I don't have that power.

294
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,960
- Would you mind putting this on, please?

295
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,140
(mellow moving music)

296
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,810
(grunts)

297
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,910
- What is this heavy thing?

298
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,280
- How lovely, it suits you.

299
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,420
- Huh?

300
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,750
- That pendant is called the momentum anchor.

301
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,950
You see, it took me three days and three nights

302
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,820
to create this masterpiece using a secret element.

303
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,930
And I am rather proud of it.

304
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,000
- Isn't he just amazing?

305
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,400
He's known in our world as the greatest alchemist

306
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,530
that's ever lived!

307
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,470
You could ask anyone and they would know

308
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,570
who Master Hippocrates is.

309
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,770
- You're a real alchemist?

310
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,840
You're the first I've met.

311
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,270
- While wearing that necklace,

312
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,240
even if you feel a strong desire to turn around

313
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,440
and run from something,

314
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,810
it will help you continue on forward.

315
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,280
Yes, I think I did well in creating this piece.

316
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,420
- Get it off!

317
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,960
(exclaiming)

318
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,920
- Master Hippocrates is the only person

319
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,360
who can relieve you of that necklace.

320
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,560
Now, let's get going, shall we?

321
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,930
- No!

322
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,630
(grunts)

323
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,930
- Follow me, goddess.

324
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,800
(Akane whimpering)

325
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,770
- Hey, wait!

326
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,810
(groaning)

327
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,210
I'm coming with you guys too!

328
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Wait for me!

329
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,000
(wind chime chiming)

330
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,470
(mysterious music)

331
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,210
(grunting)

332
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,350
- Master Hippocrates, the spider's road.

333
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
- This is taking longer than it needs to.

334
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,620
(gasping)

335
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,890
- There's no need to worry.

336
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,690
This is the spider who controls time

337
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,360
so it's not gonna hurt you.

338
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,500
(splashing)

339
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,700
- That's not our route.

340
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,640
Goddess, this way.

341
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,570
(grunting)

342
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,410
(tense music)

343
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
- Hey-

344
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,980
- Yes?

345
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,210
- I'm not a goddess, all right?

346
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
I'm an ordinary girl named Akane.

347
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,890
(tense music)

348
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,790
- You guys, okay?

349
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,030
Did anyone get hurt?

350
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,830
- No, Pipo.

351
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,330
I'm not okay at all!

352
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,610
Why we'd end up somewhere so high off the ground?

353
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,670
- We did not intend to land here.

354
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,480
- There are two entrances into this world.

355
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,080
The new one and the old one which we just used.

356
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,550
From the stories I've heard,

357
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,680
there were huge birds

358
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,780
that used to soar the skies around here.

359
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,980
Lots of them.

360
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,320
They're the ones who made this tower.

361
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,120
(birds chirping)

362
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,330
- Is that one of the birds you were talking about?

363
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,560
(squawking)

364
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,030
(exclaiming)

365
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,840
(roaring)

366
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,410
- Are those its eggs?

367
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,110
- It must be trying to protect them from harm!

368
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,480
- Calm down.

369
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,150
We wouldn't dream of cooking your beautiful eggs

370
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,620
to serve them sunny side up.

371
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,020
I promise you.

372
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,620
I mean they're too big for us to eat anyway.

373
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,820
(screeching)Whoa!

374
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,960
Whoa, whoa.

375
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,130
Think it understood?

376
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,760
- Come on!

377
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,000
- Stay still.

378
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,000
(groaning)

379
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,780
Now, descend quietly.

380
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,880
Are you all right, Akane?

381
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,720
- Mm.

382
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,620
(Pipo grunting)

383
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,900
(exhaust blowing)

384
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,710
- It's the armored mouse.

385
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,440
(ominous music)

386
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,240
(people gasping)

387
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,490
(clattering)

388
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,630
- Mother!

389
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,940
(whirring)

390
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,980
(whirring)

391
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,150
- No, my sweater!

392
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,330
- Seems you're up to no good again, Zan Gu!

393
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,570
- [Zan Gu] It's Hippocrates.

394
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,040
- [Doropo] And Pipo too.

395
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,980
These guys are real persistent, aren't they?

396
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,580
- What the hell is that?

397
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,850
(exhaust whistling)

398
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,120
(yelling)

399
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,920
(ominous music)

400
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,620
Akane, run!

401
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,120
- I can't move!

402
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,300
- Hey, make yourself useful!

403
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,100
(light mellow music)

404
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,280
(energetic music)

405
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,490
(chuckling)

406
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,160
- We really scared you, didn't we?

407
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,030
(somber music)

408
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,410
(clattering)

409
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,510
(bird squawking)

410
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,450
- The bird's eggs.

411
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,420
- No, wait!

412
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,320
- Master Hippocrates!

413
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,790
I brought you the sheep grass.

414
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,590
(leaf whistling)

415
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,460
(clattering)

416
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,830
(squawking)

417
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,110
(gasps)

418
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,510
(grunts)

419
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,010
(laughs)

420
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,150
- I got it!

421
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,120
Now, what is it?

422
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
(ground rumbling)

423
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,200
(distant sheep bleating)

424
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,130
(tense music)

425
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,670
- Ma, it's all the sheep from the village.

426
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,470
- How wonderful.

427
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,340
It seems they've come to help us.

428
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,180
(energetic music)

429
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,480
- They're huge!

430
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,680
- Do not move.

431
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,360
(energetic music)

432
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,730
(clanking)

433
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,670
- Draw back, now.

434
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,600
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

435
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,450
- Those scoundrels are as troublesome as always.

436
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,580
- I kept your egg safe.

437
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,780
(squawks)

438
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,420
Oh, I see.

439
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,930
Be sure to take good care of it!

440
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,070
(chuckling)

441
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,770
- Hm, she did a pretty good job, didn't she?

442
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,870
- [Hippocrates] Hm.

443
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,740
- Master Hippocrates!

444
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,080
We thank you and your friends for saving us

445
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,380
from such a dangerous situation.

446
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,620
- There is a village nearby called Cockscomb.

447
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,490
This is the mayor and his mother.

448
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,820
(sheep bleating)

449
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,760
(Akane exclaiming)

450
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,730
- Ah, so comfy.

451
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,600
- [Akane] Mm-hm.

452
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,470
(sheep bleating)

453
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,660
- It's so beautiful.

454
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,990
What is this place?

455
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,390
- [Pipo] This is Cockscomb Field.

456
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,300
The village is just beyond it, down the path ahead of us.

457
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,300
(mellow music)

458
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,600
- I feel like I'm in a fairytale land right now.

459
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,140
- For generations, this village has kept sheep

460
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,640
they shear for their wool.

461
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,810
They dye it with the pigment from the flowers in this field

462
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,880
then knits scarves and sweaters with it.

463
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,580
- Wow, that's so interesting.

464
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,430
Ah, it's so cute!

465
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,170
(exclaims)

466
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,270
(chuckles)

467
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,370
Hello, ladies.

468
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,200
- Hello to you too.

469
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,440
- Good afternoon, miss.

470
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,740
- That's such a pretty color.

471
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,970
- Why, thank you.

472
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,940
- It seems so peaceful.

473
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,910
What exactly is this world in danger from anyway?

474
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,680
(imitating bleating)

475
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,190
- It's starting to completely lose its color.

476
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,350
- It is?

477
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,420
- [Pipo] The field isn't the same anymore.

478
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,630
The sheep fleece is getting course, the flowers are wilting.

479
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,830
- [Akane] Why is this happening?

480
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,760
- A lack of water.

481
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,730
- Wait, what?

482
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,400
- Every single thing in this world

483
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:01,200
has water to thank for granting it life.

484
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,110
- Life means that there is color.

485
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,970
If the water flows properly,

486
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,410
then beautiful colors can thrive but if it doesn't.

487
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,880
- Master Hippocrates.

488
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,750
- Welcome, great alchemist.

489
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,620
- It's really you.

490
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,190
- It's been so long since you returned.

491
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,260
- We're in desperate need of your help.

492
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,560
Master Hippocrates, the whole village agrees,

493
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,360
you're our only hope.

494
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,760
- Especially with Master Kamadoma not around right now.

495
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,970
- I am well aware.

496
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,500
And that is why I found the Goddess of the Green Wind

497
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,100
and brought her here to help us.

498
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,340
(chuckles) - Hm?

499
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,610
- This girl's the goddess?

500
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,340
- Really, the one from that legend?

501
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,110
- The goddess will save us all.

502
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,980
- [Akane] What? This can't be happening.

503
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,590
- [Pipo] About 600 years ago, something similar happened.

504
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,990
There was a drought that caused all the color to go away.

505
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,160
Everyone was in despair.

506
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,260
Just when they thought all was lost,

507
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,230
a girl suddenly appeared like the wind

508
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,530
and saved the village.

509
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,170
She became known as the Goddess of the Green Wind

510
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,070
amongst the people who live there.

511
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,470
It's a legend that's been passed down through the ages.

512
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,150
- No, no, no, no!

513
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,950
I'm just a normal girl,

514
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,520
I don't have the power to save this world.

515
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,490
Let's go home, Chii, I don't wanna be here anymore.

516
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,390
- I'd love it If I could take all these things

517
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,190
back to my shop.

518
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,430
- I'm going home, okay?

519
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,830
I miss my mom and dad!

520
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,930
I wanna see them!

521
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,970
(gasps)

522
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,300
- But we can't go home,

523
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,570
The tower stairs were destroyed

524
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,340
by that armored mouse thing, remember?

525
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,540
- Huh?

526
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,070
- Well, there's still the other exit

527
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,010
but it would take you two days to get there

528
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,480
by carriage at the earliest.

529
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,780
- Do you hear that, Akane?

530
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,610
So let's just stay here and take it easy

531
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,220
for the rest of the night.

532
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,080
(grunting) - Mm-hm.

533
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,190
- [Woman] It's ready.

534
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,290
- Hm.

535
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,090
We prepared a light dinner for you

536
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,690
as a thanks for your kindness.

537
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,230
Right this way, please.

538
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,530
(chuckles)

539
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,980
(calm music)

540
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,280
Please, eat.

541
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,950
Help yourselves to anything.

542
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,050
- What about your mom?

543
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,520
- She had something she needed to take care of.

544
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,390
You don't have to worry, just enjoy your meal.

545
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,590
- Well then, guess it's time to dig in.

546
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,600
- Mm, wait a second.

547
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,500
Is this chestnut soup?

548
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,030
Akane, you have to try it!

549
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,440
- So good.

550
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,310
- I know, isn't it?

551
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,140
- Mm-hm.

552
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,520
- [Chii] Mm!

553
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,790
- Before you ran into us, my mother and I

554
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,260
were on our way to the next town

555
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,400
where there's fair with that sweater.

556
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,300
But then we were attacked.

557
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,230
- You mean that sweater from earlier?

558
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,200
The one you said was stolen?

559
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,900
- Yes, my mother is the best knitter in the entire village.

560
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,040
But recently, it has started to strain her eyes.

561
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,610
After she'd finally finished working on that sweater,

562
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,780
she said it would be her last one.

563
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,280
- Those jerks, they took such a precious sweater?

564
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,680
How awful!

565
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,020
- Lately, sweaters produced from our village

566
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,450
aren't selling very well.

567
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,020
There was a rumor spread about how the color

568
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,460
and quality were bad.

569
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,090
We clearly didn't have poor products at our market

570
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,530
but it didn't matter.

571
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,160
And now, with everyone's livelihood at risk,

572
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,540
my dear sweet mother insisted on taking up knitting again.

573
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,400
(somber music)

574
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,640
With her skill, we thought it's best

575
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,980
to enter the contest at the Sakasatongari Market.

576
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,580
- Huh, good idea.

577
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,810
After all, people come from far and wide

578
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,180
in order to shop there.

579
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,680
If the sweater wins the contest,

580
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,690
then it could be well, it seems.

581
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,060
- Sakasatongari?

582
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,990
- This place here.

583
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,260
- I should mention, that will not be the last of Zan Gu.

584
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,570
- [Pipo] The stuff started happening

585
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,770
when that armored mouse first appeared.

586
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,370
- They're not dangerous, are they?

587
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,170
- Over the past six months now,

588
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,210
they've been popping up

589
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,780
causing all sorts of trouble and violence.

590
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,280
I can only assume they're some scoundrels from Nibi.

591
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,750
- Wait, what's Nibi?

592
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,590
- A town that's best to avoid.

593
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,790
It's not safe to go there.

594
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,970
(ominous music)

595
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,490
(machine whirring)

596
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,390
(clattering)

597
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,860
(exclaiming)

598
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,570
(exclaiming)

599
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,670
- Hey, you!

600
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,810
(vehicle chugging)

601
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,680
(Doropo grunts)

602
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,750
(Doropo scoffing)

603
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,220
(grunting)

604
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,330
(chuckling)

605
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,300
- Huh?

606
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,100
(shatters)(yells)

607
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:04,630
(Doropo chuckles)

608
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,870
Little brat!

609
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,170
(grunting)

610
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,610
- I did some nice work out there.

611
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,750
(vehicle chugging)

612
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,420
(ominous music)

613
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,930
(Doropo grunting)

614
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:47,140
(metal clanking)

615
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,150
(clanking)

616
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,270
(ominous music)

617
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,750
(chuckling)

618
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,330
- You are to keep working.

619
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,100
Is that clear?

620
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,130
(scoffs)

621
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,600
- I can't really make decent steel

622
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,330
with all this junk you keep bringing me.

623
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,370
(clattering)

624
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,770
(hissing)

625
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,650
- Mm, wouldn't wanna be in there.

626
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,180
- So will you be able to finish it in two days?

627
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,690
- Can't make steel with iron I don't have.

628
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,920
- I'll fix that.

629
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,320
I just need you to make it quickly.

630
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,430
(chuckles)

631
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,460
- You know, when you ask for something, you should say.

632
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,960
(grunting)

633
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,930
(grunting)

634
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,410
- You'll pay if you can't complete it.

635
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,110
(ominous music)

636
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,080
(chuckles)

637
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,880
- You'll be in a whole lot of trouble.

638
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,190
- I'll collect the iron for you.

639
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,690
Doropo, let's go.

640
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,920
- [Doropo] Yes, sir.

641
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,860
(light mellow music)

642
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
- This area here is Cockscomb

643
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,800
and north of that at the center of the world

644
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,610
is where the Timeless Rain Castle is located.

645
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,110
It's where the king of the Timeless Rain lives

646
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,480
and oversees the whole world.

647
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,050
The royal family has wisely managed the water for centuries

648
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,050
without having to resort to things like petty violence.

649
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,090
- Thanks to that, we've lived peacefully

650
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,760
and have enjoyed full lives.

651
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,060
They've been so very good to us over the years.

652
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,060
- Unfortunately, the most recent king and queen died

653
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,100
one after another about five years ago.

654
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,800
And their son, the prince, was left alone with no family.

655
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,570
Whether it's in public or in the castle,

656
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,940
he hasn't made a single appearance in the past year or so.

657
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,370
- Wait, that long?

658
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,440
Is there a reason?

659
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
- According to the rumors that have gone around,

660
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,780
he's really sick and has to stay in bed all day.

661
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,020
- The poor boy must've fallen ill from grief

662
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,890
over his parents' death.

663
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,060
(sighs)

664
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,100
- It is said his power has waned over the last few months.

665
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,830
And as a result, it is affecting the circulation of water.

666
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,500
- Can't you figure out a way to heal him?

667
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,040
I mean you are an alchemist, aren't you?

668
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,110
- But even if we had a way, we can't go to the castle

669
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,350
because of Kamadoma, the wizard.

670
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,750
In this world, wizards and alchemists protect specific areas

671
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,820
and they're not allowed to bother the other

672
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,020
and he kinda lives there, so.

673
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,960
- A turf war then?

674
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,590
You've got to be kidding me.

675
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,400
Well, if that's the case,

676
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,160
then why don't you just ask this Kamadoma guy

677
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,830
to do something about it?

678
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,100
- Chii, stop.

679
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,000
Huh?

680
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,640
- The thing is-

681
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,510
- He fell into a deep slumber when the crisis started

682
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,180
and has not awakened yet.

683
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,110
- What, so does that mean he's dead then?

684
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,310
- No, no, no, that's not it at all.

685
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,750
For three years, Mr. Kamadoma hadn't had a wink of sleep.

686
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,390
However, he suddenly fell asleep

687
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,860
and has been doing so for about a year now.

688
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,590
- Basically, he's hibernating.

689
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,230
- Uh-huh.

690
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,760
- So, like a bear does.

691
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,600
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

692
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,100
- Will you focus?

693
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,630
- Today was such a long day.

694
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,840
I'm feeling real tired.

695
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,610
Can I sleep now?

696
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,040
- You're too relaxed.

697
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,840
- I've not finished my story!

698
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,740
- Oh, right.

699
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,010
Try to hurry it up.

700
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,350
- The reason why I had to bring Akane here

701
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,480
was because I needed her to save the prince.

702
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,850
- Huh? Save the price?

703
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,020
Seriously?

704
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,560
- Ooh, how romantic.

705
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,330
- You be quiet!

706
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,190
- Akane.

707
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,930
This is the Goddess of the Green Wind

708
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,070
who appeared 600 years ago.

709
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,440
As it stands, neither Kamadoma nor I can heal the prince.

710
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,480
Only the goddess is capable of curing him.

711
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,390
(clattering) (ominous music)

712
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,090
(woman gasping)

713
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,860
(chuckles)

714
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,790
- That was a nice grab, Zan Gu.

715
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,130
- [Zan Gu] I require more.

716
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,900
(exclaiming)

717
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,800
- Move it! Get out of our way!

718
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,970
(yelling)

719
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,810
(man bouncing) (man grunting)

720
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,670
- Undo it.

721
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,010
(air blowing) (man groaning)

722
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
- Huh?

723
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,650
(boings)

724
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,480
Come on, come on.

725
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,890
(groaning)

726
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,690
- Stop using magic.

727
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,920
You're bad at it.

728
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,920
- Well, that's why I'm practicing.

729
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,360
I wanna get better.

730
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,760
I'm gonna be the best.

731
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,270
- You know, Akane, I really envy you.

732
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,640
I wish that I'd had the chance

733
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,170
to go on an adventure like this when I was your age.

734
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,770
- I just wanna go home already.

735
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,710
- So then you're not going to see the prince first?

736
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,640
- Of course, not.

737
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,680
- But if you don't, Akane, this world will-

738
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,550
- Someone, anyone!

739
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,380
Are you all right?

740
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,820
- [Chii] What's wrong?

741
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,120
- [Popo] My mother.

742
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,820
- Pardon me.

743
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,560
She's been making a sweater.

744
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,860
Pipo, the medicine.

745
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,700
- [Pipo] Right.

746
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,530
- Put her to bed.

747
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,600
- Yes, sir.

748
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,730
- No, please, wait.

749
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,470
I just want to finish this.

750
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,700
I can do it tonight If I keep working.

751
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
- You need to rest.

752
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,040
- My eyes are failing and my body is weak now

753
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,010
but I need to complete the sweater

754
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,280
so I can take it to the market.

755
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,920
- Mother, you have to be careful about pushing yourself.

756
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,250
What if your body gives out?

757
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,560
- You are the mayor of this village, son.

758
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,030
Think of its future first before you worry yourself

759
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,430
too much over mine.

760
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,640
- There, this'll help perk you up.

761
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:07,050
- Popo, the four of us will deliver her sweater for you.

762
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,650
- Please, don't trouble yourself.

763
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,150
It's my responsibility!

764
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,320
- Do not worry.

765
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,350
Just remain by your mother's side.

766
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,690
The Sakasatongari market is quite close

767
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,130
to the Timeless Rain Castle anyway,

768
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,690
so it is no trouble at all.

769
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,030
Akane, you agree?

770
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,530
- Huh, no not at all.

771
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,030
(chimes)

772
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,840
(grunts)

773
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,100
- Do you agree?

774
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,510
- Yeah.

775
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,710
(chuckles)

776
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,040
(rooster crowing)

777
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,850
(mellow music)

778
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
(gasps)

779
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,900
(tense music)

780
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,780
(sheep bleating)

781
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,950
You okay?

782
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,810
- Huh?

783
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,080
- What are you doing down there?

784
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,020
- Yoga!

785
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,890
That one was corpse pose.

786
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,320
You wanna come try it?

787
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,820
- Try being a corpse?

788
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,290
Uh-uh.

789
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,690
(grunts)

790
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,960
(chuckles)

791
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,000
(groans)

792
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,600
- This car will be a great help.

793
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,900
I thank you.

794
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,410
- I'm very glad to hear that, Master Hippocrates.

795
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,040
- Here's some food and water.

796
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,310
- How kind of you.

797
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,710
What's in these?

798
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,440
- Warmer clothes for you

799
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,540
since you'll be passing through

800
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,080
one of the more frigid regions.

801
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,210
- [Chii] Oh, neat.

802
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,380
- Please take care

803
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,580
of yourself. - Hey, Mr. Mayor,

804
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,180
is your mother still doing all right?

805
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,490
- She looks very tired but I assure you,

806
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,120
she is resting well now.

807
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,520
There is no need to worry.

808
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,160
I appreciate this.

809
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,800
Please deliver that sweater safely.

810
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,830
- Right.

811
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:08,300
Just holding it makes me feel so warm and cozy.

812
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,340
And even though it's wrapped right now,

813
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,670
it gives off a nice and gentle aura.

814
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,440
- Thank you so much for your kind words.

815
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,240
I'll let my mother know.

816
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,510
- Now, let's go.

817
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,620
We do not want to miss the contest.

818
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,920
- Well, I finished loading the car for you.

819
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,390
- Hurry and get in.

820
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,130
- Well, what are you waiting for?

821
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,500
Huh, Mr. Chauffeur?

822
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,700
- Huh?

823
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,440
(Chii scoffs)

824
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,380
- [Woman] Travel safely!

825
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,240
- [Chii] Bye!

826
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,310
- Good luck out there!

827
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,920
(sheep bleating)

828
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,320
- See you, fluffy boys.

829
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,420
I'll miss you.

830
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,390
(mellow music)

831
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,690
A nice little town.

832
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,560
- Yeah.

833
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,740
- The scenery is gradually changing.

834
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,710
(chuckles)

835
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,360
(laughing)

836
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,240
It got super cold all of a sudden.

837
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,070
This is so warm and cute.

838
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,180
Nice choice, mayor!

839
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,380
- [Pipo] Wow, it really suits both of you!

840
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,550
- [Both] How adorable!

841
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,220
(groaning)

842
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,690
(laughing)

843
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,500
(wind blowing)

844
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,410
- It's coming.

845
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,810
- What is that?

846
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,550
(tense music)

847
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,570
- Get out!

848
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,240
- I think we should stay put.

849
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,540
- I said out!

850
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,750
(Akane grunting)

851
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,050
That way!

852
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,490
Sit down and curl up!

853
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,670
(clattering)

854
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,950
Finally. (blows)

855
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:45,590
(Chii sighs)

856
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,950
- That was intense.

857
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,960
- [Pipo] Thank you so much, Chii.

858
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,160
- No problem at all.

859
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,000
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Hippocrates, for protecting us.

860
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,570
- Oh, yes.

861
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,200
(groaning)

862
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,680
(chuckling)

863
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,610
(Akane and Chii grunting)

864
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,590
(engine clattering)

865
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,570
(blows)

866
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,810
- Do sandstorms happen often?

867
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,510
- Here in the Land of the Red Wind,

868
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,840
they're definitely not unusual.

869
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,780
But to be honest, this is the first time

870
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,550
I've seen one that huge.

871
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,420
- It's also drier than normal.

872
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,750
The lack of water circulation

873
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,590
is to thank for that, of course.

874
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,790
(calm mellow music)

875
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,880
We must wait for sunrise.

876
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,480
There is nothing more we can accomplish today.

877
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,380
- You got it!

878
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,650
- Hey, wait.

879
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,890
Does that mean we have to camp in this place?

880
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,990
- Yeah, why?

881
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:27,990
- Huh?

882
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,360
But that means there's no shower.

883
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,490
Chii, I don't wanna stay here.

884
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,430
- But this is the best part of the adventure!

885
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,560
(chuckles)

886
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,900
(grunts)

887
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:49,240
(mellow moving music)

888
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,290
- Hey, what are you?

889
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,910
(clattering)

890
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,410
- [Chii] It works! (laughs)

891
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,410
- Nice job, Mr. Hippocrates!

892
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,580
- [Chii] Well, what do you know?

893
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,050
I guess alchemists are pretty useful after all.

894
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,520
- We've wasted enough time!

895
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,490
Hurry up!

896
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,390
- Okay!

897
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,560
Hey, are you ready?

898
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:44,770
- [Akane] Yup.

899
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,170
(dog snarling and barking)

900
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,810
(vehicle chugging)

901
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,750
(exhaust whistling)

902
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,480
- [Man] What's that?

903
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,120
What's he doing here?

904
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,150
(people exclaiming)

905
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,890
- [Man] Whoa, whoa, whoa, out of the way!

906
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,660
(exhaust whistling)

907
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,790
(people clamoring)

908
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:16,030
(calm mellow music)

909
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,240
- Seems like the dirty snow is only getting worse.

910
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,180
- We must hurry.

911
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,130
- Ah, it's so warm!

912
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,400
- Pardon me.

913
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,770
Do you mind if my companions and I stay the night?

914
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,410
- You wanna stay, it's gonna cost you.

915
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,850
- Allow me to introduce myself.

916
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,450
I am Hippocrates, the alchemist.

917
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,820
(scoffs)

918
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,660
- Beautiful, isn't it?

919
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:15,920
- Yeah.

920
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,260
- I thought you guys were a bunch of traveling clowns.

921
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,600
- Clowns?

922
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,500
- There's a huge water shortage.

923
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,900
It's making things pricey.

924
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,540
You can't use the bath or sink but drinking water's fine.

925
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:30,840
- Honey, stop!

926
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,810
You're talking to Hippocrates, the infamous alchemist!

927
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,580
- Oh, of course, how could I been so oblivious?

928
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,810
We'll arrange our best room

929
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,450
and prepare some hot water as well.

930
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,180
Anything for you, sir.

931
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,820
If you need anything, just ask.

932
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,520
- If you'd be so kind,

933
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,360
could you please prepare a warm meal for these two girls?

934
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,130
- Of course, I'll make a big stew for them!

935
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,300
(mellow music)

936
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,580
(chuckles)

937
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:12,510
- Mr. Hippocrates, aren't you eating?

938
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,080
- I'm off to find a nearby fuel station.

939
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,890
Make sure you rest after you finish eating.

940
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,720
We'll leave in the morning.

941
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,020
- See you soon, sir.

942
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,690
(gulping)

943
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,760
- You're drinking too much.

944
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,900
- Hey, no alcohol, no life.

945
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,230
- Excuse me?

946
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,730
(vehicle chugging)

947
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:35,000
Huh?

948
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,920
(ominous music)

949
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,950
- It's those guys!

950
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,020
(children crying)

951
00:53:58,690 --> 00:53:59,990
- Give me something to eat.

952
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,700
- Who the hell are you guys?

953
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,530
- Don't you know the great Zan Gu?

954
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,770
You really gotta keep up with the times, old man.

955
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,740
(gasping)

956
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:13,010
(children crying)

957
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,880
- What kind of food would you like?

958
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,310
- Whatever human food you have.

959
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,450
- I'll bring something right away.

960
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,290
Thanks for your patience.

961
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,130
- Ah, yeah!

962
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,500
- Water too.

963
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,730
- Water?

964
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,000
But we barely have enough for ourselves,

965
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,940
let alone some to spare.

966
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,710
(crashing)

967
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,240
(groans)

968
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,980
(man gasping)

969
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,280
- Well, that was easy.

970
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,020
(grunting)

971
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,090
(tense music)

972
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,370
- What the hell?

973
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:19,970
(vehicle whirring)

974
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,350
- Sorry to be a bother.

975
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,090
- [Chii] Are you okay, sir?

976
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,160
- Yes, it's nothing serious.

977
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,030
By the way, you two.

978
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,090
(vehicle clattering)

979
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:26,010
- What are those scoundrels up to?

980
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,880
- Hm?

981
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,250
- You look exactly like him!

982
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,250
- My brother Voudan already told me the details.

983
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,540
This thing packs a punch.

984
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,740
- I better go smash that dumb well

985
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,710
into a million pieces, Zan Gu!

986
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:06,950
- Hm?

987
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,980
I'll need payment for my trouble.

988
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,180
- [Zan Gu] Yes, of course.

989
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,790
Use this to your liking.

990
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:18,090
- Hmm.

991
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,000
This will do just fine.

992
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,600
- [Zan Gu] Can you tell the quality of it

993
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,600
simply by looking?

994
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,770
- There's someone here.

995
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,670
- Zan Gu, what are you up to?

996
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,010
- [Zan Gu] None of your business, alchemist.

997
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,740
This does not concern you.

998
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,880
- When he said well,

999
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,550
he meant the timeless rain well

1000
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,180
where the prince does the ceremony.

1001
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,290
- The reason our world is suffering

1002
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,320
is because of that good-for-nothing price.

1003
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,160
Our royal savior is too sick to produce rain.

1004
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,000
But we don't need his help if I blow up the well

1005
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,500
and the water should start flowing again.

1006
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,530
- Ridiculous!

1007
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:03,340
(tense music)

1008
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,910
I cannot allow that!

1009
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,910
(tinkles)

1010
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,680
(smoke blows)

1011
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,980
Oh, dear, I let my guard down.

1012
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,350
- I thought I said no magic.

1013
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:19,050
- I did it 'cause he was about to do something!

1014
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,890
He'll turn back to normal eventually.

1015
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,620
(jolly music)

1016
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,730
God, so annoying!

1017
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,900
(chuckles)

1018
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,510
- When you first stepped into the room,

1019
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:42,240
I could already tell you are not people from this world.

1020
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,880
- We're from one next to it.

1021
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,850
Have you heard about it before?

1022
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,050
What do you know?

1023
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,320
- Not much.

1024
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,520
You see, there have been stories passed down

1025
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:52,850
about your world.

1026
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:55,690
Over the years, it's been said there's a world out there

1027
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,090
similar to ours referred to as a mirror world.

1028
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:00,330
- Oh, wow, really?

1029
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,300
- However, it ended up diverging at some point.

1030
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,330
If I had to take a guess on why,

1031
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,600
it's probably because your world changed

1032
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,200
when the steam locomotive was invented.

1033
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,740
- Are you saying you don't have trains in your world?

1034
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,210
- No, we do have them.

1035
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,980
It's just that nothing changed here

1036
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,780
after they were introduced to us.

1037
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:21,850
We still live our lives in a simple way as we always have.

1038
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,720
- But why didn't society advance?

1039
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,150
- I suppose the easy answer is we were happy

1040
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,920
with things how they were.

1041
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,230
(melancholic music)

1042
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,130
I love life here and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

1043
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,070
I'm content to watch our region's famous snowflakes

1044
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,570
fall from the sky.

1045
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,110
People would come from all over to see them

1046
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,740
but they're almost nonexistent now.

1047
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,580
From that alone, I'd say it's obvious something's amiss.

1048
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,320
- Hey, Akane, has Hippocrates returned yet?

1049
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:03,490
- Do not worry, I'll go out and find him.

1050
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,290
- It's too late to go alone.

1051
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,390
I'm coming with you.

1052
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,990
- Hold on, I'll go too.

1053
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,030
Goodbye, mister.

1054
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,630
I really appreciated your story.

1055
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,030
Thank you.

1056
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,330
(chuckles)

1057
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:18,940
- Well, it looks like he got

1058
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:20,470
the fuel he mentioned, at least.

1059
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,010
- Someone said Master Hippocrates brought back the coal

1060
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,750
and then left soon after.

1061
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,980
- Where the hell is he now then?

1062
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,490
(light energetic music)

1063
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,090
It feels a lot like spring out here.

1064
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,400
I love the breeze.

1065
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,000
- This area is called the Time of the Leaf Bud.

1066
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,300
Master Hippocrates lives here

1067
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,670
so we'll spot his house pretty soon.

1068
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,570
I'm actually from this forest too!

1069
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,210
- [Chii] Gee, I wonder which one is Hippocrates's house.

1070
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,540
- [Pipo] Those big brown things you see

1071
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,880
are the home, schools and workplaces of my people.

1072
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,580
- [Akane] Wow, they look like the tree's fruit.

1073
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,580
- What a perfect house for him.

1074
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,660
It looks just as bossy as he does. (chuckles)

1075
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,990
- If I could talk right now, I...

1076
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,260
Huh?

1077
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:17,030
How indecent of me fall into such brutish gestures.

1078
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:21,200
- If that's his house, do you think maybe he's at home?

1079
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,240
- No, I highly doubt it.

1080
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,440
That window will be open if he was.

1081
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,510
- He's way more irresponsible than I thought.

1082
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,210
He dragged us out on this adventure

1083
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,280
and now, he's suddenly MIA.

1084
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:35,050
- I did not invite you!

1085
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,620
Huh? (whimpering)

1086
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,250
- Either way, we need to keep moving forward.

1087
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,220
- Why are we in such a rush to get there?

1088
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,920
- Tomorrow morning is when the drop mist ceremony

1089
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,990
is set to happen.

1090
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,390
- [Both] Drop mist ceremony?

1091
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,630
- Yes, and we desperately need the goddess

1092
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,530
to save the prince so that he's able to be there for it.

1093
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:55,400
That's why you're here.

1094
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,610
(melancholic music)

1095
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,150
- [Chii] Seems like Zan Gu went through here.

1096
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,510
- [Pipo] He was probably making a visit

1097
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,020
to the Sakasatongari market.

1098
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:12,920
(birds chirping)

1099
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:18,020
All right, so the council is just over this mountain range.

1100
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:18,960
(sighs)

1101
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,390
- Still a long way to go.

1102
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,860
- That's right.

1103
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,600
And we need to get there before sunset, otherwise...

1104
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,670
Huh?

1105
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,370
(grunts)

1106
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,430
Go on, shoo!

1107
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:34,270
- Ugh, there've been too many flies around since yesterday.

1108
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:35,840
Now, die!

1109
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,380
(grunting)

1110
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:41,550
(slow tense music)

1111
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,690
(sighs)

1112
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,690
I missed the stupid little thing.

1113
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,960
- What a terrifying woman.

1114
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,860
That was close.

1115
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,000
- Oh, yeah!

1116
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:00,270
I just remembered there's a shortcut to the left up ahead!

1117
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,370
- Hey, that's where I smacked my shoe!

1118
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,100
- Yes, thanks to me!

1119
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,010
- Thanks, Chii, couldn't have done it without you.

1120
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:07,870
- Imbecile!

1121
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,240
- Careful, Chii!

1122
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,480
We're real close to the edge.

1123
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,350
- Can't help it.

1124
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,220
(exclaiming)

1125
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,750
(tense music)

1126
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,200
- We'll never make it.

1127
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,070
Let's go back.

1128
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,570
- Oh, I don't like this.

1129
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,980
We have no choice.

1130
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,380
- Yes, we do!

1131
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:46,480
Hey, wait!

1132
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,280
At least let me out first!

1133
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:51,020
(tense music)

1134
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,660
(whimpering)

1135
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:04,260
- Hey, so, is there a boy at school you like?

1136
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,100
- What?

1137
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:06,370
- Just trying to chat.

1138
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,400
Well, is there?

1139
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,270
- No, there isn't.

1140
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,340
Too childish.

1141
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:11,600
- Uh-huh, maybe in a few years,

1142
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,840
you'll change your mind

1143
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,340
and be madly in love with one of them.

1144
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,410
- Yeah, fat chance.

1145
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,410
- Oh, come on.

1146
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,380
Now, your being childish.

1147
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,010
Love is love and that's that.

1148
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,250
- I just don't wanna end up getting dumped like you do.

1149
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,020
(grunts)

1150
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,150
- Huh?

1151
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:30,860
- "When we met, he said he loved free-spirited girls.

1152
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:33,390
But now, he say that I'm too free-spirited.

1153
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:36,600
Men are the worst, aren't they, Midori?"

1154
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,100
- Oh, that guy.

1155
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,300
We'll that was just.

1156
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,470
(cracks) (tense music)

1157
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,040
(screaming)

1158
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:59,150
(Chii and Akane panting)

1159
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,730
I will find happiness, I swear it.

1160
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:15,670
(lively music) (giggling)

1161
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:23,580
It's nice driving on a bridge that doesn't swing.

1162
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:24,810
- It sure is.

1163
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,180
- [Pipo] Feel free to breeze through here.

1164
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,450
- 'Kay!

1165
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,520
- [Akane And Chii] Huh?

1166
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,120
(tense music)

1167
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,450
(shrieks)

1168
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,320
- Oh!

1169
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,520
(screaming)

1170
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,090
(splashing)

1171
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,970
(whimpers)

1172
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,800
That was scary!

1173
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:50,340
You mind warning us in advance next time, Pipo?

1174
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:53,740
- Sorry, I didn't think you'd believe me.

1175
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,850
- So, what are we supposed to do now?

1176
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,180
- [Pipo] We gotta keep moving!

1177
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:01,780
- What? And go where?

1178
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,420
- With this, you can breathe and stay dry in the water

1179
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:08,090
just like that.

1180
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,360
- Wait a minute, really?

1181
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,960
- Come on, follow me!

1182
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,660
(Pipo grunting)

1183
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,060
(sighs)

1184
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,400
(inhales deeply)

1185
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,670
- Huh?

1186
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,740
- Whoa!

1187
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:25,710
- It's dangerous, Chii.

1188
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,770
- I'll go in first.

1189
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,680
(groans)

1190
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,720
(inhales deeply)

1191
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,700
(calm mellow music)

1192
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:57,830
(mellow music)

1193
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,970
- [Hippocrates] I shall take a different route and catch up.

1194
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,500
The water level has decreased quite a bit here.

1195
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,110
(somber music)

1196
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,740
- [Man] Do you know where the duke is?

1197
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,470
- [Man] He mentioned he was going to see the prince.

1198
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,980
(tense somber music)

1199
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:28,690
- Lock it.

1200
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,960
- Yes, sir.

1201
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,560
- Is the prince still the same?

1202
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,830
- Yes.

1203
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,470
- It's strange that Ron hasn't been here either.

1204
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,290
(gasps)

1205
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,330
(sighs)

1206
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:13,730
Honestly, what an irresponsible old wizard.

1207
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,670
He's fast asleep while the prince is trapped

1208
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,440
within that iron doll.

1209
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,610
- [Man] On the day before the drop mist ceremony,

1210
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,110
the prince was supposed to return to his original form.

1211
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,780
- [Duke] That's what we were told but.

1212
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:29,020
(melancholic music)

1213
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:35,890
(lively fanfare music)

1214
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:42,860
- Now, we're off to the ceremony.

1215
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,160
- Where is it?

1216
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,070
- Over by the water well in the market.

1217
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,770
- Will the prince be there too?

1218
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,170
Wouldn't that mean he's been cured?

1219
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,370
- No idea.

1220
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,510
I guess we'll find out when we see him.

1221
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,580
- [Chii] Well we're still going

1222
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:57,240
to Sakasatongari market anyway.

1223
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,450
(buzzing)

1224
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,790
- Huh? Hold on.

1225
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,090
This fly.

1226
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,260
- Yes, that's right.

1227
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,500
Surely, my apprentice would know me.

1228
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,540
(laughing)

1229
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,910
This fly's got a funny little mustache on him! (laughing)

1230
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,940
(sighs)

1231
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:29,340
- Get rid of it.

1232
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:29,980
It's gross.

1233
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,510
- Oh yeah, of course.

1234
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:32,380
Shoo!

1235
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,780
(scoffs)

1236
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:37,150
- [Hippocrates] Curse this!

1237
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:42,460
(mellow music)

1238
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,100
- [Chii] A cat?

1239
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,470
- [Pipo] Master Kamadoma really likes cats

1240
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,770
more than anyone I know.

1241
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,410
People who come from outside the city

1242
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,010
have to pass through this guard house.

1243
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,480
- [Akane] Wait, why?

1244
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,110
- [Chii] It's like immigration if I had to guess.

1245
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,150
- Next!

1246
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,760
(jolly music)

1247
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:21,160
Stand right there, please.

1248
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:27,000
(cats groaning)

1249
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,610
(groaning)

1250
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,080
What's inside this package here?

1251
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,410
- Oh, it's a sweater

1252
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,650
for the contest happening at the market.

1253
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:44,280
(gasping)

1254
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,790
- You're free to pass!

1255
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:52,060
(giggling)

1256
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,230
- Wait!

1257
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,940
(blowing)

1258
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:07,770
That one's not allowed to pass!

1259
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:08,940
- Gorobeh?

1260
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:10,040
- Is that your cat?

1261
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:15,080
- We'll now start the trial process.

1262
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,750
- Wait, a trial?

1263
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:17,780
With Gorobeh?

1264
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:20,990
- You, did I just hear you laugh?

1265
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,120
- No, no, no, no, I would never do that.

1266
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,190
Oh, that's right.

1267
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:27,490
I have something for you.

1268
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,360
Ta-da!

1269
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,660
- [Cats] Huh?

1270
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,770
- Here you go.

1271
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,600
(cats gasping)

1272
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:36,100
(chomping)

1273
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,770
Nice, nice. (chuckling)

1274
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,940
- [Akane] Definitely a witch.

1275
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:41,940
- Idiots!

1276
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,680
Don't let this human tame you!

1277
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,450
(cats whimpering)

1278
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,720
(munching)

1279
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:55,150
(slurping)

1280
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,860
(gasps)

1281
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:02,090
A trial, this is a trial!

1282
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,130
(giggling)

1283
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,970
You, over there!

1284
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:14,240
- Huh?

1285
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:16,640
- [Chii] Hm?

1286
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,080
- You're guilty!

1287
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,950
- Wait, but why?

1288
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,280
- Hold on a minute.

1289
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,850
This girl is a. (yells)

1290
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,020
- Guilty?

1291
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:25,790
What in the world could she be accused of?

1292
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,920
- She's committed the greatest crime known to our species.

1293
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,920
Pulling an innocent cat's tail.

1294
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,930
(gasps)

1295
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,190
- You did, Akane?

1296
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,730
- [Akane] Mm-hm.

1297
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,100
- Now then, tail-puller,

1298
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:40,600
you shall be punished for your despicable crime!

1299
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:42,640
(gasps)

1300
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,040
(gasps)

1301
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:46,870
- Huh?

1302
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,040
- Huh?

1303
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:53,280
(cats grunting) (Chii laughing)

1304
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,880
- So, no more tail-pulling?

1305
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,820
- No more, I promise!

1306
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,720
I'll never do it again!

1307
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,920
(grunting)

1308
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,760
(tail pops)

1309
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,290
(cats grunts)

1310
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,300
- Sigil of love!

1311
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:21,240
(Chii giggling)

1312
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,280
- You didn't have to laugh so much.

1313
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,810
- I guess he won't be teasing Gorobeh anymore.

1314
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,050
(fly buzzing)

1315
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:37,290
(mellow calm music)

1316
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:47,770
(Chii laughing)

1317
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,540
Isn't this exciting?

1318
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,810
Hey, can we take a quick look around?

1319
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,570
- The sweater contest is more important right now.

1320
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:58,440
- Come on, Akane, just for a little bit, please?

1321
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,710
- What a child.

1322
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,250
Where do I even take this anyway?

1323
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,290
- Oh, it's over there!

1324
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,030
- I'm going to the welcome cat's tent

1325
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,600
two flights down, okay?

1326
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,300
So stay nearby.

1327
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,000
- Yes, ma'am.

1328
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:20,870
(laughing)

1329
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,730
- She's fast.

1330
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:25,940
(people chattering)

1331
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:28,640
(Chii laughing)

1332
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:35,410
What's that?

1333
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:37,880
- That's the timeless rain well.

1334
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,190
The prince will prepare for the drop mist ceremony

1335
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,320
in that blue and white tent there.

1336
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:50,060
- [Akane] Here you go, sir.

1337
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,530
This is a great sweater.

1338
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,100
It's dyed a beautiful shade of red with Cockscomb flower

1339
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:56,240
and it's really warm.

1340
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,360
- Master Kamadoma is still asleep.

1341
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:20,430
The prince remains in that doll.

1342
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,900
We have to carry out the ceremony.

1343
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,700
No matter the cost.

1344
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,740
(gasps)

1345
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:41,410
(creaking)(snoring)

1346
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,890
- How in the hell are we supposed to get inside?

1347
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,390
- Master Kamadoma!

1348
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:52,630
(Kamadoma groaning)

1349
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,790
- Take a look, it's a dried scallop.

1350
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,700
It goes really great with a drink or two.

1351
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,800
How about we swap?

1352
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,200
These wet tissues are useful for everything.

1353
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:02,230
This one here is super warm.

1354
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,940
So, mind giving me a freebie?

1355
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,070
- This place is enormous.

1356
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,840
Where did she run off to?

1357
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:10,910
- [Man] Word has that the prince is definitely here.

1358
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:13,150
- When I first heard the rumor, he was ill,

1359
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:15,250
I started feeling very uneasy.

1360
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,750
- Don't worry.

1361
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,020
Things will be fine as long as he carries out the ceremony.

1362
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,720
- Oh, yes, you're right.

1363
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,560
- So, has the ceremony ever been failed

1364
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,520
by anyone in the past before?

1365
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,430
- Yes, but thankfully, it succeeds more often than not.

1366
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,660
- What happens if it fails?

1367
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,930
- [Vendor] Hey, that twerp stole from me!

1368
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:34,770
Catch it!

1369
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,300
(energetic music)

1370
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,170
Damn it!

1371
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,470
- It's that guy!

1372
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,410
- Please follow him, hurry!

1373
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,780
(vendor grunts)

1374
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:50,150
Akane, I think I actually might know him.

1375
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,580
- Huh?

1376
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,590
- We went to the same school together.

1377
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,350
His name was Ron back then.

1378
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,360
For some reason, he was always bothering me.

1379
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:02,130
(mellow music)

1380
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:10,040
After graduation?

1381
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,140
Well, you see, my biggest goal right now

1382
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:14,510
is to be an alchemist.

1383
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:16,680
- If you're gonna be an alchemist,

1384
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,310
then I'm gonna be better than you

1385
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:20,650
as the greatest wizard in the whole world!

1386
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,920
- [Pipo] Hm?

1387
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,180
I heard a rumor that he became an apprentice

1388
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,220
to Master Kamadoma.

1389
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:29,190
So I wonder why he looks like that.

1390
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:32,760
(light fast-paced music)

1391
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,660
- There's a guard house up ahead.

1392
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:36,630
We can catch up once they stop him.

1393
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:40,300
Huh?

1394
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,570
What the?

1395
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:44,900
(mellow music)

1396
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,910
- Cats know how to get a good nappin', don't they?

1397
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,580
(light fast-paced music)

1398
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:08,290
(tense music)

1399
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,930
- If the armored mouse is here, then-

1400
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,930
- [Pipo] Zan Gu must be here too.

1401
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,010
- I managed to snatch some good stuff

1402
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,850
from the market for us.

1403
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,120
It's finally time.

1404
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,460
- What are they gonna do?

1405
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:41,260
- I'll read their lips.

1406
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,060
Stay still.

1407
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,070
- It'll go just as planned.

1408
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,900
The armored mouse's new cannon is gonna destroy that well!

1409
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,540
(cackles)

1410
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,240
- It's gonna be a blast.

1411
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,510
What do we do?

1412
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,280
They're gonna destroy the timeless rain well.

1413
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,380
- Is that bad?

1414
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:59,380
- [Pipo] Yes, that will is essential

1415
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:00,710
for this world's survival.

1416
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,820
- Hey, aren't you gonna eat?

1417
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:07,690
I understand how you must be feeling

1418
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,890
but we can't change our minds now.

1419
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:13,290
That well is the cause of all this trouble.

1420
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:14,490
You said if it's gone,

1421
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:17,330
we don't have to keep destroying things.

1422
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,000
- One of the shining bugs died.

1423
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:20,830
- Hm?

1424
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:24,800
It's fine, we only need like one or two anyway.

1425
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,070
(clangs)

1426
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,270
What the heck, man?

1427
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:29,040
Did I just make you angry?

1428
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:31,180
Well, you can work it out on your own!

1429
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,390
- [Kamadoma] What are you all doing?

1430
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,120
- No one is allowed to enter!

1431
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,360
(gasps)

1432
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:48,690
Master Kamadoma.

1433
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:51,460
We have been waiting for you.

1434
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,300
The prince needs-

1435
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,670
- Ah, excuse me.

1436
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,740
I do have some good news for you all.

1437
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,640
That is not the prince in that bed.

1438
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:01,270
(men gasping)

1439
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,940
Such amateur magic.

1440
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:08,450
(puffs)

1441
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,450
(men gasps)

1442
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,150
The plating has now been removed.

1443
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,660
(Chii grunts)

1444
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,160
- Where did Akane run off to?

1445
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:22,130
Well, I'm sure she'll come back if I wait here for her.

1446
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,570
(sighs)

1447
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,800
Man, what a great haul. (chuckles)

1448
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,040
(sighs)

1449
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:35,140
- It's impossible.

1450
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:37,340
There's no way we can stop them on our own.

1451
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,510
- They may have a cannon

1452
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,510
but it will be useless without ammo.

1453
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:42,750
I'll do my best to try and distract them.

1454
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,150
You steal the shells while they're not looking.

1455
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,020
- Huh?

1456
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,160
- There he is!

1457
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,620
Perhaps I, huh?

1458
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,360
It seems I have a colleague.

1459
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,930
It's quite odd for a fly to be that interested in a carrot.

1460
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,400
Colleague?

1461
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,740
I've almost turned into a proper fly.

1462
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:08,410
Hm?

1463
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,080
I should have known this would happen.

1464
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,740
The momentum anchor has become an issue.

1465
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:29,900
(somber music)

1466
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,470
(engine chugging)

1467
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,170
- Hey, what are you doing?

1468
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:47,810
Wait, now?

1469
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,380
But the plan was to blast the well

1470
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:51,520
in front of everyone tomorrow!

1471
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,950
Are you listening?

1472
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:56,560
- You don't understand me at all, do you?

1473
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:58,120
- You're right, I don't!

1474
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,190
That's why I-

1475
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,090
- You're just a poor excusable wizard.

1476
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:08,200
All you were able to do is change me into a hideous monster.

1477
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,230
- I'm sorry.

1478
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,410
I tried my best!

1479
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,440
You know that, don't you?

1480
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:17,510
I wanted you to be happy!

1481
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:19,540
I didn't want the prince to hate me!

1482
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,680
- [Both] Huh?

1483
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,350
(somber music)

1484
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:29,590
- [Prince] Hey you, do something!

1485
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,420
You're a wizard, aren't you?

1486
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,290
- Yeah, but-

1487
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,490
- [Prince] If you are able to make me talk in this form,

1488
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:38,600
then you should be able to change me back!

1489
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:39,770
So, do it!

1490
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,630
(tinkles)

1491
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:43,740
- Ah!

1492
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:48,470
(tinkling)(grunting)

1493
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,190
- I am not the prince!

1494
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,760
I am Zan Gu now!

1495
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,270
- I'm pretty sure that Master Kamadoma

1496
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,210
will be waking up soon.

1497
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,670
He's gonna be mad.

1498
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:25,140
- Then we'll have to destroy Kamadoma too.

1499
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:28,110
- What? That's not even possible!

1500
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:33,320
- Stop, Zan Gu!

1501
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:38,990
(grunting) (tense music)

1502
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,670
It's important to you, right?

1503
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,370
Please, don't destroy it.

1504
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,440
- What do you know?

1505
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:54,340
- If the water doesn't flow,

1506
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:56,880
this entire world is gonna dry up soon.

1507
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:58,110
- It's not your business!

1508
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,310
Nobody asked you so shut up, will you?

1509
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:04,920
- Ron, long time no see.

1510
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:06,590
- What are you talking about?

1511
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,920
I don't know anybody with that name.

1512
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:11,320
- You don't need to pretend anymore.

1513
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,690
If the timeless rain well is destroyed,

1514
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,390
there'll be consequences.

1515
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:16,700
(melancholic music)

1516
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:18,760
The forest where we grew up and went to school

1517
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,570
will eventually die.

1518
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,200
And all our families and friends

1519
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:24,240
will be in despair because of it.

1520
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,240
- So what?

1521
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:26,940
Don't talk to me like we're friends.

1522
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,510
- But we are, aren't we, Ron?

1523
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:38,420
(Hippocrates sobbing)

1524
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,690
- Look at that, it seems the prince and Ron

1525
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,860
are closer than we thought.

1526
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,020
- Are you certain?

1527
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:48,190
- I'll go get them immediately.

1528
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,560
- No, the prince needs to decide

1529
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,760
if he wants to come back or not.

1530
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,830
However, I should still break the spell on them.

1531
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,540
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1532
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:02,470
Stop pretending like you know everything, you will twerp!

1533
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,310
(zaps)

1534
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,680
- Ron!

1535
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:07,180
(zaps)

1536
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,610
- Huh?

1537
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:10,680
(energetic music)

1538
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,150
- Mr. Hippocrates!

1539
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,020
- Akane!

1540
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,090
- Master Hippocrates!

1541
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:20,790
(zaps)

1542
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:21,760
(gasps)

1543
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:24,030
(neighing)

1544
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:26,400
- Over here!

1545
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:27,500
It's safer.

1546
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:28,700
Pipo, the carrot!

1547
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:30,470
- Right!

1548
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,340
Ron.

1549
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:33,970
Ron!

1550
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:37,880
(yelling)

1551
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:40,680
To the exit!

1552
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:43,320
(whimpering)

1553
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:46,890
(neighing)

1554
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,350
(yelling)

1555
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,790
(slaps)

1556
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:51,820
(neighing)

1557
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:54,890
(energetic music)

1558
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,600
(grunts)

1559
01:27:57,630 --> 01:27:59,200
Master Hippocrates!

1560
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:18,750
- Please, turn around.

1561
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:20,120
I want out.

1562
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,950
- Just try and stop me.

1563
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:26,260
If you're truly the Goddess of the Green Wind,

1564
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:27,690
then stop me.

1565
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:30,530
(somber music)

1566
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,110
(grunting)

1567
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:54,290
Those bugs are scared.

1568
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,720
They're nothing, completely insignificant.

1569
01:28:57,890 --> 01:28:59,660
And you are the same.

1570
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,000
(somber music)

1571
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:07,070
- Stop it!

1572
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:18,880
- We all die eventually.

1573
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:20,080
- But even so!

1574
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:23,520
- Better hold on.

1575
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:25,220
Here comes the wall.

1576
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,320
(crashing)

1577
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,760
(whimpering)

1578
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:48,670
(people exclaiming)

1579
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:56,510
(crashing)

1580
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:59,220
(ominous music)

1581
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:31,480
Move.

1582
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,650
- Do not do this, Zan Gu.

1583
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:35,520
You're making a massive mistake!

1584
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:39,460
(ominous music)

1585
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,140
- [Captain] First platoon up the stairs.

1586
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:54,210
Everyone else, hold!

1587
01:30:57,310 --> 01:30:58,840
- You were afraid, right?

1588
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:05,580
You were scared of it, rhe ceremony.

1589
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,060
It had been decided for you when you were born.

1590
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,230
But still, you didn't wanna do it, huh?

1591
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:18,200
- Three generations of men before me

1592
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:21,100
succeeded at their drop mist ceremonies.

1593
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,570
(melancholic music)

1594
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,240
I knew that one day, it would be my turn to perform it.

1595
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:50,500
But as I got older, my defiance suddenly began to grow.

1596
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,500
After my parents died in succession,

1597
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:55,830
I would sometimes sneak out of the castle

1598
01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:57,540
and head over Nibi.

1599
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:00,000
One day, I ran into some delinquents

1600
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,270
who robbed me of my belongings.

1601
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:06,980
As the drop mist ceremony quickly approached,

1602
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:09,850
my fear and anger only increased.

1603
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,450
Kamadoma noticed, he became worried

1604
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:16,790
as the ceremony coincided with his deep sleep

1605
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:19,890
so he confined me inside of a small iron doll.

1606
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,700
- If you destroy that well,

1607
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,270
will your fear and anger go away?

1608
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,640
(light mellow music)

1609
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:39,210
How about I help with the ceremony?

1610
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:45,550
I mean I'm supposed to be the goddess after all.

1611
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:48,890
Totally makes sense, doesn't it?

1612
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,020
I'll help you out.

1613
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,490
You'll succeed for sure.

1614
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:57,900
You see, I've been through tons of villages and towns

1615
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:59,460
before coming to this world.

1616
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,870
So I was surprised to see how amazing it was.

1617
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:05,470
This place, it's so beautiful and filled with color.

1618
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:10,280
We have more advanced technology where I'm from,

1619
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:13,380
which makes things convenient but also inconvenient.

1620
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:16,920
I love the bright colors of the flowers here.

1621
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:19,920
And the stars in the night sky.

1622
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:25,220
But my world neglects all that.

1623
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:32,800
So I'm asking you to please protect this world.

1624
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,070
Only you can do it.

1625
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,530
I believe in you.

1626
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,100
(enchanting moving music)

1627
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,340
(gasps)

1628
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:56,420
(mellow moving music)

1629
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:05,700
You're back to being you again.

1630
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:12,300
(all gasp)

1631
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:16,310
- I've finally returned.

1632
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:19,740
- The prince is back to normal!

1633
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,780
(melancholic music)

1634
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:57,280
- [Chii] Sorry for leaving you alone.

1635
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,620
Were you scared?

1636
01:34:58,650 --> 01:34:59,880
- Mm-mm.

1637
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,250
Mr. Hippocrates, I've done some thinking

1638
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:04,160
and I think we should give the prince

1639
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:06,360
the momentum anchor, however,

1640
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:10,030
I know it was really difficult to make

1641
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:14,330
but honestly, it's done a lot for me, like give me courage.

1642
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,500
I know it's possible to make another one.

1643
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,770
After all, you're the best alchemist in this entire world.

1644
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:25,280
- Well, I can only make such a precious item

1645
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:27,180
in my laboratory.

1646
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:29,480
(groans)

1647
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,620
- [Akane] I'm sorry, Chii.

1648
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,690
- It's fine, get in.

1649
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,030
What's that?

1650
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:45,200
- This is a strong fuel made from valuable dragon's dung.

1651
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:46,760
- Dragon's dung?

1652
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:49,770
- Time to fly.

1653
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,640
(energetic music)

1654
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:11,960
(grunts)

1655
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:14,830
(engine whirring)

1656
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:22,970
(clanking)

1657
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:36,610
- [Chii] Hm?

1658
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:43,820
(giggles)

1659
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,460
- My lab is upstairs.

1660
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,600
- I lit the fireplace for you.

1661
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:00,540
(window clacking)

1662
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:04,580
(mysterious ambient music)

1663
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:17,520
- Keep stirring.

1664
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,460
Keep it slow.

1665
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,560
Now, take in the light of the moon.

1666
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:28,100
Then say a small prayer in your mind, deep within your mind.

1667
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:29,400
- Right.

1668
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:32,570
(light mellow music)

1669
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,010
- Master Hippocrates.

1670
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,780
- Be sure to keep it steady.

1671
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,360
(energetic music)

1672
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:52,620
- Hey, I forgot to ask.

1673
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,630
Where were you after the snowy town?

1674
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:57,700
(exhaust blazing)

1675
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:02,100
- We have arrived.

1676
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:12,710
- Master Kamadoma, it's time to change your clothes.

1677
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,110
(Kamadoma groans)

1678
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:16,550
- Will you be all right?

1679
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,450
- [Guard] Stop!

1680
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,050
Master Hippocrates.

1681
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:24,420
- Pardon me.

1682
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,460
- What is it?

1683
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:26,520
- Wait!

1684
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:29,160
Akane.

1685
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:31,160
- Forgive me, I'm a little late.

1686
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,400
This momentum anchor's for you.

1687
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,340
May I?

1688
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:40,200
- Of course.

1689
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:49,680
(mysterious music) (gasps)

1690
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:51,350
- I have a matching one.

1691
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:52,950
If you feel like you wanna run,

1692
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:55,990
this will help you move forward in any situation.

1693
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:58,220
It's power helped me get to the castle.

1694
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,830
Also that I could meet you, see?

1695
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:04,330
- I'll trust it.

1696
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:08,330
- The mantle of the goddess, give it to her.

1697
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:09,330
- [Woman] Yes, sir.

1698
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:13,070
(mellow orchestral music)

1699
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:26,050
- I was wondering,

1700
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,750
what happens if he fails the drop mist ceremony?

1701
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,390
- Then he will lose his life.

1702
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,590
- Huh?

1703
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,820
- But by performing that drastic sacrifice,

1704
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,590
he will ensure that our world

1705
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:38,560
will be filled as water until the next generation.

1706
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,070
The royal rain family has been tied to water

1707
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,370
for many, many years.

1708
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,170
And as the prince, I'm sure that boy is well aware of this.

1709
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:50,270
(suspenseful music)

1710
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,460
- You're scared?

1711
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:13,700
- Mm-mm.

1712
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:03,180
(tinkling)

1713
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:21,830
(sighs)

1714
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:27,540
(spectators murmuring)

1715
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:30,980
- Something went wrong. - What's going on?

1716
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,790
(gasps)

1717
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:45,790
(wind blowing)

1718
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:07,240
- Hm, what?

1719
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:10,710
- The ceremony was a failure.

1720
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:13,580
Now, I must dedicate my body to the well.

1721
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:14,820
Huh?

1722
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:17,350
Wait a second, but that's so cruel!

1723
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:19,090
Hey, tell him to stop!

1724
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,130
- Are you suggesting cruel things don't happen

1725
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,400
for the greater benefit of many in your world?

1726
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:25,860
- It's fine, Akane.

1727
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:34,970
Thank you.

1728
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:36,910
Farewell.

1729
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:46,250
- Akane!

1730
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:50,220
(both grunting)

1731
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:59,430
(creaking)

1732
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:02,130
(swooshing)

1733
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,170
(gasps)

1734
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,480
(tinkling)

1735
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:21,020
- Well done, prince, good work.

1736
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:25,420
I saw your admirable resolution as the rain king.

1737
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:26,460
Congratulations.

1738
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:31,000
Show your gratitude to that girl.

1739
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:33,760
Reward her bravery.

1740
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,830
- Yes!

1741
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:38,540
(swooshing)

1742
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,240
- [Woman] They're here!

1743
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:42,870
They're alive!

1744
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:44,510
- [Woman] What happened?

1745
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:46,240
- She's still alive!

1746
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:48,880
- I won't jump again, so don't worry.

1747
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:51,880
- [Man] How's that possible?

1748
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,880
- Wait, Akane, let me go.

1749
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,050
The ceremony!

1750
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:02,890
(woman vocalizing)

1751
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:13,140
(uplifting foreign language music)

1752
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,470
(Prince grunting)

1753
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,560
(people cheering)

1754
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:27,680
(panting)

1755
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:35,720
(mellow foreign language music)

1756
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:14,660
- If you look on that wall,

1757
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:18,000
you'll see the hand print of the goddess from 600 years ago.

1758
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:22,130
(Akane grunting)

1759
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,200
- Aw, and I thought we fixed it.

1760
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:30,370
- It's strange how the goddess always seems to trip there.

1761
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,850
- I should return the momentum anchor.

1762
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,810
- There's no need.

1763
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:37,250
- Huh?

1764
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,020
- You haven't had the anchor for quite some time.

1765
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,920
I gave you an opportunity but in the end,

1766
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:45,490
you moved forward of your own free will.

1767
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,790
- So you're admitting to being a fake then?

1768
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:49,930
- How rude!

1769
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,500
What's more important than the item

1770
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:54,300
is that it's user possessed as a strong mind.

1771
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:57,600
- Hm, that just sounds like a bad excuse to me.

1772
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:58,500
Well, you ready?

1773
01:46:58,540 --> 01:46:59,870
- Uh-huh.

1774
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:02,270
- I have a favorite ask you.

1775
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:04,880
(giggles)

1776
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:06,140
Muah!

1777
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:08,410
Muah!

1778
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,420
Thank you so much.

1779
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:12,520
- No problem.

1780
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:14,220
Muah!

1781
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:16,550
- Master Hippocrates!

1782
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:17,190
- Huh?

1783
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:19,060
- Aren't you so jealous?

1784
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:19,920
- Hardly!

1785
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:21,790
(laughing)

1786
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:22,730
Akane, for you.

1787
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:25,900
This is a gift that was made for the guest

1788
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:27,060
of the king of rain.

1789
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:30,400
- It's beautiful, thank you.

1790
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,270
- Pipo.

1791
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:36,610
(sighs)

1792
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:38,010
- We've been out here for three days.

1793
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:39,780
Midori must be pretty worried about us.

1794
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:40,810
- Yeah, you're right.

1795
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,250
- You needn't worry about that.

1796
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,650
Because one day in our world,

1797
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:46,620
it's only about an hour in your world.

1798
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:48,120
- Wait, is that true?

1799
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:50,750
So then, next time we come here.

1800
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,220
- Pipo and I will be gone.

1801
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:57,590
This world, however, will likely not change much.

1802
01:47:57,630 --> 01:47:58,760
That much I know.

1803
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:04,200
(mellow string music)

1804
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:07,140
That music will guide you both home.

1805
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:09,970
Now, go forward and move quickly.

1806
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:11,580
Be sure to never look back.

1807
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:16,050
- [Pipo] Take care!

1808
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,250
I'll miss you!

1809
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:22,050
- [Akane] We appreciate everything you've done for us.

1810
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:23,120
Thank you!

1811
01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:32,530
(energetic string music)

1812
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:36,500
- Oh, so that's where you've been.

1813
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,920
- Hey, Chii, I'm going home.

1814
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:54,280
- Yeah, sure, see you later.

1815
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,220
And who might you be?

1816
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,690
- I was here a few hours ago.

1817
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,330
You recommended this lamp to me, remember?

1818
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,800
When I used it at home, it worked like a charm.

1819
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:07,660
So I'd really like to buy it now if that's okay.

1820
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:15,040
Oh, you left those sitting around

1821
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:17,070
and I figured they needed water.

1822
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:18,240
You didn't come back right away

1823
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:21,140
so I went and found that vase in your kitchen.

1824
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,280
- You can have it.

1825
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:26,720
Just look after my shop for a while as payment.

1826
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,550
I'm taking a nap.

1827
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:31,760
- Hey, wait.

1828
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:36,660
- Play something that'll help me fall asleep.

1829
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:44,700
(mellow music)

1830
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:08,490
(mellow orchestral music)

1831
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:18,040
- Mom, I'm home!

1832
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:19,340
- [Midori] Welcome back.

1833
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:27,210
- I love you, Mom.

1834
