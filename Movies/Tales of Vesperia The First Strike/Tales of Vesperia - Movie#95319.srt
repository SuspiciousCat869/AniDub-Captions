1
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,916
Time has passed since the
devastating war between

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,416
humans and monsters
came at last to an end.

3
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,291
People have sought to secure
survival and prosperity

4
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:17,291
by harnessing the primeval
power known as aer.

5
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,708
When crystallized,
aer is formed into cores...

6
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:30,250
These cores, in turn,
are used to power "blastia."

7
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,458
We use many different types
of cores to create and power

8
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,916
a variety of blastia...

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,041
It is thanks to these that we
continue to live and to prosper.

10
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,291
Magic and monsters...

11
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:58,250
In this world ruled by powers
beyond human understanding,

12
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:02,958
we are faced continuously with
difficult decisions to make.

13
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,791
What should we protect...?
What should we give up...?

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,416
How should we live our lives?

15
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,541
Hold on! You're going to fast!

16
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,416
Pick up the pace, then.

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,541
Yuri...! Over here!

18
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,500
Done here. Next one!

19
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,583
How many are we setting?

20
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,416
Our team's got three.

21
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,291
Over here!

22
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:14,833
Come on, Flynn.

23
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,750
Right!

24
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,416
Don't go falling behind!

25
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,750
Do you think the other teams
are going to make it?

26
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,625
Slow it down. We have
to stick to the plan.

27
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,291
You can't just barge ahead
'cause you feel like it!

28
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,250
It's not like we have
time to wait around.

29
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,750
They're gaining on us.

30
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,666
Go on!

31
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,000
All yours!

32
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,458
All right!

33
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,500
Nobody mentioned
these guys to me...

34
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,583
Guess I'll improvise.

35
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,291
Okay, Yuri, we're all set here.
Now let's get going!

36
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,958
Where did those
things come from?

37
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,458
Has the operation failed?

38
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,083
No... I think we should
just keep on going.

39
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,083
Glad we rushed.

40
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,750
None of the other teams
are even here yet.

41
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,833
Will you shut up?

42
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,541
Everything's going
according to plan.

43
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,791
You can't talk to me like that!

44
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,500
Now I'm a little scared.

45
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,375
Wow! There are a ton of them.

46
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,125
Back that way.

47
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,833
Took you long enough.

48
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,791
Whoa, look over there.
What the hell is happening?

49
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,875
What now?

50
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,375
Chastel...! Everyone's here.

51
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,083
Hurry! Do something, Hisca!

52
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:25,000
Yurgis, quick...!
Get those two back here!

53
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,000
Yuri! Flynn! Fall back now!

54
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,250
Here we go.

55
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,083
O brilliant light,
be as a wall to allay arms.

56
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,375
Force Field!

57
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,458
Is it over?

58
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,833
Think so.

59
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,291
Yuri!

60
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,833
Flynn!

61
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:55,250
Your first job is over...
Not too shabby!

62
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,250
Yuri!

63
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,375
What's wrong this time?

64
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,500
What do you think is wrong?

65
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,458
Why didn't you
stick to the plan?

66
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,541
What's the big deal?

67
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,208
It all worked out
in the end, right?

68
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,708
We're in this together.

69
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,333
Your recklessness affects
every one of us, not just you.

70
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,375
Oh please, get off
my case already.

71
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,458
You're as fussy as an old lady.

72
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,166
And you're as
responsible as a toddler.

73
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,541
Enough, you two.
Shut up and calm down.

74
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,041
Go take care of the clean-up.

75
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,750
No more squabbling!

76
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,583
Yes, Sir.

77
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,750
Great, thanks to you
I've got a bump on my head.

78
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,250
Me? It was your fault.

79
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,958
Shut up!

80
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,416
Captain!

81
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,583
What is it, Lambert?

82
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,625
It seems the red trees
are approaching the town

83
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,750
more and more rapidly, sir.

84
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,208
Yeah...

85
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
The aer...

86
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,208
Are you ever planning to
put your full uniform on?

87
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,833
Yes, Mom, I'm going to
put it on in a minute...

88
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,833
You're such a stickler.
It's getting old.

89
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,000
And look at this floor!

90
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,791
Get off my back!

91
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,500
Talk about bad luck...

92
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,333
Getting assigned not
only to the same post,

93
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,583
but the same room as you...

94
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,458
Someone definitely
has it out for me.

95
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,375
Trust me, the
feeling is mutual...

96
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,833
I still don't get why you even
joined the Knights at all.

97
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,000
Boys, I'm coming in.

98
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,791
How can you not be ready yet?
It's time to go.

99
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,916
I'm sorry.

100
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,208
So hurry.

101
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,250
The town's so deserted,
and it's only been a month.

102
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,625
It was bad for business when
the monsters started appearing.

103
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,375
You guys are late.

104
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,916
I left Chris behind to wait.
Your shift's up next.

105
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,916
Yes sir.

106
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,458
Yuri...

107
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,208
Don't go running off on your
own like yesterday, all right?

108
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,708
Hey! Come back here
and say that again!

109
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,000
Seriously?!

110
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,958
Do you have to cause
trouble everywhere you go?

111
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,625
It's just his natural charm.

112
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,625
Shut up...!

113
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,375
Nobody thinks you're funny...

114
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,375
Ugh... this furball's annoying.

115
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,291
Be nice. Repede's
yours to look after.

116
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,666
I'm bored. Why don't you
show me your magic artes?

117
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,500
What...? But there's no
real need for it right now.

118
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,041
I didn't see it yesterday.
I was face-down in the dirt...

119
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,166
and they won't give us
rookies any blastia.

120
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,916
I don't think they'll
ever give you any.

121
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,083
With your connections,

122
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,625
I'm guessing you'll
get yours quickly...

123
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,208
Your father was one of the
Knights, too, now wasn't he?

124
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,458
Anything I get
I'll earn for myself.

125
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,875
Just show me.
We can call it education.

126
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,416
I'm not showing you anything
until you ask nicely.

127
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,416
Please... just... show...
me... damn... it.

128
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,083
That's not going to cut it.

129
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,958
That's it...?
That's pretty lame.

130
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,125
We specialize in healing
and defense artes.

131
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,416
Come here, Chastel!

132
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,000
This is another way
you can use blastia

133
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,958
to make it more powerful.

134
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,666
Hey... what are you doing?
That could've been dangerous.

135
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,000
Captain!

136
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,541
What are you doing here?

137
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,541
Checking the forest.

138
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,375
Now quit standing
around and go patrol!

139
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,041
Yes, Sir.

140
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,833
Hey, Captain...!
Take this with you.

141
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,250
I'm afraid it isn't very much,

142
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,708
since we can't go hunting
in the forest these days.

143
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,708
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

144
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,916
We'll have it safe again
as soon as possible.

145
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
All right, I'm going
to see Garista ...

146
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,083
You guys are on your own.

147
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,125
Yes, Sir.

148
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,666
Oh, uh, Captain...!

149
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,958
Would you take Repede
with you? He's a nuisance.

150
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,916
Go on, Lambert.

151
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
See you later.

152
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,333
Yeah.

153
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,166
Hey...! I've got what
you asked for, Captain.

154
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,750
Great... Toss it down.

155
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,625
Thanks a bunch.

156
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,541
He's so buddy-buddy with them...

157
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,666
The Knights in the capital
would never be so informal.

158
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,583
It's all part of
small town life...

159
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,875
We all gotta work
together around here.

160
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,291
Still... he's not a
typical Knight captain...

161
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,333
That makes it easier.

162
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,708
What's he thinking...?
Make the forest safe soon?

163
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,916
He promises them too much!

164
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,375
Garista!

165
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,583
Good afternoon, Captain Fedrok.

166
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,375
Same to you, Garista.

167
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,583
I would appreciate it

168
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,416
if you kept your voice
down in the library.

169
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,875
Come on. I want your
opinion on something.

170
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,750
So, you're doing
well in the forest...

171
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,291
Most of the monsters
have been subdued.

172
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,666
Yes, thanks mainly
to your strategy.

173
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,333
One thing...
While in the forest,

174
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,791
we noticed an
unusual amount of aer.

175
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,708
It's making the plants
and animals crazy.

176
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,083
Then you believe aer is behind

177
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,458
the sudden surge
in monster activity?

178
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,083
And the unseasonal red foliage?

179
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,500
Not just that.

180
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,750
Our blastia acted up a little
during the mission, too.

181
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,083
That's troubling indeed.

182
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,000
And your hypothesis is
that there is so much aer

183
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,333
spewing out that it's
affecting the blastia.

184
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah. There won't be
much point in trying to

185
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,166
clear out the monsters
unless we can stop it.

186
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,916
Do you have any idea
where it's coming from?

187
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,375
You know those ruins
in the lake upriver...?

188
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,125
Seeing as the red trees
lead off in that direction,

189
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,958
I'm thinking there
might be something there

190
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,291
we should look into.

191
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,958
And whatever this
"something" is,

192
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,541
you believe that it's
releasing the aer.

193
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,500
Interesting...

194
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,333
Some sort of blastia, perhaps?

195
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,291
Those old ruins have been
abandoned for many years...

196
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,000
Any sort of activity
would be strange...

197
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,458
We will need to
investigate quickly.

198
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,833
A mandate arrived today
from the capital...

199
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,000
It says you're to attend
the ceremony to celebrate

200
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,166
the tenth anniversary
of the Great War's end.

201
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,875
It isn't a Knight's
duty to stand around

202
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,166
dressed all formal
and twiddle his thumbs.

203
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,791
That's a difficult thing
to explain to Headquarters.

204
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,208
If you're going to
attend the ceremony,

205
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,458
you'll need to leave soon.

206
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,666
Yeah, yeah...

207
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,416
Anyway, do you know
anybody who's an expert

208
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,416
on aer or blastia?

209
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,541
Let's see... Actually, I do.

210
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,166
I believe there's
a blastia researcher

211
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,125
named Rita Mordio who
has a laboratory nearby.

212
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,833
Good. Where is it?

213
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,375
What about the ceremony...?

214
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,833
It's in three days.

215
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,291
I'll send somebody else.

216
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,375
His Excellency ordered it.

217
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,375
I deem this far more urgent...

218
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,750
It's my first priority.

219
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,875
Fine... if you insist...

220
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,875
but I think there's one
more thing you should know.

221
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,208
The researcher I told you about

222
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,875
can be a bit
difficult to deal with.

223
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,166
I'd suggest bringing
a gift along for her.

224
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,750
Man, I'm glad the shift's over.

225
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,916
It's exhausting. I feel like
I'm always on-edge lately.

226
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,250
Well then, I have an idea.

227
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,833
What's this great idea?

228
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,000
We should stop by here later.

229
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,291
No thanks. I think I'll pass.

230
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,833
Too good to hang out with us?

231
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,000
He can be such a prude.

232
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,208
Oh, no. This place is
filled with guild men.

233
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,291
This is just our luck.

234
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,958
Guild men? What are
you talking about?

235
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,625
I'm sure you had them
in the lower quarter, too.

236
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,875
They act like vigilantes,

237
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,500
but all they really care
about is making money...

238
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,000
They're part of a larger
group called the Union,

239
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,250
which is led by Don Whitehorse.

240
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,166
Basically, they're
a nasty bunch.

241
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,791
Yuri, come back here!

242
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,250
See, this guy wanted safe
passage all the way to

243
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,291
the town on the other
side of the forest...

244
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,000
So I told him, "Alright,
but you're gonna have to

245
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,875
give me all your
money up front."

246
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,125
Don't even think about it.

247
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,541
Welcome!

248
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,833
We'll have two Mabo Curries...
oh... and some milk, please.

249
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,541
Oh, isn't he adorable?

250
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,166
Is this little guy
a member, too?

251
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,000
He hasn't been
officially enlisted yet.

252
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,208
I'll be back in just a minute.

253
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,833
Thanks...

254
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,541
It was a real pain
in the ass, though,

255
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,416
so I kept all the money
and ditched him

256
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,208
the minute we got
outta the forest.

257
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,291
You were supposed to escort
him all the way to town.

258
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,916
That wasn't very nice of you.

259
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,291
Scamming people
out of their money

260
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,375
and then using it
to booze it up.

261
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,583
You're a real prince,
aren't you?

262
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,625
Yo... You got some
spunk, huh, Mr. Knight?

263
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,958
How about you say that
again, to my face?

264
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,916
You lowlife thugs are all alike.
You guys are a dime a dozen.

265
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,416
Eh?!

266
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,833
Could you lean back a bit?
I'm not looking for a boyfriend.

267
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,625
You little punk.

268
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,208
Come on...

269
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,416
Come on, Flynn... Do something.

270
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,625
I'm staying right here.

271
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,291
Yuri's the one who
started it all...

272
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,708
It has nothing to do with--

273
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,958
Hey, kid. You think
you're some big shot?

274
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,791
I said I don't want
to be part of this!

275
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,208
Hey!

276
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,125
And who the hell are you?

277
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,458
Hey!

278
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:32,875
Bastard!

279
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,541
That is enough!

280
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,625
What was going through your head

281
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,250
when you dared draw
a blade in here?

282
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,416
But... but you see, sir...

283
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,500
Very sorry, sir.

284
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,208
You've got balls...

285
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,625
Too bad you decided to
become a dog of the Empire.

286
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,500
I'm Merzhom Keida...

287
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:17,125
The man in charge of
the guild in this town.

288
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,875
Yuri... Yuri Lowell.
Nice to meet you.

289
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,125
Work's all but
dried up lately...

290
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:27,125
It's got all of my men
a bit high-strung.

291
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,833
From now on I'll make sure
they see every job through...

292
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,208
Given that assurance,

293
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:36,000
I hope you can excuse their
reprehensible behavior.

294
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,708
No problem... It's excused.

295
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,625
There's something abnormal
about these monsters

296
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,958
we've been seeing
around here lately.

297
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,041
Yeah.

298
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,666
For one thing,
they never used to go

299
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,541
anywhere near towns
that had barriers.

300
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,791
So what's Niren doing about it?

301
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,000
Niren...?

302
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,416
Oh... You mean the captain.

303
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,458
So you guys are on
a first-name basis?

304
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,625
Yeah, it's a long, boring story.

305
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,583
I hear you guys had
a large scale mission

306
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,583
in the forest yesterday,
hunting down monsters.

307
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,666
Yeah.

308
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,166
The trees are
unseasonably red, too.

309
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,208
Seems likely there's some sort
of connection there, doesn't it?

310
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,708
I don't know...

311
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,083
But the captain sure does seem
to think there is, though.

312
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,541
He's consulting with
our strategist about it.

313
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,000
That's enough.
Keep your big mouth shut!

314
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,291
Idiot!

315
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:27,791
We're leaving!

316
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,458
Ow, ow, ow!

317
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,291
Hey, I'm not done eating yet!

318
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,583
Let go...! Come on
guys, this hurts!

319
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,666
Okay! Okay!

320
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,708
Hey Raven!

321
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,625
I've got a little job for you.

322
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:59,458
No fair...! You're using
healing artes on him...

323
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,708
I should get them, too!

324
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,041
Shut up!

325
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,791
Maybe the pain will
teach you a lesson.

326
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,458
I do feel sorry for you,
getting injured like this...

327
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,083
but only a little bit sorry.

328
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,583
I'm older than you!

329
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,291
Oh, no! It looks like you
got a head injury, too...

330
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,333
Let me see.

331
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,708
Just hold still.

332
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,208
I don't get it.
Why would someone like you

333
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,291
join the Knights
in the first place?

334
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,458
Why wouldn't I?

335
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:25,916
I mean the pay is
decent and it's not like

336
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,666
I have anything else to do...

337
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,375
Besides, I'm a great fighter.

338
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,125
In other words, before,
he was just wandering around

339
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,666
aimlessly hoping to
find somebody to fight...

340
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,291
--Right, Yuri?
--Shut up!

341
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,375
He's always been like this:
immature and reckless.

342
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,791
Oh, like you've changed at all.

343
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,916
You're still uptight
and judgmental.

344
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,791
You're childhood friends?

345
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,791
We both grew up in the lower
quarter of the capital...

346
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:51,958
That's all.

347
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,583
Man, it was like
a dream come true

348
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,000
when you finally moved away.

349
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,708
And then you had to
go and spoil it all

350
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,666
by showing up for the
recruitment exam...

351
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,083
Why did you really join?

352
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,583
Who knows?

353
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,750
it's possible your old man
rubbed off on me or something...

354
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,500
I always thought he
was a great guy...

355
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,416
and, not having any
parents of my own,

356
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,625
maybe I was a little
jealous of you.

357
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:13,083
Don't talk about him, okay?

358
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,791
Hey, you four.

359
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:22,083
Go in and see the captain when
you're finished up out here.

360
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,083
He's not happy.

361
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,000
Why would the captain
be mad at us?

362
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,916
We didn't do anything wrong.

363
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,333
In case you've
already forgotten,

364
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,666
we're members of the Knights

365
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,416
and there's this little
thing called "discipline."

366
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,125
He's going to think I'm
an incompetent bozo...!

367
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,958
This is just perfect!

368
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,125
Brawling in a pub.

369
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:49,041
That's one stupidity you
could have easily avoided.

370
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,791
I'm very sorry, sir.

371
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:55,250
Things are already crazy
enough outside of town...

372
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,125
There's no need to stir up
more trouble inside.

373
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:01,458
But those guild men were
totally out of line, Captain!

374
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,125
This guy told an old man he'd
protect him, took his money,

375
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:08,291
and then just ditched him...
I had to teach them a lesson!

376
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,125
That's what started it...

377
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:15,750
Well... I probably would've
done the same thing... Still...

378
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,541
The guilds are
autonomous groups,

379
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,250
free from imperial influence.

380
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,833
They're not entirely
despicable men.

381
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,791
I find that hard
to believe, sir.

382
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,666
In case you haven't
already realized it,

383
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,375
they're handling some
things that we don't have

384
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:34,625
the resources to deal with.
For a price, of course.

385
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,416
The guy who's leading
them is called Merzhom.

386
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,625
It seemed like he knew you.

387
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,541
Hmm...? Merzhom...

388
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,500
Yeah, well, that's
a long, boring story.

389
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,708
It's not like that!

390
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:49,583
We're not doing business
under the table or anything!

391
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,166
Are you all fixed up?

392
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,500
Yes, sir.

393
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,041
Then go back to your
quarters... We're done here.

394
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,375
Huh?

395
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:01,375
So... you're not tossing
us in the stockade?

396
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,875
What would that do other
than decrease our manpower?

397
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,583
Still, I should do something...

398
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,208
Letting the four of you
completely off the hook

399
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:14,041
would set a bad example
for the others...

400
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,208
Tell you what, I'll just
have the pub's repair costs

401
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,291
deducted from your pay.

402
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,125
Oh, and Flynn...

403
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,583
I'm going to send
you to the capital.

404
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,541
Sir?

405
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,541
You'll be filling in for me.

406
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:27,958
I will?!

407
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,666
There's something more
important I need to see to...

408
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,583
Yurgis'll be in charge
here while I'm gone...

409
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:36,333
You'll be attending an
official ceremony...

410
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,375
and delivering this request
for reinforcements.

411
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,458
I'm convinced there's
something going on

412
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,083
in those ruins near the lake...

413
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,875
and if I'm right, we'll need
more manpower to handle it...

414
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:50,500
Oh! I'll also need to bring
one'a you twins with me.

415
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,208
I'll take the bigger one.

416
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,166
Does he mean our...?

417
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,833
Yeah, I think he does.

418
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,875
"Bigger one"?

419
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,708
Well they look like the exact
same height to me... Right?

420
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,791
As for you, Yuri: you'll
be looking after Lambert.

421
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,875
Again with the dogs?!

422
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,833
Yuri.

423
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,291
Yeah, what now?

424
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,500
Quit causing trouble.

425
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,958
I'm tired of getting
dragged into it.

426
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,458
Yeah, yeah...

427
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,000
You're a member of
the Knights, now...

428
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:32,250
You have to obey the rules.
You need to be more responsible.

429
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,916
And if that's too much
for you to handle

430
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,875
then you don't belong here.

431
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,958
I still don't see how anything
I did tonight was wrong.

432
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:42,000
If you can't swallow your
pride and learn to obey orders,

433
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:45,291
you should leave the Knights.

434
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,833
I am done talking to you.

435
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,125
Ow!

436
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,750
We're lost, aren't we?

437
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,583
Yeah, pretty much.

438
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,916
Can you read this?

439
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,666
How could anyone call
all these scribbles a map?

440
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,708
That's weird. Sir Garista
is usually so precise.

441
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,125
Chastel! Look over there!

442
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,458
Looks like some kinda
alarm... Check it out.

443
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,833
Right.

444
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,458
Thataway!

445
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,625
The capital.

446
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,500
This is a laboratory?

447
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,750
Apparently so...

448
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:50,208
Hey...! 'Scuse me,
is anyone here?

449
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,125
Get lost. Leave me alone.

450
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,583
Hold on!

451
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,166
Thieves! Go away!

452
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,000
She's just going back to sleep?

453
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,875
A kid?

454
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:06,208
Rita Mordio, yes...?

455
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,916
My name is Niren Fedrok,
and this is Chastel Aiheap.

456
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,416
We're with the
Imperial Knights...

457
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,625
and this right here is
our bargaining chip.

458
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:17,416
Yeah, alright. What
do you want to know?

459
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,333
We've detected a
large amount of aer

460
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,166
being produced in the
forest near Ceazontania...

461
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,791
So much, in fact, it's affecting

462
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:27,625
plants and normally
gentle animals in the area.

463
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:30,333
I dunno, it seems
pretty unlikely that aer

464
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:33,333
could produce those kinds
of effects all by itself.

465
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,458
So that means...?

466
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,208
Hey, hold on a second...

467
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,458
Ceazontania, huh?

468
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,791
Yes, there are some ruins
in the lake upstream.

469
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,333
Ah, I know where
you're talking about.

470
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,666
I've scoped that place before.

471
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,833
But the barrier blastia
that I found in place there

472
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,666
was missing its core.

473
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,875
So, does that mean the
blastia isn't active?

474
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,625
Nope. And from what I saw,

475
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:59,166
I'm pretty sure there wasn't
an aer krene there, either.

476
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,708
What's an aer krene?

477
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,000
It's a little bit like a spring,

478
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,125
but made of aer
instead of water.

479
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,750
Aer flows through the land,

480
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,041
so you can find it
pretty much anywhere...

481
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,041
but there are some places
where it really gushes out.

482
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,375
But in this case...

483
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,833
if it's suddenly producing
large amounts of aer,

484
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,541
it's possible somebody inserted
a core into the blastia

485
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,708
to activate it.

486
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,291
Maybe the blastia
is out of control,

487
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:26,000
and it's spewing out
large amounts of aer.

488
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,416
Everybody knows
blastia are useful for

489
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,625
generating all kinds of power...

490
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,375
but if they're being
used improperly,

491
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,041
they can be
incredibly dangerous.

492
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,291
So then, let's assume
this blastia is active.

493
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,458
Would it be possible
for us to destroy it?

494
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:44,333
I can't really say without
knowing what kind of core it is.

495
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,083
There has to be
something we can do.

496
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,791
This aer... is it red?

497
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,125
Yeah.

498
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,833
Too concentrated...

499
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,750
If oversaturation is affecting
the surrounding area,

500
00:35:55,833 --> 00:36:00,333
then the only option is to
stop it at its source somehow.

501
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:02,083
Just a minute.

502
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,625
Here.

503
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,125
I built this little
one to collect aer...

504
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:13,041
She might be able
to clear things up.

505
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,541
How does it work?

506
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,458
You just set her
down and activate her

507
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,250
near the source of the aer...

508
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:21,458
She's programmed to take care
of everything else on her own.

509
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,791
I can't guarantee that
she'll be helpful, though...

510
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,625
She is a blastia, after all...

511
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,750
She could easily
be affected, too.

512
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,416
And this is just a theory
you came up with on the fly.

513
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,875
Right. It's just a theory.

514
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,375
Thanks for the help.

515
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:46,375
Perfect! I've been looking
everywhere for this core!

516
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,708
Hey, how'd you know
where to find me, anyway?

517
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,333
Garista, one of my men, told me.

518
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,583
Figures it was that guy...

519
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,041
I really can't
stand that weasel.

520
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,750
You know each other well?

521
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,708
No way...! I only met
him in the capital...

522
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,166
The guy is a jerk!

523
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,583
Are you sure?

524
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,083
Heck yeah!

525
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,416
He took the cores I found
and turned them into weapons.

526
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,875
Like I said-- a jerk.

527
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:15,083
The stupid Empire only sees
blastia as tools for war...

528
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,250
but they're so much
more than that!

529
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,041
Just a sec.

530
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,416
Here, take this with you...

531
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,583
It's a special formula
that'll make your blastia

532
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,125
immune to the aer's effects.

533
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,958
What do you mean,
immune to the aer's effects?

534
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,333
It'll keep them from overloading

535
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,625
due to the increased
concentration of aer.

536
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:45,666
It won't last long, though.

537
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,958
If you're going to
check this thing out,

538
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,541
you should probably hurry.

539
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,208
If the blastia
goes out of control,

540
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:53,375
it could take out the town,
not just the ruins.

541
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:55,958
Think of it this way:

542
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,250
blastia has the power
to protect the city...

543
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:01,791
so the opposite is
just as possible.

544
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,291
Thank you.

545
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,125
Appreciate the help.

546
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:08,125
This core is all
the thanks I need!

547
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,208
Uh, out of curiosity, do you
live out here by yourself?

548
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:22,208
This is just the
laboratory where I work...

549
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,416
I live somewhere
else entirely...

550
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,750
Shut the door, will ya?

551
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,333
Oookay.

552
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,750
Your Excellency
Commandant Alexei...

553
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,708
the Council has a request.

554
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,541
They ask that the Lady Estellise

555
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:57,083
be allowed to attend
the upcoming ceremony.

556
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,541
Again?

557
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,458
They claim the celebration
is meaningless without her,

558
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,791
as she may be the
successor to the throne.

559
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,166
Successor?

560
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,625
She is merely the Council's
nominee... Nothing more.

561
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:13,166
The Council is not to have
contact with Lady Estellise...

562
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,458
Is that clear?

563
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,583
Yes, sir.

564
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,083
Your Excellency...!

565
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,250
A messenger from
Ceazontania has arrived.

566
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,208
Ceazontania?

567
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:30,166
I am Flynn Scifo of the
Ceazontania brigade...

568
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,958
I have come to the
capital to attend

569
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:36,333
the ceremony as Captain
Niren Fedrok's proxy.

570
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,625
Why does he not come himself?

571
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,166
Inside that case you will find

572
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,375
a document requesting
reinforcements.

573
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,291
All officers ranked
captain or higher

574
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:54,833
were to attend this ceremony.
That was the order I gave.

575
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,875
Excellency...!

576
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,375
Strange things have
been happening...

577
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,791
There's abnormal aer in
the forest near town...

578
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:04,583
Monsters are appearing!
Please sir...

579
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,625
I beg you, read the request.

580
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,791
When is the ceremony rehearsal?

581
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:11,416
It will begin shortly, sir.

582
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,666
Wait...! Your Excellency!

583
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,166
I will dispatch reinforcements
after the ceremony...

584
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,416
Until then, you're on your own.

585
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,666
The situation is most dire...

586
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,458
The citizens are
in serious danger.

587
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,041
Remember your place, Knight...!

588
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,708
Boy... your only job right
now is to convey my orders

589
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,875
back to Fedrok.

590
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,000
Return at once...

591
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:41,625
I will not have a Knight of
your rank attend this ceremony.

592
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,958
It's Flynn... Flynn Scifo...?

593
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,041
Would that make you
the son of Finath Scifo?

594
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,541
From what I hear, you passed
the Knight's recruitment exam

595
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,291
with flying colors...

596
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,916
I'm sure your father'd be proud

597
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,916
to see you following
in his steps.

598
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,833
My father...

599
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,791
I hope you aren't planning
to follow his example

600
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,416
and throw your life away...

601
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,458
Don't forget: you're a
member of the Knights now.

602
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,166
Flynn...

603
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,625
Lady Estellise...

604
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,833
Good to see you again.

605
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,541
It was noble of you to come
all the way from Ceazontania...

606
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,958
I pray for the safety
of the citizens there.

607
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,541
Thank you, my lady.

608
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,458
The imperial capital
is maintaining

609
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,791
a precarious
balance right now...

610
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,875
I know it's a lot to ask of
your brigade, but please...

611
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:58,458
hang on a little longer.

612
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:01,833
I'm glad it's me the
captain sent in his place...

613
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:05,458
I'm sure Yuri would have slugged
His Excellency in a heartbeat.

614
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:08,208
Yuri...? Who is he?

615
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,125
He's...

616
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,375
Well, then...
Please be careful.

617
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,708
He's made a mess of things.

618
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,958
I want this taken care of.

619
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,541
Yes, Sir!

620
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,750
See...?

621
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,500
I told you that taking out
monsters in the forest

622
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,916
would be way more fun
than stupid training.

623
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,500
And I told you, not until
the reinforcements arrive.

624
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,041
Never seen anything
like that before.

625
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,541
The barrier will
protect the town.

626
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,541
Now let's get going!

627
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,958
Into town, hurry!

628
00:43:58,583 --> 00:43:59,458
Now, Kansuke...!

629
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,500
Fall back inside the town!

630
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,750
Leave it, Elvin.
We're falling back!

631
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,916
Yuri...! That's enough!
Time to retreat!

632
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,083
My daughter...

633
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:28,625
She's in the carriage...! Emma!

634
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:32,041
Emma!

635
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,208
We're gonna go see
your mommy now, okay?

636
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:02,291
Let's go, Lambert.
You lead the way!

637
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:22,208
Let's get the injured back
inside the town. Hurry up!

638
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,416
Mommy!

639
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,541
Emma... Oh, my baby!

640
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:41,375
Yuri, fall back into town!
Come on! Hurry!

641
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,333
Sure about this...?

642
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,083
There isn't any
money in it for you.

643
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,375
Don't worry about it.
I'll send the bill to your boss.

644
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:59,125
--Argus! Come back!
--John!

645
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,708
Where are you going?

646
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,166
What is it, Lambert?

647
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:14,916
Come back here...! Now, Lambert!

648
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yuri!

649
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,500
Anyone who can, come!

650
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:21,750
Damn...! All right,
you two... let's follow them.

651
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,291
Damn it...

652
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,583
His tracks are all mixed
in with the monsters'.

653
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:33,208
Lambert!

654
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,375
Lambert...! Argus!

655
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,291
The aer's getting even
thicker here than it was before.

656
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,541
You mean... this is aer?

657
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,791
Normally, aer is green...
but it seems that it turns red

658
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,500
when it's unusually
thick like this.

659
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,458
So is this what's makin'
all the trees wither

660
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,125
and the animals get violent...?

661
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:56,041
Aer's keeping us
outta the forest?

662
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,000
Well?

663
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,125
Yes... We believe
that to be the case.

664
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:04,416
No point in keeping it under
wraps anymore, now is there?

665
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,583
Help me!

666
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,666
After 'em!

667
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,875
Merzhom!

668
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:20,416
Yuri, get back here!

669
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,083
Unbelievable!

670
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,000
Guards up, everyone.

671
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,250
Damn it all...

672
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,541
Something that dangerous
this close to town?

673
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,541
Things are getting
worse than I thought.

674
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:48,875
It's Lambert!

675
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,958
Hold up a second.

676
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,875
Lambert, no...

677
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:47,458
Lambert, what are you doing?

678
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:49,916
Stop, please! Get off me!

679
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:59,750
Stop... Please stop,
Lambert... Don't do this.

680
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,458
Lambert!

681
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:30,916
My friend... I'm sorry.

682
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,375
Dammit!

683
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,541
Oh, Repede... I'm so sorry...

684
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,583
Your dad--I had no other choice.

685
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:23,333
What in the world happened?

686
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:26,083
The monsters made it all
the way to the bridge.

687
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,875
Hisca, what's the matter?

688
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,250
What happened...?
Talk to me...! Hisca!

689
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,583
Lambert and the other dogs...

690
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:40,458
They just turned
into monsters...

691
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:45,458
Then they all...
And Yuri... he...

692
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:50,500
Hisca...

693
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:12,666
I heard what happened.

694
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,375
You should keep an extra
close eye on Repede.

695
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,333
I bet he's gonna feel
a bit lonely for a while.

696
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,458
I'm sorry, Captain.

697
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:25,625
There's nothing you
need to apologize for.

698
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,583
Now, why don't you
head back to your room?

699
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:41,708
Try not to catch cold.

700
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:06,458
No! Please!

701
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,916
I'm gettin' too old
for this stuff...

702
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,916
Need a breather.

703
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,875
What's somebody doin'
out here this late?

704
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,166
No, it's the truth...!

705
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:07,750
We tried to use magic artes,
and our blastia just exploded.

706
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:10,291
Explodin' blastia?!

707
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,625
That's a Royal Guard.

708
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:18,083
Who's that he's talkin' to?

709
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:20,708
Damn!

710
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,708
What's this?!

711
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:33,250
Thank you... I'll take
charge of the report now.

712
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,291
Things are startin' ta get

713
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,000
a little bit
complicated around here.

714
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:45,416
Mister Knight!

715
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:53,000
Here, take this.

716
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:59,041
You saved me...
Thank you so much!

717
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:27,291
Flynn...

718
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:37,750
Nice, cushy job you got,
taking care of the dogs.

719
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,750
What?

720
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,666
I've got a cushy job, huh...?

721
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,916
I'm sure it was
real tough for you,

722
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,083
standing around
at the ceremony.

723
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:49,083
Get outta my way...
I'm too busy for you.

724
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:50,458
And it must be nice
getting pampered

725
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:53,375
just because your daddy
was a Knight, too, huh?

726
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,958
Screw you...

727
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:04,708
I guess being a jerk's the
one thing you're good at!

728
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,875
How many times am I gonna
see you two in here like this?

729
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,708
Now go hit the baths. You
stink... We'll talk after that.

730
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:48,583
How can you be so relaxed with
everything that's happening...?

731
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,583
We have to do something!

732
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,583
We can't for now.

733
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,333
He's not sending anybody...

734
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:59,041
not till after the ceremony.

735
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:02,000
His orders are for us
to hold the fort...

736
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,083
I'll bring the
documents to you later.

737
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,791
I see... Very well.

738
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:09,541
Did you even explain everything
that's been going on here?!

739
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:13,583
Yes! I can't help whatever
Headquarters decides to do!

740
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:15,500
Wait until after the ceremony?

741
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,000
So what, we sit around
and do nothing?!

742
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:19,041
Don't you think I said
the same thing...?!

743
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:21,166
They just don't see
us as a priority...!

744
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,708
There's nothing we can do!

745
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,333
People have died, Flynn!

746
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,250
I suppose you think I
didn't try hard enough?

747
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,125
Quit your arguing.

748
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:32,958
Sounds like I gave you
an unpleasant task, Flynn.

749
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:36,041
That was inconsiderate.
I apologize.

750
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:39,125
You're sorry?!

751
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,250
The situation is
only worsening...

752
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,416
We won't be able to keep
the town safe and secure

753
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,666
if the monsters attack again.

754
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:51,666
So tomorrow we'll
investigate the ruins.

755
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,250
Sir, you can't be serious...

756
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,625
If we do that, then people
are going to die...!

757
00:58:56,708 --> 00:58:59,333
We can't just disobey an order--

758
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,708
Thinking of your old man?

759
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,750
Yeah, I am...

760
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:10,208
He liked ignoring orders, too...

761
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:13,166
Headquarters had stopped
the attack, but he...

762
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,458
Have you forgotten that people
in the lower quarter were dying?

763
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:19,125
He died protecting
citizens and his family.

764
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:22,500
My father died disobeying
the orders he was given...!

765
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,250
Did you know they
never found his body?

766
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:28,958
I am never going to make the
same mistake that my father did.

767
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:45,916
Our job is to protect the
people who live in this town.

768
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,833
That's my duty as a Knight,
and I take it very seriously...

769
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,708
Flynn... Maybe you
should wait until

770
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:53,708
you've served as a Knight
for a little longer...

771
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,583
Then you can decide if
what your old man did

772
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:59,708
was really a mistake or a
commitment to sacred duty.

773
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:05,666
We leave first thing in
the morning... Understood?

774
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,958
Garista... Inform
the others, would you?

775
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:11,083
Yes, Sir.

776
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,666
Sorry about earlier...

777
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,125
I didn't know that
Lambert had died.

778
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,000
No, I'm sorry...

779
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:48,791
I was just shocked that
they refused us outright.

780
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,750
My father's body never
got a proper burial.

781
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:55,583
They only gave us a
few personal effects.

782
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:57,458
Once you die, it's over...

783
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,250
Everything ends...

784
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:03,250
and there's nothing left,
nothing that matters.

785
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,750
The monsters are practically
on our doorstep...

786
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,208
What if they get
inside the town?

787
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:08,833
What do we do then?

788
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,583
The barrier's still there...

789
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:13,708
They'll have a hard time
getting past that, at least.

790
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:16,041
Maybe, but I'm still
with the captain on this.

791
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,208
The whole reason we
asked for reinforcements

792
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:20,708
was because it was too
much for us to handle...

793
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:22,583
We should wait.

794
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:26,083
If we don't do something,
more people will die...

795
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:27,583
I've seen enough death...

796
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,500
I'm ready to start
fighting back.

797
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:32,541
If we die, then
who protects them?

798
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,333
I'm going down to see Repede.

799
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,541
Maybe you should reconsider...

800
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:02,208
There's still time
to change your mind.

801
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:06,458
The ceremony will
end tomorrow...

802
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:09,000
Wouldn't it be wise to wait?

803
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,750
You have any idea
how long it'll take 'em

804
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,833
to assemble a unit
and get 'em here?

805
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:15,333
Even so...

806
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:17,416
Besides, I'd prefer to
have all this taken care of

807
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,916
before Alexei's men arrive.

808
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,083
Why is that?

809
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:24,083
I hear he's really
interested in blastia...

810
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,750
If there's a powerful
one in the ruins,

811
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:28,375
he might order us to bring
it back in working condition

812
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:31,083
instead of destroying it.

813
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:32,541
It's wreaking havoc with the aer

814
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:36,000
and turning even our trained
animals into monsters.

815
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:38,166
Everyone took a hit in
this latest attack...

816
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,333
Citizens, Knights,
even livestock...

817
01:02:41,416 --> 01:02:43,166
I don't want any
more casualties.

818
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,083
It's as simple as that.

819
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,666
Yes, I understand...

820
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,500
I'll determine a route for you.

821
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:49,500
Thanks...

822
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:50,708
One more thing...

823
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:53,791
I'm concerned about
taking blastia with us.

824
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,333
I'm worried that
this unusual aer

825
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:57,875
might interfere
with them somehow.

826
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,541
Surely not having
their magic artes

827
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:02,958
will affect the squad's
morale on the mission.

828
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:04,416
As much as we know,

829
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,000
we still don't have total
control of the way in which

830
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,125
cores provide
blastia with energy.

831
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:13,916
I'm sure they just activated
a little late last time.

832
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,208
Fine then... We'll take 'em,
but I hope you're right.

833
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,166
It's Yuri.

834
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,125
Yeah... It's open, come in.

835
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,166
What's up?

836
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,916
Not much. I just...
couldn't sleep.

837
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,625
Doesn't sound like you.

838
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,375
Yeah...

839
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,375
Here. A glass of
grape juice for you.

840
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,250
Thank you.

841
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,916
So, is that your
wife and daughter?

842
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,958
Oh, yeah...

843
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,208
They're not with
us anymore, though.

844
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:57,041
There was an incident...

845
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,833
I wasn't able to protect them.

846
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,875
Back then, I totally
bought into the idea

847
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:05,125
that the Empire's
orders were absolute...

848
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,583
Even when acting
against those orders

849
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:11,000
might have saved the lives
of my wife and little girl.

850
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:13,208
Anyway, a lot
happened after that,

851
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:16,000
and they shipped me off
to the middle of nowhere.

852
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,791
I actually kinda
like it out here...

853
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:20,583
being so far away
from the capital.

854
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,333
It sure is biting us in
the ass now, though...

855
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:26,833
but still I'm
determined not to make

856
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:30,541
the same mistakes
I did in the past.

857
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:33,375
Flynn's old man was
really somethin'...

858
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,000
Wasn't always the
most positive guy...

859
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,083
But I had a lot of
respect for him...

860
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,666
Now there was a man
who knew how to protect

861
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,291
what was most dear to him.

862
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:52,750
Yes?

863
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,958
I know it's quite late...
and I'm sorry to bother you.

864
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:58,541
What is it, sir?

865
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,750
Won't you sit down?

866
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,916
No... thank you...

867
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,250
We're leaving early tomorrow.

868
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:08,958
You don't seem to agree
with this mission...

869
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:10,750
Unless I'm mistaken.

870
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,875
I'm a member of
the Knights, sir...

871
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:16,000
My personal feelings
don't really matter.

872
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,500
I must admit,
I'm a little troubled

873
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:20,458
by Captain Fedrock's
decision as well...

874
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,458
I don't understand
why he insists

875
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,583
on putting the
brigade in danger.

876
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:27,791
I agree... We should
obey Headquarters...

877
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:29,250
protect the townfolk...

878
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:33,000
and wait for reinforcements
before taking any action.

879
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,208
That's quite sensible...

880
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:38,791
You don't take after
your father, then.

881
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:42,125
You see...

882
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:45,083
I didn't know him well, but I
did meet him once, before...

883
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,541
Captain Fedrok's actions
actually remind me a lot

884
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:50,250
of something your late
father would have done.

885
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:55,541
Anyway, His Excellency's
orders are absolute...

886
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,833
Captain Fedrock has an
obligation to obey orders

887
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,750
just as your father did.

888
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,375
So tell me, Flynn...

889
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,000
Knowing it will be an act of
insubordination on your part...

890
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,708
are you still going?

891
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,416
I am a member of the Knights...

892
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,791
I will obey my
direct superior...

893
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:12,791
I may not fully agree with
what the captain's doing...

894
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,333
but he said something
to me earlier,

895
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:16,708
and I want to find
out what it means.

896
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,791
Good night, sir.

897
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,166
What a shame...

898
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,625
If things had
gone the other way,

899
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:27,708
he might have made a fine
servant for His Excellency.

900
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,750
Goodness. Are you
all right out here?

901
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:43,458
Tonight I'm drinkin' fer
me and my dead buddy.

902
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,125
Round two!

903
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:49,416
I think you should go home.

904
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,625
Let's go back.

905
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,083
When we depart from here,
we will follow the river

906
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:31,083
and enter the ruins on the lake.

907
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:32,833
Once there, we will
investigate...

908
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:34,666
We will identify and
then resolve the cause

909
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,791
of the aer disturbance.

910
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:38,875
I'd prefer to wait
for reinforcements,

911
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:41,500
but this matter is too urgent.

912
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:44,166
If the effects of the aer
remain unchecked any longer,

913
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:47,333
the town will be in
even greater danger.

914
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:50,333
It's our duty to
protect these people!

915
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:56,541
So... uhhh...
everyone ready to go?

916
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:10,458
Yuri...

917
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:23,375
Hey, what's wrong little one?
Why are you up so early?

918
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:27,375
You guys are going somewhere
dangerous, aren't you?

919
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:28,791
Now, where'd you hear that...?

920
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:32,291
Don't you worry...
I showed you how tough I am.

921
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,333
Uh, Captain...

922
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,500
Ah, c'mon.

923
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:49,500
There's no need for
so many long faces.

924
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,041
We'll just be gone
for a little bit.

925
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,291
All you have to do
is wait for us

926
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,750
and don't step
outside the barrier.

927
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,666
Just hang on a little longer.

928
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:02,333
Life will be back
to normal soon.

929
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:04,166
'Kay, let's go.

930
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,500
That's just plain reckless.

931
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,791
They don't even know
what they're up against.

932
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:38,541
Makes me wonder why I bothered

933
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,458
to warn 'em in
the first place...

934
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:43,083
but that's Niren for ya...

935
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:44,333
Now that I think on it,

936
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:47,625
havin' 'em owe us one
doesn't sound half bad.

937
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:50,166
You're not serious?

938
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,833
You seriously need
to report to the Don.

939
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:53,916
Now, get outta here.

940
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,875
Yeah, yeah...!
Well... you take care.

941
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,541
What is it, sir?

942
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,166
Hey, Yurgis...

943
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:33,333
will you do me a favor and
give your blastia a try?

944
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,791
Sure.

945
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,416
What's happening?

946
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,000
It's because of the aer here.

947
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:07,458
So you're saying we can't
use our blastia at all?

948
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,958
Well... that's where
these come in...

949
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:13,291
They're formulas to help keep
the blastia from overloading...

950
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:16,000
I made enough copies
for everybody.

951
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,458
They don't last long, though,

952
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,875
so you'll only want to
use them as a last resort.

953
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,875
You knew our blastia
would go out of control

954
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:23,416
before we even left?

955
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,708
Correct... Like I said,
the situation is urgent...

956
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:29,208
It would be a disaster if
the town's Barrier Blastia

957
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:32,500
went haywire, too...
Now, let's get moving.

958
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,833
And you're only
telling us all this now?!

959
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:39,250
It might've been helpful if
you'd said something sooner!

960
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:44,250
Whoops... Guess I forgot.

961
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:48,125
Huh?

962
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,500
He forgot to mention it...?

963
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:55,083
Are we really letting
this guy lead us?

964
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:01,083
Shut up and move it...! Now!

965
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,375
Well, I guess this explains
something, at least...

966
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,958
Why we haven't
run into monsters.

967
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:10,791
This place makes my skin crawl.

968
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,833
Are we gonna end up down
there like that, too?

969
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,041
Keep your guards up...

970
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:17,541
There's no telling
what might happen.

971
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:44,125
Frozen Arrows, ready! Quick!

972
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,708
Don't hit David...! Fire!

973
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,333
Pull him out!

974
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:15,916
Get away from the swamp, now!

975
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,166
Hurry!

976
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:34,041
That monster back there
detected our presence.

977
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:37,375
I'm guessing that it reacts
to sound and sudden movement.

978
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:40,416
Going forward, we'll split
ourselves into two teams...

979
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,291
One will cross the bridge
and enter the ruins.

980
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:44,208
The other will give support.

981
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,208
The support team will
provide sufficient cover

982
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:49,000
all the way to the entrance,
secure a return route,

983
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:52,750
and then wait until the
infiltration team gets back.

984
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:54,166
Captain.

985
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:01,250
I want to avenge
Lambert's death today.

986
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,375
Figured you'd say that...

987
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,291
Yurgis... Assign teams.

988
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,500
Right!

989
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:08,833
Those with crossbows,
you're on support...

990
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:11,208
Those with swords, axes,
or defensive artes,

991
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,916
you're on infiltration...

992
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,291
Support team, use the formulas
the captain gave you!

993
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:20,750
Flynn!

994
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,250
Move!

995
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,875
Yurgis.

996
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:29,541
Sir?

997
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:31,125
With me, Flynn.

998
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:39,250
I thought you disapproved
of this mission.

999
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,458
I always do my duty.

1000
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,791
Ready to move?

1001
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,875
It's here...! Hurry!

1002
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:35,458
Your fight's over here, monster.

1003
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,458
Let's go!

1004
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:14,666
The hard part is
just beginning...

1005
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,458
Everyone stay sharp.

1006
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:36,208
Over here, sir.

1007
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:43,958
The aer's flowing from there.

1008
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,000
We'll follow it to the source.

1009
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:13,875
What is it?

1010
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:49,875
Watch the edge there, Flynn.

1011
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,250
Right.

1012
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:57,458
Gotta go further down.

1013
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:59,625
Looks like that's the
entrance over there.

1014
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,000
Hi.

1015
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,875
Why are you here?

1016
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:33,708
Not as young as you
used to be, Niren.

1017
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:38,583
I could say the
same to you, geezer.

1018
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,541
So... Yuri... What's wrong?

1019
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:45,916
It's lookin' like you're a
little off your game today.

1020
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
You always butt in like this?

1021
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:51,875
Got a mouth on ya...

1022
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:53,708
We've got our
reasons for coming...

1023
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:57,333
If the town goes under,
then we're outta work...

1024
01:19:57,416 --> 01:20:00,208
Plus, I've got some fallen
men who need avenging...

1025
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:02,333
Let's get this over with today.

1026
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,083
Captain!

1027
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:07,625
Doesn't hurt anymore...
I'll be fine.

1028
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:14,916
Lose your blastia right now!

1029
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,416
What?

1030
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,250
If it blows up here,
it'll take us all out.

1031
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:21,708
Yes, sir.

1032
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:46,250
Sure looks like this
is the right way.

1033
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:49,958
Let's go then...
I'm counting on you two.

1034
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,250
Niren!

1035
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,541
Our swords aren't hurting it.

1036
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,791
Flynn!

1037
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,375
Yuri...! We need to
cut the red cords!

1038
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,166
Yuri!

1039
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,583
Yeah!

1040
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,958
Let's go!

1041
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:59,666
They keep coming...
You go on ahead.

1042
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,541
Thanks, Merzhom.

1043
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,500
That's a big boy.

1044
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,041
This really hurts.

1045
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:07,416
Oh no!

1046
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,750
Someone help...!
Get it off of me!

1047
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,125
Yuri... Let's get closer.
I'll toss you up there.

1048
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:31,041
Come on!

1049
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:03,458
Yuri!

1050
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,708
So... you okay?

1051
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:34,416
I'm fine.

1052
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:05,666
This is what we've
been looking for.

1053
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,666
It's been suckin' up
aer to act as its core.

1054
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:17,625
That's a fancy-lookin'
gadget you found there, Niren.

1055
01:26:17,708 --> 01:26:18,958
You okay?

1056
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:21,041
One of my men didn't make it.

1057
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:23,125
I see... I'm sorry.

1058
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:25,416
Who would build
something like this?

1059
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,458
We'll find out later.

1060
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:32,416
Supposedly, this will
stop the aer from flowing.

1061
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,875
What's that...? It's weird.

1062
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,208
No kidding... Very weird.

1063
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:11,041
Hey, it worked!

1064
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:24,500
Chastel, no!

1065
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:46,333
This whole place
is falling apart!

1066
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:49,041
Yuri! We gotta go!

1067
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,750
Here, hold this.

1068
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,000
What are you stopping for?

1069
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:12,458
Captain...! Look! This core!

1070
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,208
Later, Flynn!

1071
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:48,291
Yuri!

1072
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,625
Chastel...! Is she okay?

1073
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,916
She'll be fine...
She's still breathing.

1074
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:03,916
Sir, you still down there?

1075
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,708
Give me your hand!

1076
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:22,541
Take this. We'll hold you.

1077
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,500
We're going to get you, sir...

1078
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,541
Hold on...! Damn!

1079
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:32,416
It's no use... just go.

1080
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,208
Not a chance!

1081
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:37,458
Come on. Give me
your hand, damn it!

1082
01:29:37,541 --> 01:29:40,375
'Fraid not...
It's outta commission.

1083
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:44,458
You can get that healed...
Now grab hold!

1084
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:45,458
Yuri.

1085
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:46,625
I still can't reach him...!

1086
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,041
Is there something
else we can use?

1087
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,666
Yuri!

1088
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:57,416
It's too late for me...

1089
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,375
Focus on the people
that you can save.

1090
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,750
Take this, too.

1091
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,958
Flynn... You look after them.

1092
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:33,000
Become an even greater
Knight than your old man...

1093
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:35,750
and remember your true duty.

1094
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:44,416
No...! Please, Captain...! NO!

1095
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,875
Now go.

1096
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,458
Later, Niren.

1097
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,958
Thank goodness...
You're finally awake.

1098
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,333
We're actually still alive.

1099
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:57,375
Yeah... It's over.

1100
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:59,750
Glad you're awake.

1101
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:02,500
So, uh... Where's the captain?

1102
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,541
Flynn...! Tell me. Where is he?!

1103
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:21,833
Yuri?

1104
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:24,833
Yeah, he's gone...
but he went out in style.

1105
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:31,708
I know it's a formality,

1106
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:36,333
but it seems silly to
bury an empty casket.

1107
01:34:36,416 --> 01:34:37,875
He told me...

1108
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:41,916
that following orders kept him
from protecting his family.

1109
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,625
He said that he respected
the decision your father made.

1110
01:34:59,291 --> 01:35:00,250
Good grief...

1111
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:02,833
You're still not
finished in here?

1112
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:06,916
He was given specific orders
to stay and hold the fort.

1113
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,208
Instead he went off
and got himself killed

1114
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:11,541
on some ridiculous mission.

1115
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:12,708
That fool...

1116
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,416
Did he think
disobeying direct orders

1117
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,625
would make him some
kind of hero...?

1118
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:20,375
How could you serve
someone so incomp--

1119
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,958
Calm down! You know this
guy's not worth it, Yuri!

1120
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:26,458
How dare you come into
his fort and insult him?!

1121
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:28,458
You little brat.

1122
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:47,333
It's time, you two...
Give us a hand.

1123
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,791
What kind of brigade is this?!

1124
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,416
You said after death,
nothing's left.

1125
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:17,083
But the captain did
leave something behind...

1126
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:22,125
If not for him, the rest us
wouldn't be here. Right?

1127
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:23,583
If you think about it,

1128
01:37:23,666 --> 01:37:26,208
your father left a legacy
behind when he died, too...

1129
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:28,541
Always remember that.

1130
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:31,875
One last salute...

1131
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:35,416
For Captain Niren Fedrok
of the Imperial Knights!

1132
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:29,833
Yuri...

1133
01:38:29,916 --> 01:38:32,041
It isn't over yet.

1134
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:07,958
We found it inside the ruins.

1135
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:13,666
Only you use that
type of core, sir.

1136
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,791
Why did you do it...?!

1137
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:22,333
Were you hoping the town
would be destroyed?

1138
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:24,208
Don't be silly...

1139
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,500
We were simply using
those ruins as a test area

1140
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:28,833
for a new type of blastia.

1141
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:31,250
You're creating new blastia?

1142
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:32,291
Correct...

1143
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:33,958
In order to maintain
our way of life,

1144
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:36,250
we must control
aer and blastia...

1145
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:37,916
The only method we
have for obtaining

1146
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,291
the necessary crystallized
aer cores is excavation.

1147
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,458
But if we could develop

1148
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,125
an artificial replacement
for the cores,

1149
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:46,458
it would usher in an era
of greater prosperity,

1150
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:49,333
one free from the
fear of monsters.

1151
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:51,291
But you lost control
of the blastia...

1152
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:52,750
So you decided to destroy it

1153
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:55,666
and take out the brigade
and the town as well.

1154
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:57,791
There was always a
chance it would go awry.

1155
01:39:57,875 --> 01:40:01,458
We don't even have control
over normal blastia.

1156
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:02,958
Fortunately for us,

1157
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:06,166
that's how we were able to
bring back that core as proof.

1158
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:10,458
You know, there've been
other experiments

1159
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:12,833
with some measure of success.

1160
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:14,000
Of course...

1161
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:17,041
there were some
casualties then, as well.

1162
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:22,875
Are you saying...

1163
01:40:22,958 --> 01:40:25,541
Do accept my condolences.

1164
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:39,541
How awful.

1165
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,291
It appears there will be an
unfortunate blastia explosion

1166
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:43,000
here as well.

1167
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Feisty one...

1168
01:41:35,875 --> 01:41:38,458
You're starting to annoy me.

1169
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:56,625
Damn it.

1170
01:42:01,458 --> 01:42:03,625
Flynn... We've got one chance...

1171
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:05,666
Make an opening for me.

1172
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:07,250
I'm on it.

1173
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,625
Enough child's play!

1174
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:23,166
It's over!

1175
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:38,875
That's...

1176
01:42:40,708 --> 01:42:43,333
His blastia, you bastard.

1177
01:42:56,083 --> 01:42:59,208
Captain... It's finished.

1178
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:31,083
Hisca.

1179
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:08,791
You come to see me off?

1180
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:12,083
Yeah... What, are you surprised?

1181
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:15,541
Looks like everybody
else is leaving, too.

1182
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:17,916
The Empire is abandoning
this place now...

1183
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,916
so they'll move on.

1184
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,833
I noticed the guild guys
didn't waste any time

1185
01:44:21,916 --> 01:44:24,500
getting out of town.

1186
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:26,625
I think Merzhom and the
captain were friends...

1187
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:28,833
I'm guessing that's
why he stayed.

1188
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:30,041
Yeah, I know the feeling.

1189
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:31,375
With the captain gone,

1190
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:34,166
I don't think I'm cut out
for the Knights anymore.

1191
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:39,083
I'm sorry... Leaving you
all the clean-up.

1192
01:44:39,166 --> 01:44:40,458
I prepared an incident report

1193
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:43,291
and handed it over to
Vice Captain Yurgis...

1194
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:46,833
Garista died in a random
blastia explosion.

1195
01:44:46,916 --> 01:44:48,291
We're both covered...

1196
01:44:48,375 --> 01:44:49,916
Yurgis suspected Garista too,

1197
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,750
once the captain
filled him in...

1198
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:55,500
so he didn't make any objections
to the report I turned in.

1199
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:00,375
You know...
you're tough, Flynn.

1200
01:45:00,458 --> 01:45:03,541
They don't make
many guys like you.

1201
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:06,000
Right back at you, Yuri...

1202
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:07,750
Making it in the
world all alone...

1203
01:45:07,833 --> 01:45:10,208
Yeah, that's you all right...

1204
01:45:10,291 --> 01:45:12,333
As for me, I'm a Knight
through and through.

1205
01:45:12,416 --> 01:45:15,500
I'll stay here and do
the best job I can...

1206
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:18,166
Just like the captain ordered.

1207
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,083
Oh, that's right...

1208
01:45:22,166 --> 01:45:24,375
I guess that you
won't be all alone.

1209
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:32,125
Take good care of it.

1210
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:33,916
See ya around.

1211
01:45:35,416 --> 01:45:37,000
Yeah.

1212
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:48,083
See you later...
