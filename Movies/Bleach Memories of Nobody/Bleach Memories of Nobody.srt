1
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,583
‐What is the status?

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,707
‐The area’s been expanding
at a constant rate

3
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,924
since we first
started monitoring it.

4
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,795
The Stealth Force has been
dispatched to investigate.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,550
They should arrive at the
Outer Barrier momentarily.

6
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,345
‐I just established contact.

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,557
They’ll be passing by the Dangai
Precipice World in 10 seconds.

8
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,931
They’re about to enter
the dimensional area.

9
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,808
Opening communication lines.

10
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,557
MALE SPEAKER (ON
VIDEO PHONE SCREEN):

11
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,229
Hey, what the‐‐
where’s the exit?

12
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,357
It’s no good.

13
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,821
We can’t break through,
and the Stealth Force

14
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,743
is unable to
infiltrate the area.

15
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,572
What the hell’s going on?

16
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,696
Requesting immediate backup.

17
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,372
‐We’ve got them.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,620
We’ve got you backup.

19
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,953
Maintain your positions.

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,078
‐This is the Research
Technology Concept.

21
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,083
Insertion into the
dimensional area has failed.

22
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,745
The Stealth Force is on the‐‐

23
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,254
‐Notify Central 46
of the situation.

24
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,498
Let’s get them out of there.

25
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,758
MALE SPEAKER (ON VIDEO PHONE
SCREEN): It’s the current.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,590
The restricted
current is too strong.

27
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,094
‐Listen, help is on the way.

28
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,925
Now tell us, what
prevented you from entering

29
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,101
the dimensional area?

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,850
MALE SPEAKER (ON VIDEO
PHONE SCREEN): Aaah!

31
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,826
‐I think that guy was born
with extra hands or something.

32
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,721
[panting]

33

[loud crash]

35
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,186
‐What is that, dust?

36
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:31,778
‐It just happened.

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
‐It’s coming right at us.

38
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,163
‐Get ready.

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,655
‐Right.

40
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,157
‐Hey, hold on.

41
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,184
‐Where are you going?

42
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,977
[theme music]

43
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,256
‐Back off.

44
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:43,388
Aaah!

45
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:53,573
‐Ichigo.

46
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,862
‐What’s up?

47
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,033
‐Here we go.

48
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,282
‐That Hollow was
chasing this girl.

49
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,785
So it’s a good thing we
came along when we did.

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,278
‐Hmm.

51
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,247
‐Don’t worry.

52
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,042
It’s all right.

53
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,463
He only looked scary.

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:14,923
‐Would you just‐‐ It’s
time for you to go.

55
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,715
‐It’s going to be
all right you’re

56
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,048
going to like the Soul Society.

57
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,933
It’s not scary at all.

58
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,431
It’s where departed
souls go to live.

59
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,933
‐But I‐‐

60
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,676
‐You don’t want to
hang around this place.

61
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,398
What if another one of those
monsters comes after you?

62
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,276
‐Is it over already?

63
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:23,705
‐Yeah.

64
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,914
Thanks a lot.

65
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,582
You know, Ichigo‐‐

66
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,122
‐What is it?

67
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,625
‐You use your combat
pass too much.

68
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,207
‐Huh?

69
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:40,884
What are you talking about?
[grunt] What the hell was that?

70
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,337
Blah.

71
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,926
‐Somehow you always
forget that you have him.

72
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,852
You think you can leave
your Gigai lying around

73
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,061
wherever you want.

74
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:49,972
Then I get stuck making
excuses afterwards.

75
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,848
‐What do you mean?

76
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,187
‐Here’s an example.

77
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,732
Someone happens to walk by.

78
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,016
Oh, dear me, is something wrong?

79
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,688
This man’s not breathing.

80
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,686
What do I do?

81
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,898
An ambulance?

82
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,279
That won’t do any good
if he’s already dead.

83
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:04,914
Someone better call a hearse.

84
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,371
You see what I mean?

85
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,082
‐Yeah.

86
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,791
Like they never call a hearse.

87
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,080
‐That’s not the point.

88
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,084
The point is whenever you
leave your body lying around,

89
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,706
there’s always a big commotion.

90
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,544
‐There’s no pulse.

91
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,626
He’s in cardiac arrest.

92
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,843
‐I rest my case.

93
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,762
‐Hey, my body.

94
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,383
‐Aah.

95
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,716
‐It’s so sad.

96
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,843
‐Oh, look, he’s coming to.

97
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,847
‐Look at that.

98
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,559
‐What’s going on?

99
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,771
‐How‐‐

100
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,471
‐What’s up?

101
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,308
‐Are you all right?

102
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:35,895
‐Oh, god.

103
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,809
‐Hold still, will you?

104
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,557
Easy.

105
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,057
‐What are you doing?

106
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,728
‐Let go of me.

107
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,647
RUKIA: Oh, please.

108
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,987
‐Ah, that really sucked.

109
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,158
‐Now who was it that
was just saying that?

110
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,208
You’re lucky I had
my memory replacement

111
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,712
to switch everyone’s memory.

112
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,383
Kon.

113
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,001
‐Hello, hello.

114
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,508
‐What the hell?

115
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,470
‐You’re the one who
needs to have him around,

116
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,882
so you hold him.

117
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,338
‐I don’t want to
carry this thing.

118
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,598
‐Rukia, how could you do this?

119
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,262
‐You like that?

120
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:11,758
Huh?

121
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,430
Do ya?

122
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:13,718
Little bastard.

123
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,558
‐Wait.

124
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,023
Hold on.

125
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,481
What’s that smell?

126
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,403
ICHIGO: Shut up!

127
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,439
‐There’s a bunch of
dog poop down here.

128
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,271
ICHIGO: Well, I hope it stinks.

129
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,436
‐This doesn’t make sense.

130
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,613
What is it?

131
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,823
‐If it’s another Hollow,
then what are we waiting for?

132
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,245
Aaah.

133
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,871
You got that stuff in my mouth.

‐Ichigo.

135
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,120
‐It serves you right.

136
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,002
Now we’re even.

137
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,460
‐Hey!

138
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,828
‐I’ll be right with you
just as soon as I’m‐‐

139
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,458
‐Help.

[loud rumble]

141
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:39,957
‐The train station.

142
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,465
‐Hey!

143
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,674
What’s up with this
spiritual pressure?

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,130
‐I don’t know.

145
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,179
I’ve never felt this kind of
spiritual pressure before.

146
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:32,352
‐Huh?

147
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,010
‐Wow, what are these things?

148
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,846
‐Ooh, like ghosts.

149
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,141
‐No one else can see them.

150
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,608
They must be souls.

151
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,029
‐If they were, wouldn’t they
have chains on their chests?

152
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,029
It’s weird.

153
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,030
‐We have no choice.

154
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,284
‐Oh, well, here we go again.

155
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,115
‐Hey, put that away.

156
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,659
‐Fine.

157
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:04,212
Disgusting.

158
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,835
Kon, try to stay out of trouble.

159
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,006
Hey, you can’t
just leave me here.

160
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,723
Whoa, well, what are you doing?

161
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,514
Hey.

162
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,847
‐This is Rukia
Kuchiki, Squad 13,

World of the Living Area 3888.

00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,846
‐What now?

165
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,055
‐Ichigo, see if you can
perform a Kenso on one of them.

166
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,557
‐Really?

167
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,228
A Kenso?

168
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,734
‐Reporting in.

169

We’ve encountered a large number
of unknown beings possessing

00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,743
a strange spiritual pressure.

171
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,330
‐It doesn’t have any
effect on these guys.

172
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,830
‐Something’s going on.

173
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,832
All I’m getting is interference.

174
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,628
‐What’s going on?

175
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,722
‐Stop.

176
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,643
‐Rukia.

177
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,685
KON: Make way!

178
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,016
‐What’s with you guys?

179
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,770
Back off.

180
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,773
‐What should we do?

181
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,228
‐I don’t know.

182
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,413
Who’s that?

183
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,837
‐A Soul Reaper?

184
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,251
What are you doing here?

185
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,812
‐No, hey, get off, will ya?

186
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,730
Hmm?

187
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,652
Who’s that?

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,040
‐She’s going to
release her Shikai.

189
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:02,872
‐What?

190
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:03,996
‐Bring them to the twilight.

191
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,003
‐Ichigo.

192
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,206
‐Hold on a minute.

193
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,837
You don’t even know what
the hell you’re doing.

194
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,172
Those things aren’t Hollows,
so just back off, dammit.

195
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,259
‐Stay out of my way, you jerk.

196
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,802
‐What?

197
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,565
You stepped on my
face, you little brat.

198
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,194
‐Bring them to the twilight.

199
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,691
Mirokumaru.

200
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,700
‐Now what else could
possibly go wrong?

201
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,405
Huh?

202
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,624
What happened to that other guy?

203
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,388
‐Sorry I’m late.

204
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,977
Can you believe how
strong that wind was?

205
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,779
‐Any idea what just happened?

206
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,904
‐They vanished.

207
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,238
‐That was awesome.

208
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,163
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

209
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,242
And it felt so good.

210
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,250
‐Oh, great.

211
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,292
It’s the jerk.

212
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,084
‐Aah.

213
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,915
It was you.

214
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:31,962
Hold on.

215
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,425
How’d you change into
your Gigai so fast?

216
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,253
‐I don’t know.

217
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,839
‐You better tell me who you are.

218
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,673
‐I’m a Soul Reaper.

219
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,427
‐I already know that,
but who are you?

220
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,181
‐If you want to
know someone’s name,

221
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,972
it’s best to introduce
yourself first.

222
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,219
‐I’m Ichigo Kurosaki.

223
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,978
‐See?

224
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:49,982
That wasn’t so hard.

225
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,353
And my name’s Senna.

226
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,767
Later.

227
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,355
‐You’re not going anywhere,
not until you tell me

228
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,320
why you did that?

229
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,651
‐Because it’s my job.

230
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,397
‐What were those
things back there,

231
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,066
and what did you do to them?

232
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:01,355
‐Aah.

233
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,237
‐What?

234
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,283
Are those things back again?

235
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:03,816
‐This is bad.

236
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,330
I knew it.

237
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,741
‐What do you mean?

238
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,288
‐Hmm.

239
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,043
Nope, yellow just
isn’t my color.

240
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,795
‐What difference does it make?

241
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,418
Come on.

242
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,922
‐Your name’s Ichigo?

243
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:17,925
‐Yeah.

244
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:18,626
‐Check it out.

245
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,725
‐Huh?

246
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,550
‐There’s an unconscious man
in front of the train station.

247
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,135
Requesting an
ambulance immediately.

248
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:24,802
‐Hey, you OK?

249
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,217
‐Not again.

250
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,056
‐You really ought to
take care of that.

251
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:28,391
‐Oh, no, you’re coming with me.

252
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,024
w let’s go.

253
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,274
‐Hey, take it easy.

254
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,153
‐I still got some questions.

255
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,443
‐He never learns.

256
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,753
‐Aah.

257
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,048
Give up yet?

258
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,884
‐You got to be kidding.

259
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,509
‐I don’t know.

260
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,505
You really think it’s
wise for a lieutenant

261
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,137
to be drinking in the
middle of the day?

262
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,563
‐What, are you crazy?

263
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,893
I could drink this all
day and not feel a thing.

264
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,229
It looks like it’s
empty already.

265
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,315
‐What?

266
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,517
Not again.

267
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,978
You guzzled it all,
you drunken geezer.

268
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,068
‐You want to make
something of it, cue ball?

269
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,075
‐Damn straight.

270
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,316
Come on, I’m going to
teach you a lesson.

271
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,445
‐Fine.

272
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,531
Whoever loses buys
the Sake, got it?

273
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,787
‐Try to take the
high ground, huh?

274
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,883
‐It’s always better
to be on top.

275
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,331
‐Yeah.

276
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,378
We’ll see.

277
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,133
Here I‐‐

278
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,299
‐Lose your nerve?

279
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,395
‐What is that thing?

280
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,102
‐Huh?

281
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,239
‐You guys, look.

282
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,899
A Ferris Wheel.

283
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,907
I’ve always wanted to
ride on one of those.

284
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,945
Wow.

285
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,753
Sorry.

286
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,711
What is it that
you wanted to know?

287
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,250
‐What squad do you belong to?

288
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,673
‐I can never keep track
of all the little details.

289
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,673
I know that I belong
to one of those squads.

290
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,506
‐Now, listen, we’ve seen
you handle a Zanpakuto,

291
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,891
and you know how to release it.

292
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,469
Only a Soul Reaper would
have that knowledge.

293
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,595
You must be in a squad.

294
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,722
Every Soul Reaper
belongs to a squad.

295
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,978
How can you not remember that?

296
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,772
‐Question, please.

297
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,765
Before we go any further,
what are you doing here?

298
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,527
‐Well, I’m here
because‐‐ hey, wait.

299
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,029
‐So I forgot.

300
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:46,822
What’s the big deal?

301
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,946
I don’t see what
difference it makes.

302
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,624
‐Can you at least tell us what
those guys were back there?

303
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,411
‐I haven’t the slightest idea.

304
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,325
Ooh, he’s so cute.

305
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,326
Can I pet him?

306
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,787
‐Sure.

307
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,786
‐I just had this feeling that
I should get rid of them,

308
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,499
you know?

309
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,629
Instinct.

310
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:09,134
Isn’t that what they call it?

311
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,338
‐Whacko.

312
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,100
‐Listen, Ichigo, I need to
go back to the Soul Society.

313
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,352
‐Huh?

314
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,645
‐I’m having trouble
contacting them.

315
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,637
I think they should know
about that phenomenon

316
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,188
we witnessed earlier.

317
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,784
Stay with that girl, and don’t
let her out of your sight.

318
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,319
‐Hey, you can’t leave
me with that nutcase.

319
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,493
‐Wow, Rukia.

320
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,952
‐Don’t mess this up.

321
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,492
‐Boy, what’s she
so uptight about?

322
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,537
‐Hey, Ichigo.

323
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,371
Shut up you idiot.

324
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,327
There are people around.

325
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,116
‐She’s gone.

326
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,247
‐Huh?

327
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:40,753
Dammit.

328
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,380
Hey.

329
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,305
‐You’re so persistent.

330
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:49,473
‐Wait.

331
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,880
What a pain.

332
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,313
Hey.

333
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,072
‐Oh. [giggle] Remember
when you told me

334
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,034
that if I answered
your questions,

335
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,991
you’d do anything
I asked you to?

336
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,663
‐No, I never said
anything like that.

337
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:18,041
‐Let’s play tag, you’re it.

338
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:18,582
‐Wait.

339
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,964
I don’t want to play.

340
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,250
Hey.

341
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,674
Wait up.

342
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,922
I don’t believe this.

343
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,680
Senna.

344
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,219
Come on out.

345
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:33,592
This isn’t funny.

346
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,049
‐Hey.

347
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:35,759
What’s with all
the fun and games?

348
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,644
‐Rangiku.

349
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,555
Toshiro.

350
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,775
‐It’s been a while.

351
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,605
Refer to me as Captain
Hitsugaya, and not Toshiro.

352
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,691
‐Fine.

353
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,824
What are you two
doing here anyway?

354
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,651
‐Wait up, you guys.

355
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,446
‐We need to talk.

356
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,912
‐Yeah, well, uh,
I’m kind of busy.

357
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,411
‐Just come with us.

358
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,492
‐No, wait.

359
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,368
Hey.

360
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,503
Dammit.

361
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,540
I got to go, but
I’ll be right back.

362
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,083
Don’t go anywhere.

363
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,789
‐Mommy, that man is
talking to himself.

364
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,178
‐I see.

365
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,471
So Rukia went back
to the Soul Society.

366
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,928
Sounds as if you
just missed her.

367
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,057
‐Well, then, I suppose you
might as well get started.

368
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,275
‐At 12:50 AM today, a town
from the World of the Living

369
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,726
suddenly appeared
above the Seireitei.

370
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,606
We also detected a trail
of spiritual waves flowing

371
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,196
into the World of the Living.

372
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,740
Shortly after that, we
lost all communication

373
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,663
between our two worlds.

374
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,793
‐So what’s it all mean?

375
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,200
‐This guy is clueless.

376
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,328
‐Just relax.

377
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,076
Allow me to clarify a
few of these concepts.

378
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,787
You see our universe
has two worlds, which

379
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,498
are the World of the
Living where we are,

380
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,840
and the Soul Society.

381
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,424
Between them is the
Dangai Precipice World,

382
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,968
which serves as the tunnel,
as well as its main purpose

383
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:57,643
to keep the two
worlds from colliding.

384
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,810
See?

385
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,850
You went through it one
time, or have you forgotten?

386
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,274
It doesn’t matter.

387
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,941
At any rate, about three
days ago, a new dimension

388
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,810
appeared between
the Dangai Precipice

389
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,227
World and the World
of the Living.

390
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,785
It began to expand
rapidly bridging the gap

391
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,319
and adhering to both worlds.

392
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,322
At this point, it appears that
the area that attached itself

393
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,155
is acting like a lens.

394
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,869
Now you see, the
World of the Living

395
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,661
looks as if it’s located
within the Soul Society, which

396
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,116
is in a different dimension.

397
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,005
In other words, it just
looks like a mirage.

398
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,334
‐The Stealth Force was
sent out to investigate

399
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,630
this newly created
dimension, but they failed.

400
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,722
So now, we’re investigating
the influx of spiritual waves

401
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,090
into the World of the Living.

402
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,346
It was decided that I would
head up the operation.

403
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,349
‐Hold on a minute.

404
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,930
Why were you picked?

405
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,555
‐Because all the other
captains backed out.

406
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,896
‐Let’s just stick
to the details.

407
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,821
‐That must’ve been what
those white things were.

408
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,069
‐You saw something unusual?

409
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,152
‐Yeah, there were these
white ghostly things.

410
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,947
Must have been hundreds of them
wearing these red pointy hats.

411
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,911
‐It sounds like Blanks.

412
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,873
‐And that means the
Valley of Screams.

413
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:05,834
‐Time for explanation
number two.

414
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,373
Ready, Tessai?

415
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,868
‐Uh‐huh.

416
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,129
‐As you already
know, souls migrate

417
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,920
between the World of the
Living and the Soul Society.

418
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,296
From time to time,
however, there

419
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,221
are souls who for some
reason become detached

420
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,721
from the Cycle of
Transmigration while

421
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,393
in the Dangai Precipice World.

422
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,390
These souls wander aimlessly
through the Dangai Precipice

423
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,523
World and are slowly drawn
together over a period of time.

424
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,561
As the souls come together, it
causes a new dimension, hence,

425
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,649
the Valley of Screams.

426
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,573
In the Valley of
Screams, the souls

427
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,863
separate into memory
and energy, then

428
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,855
return to the Cycle
of Transmigration.

429
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,367
Are you following me so far?

430
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,411
‐Yeah, I got it.

431
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,333
‐So Ichigo, from the
description you gave,

432
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,583
it sounds as if
what you witnessed

433
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,754
were Blanks, which are
souls with no memories.

434
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,416
‐What happens to the memories?

435
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,212
They must go somewhere.

436
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,265
l, they merge
together into one entity

437
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,629
and return to the
World of the Living.

438
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,429
It’s called a Shinenju.

439
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,510
It’s a jewel that acts as
a collection of memories.

440
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,927
In any case, the appearance
of the Valley of Screams,

441
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,927
in itself, isn’t a
matter for concern.

442
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,599
It’s a natural and
common phenomenon.

443
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,559
Yet, there is a problem.

444
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,937
This time the Valley of Screams
has connected the Soul Society

445
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,186
to the World of the
Living, something

446
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,107
which has never happened before.

447
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,486
‐It’s not just some
weird natural phenomena?

448
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,495
‐There has never been
a natural phenomena

449
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,037
that has created a tunnel
linking two worlds.

450
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,409
That’s what’s going on here.

451
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,667
There’s no doubt that someone’s
doing this deliberately.

452
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,632
‐Hey.

453
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,459
That’s right.

454
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,165
‐Kon, what are you doing?

455
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,877
There was some guy wearing
really strange armour standing

456
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,625
right in the middle of
all those white things.

457
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,430
I saw it myself.

458
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,141
‐In a strange armour?

459
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,561
‐Do you remember any specific
details about the amour?

460
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,770
‐Of course, I’ve got a
memory like a steel trap.

461
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,731
Uh, now let’s see.

462
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,652
It was kind of a, uh, hmm,
well, when you think about it,

463
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,364
it was more of a‐‐

464
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,781
‐I’ll just take
this and analyze it.

465
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,873
‐Yes, please do.

466
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,660
If it’s being done
intentionally,

467
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,954
I doubt that whoever’s behind
this has honorable motives.

468
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,497
So what do they want?

469
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,130
At this point, it’s difficult
to know with any certainty.

470
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,169
‐But still, I have this feeling.

471
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,383
It concerns the Shinenju.

472
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,884
It must have returned to
the World of the Living,

473
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,006
and that’s what they want.

474
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:27,301
That theory makes
the most sense.

475
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,888
We’ll analyze the data and
try to identify the enemy.

476
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,435
I want you to keep watch
over the town, Ichigo.

477
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,559
I’m certain it’s
only a matter of time

478
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,228
before they appear again.

479
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,566
While you’re at it, keep your
eyes open for the Shinenju.

480
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,284
‐Yeah, no problem.

481
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,112
Ah.

482
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,106
Sorry about that.

483
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,087
Why’d she still be
hanging around here?

484
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,000
‐Wow, you came back
just like you said.

485
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,418
I’m right over here.

486
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,345
‐Would you quit messing around?

487
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,143
It’s time to answer
some questions.

488
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,516
Fine, you catch me, and I’ll
tell you whatever you want.

489
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:17,815
‐What?

490
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,727
Hey.

491
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,314
What’d I just say?

492
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,572
Dammit.

493
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,958
GAME HOST: He will now
drink an entire gallon

494
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,120
of orange soda in
two seconds flat.

495
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,249
Ready, and go.

496
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,755
‐10, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two‐‐

497
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:42,749
‐It’s all gone.

498
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,090
‐Give him a big hand, folks.

499
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,723
‐But he drank it too fast.

500
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,759
‐And you know what happens
when you get it wrong, right?

501
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:53,014
‐[shout] Yeah.

502
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,598
GAME HOST: Thank you very much.

503
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,485
Thank you.

504
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,941
If you enjoyed the
show, please feel

505
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,601
free to show your appeciation.

506
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,109
Pass the hat.

507
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,493
‐There’s a girl on
the roof over there.

508
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,035
‐Dammit, Senna.

509
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:10,865
‐Look.

510
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,200
‐Yeah, oh yeah.

511
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,954
‐Look at that girl.

512
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,038
‐Huh?

513
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,831
‐What’s she doing up there?

514
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,617
‐It must be some kind of act.

515
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,651
‐This feels so nice.

516
00:24:59,123 --> 00:24:59,663
‐Where’d she go?

517
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,788
‐She disappeared.

518
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,625
No, wait, there she is.

519
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,091
‐Ta‐da.

520
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,131
All right.

521
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,136
‐Pretty good, isn’t she?

522
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,099
‐Come on, take a bow.

523
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,059
‐Yeah, right.

524
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,060
Thanks.

525
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,681
‐Aah.

526
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,348
‐Oh, come on, now.

527
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,944
They completely upstaged us.

528
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,021
‐That’s show business.

529
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,817
SENNA: Thanks, it looks great.

530
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,863
You could have saved
us both a lot of time.

531
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,366
If you said you were treating,
I’d have answered right away.

532
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,161
‐So let me get this straight.

533
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,992
You don’t have any money?

534
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,868
OK.

535
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:40,497
What do you know about them?

536
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,461
‐Who are you talking about?

537
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,041
‐I just explained it to you.

538
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,207
The Blanks and the
Shinenju, remember?

539
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,046
You need to tell me
everything you know.

540
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,221
‐I would if I could.

541
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,879
It’s the first
I’ve heard of them.

542
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,678
So someone’s using those pointy
hat things try and find this,

543
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,774
uh, this Shinen‐a‐ma‐bob?

544
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,981
‐Shinenju.

545
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:00,889
‐Right.

546
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,686
They’re using them to find it?

547
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,690
‐Yeah.

548
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,151
‐So who is this someone?

549
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,400
‐That’s what we’re
trying to figure out.

550
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,194
‐And then what will you do?

551
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,525
‐I’m not quite sure.

552
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,741
‐Have you got any idea what
the Shinen thingy looks like?

553
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,955
‐Not a clue.

554
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,986
‐You’re not making this easy.

555
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,698
Well, it sounds to
me like you’re just

556
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,748
going to have to wait
for those pointy hat guys

557
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,711
to show up again.

558
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,332
You know what?

559
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,747
I’m going to help you out.

560
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,246
‐Huh?

561
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,758
‐There’s just one condition.

562
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:32,382
‐I knew it.

563
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,126
‐First, we got to do that.

564
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,298
‐Huh?

565
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,846
‐Take me for a ride
on that, and I’ll

566
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,259
help you with whatever you want.

567
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,768
‐I’m not falling for that again.

568
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:45,772
What the‐‐ Just what is
it with you and heights?

569
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,266
‐I don’t know.

570
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,317
I like it when I’m way up high.

571
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,071
All the things that seem
confusing or messed up suddenly

572
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,151
become clear.

573
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,648
‐Hey.

574
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,700
That ribbon.

575
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,951
‐Oh, you noticed.

576
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,244
The red looks better than
the yellow, don’t you think?

577
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,907
‐Yeah, but how’d you
get it with no money?

578
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,706
‐I wandered into some
shop to look at stuff

579
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,790
and tried this on to
see if I liked it.

580
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,125
I guess I must have
forgot I had it on.

581
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,712
It happens all the time.

582
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,626
‐Not when I’m around.

583
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,974
‐Well, wait, aren’t you
going to pay the check?

584
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,979
‐I’d like to buy this.

585
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,021
‐Ah, a present for
your girlfriend?

586
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:26,905
‐My sister.

587
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,439
‐Shall I gift wrap it for you?

588
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,403
‐Thanks, but I’m
kind of in a hurry.

589
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:35,857
‐Thank you very much.

590
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,278
I hope she likes it.

591
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,615
‐Here, take it.

592
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,242
‐I can’t believe you
actually did that.

593
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,828
You’re so uptight.

594
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,425
‐I hate that kind of thing.

595
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,999
Just take it and shut up.

596
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:49,996
‐Thanks so much, Ichigo.

597
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,247
Now the Ferris Wheel.

598
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,046
‐Yeah, right, forget about it.

599
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,342
‐Meany.

600
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,973
‐We high schoolers aren’t
exactly made out of money,

601
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,839
you know.

602
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,125
‐Hmm.

603
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,178
‐Hey.

604
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,433
‐I’m going to the restroom.

605
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,682
Is that all right with you?

606
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,989
He’s not a bad guy once
you get to know him.

607
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,322
Sweet.

608
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,446
All right.

609
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:33,748
That river.

610
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:39,758
‐Daddy!

611
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,965
Welcome home, Daddy.

612
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,058
Aah.

613
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,395
Dad?

614
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,319
‐Is my little boy, hungry?

615
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,237
‐Yes, Daddy.

616
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:07,447
‐Here you go.

617
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,409
‐Cheers, everyone.

618
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,426
‐Come on.

619
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,141
This place was so
crowded a minute ago.

620
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,838
‐Oh.

621
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:19,688
This is‐‐ this is my‐‐
this is my funeral?

622
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,188
Mom, Dad.

623
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:24,661
Aaah!

624
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:36,536
What?

625
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,515
Who are you?

626
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,972
‐You’ve got better
reflexes than I expected.

627
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,600
‐Why are you here?

628
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,101
And what do you want?

629
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,563
‐I’m going to be your escort.

630
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,904
Our commander, Ganryu, has
issued orders to summon you.

631
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:57,982
‐He summoned me?

632
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,115
Who is this guy?

633
00:30:59,191 --> 00:30:59,861
I’ve never heard of him.

634
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,283
‐That information
is unimportant.

635
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:07,412
So what are you
going to do about it?

636
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,872
‐Jai, I told you not
to waste time talking.

637
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,542
‐You should know better
than to jump out like that.

638
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:19,253
‐This will only take a second.

639
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,378
Stop it.

640
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,675
That tickles.

641
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:31,676
‐Don’t crush her.

642
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,065
‐We’re already late, let’s go.

643
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,063
‐Ah, ah.

644
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,280
‐Now, let’s go, shall we?

645
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,244
‐Hold it.

646
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,582
Where do you think you’re going?

647
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,579
‐Who the hell are you anyway?

648
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,464
Aaah, oh, my arm.

649
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,922
My arm.

650
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,673
‐What’s with all
the wandering off?

651
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,263
‐I just‐‐ why don’t you
mind your own business?

652
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,593
‐Afraid I can’t do that.

653
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,426
At least not until
you’ve kept your promise.

654
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,684
Hey, big guy.

655
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,603
Sorry about the arm.

656
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,141
‐You’re going to pay for that.

657
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,267
I’m gonna kick your ass.

658
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,522
‐That’s enough.

659
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,364
Patience.

660
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,979
The time has not yet come.

661
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:23,728
‐The time?

662
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,487
What’s he talking about?

663
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,110
‐Dammit.

664
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:27,945
‐Hey, wait a minute.

665
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,450
Hey, what’s the big idea of
letting me pay for lunch,

666
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,327
and then running away.

667
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,125
‐I wasn’t running away.

668
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,995
‐Then what were you doing?

669
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,215
‐My entire family is
buried in this cemetery.

670
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,715
‐You expect me to believe that?

671
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,296
‐I’m telling the truth.

672
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,511
I remember it all.

673
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,182
I do.

674
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:53,011
I remember when I was alive,
though it’s still kind of hazy.

675
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,058
I had to come and
see for myself.

676
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,480
My house used to be
around here, too.

677
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,602
Tell you what.

678
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,516
Let’s pick this up tomorrow.

679
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,306
I promise I’ll help you.

680
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,108
All right?

681
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,362
‐You idiot.

682
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,785
I’m not going to abandon
someone who was just attacked.

683
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,157
‐I don’t know about
this bad guy story.

684
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,124
It just sounds fishy.

685
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,715
‐Yeah, I know it sounds
pretty wild, but it’s true.

686
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,672
And it’s just for one night.

687
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,501
‐I’m Senna.

688
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,595
‐My name’s Yuzu.

689
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,669
It’s a pleasure to meet you.

690
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,675
‐Thanks for having me.

691
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,677
‐Hey, Yuzu, you
don’t mind if she

692
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,679
sleeps in your room
tonight, do you?

693
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,550
And she probably wants a bath.

694
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,349
‐OK.

695
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,848
‐What’s the matter
with you, Dad?

696
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:46,017
‐You guys are both crazy.

697
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,149
‐You can hang out in here
until your bed’s ready.

698
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,606
‐Hmm, boy’s rooms are
always so drab and boring.

699
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,487
‐Gimme a break.

700
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,735
‐Whatever.

701
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,538
It seems like you’ve got
a nice family, though.

702
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,869
‐You think?

703
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,906
‐Yeah, my dad was way different.

704
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,050
‐Hey.

705
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:13,586
‐What?

706
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,598
‐Is something wrong?

707
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,010
‐Hmm, nothing at all.

708
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:18,888
‐So do you have
any ideas as to why

709
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,305
those guys wanted
to take you away?

710
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,063
Did they say anything?

711
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:27,404
‐Oh, I think the guy said
commander Gan somebody wanted

712
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,574
me be brought to him.

713
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,400
‐Yeah, and what else?

714
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,034
‐That was it.

715
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,321
If you hadn’t come by when you
did, I might have learned more.

716
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:33,865
‐You’re crazy.

717
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:34,697
Hey, what are you doing?

718
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,741
You can’t sleep in here.

719
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,784
‐There’s nothing wrong with it.

720
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,949
‐Are you kidding?

721
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:39,737
Hey, quit kicking
your legs around,

722
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,658
and put your shoes back on.

723
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,496
‐That’s not cool, you guys.

724
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,712
‐Shh.

725
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,631
She says she’s going
to sleep in his bed.

726
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,540
‐So what?

727
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,417
It’s not like he’s a little kid.

728
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:49,755
‐No.

729
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,708
‐Oh, Masaki, it’s the
day we’ve been dreading.

730
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,427
I don’t know what
I’m supposed to do.

731
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,431
‐What’s going on out here?

732
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,473
‐I told you it wasn’t cool.

733
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,347
‐The bath is ready
whenever she is.

734
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,183
‐You guys.

735
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,598
Hey, Senna.

736
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,896
You can take your bath now.

737
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,230
Hey.

738
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,795
URAHARA (ON PHONE):
Ichigo it’s me, Urahara.

739
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,212
How’s it going?

740
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,749
Find anything out
about the Shinenju?

741
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,752
‐Nothing yet, but
I had a little run

742
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,634
in with those guys
Kon was talking about.

743
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:31,804
Remember them?

744
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,881
URAHARA (ON PHONE):
Are you all right?

745
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,974
‐Yeah, it wasn’t a big deal.

746
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,760
They took off before
anything happened.

747
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,932
‐Glad to hear it.

748
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,681
Listen, one of the
reasons I called

749
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,644
is because we were able to turn
up a few things on our end.

750
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,853
‐Like what?

751
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,694
URAHARA (ON PHONE): We
were able to analyze

752
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,650
the visions taken
from Kon’s memories.

753
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:51,649
If you recall, Kon said he saw
someone wearing strange armour

754
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,033
in the middle of the Blanks.

755
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,031
We identified the armour as
belonging to a group that was

756
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,324
banished from the Soul Society
after their takeover attempt

757
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,579
failed.

758
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,449
So I think we can be fairly
certain their motive is

759
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,655
revenge.

760
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,915
The question remains,
why are they here,

761
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,207
and what do they want?

762
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,883
‐Kisuke, can I ask
you a question?

763
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,883
URAHARA (ON PHONE): What is it?

764
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,264
‐Well, is it possible
for a Soul Reaper

765
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,431
to have memories of
when they were alive?

766
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,800
‐Huh?

767
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,847
I’ve never heard
of that happening.

768
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:26,022
You want to tell me
what this is about?

769
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,191
‐Nah, I was just
wondering, that’s all.

770
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,158
‐Hey, do you really think those
things will show up here again?

771
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,531
‐I’m not sure.

772
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,079
All I know is that the Blanks
showed up here once, and right

773
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:45,873
now that’s the only
clue we’ve got.

774
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,754
‐Man, this is totally boring.

775
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,752
‐I don’t remember this many
people being here at this hour.

776
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,547
Usually, things
are pretty quiet.

777
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,549
Not much going on.

778
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,392
Hey, Senna, do me a
favor and stay close, OK?

779
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:06,894
Hey.

780
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,225
Senna!

781
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:11,734
Where’d you go?

782
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,863
‐Over here.

783
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,909
‐In case you forgot, you
just got attacked yesterday.

784
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,740
You can’t just go
wandering off like that.

785
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:28,576
[crying] A soul?

786
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,583
What is it, kid.

787
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,576
What’s the problem?

788
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,036
‐You’re scaring him.

789
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,592
Hey, there, big guy.

790
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,593
My name’s Senna.

791
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,804
What’s yours?

792
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,835
‐Tomoya.

793
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,586
That’s a really nice name.

794
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,930
If you want to tell me what’s
wrong, maybe I can help.

795
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:52,135
‐I’m lost, and I’m all alone
because my Dad is gone.

796
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,770
‐Were you going someplace
with your father?

797
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,268
‐Uh‐huh.

798
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,569
We were in the car, and he
was taking me to the festival.

799
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,861
But I fell asleep, and when
I woke up, he was gone.

800
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,026
‐I see.

801
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,664
‐I know you miss your Dad.

802
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,163
And I’m sure he misses you, too.

803
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,914
But your Dad is up
in heaven right now.

804
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,664
‐Uh‐huh, he’s not in heaven.

805
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,868
My Dad is looking
for me right now.

806
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,825
I know it.

807
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,996
‐Well, if he is,
then maybe Ichigo

808
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,166
and I can come along with
you and help you find him.

809
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,085
‐Yeah.

810
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,711
‐We’ll all find him together.

811
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,838
OK, now, which way
did you come from?

812
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,795
‐Over that way.

813
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,185
‐Then let’s get going.

814
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,852
‐Hey.

815
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,930
Actually, we’re kind
of busy right now.

816
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,773
‐You said yourself
we have no leads.

817
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,309
No sense in hanging around here.

818
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,312
Let’s go.

819
00:38:32,393 --> 00:39:33,623
‐Yeah.

820
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,545
‐How much longer are we
going to keep this up?

821
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,916
It’s pretty obvious there’s
no festival around here.

822
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,875
Besides, those no guarantee his
father’s still on this side.

823
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,716
‐We are going to find him.

824
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,221
There’s not much time left until
he has to leave this world.

825
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,264
And then, that
little boy is going

826
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,059
to have a long
journey ahead of him.

827
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,981
This will be his very last wish.

828
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,521
Think how sad it would be
if it didn’t come true?

829
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,566
I can’t bring myself to
perform a Konso like this.

830
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:13,697
I just want‐‐ I want to give
him that one last good memory.

831
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,746
‐Senna.

832
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,581
I’m coming.

833
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,457
‐Hurry up.

834
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:18,873
I found it.

835
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,328
I found it.

836
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,077
Come on.

837
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,771
I don’t see him.

838
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,018
Where is he?

839
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,437
‐We’ll find him.

840
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:44,975
Come on.

841
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,609
‐OK.

842
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,621
‐I’m so glad this
place is still here.

843
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:56,372
We came here a lot when
I was a little girl.

844
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,834
‐But you‐‐

845
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:58,326
‐Tomoya!

846
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,826
‐Huh?

847
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,378
‐Tomoya.

848
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,630
‐It’s Daddy.

849
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,514
Daddy, oh.

850
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,101
‐I’m so sorry.

851
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,639
I’m so sorry, Tomoya.

852
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,562
‐I never thought
we’d really find him.

853
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,936
‐Thank you so much.

854
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:23,652
‐See?

855
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,483
We did it.

856
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,147
‐Uh‐huh.

857
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,145
‐It’s all thanks to you.

858
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,108
Ah, no, please, I didn’t
do anything, really.

859
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,198
‐It’s hard to believe.

860
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,325
I guess you were so wrapped
up in helping Tomoya

861
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,711
that you didn’t even
notice all the souls who

862
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,831
are gathered here.

863
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,285
I was able to find this
place, thanks to them.

864
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,972
‐All these people led you here?

865
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,720
‐Yeah.

866
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:53,344
Don’t you understand?

867
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,009
They’re here because of you.

868
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,638
I’m surprised you didn’t know.

869
00:41:56,723 --> 00:42:00,023
If it wasn’t for you,
they wouldn’t be here.

870
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,061
‐Tomoya, it’s time
for us to be going.

871
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,226
Bye, bye.

872
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:15,873
‐Hey.

873
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:16,742
Wait a minute.

874
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,329
Are these guys‐‐?

875
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,091
‐Why me?

876
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,054
Why?

877
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:33,555
Why are they all
attracted to me?

878
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,234
Ichigo.

879
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:46,479
I think that I must
be‐‐ is it true?

880
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,187
‐Senna.

881
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:08,709
Captain Ukitake, what
are you all doing here?

882
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:09,175
Rukia.

883
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,133
What’s this about?

884
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,465
‐Ichigo.

885
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,261
‐We’re here to carry out a
level one order from Central 46.

886
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,725
You’re to hand over
the girl immediately.

887
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,426
‐What?

888
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,636
‐Ichigo, I’ve searched every
record of the 13 Court Guard

889
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,559
Squads, the Stealth
Force and the Kido Force,

890
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,977
as well as the Soul
Reaper Academy.

891
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,278
There is no Senna
listed anywhere.

892
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,030
I also verified that the
Zanpakuto the girl uses,

893
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,203
Mirokumaru, was swallowed up
by the restrictive current

894
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,912
in the Dangai Precipice
World 100 years ago

895
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,913
along with its owner.

896
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,365
In other words, there is no
way her Zanpakuto can exist.

897
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,127
‐But that’s not possible.

898
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,841
What you’re saying isn’t true.

899
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:51,962
I am a Soul Reaper.

900
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,296
I know it.

901
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,222
‐Then when did you come to
the World of the Living?

902
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,719
How long ago?

903
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,181
‐It’s so confusing.

904
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,262
I remember walking
out by the banks

905
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,255
of that river two days ago.

906
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,677
And I’m not confused
about my name.

907
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,178
I know it’s Senna.

908
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,018
I remember that river.

909
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:12,114
When I was a little girl,
I‐‐ but I‐‐ then I was alone,

910
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,981
and there was no one else.

911
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,358
‐Don’t you see?

912
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,906
All those different memories
are mixed up in your head.

913
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,030
‐I know it’s hard to
comprehend, but the very thing

914
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,120
we’ve been searching for,
this Shinenju is actually you.

915
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,037
‐Is it true?

916
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,338
‐The Valley of Screams
became visible 24 hours ago.

917
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,093
We’ve concluded that the
man behind is Ganryu.

918
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,225
His motive is to
destroy the worlds.

919
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,433
In order to achieve
his objective,

920
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,222
he intends to
utilize the Shinenju.

921
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,978
The Shinenju Senna.

922
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,190
By order of the Soul Society, we
will now take you into custody.

923
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,904
‐But‐‐ but what
gives you the right?

924
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:57,438
What have I done?

925
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,198
I’m just one person.

926
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,162
How could‐‐

927
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,780
‐Just hold on.

928
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,578
You can’t do this.

929
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,123
‐Ichigo, what are you doing?

930
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,036
‐No matter what this girl is,
it doesn’t change the fact

931
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,375
that she exists at this moment.

932
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,921
Look, she has
feelings and emotions,

933
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,716
and has thoughts and
dreams just like you do.

934
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,090
But you want to ignore all
that and lock her away, right?

935
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,099
As far as I’m concerned,
you’re no different than them.

936
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,472
So you might as well
forget about it,

937
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,226
because I’m not handing
her over to you.

938
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,269
‐Sorry, but we haven’t the time
to debate this with you now,

939
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,055
Ichigo.

940
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,186
‐Step away!

941
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,232
Move Ichigo.

942
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,896
‐I can’t do that.

943
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:41,527
‐What is that?

944
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,712
‐Renji.

945
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:12,016
‐Matsumoto.

946
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:12,443
‐Damn.

947
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,940
Not these again.

948
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,324
Hey, kid.

949
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,527
It wasn’t time for us
before, but it is now.

950
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,448
‐Yeah, you’re right.

951
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:32,206
It’s time to lose
your other arm.

952
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,040
‐Ichigo.

953
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,084
‐Kon, take care of her.

954
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:34,576
‐Right.

955
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,180
‐I don’t know what
happened, but he’s

956
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:49,557
got more power than yesterday.

957
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,018
‐Go.

958
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:58,729
Get the Shinenju.

959
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,396
‐Yes, ma’am.

960
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,157
Reign over the frosted
heavens, Hyorinmaru.

961
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,883
‐Now roar, Zabimaru!

962
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:22,506
What the hell?

963
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,178
‐Sogyonokotowari.

964
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,096
Go Kuchchiki.

965
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:32,102
‐Right.

966
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,443
You get out of here, you freaks.

967
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,479
‐Rukia.

968
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,022
‐Hado 33, Sokatsui.

969
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,898
Get off me.

970
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:42,936
Wait.

971
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,147
‐I’m a Soul Reaper.

972
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,776
I’ll show them.

973
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:47,905
Aaah.

974
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,873
Bring them to the twilight.

975
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,536
‐No, don’t, Senna.

976
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,720
Senna.

977
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,313
‐There’s no mistaking it.

978
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,520
No.

979
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,429
That amour belongs
to the banished clan,

980
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,518
the noble House of Ryodoji.

981
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,613
‐I wouldn’t know about that.

982
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,441
We are from the Clan of
Darkness, the Dark One.

983
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,948
‐What?

984
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:27,611
Not so fast.

985
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:43,625
‐There’s no need to stay.

986
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:58,058
‐All right, put
the girl down now.

987
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,771
‐Hey, let go of me!

988
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,028
‐Senna.

989
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,939
I’ll handle this.

990
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,125
Forget it.

991
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,123
You can have her.

992
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:21,877
It’s over.

993
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:31,133
‐Ichigo.

994
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,321
Ichigo!

995
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:45,649
[scream]

996
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,910
‐Ichigo.

997
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,200
Ichigo.

998
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,313
‐He’s OK.

999
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,272
‐Oh.

1000
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,692
Thanks.

1001
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,560
I appreciate all of you
coming to help so quickly.

1002
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,767
‐They didn’t even
slow those guys down.

1003
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,027
‐Hey, it’s not that easy.

1004
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,451
Remember, three squad captains
were present during the attack,

1005
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,660
and even they were ineffective.

1006
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,619
So it wasn’t his fault.

1007
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,529
‐That’s true.

1008
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,867
‐Tell me what happened.

1009
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,412
‐Unfortunately, they had
planned an escape route,

1010
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,708
and they were able to get away.

1011
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,255
‐Have you been able to
learn anything else?

1012
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:50,167
‐Yes, it appears that they plan
to use the Shinenju to draw

1013
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,216
the World of the Living and
the Soul Society together.

1014
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,642
The massive collision
would be devastating.

1015
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,509
‐But why?

1016
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,715
What do they want?

1017
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,716
‐That I don’t know.

1018
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,428
But it all points
towards that conclusion.

1019
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,230
‐What about the Soul Society?

1020
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,861
‐They’re in council right now
working on a plan of action.

1021
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,230
Although, the
Valley of Screams is

1022
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,819
completely inaccessible
from the Soul Society.

1023
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,494
Without an entryway, it’s
impossible to mount an attack.

1024
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,495
‐But still, there
must be some way in.

1025
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:24,407
‐Well, I imagine the Shinenju
created some sort of passageway

1026
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:24,918
into the World of the Living.

1027
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,709
did get here somehow.

1028
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,632
‐Yeah, that’s right.

1029
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,302
‐Ichigo.

1030
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,802
If we find the entrance,
we can go after them.

1031
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,677
It is possible, isn’t it?

1032
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,723
‐Uh‐huh.

1033
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,426
‐Then let’s go.

1034
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:45,557
‐Ichigo.

1035
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,564
‐Hmm.

1036
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,607
‐All right then.

1037
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,400
I guess we’d better
start looking.

1038
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:51,903
‐Right.

1039
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,695
‐There’s absolutely no trace
of gun powder or chemical

1040
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,782
residue left by the explosion.

1041
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:04,038
‐What the hell is going on?

1042
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,557
‐Ichigo.

1043
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,647
I never should have‐‐

1044
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,821
‐It’s not your fault, Rukia.

1045
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,320
You did what you felt was right.

1046
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:40,783
Senna is strong‐willed, and
stubborn, and a little crazy,

1047
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,076
but she was trembling.

1048
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,170
She was so frightened
and confused.

1049
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,552
She had no idea
who she really was.

1050
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,722
And I just couldn’t see that.

1051
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,352
I failed and wasn’t
able to protect her.

1052
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,261
‐Ah, you noticed.

1053
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:08,188
The red looks better than
the yellow, don’t you think?

1054
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,690
Remember when you told me that
if I answered your questions,

1055
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:12,774
you’d do anything
I asked you to?

1056
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,106
I don’t know.

1057
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,901
I like it when I’m way up high.

1058
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,856
All the things that seem
confusing or messed up suddenly

1059
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,356
become clear.

1060
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,530
‐I don’t get it.

1061
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,909
Why’d she say that?

1062
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:30,462
‐Ichigo.

1063
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:30,871
What’s wrong?

1064
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,498
‐Don’t worry.

1065
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,544
Just come with me.

1066
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,037
‐All right.

1067
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,656
SENNA (VOICEOVER): I
remember when I was alive,

1068
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,792
though it’s still kind of hazy.

1069
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,870
My house used to be
around here, too.

1070
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,916
‐There it is.

1071
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,119
Right in the middle
of the river.

1072
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,511
Jump.

1073
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:27,929
‐What is that?

1074
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,563
Look at that.

1075
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,766
It’s the same phenomenon that’s
visible from the Soul Society.

1076
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,979
‐I’m going in.

1077
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,069
Rukia, contact Urahara and
tell him that we found it.

1078
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:42,654
‐No.

1079
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,490
It’s not safe.

1080
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,454
Wait for the others.

1081
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,873
‐I’m going now.

1082
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,700
Tell the others.

1083
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,955
Go.

1084
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:49,866
I’m going to save Senna.

1085
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,003
‐No, Ichigo.

1086
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,349
‐What is this place?

1087
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,472
Why am I up here?

1088
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:54,177
I thought you wanted me
to do something for you.

1089
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,689
‐You don’t need to do
a thing except sit back

1090
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,520
and be the instrument through
which we fulfill our dream.

1091
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,608
‐What are you talking about?

1092
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,942
Lord Ganryu is the rightful
ruler of the Soul Society.

1093
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,158
So lower your voice and
address him properly

1094
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:07,909
or else you’ll regret it.

1095
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,241
‐Relax.

1096
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,537
I’ve long since abandoned the
need for such formalities.

1097
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:16,042
1,000 years have passed
since we were banished

1098
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:20,044
by the unjust laws
of the Soul Society.

1099
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:23,048
They exiled our clan
to wonder endlessly

1100
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,760
in this Dangai Precipice World.

1101
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:29,343
We survived by evading the
restrictive current which

1102
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,928
swallows up everything
that touches it.

1103
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,215
We discovered the
souls who had strayed

1104
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,518
from the Cycle of
Transmigration and turned

1105
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,402
into wandering ghosts in
the Dangai Precipice World.

1106
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,021
We then learned to
use them as an energy

1107
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,436
source for our own power.

1108
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,110
The number of souls
is always constant.

1109
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,124
And when these
souls, or Blanks who

1110
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,374
have strayed from the
Cycle of Transmigration

1111
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,255
reach a certain number,
they’re naturally

1112
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,794
drawn together and
generate a dimension

1113
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:04,629
known as the Valley of Screams.

1114
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,095
Imagine a dimension
consisting entirely

1115
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,513
of a compact mass of Blanks.

1116
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,643
And at the same time, all the
memories of these lost souls

1117
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,103
merge into one object and return
to the World of the Living.

1118
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,852
That is the Shinenju.

1119
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,525
The Shinenju is you.

1120
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,735
‐However, the Blanks
cannot completely lose

1121
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,315
their individuality.

1122
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,992
Even though the Blanks are
basically empty vessels,

1123
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,071
they still wander
for a time searching

1124
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,244
for their lost memories.

1125
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,458
This is where the
problem begins.

1126
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,998
If the Shinenju is
placed at the center

1127
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,884
of the Valley of
Screams, the proximity

1128
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,750
will intensify the Blanks
desire to seek their memories.

1129
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:51,338
This will drive them to rush
towards the creating a vacuum.

1130
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,718
The result will lead to
the Valley of Screams

1131
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,394
to constrict and cause
the Dangai Precipice World

1132
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,063
to collapse, pulling the
Soul Society and the World

1133
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,062
of the Living together
in a massive collision.

1134
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,814
‐Is that possible?

1135
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:07,567
‐I got to admit, it’s not
a very pleasant thought.

1136
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,991
‐Least pleasant of all, is the
fact that it’s already begun.

1137
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,240
‐Never mind all the details.

1138
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,413
How much damage are
we talking about?

1139
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,832
‐It’s difficult to say exactly.

1140
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,620
But when two worlds that
aren’t meant to touch align,

1141
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,246
it would certainly result
in the destruction of one,

1142
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,583
if not both worlds.

1143
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,378
‐But when?

1144
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,923
How much time do we have?

1145
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,086
‐Given my limited data, I
can’t establish a precise time.

1146
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,005
But I would guess about an hour.

1147
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,596
‐I’ll mobilize the
Punishment Force

1148
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,100
to attack the Valley
of Screams immediately.

1149
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,311
‐It’s useless.

1150
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:43,392
There is no Senkaimon that
connects the Soul Society

1151
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,150
to the Valley of Screams.

1152
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,650
Therefore, we have
no way to enter.

1153
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:52,703
There’s nothing our troops
can do to stop this.

1154
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:53,531
‐The situation is critical.

1155
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,623
Prepare the Kido
Cannon immediately.

1156
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,040
We must destroy the
Valley of Screams

1157
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,579
and the by firing
directly into its core.

1158
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,206
‐But if we do that, we’ll
cause massive damage

1159
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,132
and countless casualties
to both worlds.

1160
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:10,259
‐I’m sorry, but we
have no other choice.

1161
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,630
‐Let me through.

1162
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:12,265
‐Stand back.

1163
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,802
You’re not allowed inside.

1164
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,473
‐How dare you interrupt.

1165
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,808
This is a captain’s meeting.

1166
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,443
Be gone.

1167
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,652
‐My deepest apologies, sir.

1168
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,111
I will gladly accept
any punishment later.

1169
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,233
However, I have
crucial information,

1170
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,859
and it’s imperative
that you hear it.

1171
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,946
This substitute Soul Reaper,
Ichigo Kurosaki has discovered

1172
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,165
an entryway to the Valley
of Screams through the World

1173
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:44,543
of the Living, and has
gone there to rescue the .

1174
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,673
I beseech you, please
send reinforcements

1175
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,421
to assist Ichigo.

1176
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,625
‐Ichigo.

1177
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,305
How did he‐‐

1178
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,224
‐I’m afraid I cannot
honor your request.

1179
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,721
‐But why, captain?

1180
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:02,104
Mind you, I am not taking the
substitute Soul Reaper’s skills

1181
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,022
lightly.

1182
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,310
However, we have only one hour.

1183
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,435
And there is no guarantee
that the 13 Court Guard Squads

1184
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,773
could enter the Valley of
Screams, defeat the enemy,

1185
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,780
and rescue the in that time.

1186
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,821
Do not think poorly of me.

1187
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,698
This meeting is now over.

1188
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,243
All squads will begin
emergency procedures.

1189
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,656
Prepare the Kido Cannon.

1190
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,698
‐I have‐‐

1191
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:03,986
‐I’m going, too.

1192
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,699
That crazy bastard.

1193
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,499
I’m not about to let him
take all the glory again.

1194
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,516
‐The Blanks are being
drawn to the just

1195
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,857
as you said Lord Ganryu.

1196
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:36,534
‐Of course.

1197
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,031
Well, now.

1198
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,078
We have a guest.

1199
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,537
‐Senna.

1200
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,675
I’m coming for you.

1201
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,311
‐Have you returned
for another beating?

1202
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,521
‐Give Senna back.

1203
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:19,494
Just as the moment has arrived
for her to finally awaken

1204
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,949
as the , because of you she
will be forced to endure

1205
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,913
unimaginable pain and
fear as a human being.

1206
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:29,447
‐Ichigo.

1207
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,209
Oh, no.

1208
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:34,922
Ichigo.

1209
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:35,921
‐Hang on.

1210
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,258
[screaming]

1211
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,932
‐Yeah, you bastards.

1212
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,367
‐Mr. Urahara, don’t you think we
should go after Ichigo in case

1213
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,949
he needs our help?

1214
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,486
‐It’s impossible.

1215
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,159
The Valley of Screams is
somewhat similar to the Soul

1216
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,499
Society.

1217
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,633
It’s a spiritual world
where humans cannot go.

1218
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,337
‐Rukia.

1219
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,137
‐Renji.

1220
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,432
‐So how’d it go?

1221
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,313
‐No good.

1222
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,470
They refuse to send anyone.

1223
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,598
And they intend to use
the Kido Cannon to destroy

1224
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,346
the entire Valley of Screams.

1225
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:40,269
‐If they do that, what
will happen to Ichigo?

1226
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,398
‐I’m not about to
let that happen.

1227
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,994
We’re going in there
to finish the job,

1228
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,360
and get Ichigo out of there
before they fire the Kido

1229
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,449
Cannon.

1230
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,372
‐Do you have a plan?

1231
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,081
‐Don’t worry about it.

1232
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,201
We’ll come up with something.

1233
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,619
‐You wouldn’t stand a chance
going in by yourselves.

1234
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,630
We’ve already put
the team together.

1235
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:02,341
Now we’re going to deal
with this ourselves.

1236
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,672
‐And I’m coming, too.

1237
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,129
‐Would you quit fooling around?

1238
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,717
Let’s go.

1239
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,505
‐Right.

1240
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:14,928
‐Please, Rukia, please
take care of Ichigo.

1241
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:15,728
‐Don’t you worry.

1242
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,514
‐That’s it.

1243
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,177
I’ve had enough of this.

1244
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,571
Kenpachi.

1245
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,741
‐You might want to move.

1246
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:14,538
‐Don’t worry about me.

1247
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,828
‐What’s that?

1248
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,551
‐It’s time to get
down to business.

1249
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,306
‐But why are you‐‐

1250
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:37,391
‐We’re not about to let you
have all the fun yourself.

1251
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,935
‐Things have gotten
fairly dull lately,

1252
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,228
so we thought we could
do with some amusement.

1253
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,273
‐I said you might need some
help, and they all volunteered.

1254
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,610
So never fear, the
cavalry is here.

1255
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,574
‐Let’s do what you
came here to do.

1256
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,655
‐What are we waiting for?

1257
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,988
Let’s do this.

1258
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,580
‐Right.

1259
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,702
Extend, Hozukimaru.

1260
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,963
Yeah.

1261
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,799
‐Roar, Heiniko.

1262
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:24,901
‐Raise your head, Wabisuke.

1263
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:43,832
‐You stupid little‐‐ on

1264
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:44,327
‐Huh?

1265
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:47,548
What the hell’s going on?

1266
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,050
‐Hey.

1267
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,716
This isn’t what you’re
looking for, is it?

1268
01:06:55,845 --> 01:07:06,605
‐You little‐‐ It’s
too late little girl.

1269
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:30,499
‐You little‐‐ It’s
too late little girl.

1270
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,048
Goodbye.

1271
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,718
[scream]

1272
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:47,476
‐[grunt]

1273
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:47,944
‐Huh?

1274
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,194
‐Huh?

1275
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:56,859
‐How ridiculous.

1276
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:05,541
Hide and seek’s not
my favorite game,

1277
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:09,633
but I’m not too bad at it.

1278
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,422
‐Uh‐oh.

1279
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:14,133
Get ’em, Kenny.

1280
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,007
‐Are you ready to
use that sword?

1281
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,773
What do you know.

1282
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,890
You just might turn out
to be fun after all.

1283
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,917
‐Reign over the frozen
heavens, Hyorinmaru.

1284
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,470
‐Hanging in there, huh kid?

1285
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,729
You don’t seriously believe
your energy will outlast mine?

1286
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,730
But I’m happy to keep it
up as long as you are.

1287
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:11,984
Take this.

1288
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,352
That didn’t take long.

1289
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,861
‐Now Bankai.

1290
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,995
Daiguren Hyourinamru.

1291
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:04,372
‐‐[grunt] I can’t believe he
still has that kind of power

1292
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,540
left.

1293
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:08,501
What’s happening?

1294
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,459
No.

1295
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,421
[scream]

1296
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,895
‐Third chant is in place.

1297
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:32,305
Preparations for
firing are complete.

1298
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,405
‐Research Technology
CommCenter reports

1299
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,070
the target will pass out of the
critical range in five minutes.

1300
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,403
‐Hmm.

1301
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:41,698
Head Captain.

1302
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,819
‐I understand.

1303
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,776
I will wait until
the very last second.

1304
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,278
However‐‐

1305
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,590
‐I will never let you
take the Shinenju.

1306
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,137
‐Ichigo, grab on.

1307
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:19,653
‐Renji.

1308
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:20,316
‐Go Ichigo.

1309
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,202
‐You’re not going anywhere.

1310
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,462
‐We’ll kill the two of
you, and then your friends.

1311
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,932
‐What the‐‐

1312
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,321
‐Senna!

1313
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:08,526
You still foolishly believe
that you can save the Shinenju?

1314
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,828
‐We’ll see who looks
foolish after I walk out

1315
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:11,990
of here with Senna.

1316
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,419
‐You’re too late.

1317
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:20,842
The Shinenju has
already begun to merge

1318
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,630
with the Valley of Screams.

1319
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:26,764
No one can stop it now.

1320
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:27,933
‐Shut up.

1321
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,050
I’ve had enough of your crap.

1322
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,139
I’m grabbing Senna and
taking her out of here.

1323
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,234
‐You still don’t
seem to understand.

1324
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,941
I told you, it’s useless.

1325
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,520
Getsuga Tensho!

1326
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,864
‐You little pest.

1327
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:50,198
‐You finally showed
yourself, huh?

1328
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:54,833
After I crush you, I’m going
to walk out of here with Senna.

1329
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:55,542
‐Go ahead.

1330
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:58,423
Bring it on.

1331
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:10,302
Tensa Zangetsu.

1332
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,390
‐For a millennium
our clan was forced

1333
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:01,938
to scrape out an
existence, surviving only

1334
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:05,021
by concealing ourselves in the
dank crevices of the Dangai

1335
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,437
Precipice World.

1336
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:10,526
Our hatred for the Soul
Society was the only fuel

1337
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:13,453
that drove us to endure
that living hell.

1338
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,952
Then we discovered how
to avenge this injustice

1339
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,795
and obliterate those
who condemned us

1340
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:18,372
to this wretchedness.

1341
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,294
Now the moment is at hand.

1342
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,115
No one is going to stop me.

1343
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,262
Why are you so desperate
to save this girl?

1344
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,637
The Shinenju is a mass
of collective memories,

1345
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:39,676
nothing more.

1346
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:43,599
The worthless remains of
what used to be alive.

1347
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:44,858
‐No she’s not.

1348
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,191
You’re wrong.

1349
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,186
Senna is alive.

1350
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,737
And she’s here.

1351
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:59,869
She was confused and
afraid, looking for help.

1352
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:04,166
She’s done nothing wrong,
but you want to destroy her.

1353
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,251
I made a promise
that I’d protect her,

1354
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,915
and I swore it on my soul.

1355
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:12,126
[shout]

1356
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,352

1357
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,151
‐That’s it.

1358
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:31,194
I understand now.

1359
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:34,697
All of you are just‐‐ Ichigo.

1360
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:49,093
‐We pass out of critical
range in 20 minutes.

1361
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,051
‐Why haven’t they contacted us?

1362
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:54,011
What’s going on?

1363
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,591
‐There’s no time.

1364
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,548
We must fire.

1365
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:01,056
‐Sensei, please.

1366
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,890
‐Commence firing the cannon.

1367
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,465
‐They fired the cannon.

1368
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,878
‐It won’t be long before the
entire dimension collapses.

1369
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,391
‐What the hell?

1370
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:51,016
‐My Zanpakuto’s
tougher than you think.

1371
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:54,397
But underestimating my power is
going to be your last mistake.

1372
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,123
‐You can’t escape.

1373
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,119
‐I’m not planning
on running away.

1374
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,210
‐You’ll wish you had.

1375
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,633
‐Dance, Sode no Shirayuki!

1376
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,843
‐Nice try.

1377
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,349
‐Some no mai, Tsukishiro!

1378
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,290
What?

1379
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,334
‐I told you.

1380
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,958
You can’t escape.

1381
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:00,586
‐Byakuya.

1382
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,307
‐As you pass into
the next life, feel

1383
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:10,481
honored that you
perished by my Bankai.

1384
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:15,271
Scatter, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

‐[shouting]

1386
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:22,201
‐Byakuya.

1387
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:23,413
‐Come, Rukia.

1388
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:28,372
‐Senna!

1389
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:57,017
Time for you to die.

1390
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,987
‐Come on.

1391
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:04,449
[shouting]

1392
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:37,402
‐You’re awfully quiet for once.

1393
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,401
Hey, what’s the matter?

1394
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:38,612
Cat got your tongue?

1395
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,915
‐Shut your big fat mouth.

1396
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,079
‐They’re coming back.

1397
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,364
‐They’ve successfully
retrieved the Shinenju.

1398
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,489
The Valley of Screams
is disintegrating.

1399
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:00,274
‐Welcome home.

1400
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:01,646
‐Rukia.

1401
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,282
‐You actually did it, Ichigo.

1402
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,280
‐Yeah.

1403
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:06,191
‐Job well done.

1404
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,198
You’re all to be congratulated.

1405
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:09,661
‐You’re all right.

1406
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,370
We were so worried.

1407
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,163
‐Rukia.

1408
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:13,543
Renji.

1409
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:14,329
Thank you.

1410
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,251
‐You idiot.

1411
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,792
It’s not like we did it for you.

1412
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,543
‐Yeah, I didn’t think the
big moocher had it in him.

1413
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,536
‐What are you talking about?

1414
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,378
‐Don’t worry, we’ll feed you.

1415
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,173
‐Senna, I forgot.

1416
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:27,506
I still have your ribbon.

1417
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:31,051
‐Ichigo.

1418
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,556
‐What’s going on?

1419
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:44,477
Why is the alarm
continuing to sound?

1420
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,816
‐It’s no good.

1421
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,492
The dimension passed
beyond the critical zone.

1422
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,701
Gravity is pulling the World of
the Living and the Soul Society

1423
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:54,083
together on a collision course.

1424
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:02,246
‐What’s this all about?

1425
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,586
‐It isn’t stopping.

1426
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,090
‐Then what’s going to happen?

1427
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,422
‐This isn’t good.

1428
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:10,088
‐Senna.

1429
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,808
Why is this happening?

1430
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,232
‐This is bad.

1431
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:23,943
‐Dammit.

1432
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,652
Isn’t there anything we can do?

1433
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,086
‐Ichigo.

1434
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,380
I’m scared.

1435
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,133
‐Senna.

1436
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,054
‐I won’t do it.

1437
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:53,433
I just can’t.

1438
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,510
I can’t allow it.

1439
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,806
Not when this is such
a wonderful world

1440
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:03,401
with so many beautiful
people living in it.

1441
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,649
Not where you live, Ichigo.

1442
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:07,231
I can’t let that happen.

1443
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:14,913
It’s OK.

1444
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,160
The Blanks are still near me,
and I’m not afraid of them now.

1445
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:21,965
If I return their memories to
them, then they’ll be at peace.

1446
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:25,579
And the barrier between the two
worlds will be strong again.

1447
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:29,457
‐But Senna.

1448
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:33,046
‐If the world were destroyed,
then there would be no Ichigo.

1449
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,684
I can’t imagine a
world without you.

1450
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:43,813
‐Stop!

1451
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,444
You can’t do this.

1452
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:53,111
‐No, Ichigo, I would never
allow you to die in front of me.

1453
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:56,035
‐No, Senna.

1454
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:56,196
Senna!

1455
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:05,536
‐Confirming countless
spiritual explosions

1456
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,576
in the Dangai Precipice World.

1457
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,459
The Soul Society and
the World of the Living

1458
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:13,635
are both moving towards their
previous stable positions.

1459
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,625
The collision has been averted.

1460
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:20,058
‐Ichigo, I have a favor to ask.

1461
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:04,814
I want you to take me back
and check my family grave.

1462
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,943
Remember yesterday when
I told you it was here,

1463
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:14,031
I was alive once, and
I lived in this town.

1464
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,399
I know it.

1465
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:18,355
‐Yeah.

1466
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,527
‐I don’t remember everything.

1467
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,826
But I did have a family.

1468
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,620
I’m certain of it.

1469
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:28,206
I was in this world,
and I was alive.

1470
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,920
So there has to be
a name on the grave.

1471
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,470
‐You know, it was
right around here.

1472
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,140
‐It was just down this
row, fourth from the end.

1473
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,270
Is there a name?

1474
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:53,774
My vision is blurred, and
I can’t see very well.

1475
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:05,413
Is it there?

1476
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:05,834
‐It’s there.

1477
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:06,951
Clear as day.

1478
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,965
You used to live in this
town, and you had a family.

1479
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,804
‐I’m so happy.

1480
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,692
I feel warm.

1481
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:38,526
Ichigo.

1482
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:41,282
Will we ever meet again?

1483
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:41,823
‐What you talking about?

1484
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,195
Of course, we will.

1485
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:24,107
‐The energy from the Blanks
is slowly dissipating.

1486
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,369
Soon it will all be gone.

1487
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,830
Once that happens,
everything about Senna

1488
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,909
will fade from our memories.

1489
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:33,077
She was never alive
in our lifetime,

1490
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,416
so you can’t remember
someone who didn’t exist.

1491
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:45,586
‐I know she’ll be gone
soon, but right now, I

1492
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,049
can still hear her voice.

1493
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:02,363
