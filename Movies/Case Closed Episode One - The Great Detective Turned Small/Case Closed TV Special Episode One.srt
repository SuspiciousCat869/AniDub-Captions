1
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,537
Hm...

2
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,729
Hello, it's me.

3
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,022
Can you come over?

4
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,906
That's right. Lab #4.

5
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,637
I've got something interesting to show you.

6
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,661
Okay.

7
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,651
A smell?

8
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,178
But I didn't smell anything like that.

9
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,735
It's like a shark in a way.

10
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:35,147
Hm?

11
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,906
Smelling the scent of blood and
rushing to the scene of the crime.

12
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:42,830
Using each and every sense to track
down the perp and grab hold of them.

13
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:46,724
Closing in with rows upon rows
of the sharp teeth of evidence,

14
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,963
and not letting go until the perp gives in.

15
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,019
Hmph.

16
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,203
That's being a detective.

17
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,468
I really don't think that's a good idea.

18
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,616
You know there was a murder at this aquarium.
Should we really have "Operation: Rekindle Love" here?

19
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,409
I guess not.

20
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:41,377
Ugh, aw bummer! Look, it's starting to rain!

21
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:44,339
Huh? Really? We should run home!

22
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,263
Wait a sec! I thought I told you not to run!

23
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:48,851
What's wrong with running?

24
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,486
Ah.

25
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:55,915
No way! What the heck was my
cellphone doing inside my hood?!

26
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:57,082
Sorry...

27
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,540
I was trying to figure out where the perp had
put the cell phone to record the movie, and well...

28
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:04,114
I completely forgot I had put it there in your hood.

29
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,766
What're you gonna do about it?!

30
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,261
My Dad just got it for me!

31
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,626
No! Don't worry!

32
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:11,812
I'll buy you a new one! It'll be an even better one, okay?

33
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:12,855
You suck!

34
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,414
Something bad always happens when I spend time with you!

35
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:20,052
When we went to the states, all
you did was work on cases there too!

36
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,397
Okay, okay. Then...

37
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,913
I'll take you somewhere else.

38
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,772
How about we go to Tropical Land?

39
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,203
What's Tropical Land?

40
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:30,803
Where is this wonderous dream land...?

41
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,337
It's new! I heard they're
almost done building it in Tokyo.

42
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,746
And I'm sure there won't be any cases getting
in the way at an amusement park, you know?

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,330
If you're the one paying for it
all then I guess I don't mind going.

44
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:43,203
Huh?!

45
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,747
We should totally go if win the Tokyo karate tournament!

46
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,739
How about it?

47
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,374
Uuh...

48
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:52,968
Wait a second, I remember you
being the runner up last year.

49
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:57,744
And, didn't the upperclassman who won
the tournament retire from the karate club?

50
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,466
That's a promise, right?

51
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,348
Hmph.

52
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:02,588
Huh...?

53
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,346
It's not like I get that much allowance, you know?

54
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:07,493
And if you're gonna buy me a new cellphone,

55
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:11,717
make sure to put a Sea Slug Man strap
that they sell at the Beika Aquarium on it.

56
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:12,810
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:13,736
Also!

58
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,698
What? You're telling me there's more?

59
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,479
Well, I guess that's all for now.

60
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,257
Gee, thanks...

61
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:37,564
Ugh, it's raining so hard!

62
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,921
The forecast was way off today.

63
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,648
I'll have a... What he's having.

64
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:55,805
Really? You don't have to check the contents?

65
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:56,424
Hmph.

66
00:06:57,008 --> 00:07:01,120
If this infos been faked, we'll just
have to take your life as recompense.

67
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,595
Doesn't stop me from checking on my end, at least.

68
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,023
Suit yourself.

69
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,545
Okay, confirmed.

70
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:15,317
Thank you for waiting.

71
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:19,227
So, have another job lined up?

72
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:20,172
Hm...

73
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:24,352
You know, I'm gonna at least need an
outline of what the next job's gonna be like.

74
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,836
How about this?

75
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,704
There's been a rat sneaking around lately.

76
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:31,183
It's been sniffing out info on the Organization.

77
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:31,961
Uh...

78
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:33,247
Well?

79
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,001
Oh. That's the first I've heard about it.

80
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,264
I see.

81
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:43,975
So, my next job is figuring
out who the rat is. Is that right?

82
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,548
No need.

83
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:49,075
We already have a hunch of who's
been sniffing around the place.

84
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:49,750
Er...

85
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:51,840
Oh.

86
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,622
Huh, this is actually a pretty good drink!

87
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:57,926
What's in it? Does this cocktail have a name?

88
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,116
It's Rum.

89
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:04,424
Cointreau, a little bit of lemon juice...

90
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:05,799
Huh?

91
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,335
"XYZ"...

92
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,370
A drink called, "This is the End."

93
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:18,915
Well, gotta go! Uuh...

94
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,552
Let me know if another job comes up!

95
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,630
You sure about this?

96
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:30,268
Just letting him go like that?

97
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,638
We both know that he has to be the rat for sure.

98
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:34,535
Yeah.

99
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:37,730
Don't worry about it.

100
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:56,830
Hmph.

101
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,463
It's a cocktail that signifies the end.

102
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,553
It's me.

103
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,561
Understood. Now get out of there.

104
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:52,141
Heh.

105
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:55,463
Alright then boss, what should we do?

106
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,561
You know, about the gun-smuggling data?

107
00:09:58,691 --> 00:09:59,688
Doesn't matter.

108
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,160
We should continue on as planned.

109
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,917
Have you prepared enough cash?

110
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:07,834
You know we have to be sure they
understand how serious we are about this deal?

111
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,837
Yeah. But the whole thing could be a set up.

112
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:12,605
I wouldn't worry about that.

113
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,507
We can sus them out even after we've made contact.

114
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:17,819
Yeah, that is true.

115
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,781
Besides...

116
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:19,412
Huh?

117
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,082
Hmph.

118
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,715
That place is way too important to just give up on.

119
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,298
Hm... Huh?

120
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:49,081
Yes?

121
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:50,370
Oh, Shinichi!

122
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,090
Ran? What is it? It's way too early for this.

123
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,224
What are you talking about?!

124
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,308
It's already 11! Eleven!

125
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:58,514
Wait, seriously?

126
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,792
Ugh...

127
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,670
I'm coming in.

128
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,846
And? What are you doing here?

129
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,092
It's Sunday, you know.

130
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:13,705
So, you did forget after all.

131
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:15,832
Hmm? What did I forget?

132
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,920
Don't ask me what you forgot!

133
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:22,395
When I told you I didn't have karate practice
today, you said, "Then we should go buy your cellphone."

134
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,033
It was all your idea!

135
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,812
Er... Oh, sorry! I completely forgot!

136
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:31,884
Come on. You were up all night reading
a mystery novel again, weren't you?

137
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,537
Hah, you caught me.

138
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:34,648
Uh...

139
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:37,181
Just hurry up and get changed already.

140
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,420
In the meantime, I'll cook you
up something to eat for breakfast.

141
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,973
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

142
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:43,497
Oh. Thank you.

143
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,645
Look here! Just don't forget the Sea Slug Man strap, okay?

144
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,415
Roger!

145
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:00,492
Huh...

146
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:01,183
Hm?

147
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,780
So hey, remember how that car exploded near Beika Harbor?

148
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:07,745
It was on the night that we went
to the Beika Aquarium last week.

149
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:08,436
Yeah?

150
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:11,973
Did you find out what happened?

151
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:14,991
It looks like they still haven't figured out who did it.

152
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,017
You're right. That's kind of scary.

153
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:21,015
Don't worry. I'm sure it'll be solved soon.

154
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,644
Japanese police are amazing, you know?

155
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,245
Uh-huh. You're just trying to
say you're even more amazing,

156
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,000
because they come asking you for
help when they can't solve a crime.

157
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:30,888
Got that right!

158
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:31,395
Uh...

159
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:34,415
Can't you just be a little modest?

160
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,885
I'm joking! It's a joke!

161
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,660
Alright, are you ready to get going then?

162
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,786
Sure.

163
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,520
Mitsuhiko! Mitsuhiko!

164
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:55,975
Pass! Pass!

165
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:57,884
Ayumi!

166
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,892
Wah!

167
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:00,624
Ah! Uh...

168
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:02,261
Hmph!

169
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,194
Are you ready, Genta?

170
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:07,607
Ready!

171
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:11,954
Dah!

172
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,070
It's super easy.

173
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,220
Aww!

174
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,666
You almost made it, Ayumi!

175
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,336
Okay, so now it's my turn to kick!

176
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:23,027
Yah!

177
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:24,755
Woah!

178
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,701
Come on Genta! Where were you aiming that kick?!

179
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,020
Hehe... Sorry, sorry.

180
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:31,480
Sorry!

181
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:32,210
Hm?

182
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,072
Hey, would you get that ball for us?

183
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,112
Hup!

184
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:39,825
Woah... So cool!

185
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,185
Are you a soccer player?

186
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,353
Yeah, I used to be one. Catch!

187
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:46,234
Woah!

188
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,150
Wow, thank you so much!

189
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,042
Bye-bye!

190
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:55,103
I bet if we had a friend who was
as good at playing soccer as he is,

191
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,230
we'd become really good players too!

192
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:58,145
Totally!

193
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:02,031
What if you hadn't quit the soccer club?

194
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:05,456
Maybe you would've been a
member of the Samurai Blue by now.

195
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:07,426
Really? In 11th grade?

196
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,370
Why not?

197
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:11,101
Besides, the only reason I started playing soccer,

198
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:14,394
was to build the athletic skills
that are expected of a great detective.

199
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:17,685
After all, Holmes used to practice fencing, didn't he?

200
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,492
He's a fictional character...

201
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,945
Yeah, but he's a famous detective
known by everyone in the world over!

202
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:24,498
Uh...

203
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,662
That may be true and all, but...

204
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:28,575
He's the coolest!

205
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,815
He's always calm and composed,

206
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:36,091
He's wise and sophisticated, and his skills
of observation and deduction are unbelievable!

207
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,425
He's even a master violinist!

208
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:43,504
The famous Sherlock Holmes, created
by novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,

209
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,983
is without a doubt, the greatest
detective the world has ever known!

210
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:47,904
Hmm...

211
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,429
Huh?!

212
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,292
Aah! Somebody get him, he stole my purse!

213
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:53,114
Hm.

214
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:53,768
Huh.

215
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,913
Somebody help!

216
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:57,248
Move it!

217
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:02,016
Woah!

218
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,489
Excuse me, please.

219
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,997
Please let us through!

220
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:07,583
Huh?

221
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:08,544
Ah...

222
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:13,902
Who the hell are you?

223
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,923
Haido High 11th grader, Hina Wada!

224
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:20,277
Isn't she...

225
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,887
Hey, Ran! Come on! You and I have got to help.

226
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,302
Uh-uh. It's okay, she's got this.

227
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:27,550
Huh?

228
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:31,737
Damn it! Gettin in my way? You're gonna get it!

229
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,862
Oh? You're gonna use a knife, huh?

230
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:40,064
Okay then, I guess I'll just have to take you seriously.

231
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,409
Karate?

232
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:45,132
Mhm.

233
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,394
Oof! Woaaah!!

234
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,188
Ugh!

235
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:56,221
Hehe.

236
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:01,740
Huh..?

237
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,602
Hmph!

238
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:05,867
Hm. Want some more?

239
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:13,645
Wow, looks like she's pretty strong, huh?

240
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:14,373
Mm-mm.

241
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:14,988
Stop it!

242
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,151
She's not pretty strong. That girl is strong.

243
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:24,514
Her first encounter with her life-long rival,

244
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:28,345
was unavoidable, as she pursued
mastering the martial art of karate.

245
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,706
They met in the spring time,
when Ran Mori was 16 years old.

246
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,508
Sonoko!

247
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,723
How about that?

248
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:37,203
What are you doing narrating my life like that?

249
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,372
And it's not even spring yet, geez!

250
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,811
Oh come on! I'm just creating the atmosphere!

251
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,830
It's not even my first encounter with her either.

252
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,523
Oh, so you do know her.

253
00:16:46,982 --> 00:16:49,050
Yeah! I've faced her many times.

254
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,829
Never mind that, Ran. Come over to my place!

255
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:53,641
But we're already on our way to the...

256
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,955
You guys can go on a date some other time! Let's go!

257
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,184
Wait, Sonoko!

258
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:58,835
Huh.

259
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:06,273
I'm home!

260
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,005
Welcome home, Lady Sonoko.

261
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:11,835
Well, come on in you guys!

262
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:13,018
Nice to see you again!

263
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,236
Welcome, Miss Mori and Mister Kudo.

264
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:22,234
So today, we have the Puru Fuwa Cheese Tart,
a confectionary that I ordered from Hokkaido.

265
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:25,496
Huh? The one that you have to wait 3 months for?!

266
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,106
Yup! Let's eat it together!

267
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm so excited!

268
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:32,396
Is it okay to eat something like
that right before your tournament?

269
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,364
Don't blame me if you get fat.

270
00:17:34,677 --> 00:17:35,727
It's fine!

271
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:39,555
My upperclassman Kazumi's coming
over to help me practice a bit tomorrow.

272
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:42,567
In fact, I'll even double my routine if I have to.

273
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:43,440
Jeez.

274
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,418
You have such a nagging husband.

275
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,308
Hey, what do you mean husban—

276
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,445
What is it, Sonoko?

277
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,376
Oh! You have guests? I'm sorry!

278
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:51,994
Welcome back, Sonoko.

279
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:54,411
Just barging in like that. How impolite.

280
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,455
No problem! Such youthful energy!

281
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,608
This must be your daughter?

282
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,770
Yes! Our daughter Sonoko.

283
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:02,885
Nice to meet you.

284
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,084
How unfortunately embarrassing.

285
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:09,032
She lacks awareness of the heir
to the Suzuki Financial Group.

286
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,657
You've got my sister for all that.

287
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,630
It's about where your heart should be.

288
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:17,596
Ah yes, that's right! And standing
behind my daughter are her friends,

289
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:20,135
Miss Ran Mori, and Mister Shinichi Kudo.

290
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,606
Uh...

291
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,761
You know, Ran's father used to
be a detective in the police force,

292
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:27,018
and he now makes his living as a private eye.

293
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,711
Perhaps you could discuss your case over with him?

294
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:31,276
Uh, well...

295
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:32,992
There's a case?

296
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:38,164
Mr. Sewa will be holding a party this weekend,
so they came all the way here to invite us.

297
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:42,200
However, unfortunately, we
won’t be able to make it ourselves.

298
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:45,442
We have a briefing that same
day that we simply cannot miss,

299
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,444
for the upcoming jewelry exhibition at Beika Museum.

300
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,615
Oh, the Black Star one Uncle Jirokichi was talking about.

301
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:53,853
Yes.

302
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,221
But according to Mr. Sewa,

303
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:59,879
he received a startling message,
warning him to cancel his party.

304
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:04,169
And that if he didn’t, one of
his party guests would be murdered.

305
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,431
I see...

306
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,999
You can count on Mr. Shinichi
Kudo to handle something like that?

307
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,000
Huh?

308
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,703
If you must know, Shinichi is
a renown high school detective,

309
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:16,937
who has helped the police solve a
number of seemingly unsolvable cases!

310
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,207
I hate to say this,

311
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,080
but he's way better at it than Ran's father.

312
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,535
That's for sure.

313
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,199
I think I could be of some help to
you if you'd let me take on this case?

314
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:28,345
Well, that is quite encouraging!

315
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,780
Just to be safe,

316
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:34,098
we've already increased the number of security
guards we'll have present at the event that night.

317
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:37,625
I don't think we need to ask a
detective for help at this point.

318
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,881
Well, I guess it's about time that we got going.

319
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:41,413
Alright?

320
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:42,365
Yes.

321
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,393
Woah! Ah!

322
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,208
Watch out!

323
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:48,548
Woah!

324
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,337
Hmph.

325
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:59,201
My God! What do you think you're doing?!

326
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,931
Pay proper attention!

327
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,889
Uh... Well, we've been spared, thanks to you.

328
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:07,748
Thank you so much, miss.

329
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:08,716
Sure!

330
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:10,205
Nice save, Ran!

331
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
Thank you so much.

332
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,238
I certainly hope you didn't get hurt?

333
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,660
No, I'm fine!

334
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:18,624
I inherited a very sturdy body from my father!

335
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,713
Oh. Did what I say bother you?

336
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:22,056
I didn't mean it.

337
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,095
Well, you see, the Mori family is quite the family!

338
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,942
Jeez, Sonoko...

339
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,219
Mr. Kudo?

340
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:34,728
What seems to be wrong?

341
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,618
Nothing! Everything's fine.

342
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,541
Oh, this is amazing!

343
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,890
It's made of a super lightweight
material that was developed

344
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:45,590
by the Suzuki Financial Group's
very own textiles division!

345
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:50,491
And the sleeves are a bit narrower and less
baggy, yet still quite easy to move around in.

346
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:54,266
I may not look it, but I'm quite
the martial arts fanatic, you see.

347
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,761
Are you really sure it's okay for me to have this?

348
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:57,888
Well of course!

349
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:02,050
I may have played a tiny part in
its design as well, just so you know.

350
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:03,156
Wow, you did?!

351
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:03,965
Yep!

352
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,398
You can even call me couturier
Sonoko if you like my style?

353
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,392
With that karate outfit...

354
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:12,958
you're set to win the tournament for sure!

355
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:14,611
That's the power of love!

356
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,689
Well the thing is...

357
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:16,716
What's the matter?

358
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:19,570
She's not allowed to use that outfit at the tournament.

359
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,157
What's that?! Really?

360
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:25,065
That's right, each tournament has
it's own different outfit regulations.

361
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm really sorry, Sonoko. But I'll
wear it during practice and do my best?

362
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:30,564
I guess it can't be helped.

363
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:33,823
So then you'd better win that
tournament! Or I will be upset!

364
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,440
I'm sorry, Mrs. Suzuki.

365
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:37,540
Oh, it's fine!

366
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:40,935
We can't be there to cheer for you.
But do give it your best shot, alright?

367
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,365
Right!

368
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:47,844
We still didn't get a chance to go buy your cellphone.

369
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:52,326
True. Well, I'm gonna go buy a
few things for dinner and head home.

370
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,995
Okay. We'll go get your cellphone next time.

371
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,385
Mhm!

372
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:56,347
See ya!

373
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:57,832
See you later!

374
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:01,629
Aah!

375
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,982
Shinichi! I forgot my wallet at your place!

376
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:08,111
Seriously?

377
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:12,227
Shinichi!

378
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,270
Hey, Shinichi?

379
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,630
I found my wallet so I'm gonna go.

380
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,670
Okay.

381
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,105
I still can't believe how many books you have in here.

382
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,733
And that all of them are mystery novels.

383
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:32,528
I guess your father was able to became a world-famous
mystery novelist thanks to reading all of them, huh?

384
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:38,280
And you became a mere mystery junkie.

385
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:39,581
I resent that.

386
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:43,316
Not to mention your beautiful
mother is the legendary actress,

387
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:45,064
Yukiko Fujimine!

388
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:46,732
I'm so jealous.

389
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:48,998
It's not as great as it looks, you know.

390
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:52,165
Hey, I bet I know who your first love was?

391
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:53,800
It was your mother, right?

392
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,044
What?! No!

393
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,465
Okay then, who is it?

394
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,477
Mm... urgh... Dah!

395
00:22:58,704 --> 00:23:01,177
Well if you must know, my first love was...

396
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,988
Yes, she was..?

397
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,904
I'll tell you who my first love was...

398
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:07,843
Hm?

399
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:12,545
Woah?!

400
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,578
What in the world are you doing?! Doctor Agasa!

401
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:24,313
So tell me, how's your homework coming along?

402
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:27,491
I thought it was about time
for you to start feeling drowsy!

403
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:29,763
How was it? I bet this woke you up!

404
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,074
Don't move around so much, Doc!

405
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:35,115
Ow! Sorry about that.

406
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:38,583
So what kind of experiment was it this time?

407
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,767
So, you want to know after all!

408
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:42,251
Not really.

409
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:45,622
Well, since you insist, I'll tell you everything about it!

410
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:49,085
Ta-da! It's a personal rocket!

411
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:52,280
"Ta-da?" Come on, really?

412
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:57,373
Once I've finished perfecting this baby, traffic
jams and the like will finally be a thing of the past!

413
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:59,963
And not to mention, I'll be a millionaire!

414
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:01,145
Hmm.

415
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,848
But isn't that thing kind of dangerous?

416
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,088
I mean it's basically a missile, am I right?

417
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:11,418
What're you talking about?! I consider
safety first with every last thing I make!

418
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:12,965
This incident was a fluke!

419
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:14,605
Huh? Woah!

420
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,880
Shinichi!

421
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,060
Aah, Doc!

422
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:19,680
He's hopeless.

423
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:21,634
What!?

424
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,975
Come on, shut up! Stop nagging me already!

425
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:28,086
It's not like I want to go with you, either!

426
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:30,155
But here's the thing. Ran wants...

427
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:33,293
It's only natural that parents
go cheer for their children.

428
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,223
What I'm trying to say is...

429
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:39,592
Isn't there something more important you
should consider doing, before deciding on that?

430
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,216
I'm sure you don't have any jobs
chalked up for this month, either.

431
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,130
Argh! Don't go making assumptions!

432
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:47,862
I've found 3 this month already, you know!

433
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,799
Three?

434
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:50,389
Doing what?!

435
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,719
You're a great detective who
spends his time looking for lost dogs!

436
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,895
No, not dogs! Cats! Don't you mock me!

437
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:58,145
The other day, I stomped into a place...

438
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,979
I'm home!

439
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,258
... when actress and producer
were having an illicit affair and...

440
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:04,426
What? That's a case! No, it's totally a case!

441
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:06,668
I'll call you when dinner is ready, okay?

442
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:10,096
So stuck up! Aren't you just deceiving them?

443
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,544
But that president...

444
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:20,629
I can't figure out why he went out of his way to choose
such a place so full of people to carry out the deal?

445
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:22,527
He underestimates us.

446
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:26,127
He thought choosing a place like that
would prevent us from making a scene.

447
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:29,504
And if he just happened to bring a companion along,

448
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,180
that crowd would make a great cover for escape.

449
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,546
Then maybe it is a trap.

450
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:39,139
Bourbon mentioned the president was
also seen hanging out with the Deisankai.

451
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:42,198
Wow, Bourbon huh?

452
00:25:42,903 --> 00:25:45,828
That guy sure knows how to sniff things out.

453
00:25:46,384 --> 00:25:48,135
Well, even so,

454
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:51,730
since we know about it, there won't be any issue.

455
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,726
We'll just have to kill him first.

456
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:09,376
Haah!

457
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:10,210
Aah!

458
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,671
Ah! Woah!

459
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,148
Yah!

460
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:12,745
Woah!

461
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:15,853
And, stop!

462
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:17,116
She did it!

463
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:17,696
Alright!

464
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:20,335
Blue, high kick, one point!

465
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,795
And blue wins!

466
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:25,281
Hm, haha!

467
00:26:25,723 --> 00:26:27,928
That was fantastic! Ran is amazing!

468
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,780
At last Mr. Mori! She made it to the finals!

469
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,500
Ha, she'll make it hands down!

470
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,236
Ran wins when it counts, just like I do!

471
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,353
There's no way she'll lose in the finals!

472
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:43,420
I pray she didn’t also take after you in
getting carried away and dropping the ball.

473
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,280
What's that?

474
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:48,284
Well, since Ran's also my daughter,
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

475
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:53,775
Ran! Go for it at the finals!

476
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,396
Ah, where is he? Just like him to disappear.

477
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:02,762
Yes, yes, I understand.

478
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,096
Alright then Inspector. Right away.

479
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:11,746
The Kumite Women's Section Finals will now begin.

480
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:16,654
Red, Haido High School, Hina Wada.

481
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,606
Here!

482
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:21,682
Blue, Teitan High School, Ran Mori.

483
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,642
Here!

484
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:24,203
Begin!

485
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:32,454
Hah!

486
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:32,855
Ah!

487
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,055
Ah! Hmph.

488
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:38,081
Hmph.

489
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,593
Hah! Yah!

490
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,244
Hup!

491
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:42,236
Ah!

492
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:49,341
All right, all right! That's good, keep it going!

493
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:51,168
Stay calm Ran, please!

494
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,214
Stop!

495
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:05,595
Huh?!

496
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,625
Red, middle kick, two-point! Ready. Begin!

497
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:11,562
Hah!

498
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,106
Gah!

499
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:30,128
Hah!

500
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,128
Stop!

501
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,356
Hey! Ran, what are you doing?!

502
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:46,916
Ran! Focus! You can do it!

503
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:50,547
Focus! Focus! Focus super hard!

504
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:56,234
Focus hard!

505
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:57,577
Waah...

506
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:01,335
Huh?

507
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:05,411
Oh...

508
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,020
Hm... Huh?

509
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,293
Shinichi?

510
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:22,152
What?

511
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,823
There's... a... case...

512
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:28,976
There's a case?

513
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:33,975
It's just never ending cases... Just cases, cases,

514
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,419
and more cases!!

515
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,490
Damn you...

516
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:41,968
You crazy deduction freak!!!

517
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:01,782
Hmph.

518
00:30:02,745 --> 00:30:03,100
Heh.

519
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,993
I wish you'd just drop it already.

520
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:11,013
I don't have time to waste on
your fruitless investigation.

521
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,340
Please, no need for you to be rude.

522
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,701
There's no mistake here. Trust me on this,

523
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,488
the perp in this case is one of the people here tonight.

524
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,083
Then, why don't you find that
"perp" right away and arrest him?

525
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:24,246
We know who it is.

526
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,678
Huh?

527
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:28,040
We already figured out who the perp is.

528
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:31,024
There you are Mr. Kudo! We were waiting for you.

529
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:33,451
I'm so sorry. I know I'm a bit late.

530
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,651
Who does this young man think he is?

531
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,769
He can't possibly be here with you!

532
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:39,439
Hmph. Have you forgotten?

533
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:42,335
We met just the other day at the Suzuki residence.

534
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,223
Hm? At the Suzuki's?

535
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:47,635
If you must know, Shinichi is
a renown high school detective,

536
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,088
who has helped the police solve a
number of seemingly unsolvable cases!

537
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:53,675
A high school detective, eh?

538
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,427
Here are the facts as we know them,

539
00:30:56,531 --> 00:31:01,267
Mr. Yamazaki, president of Beika Bank, was
murdered in the guest room on the third floor.

540
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:04,675
I happened during a party that
was being held here earlier tonight.

541
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:05,770
Hmm...

542
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:09,355
The victim's death was caused by a knife wound.

543
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,340
The door of the room was completely locked,

544
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:15,837
and the key to the room was in Mr. Yamazaki's pocket.

545
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:20,714
The only thing left open, was the
veranda window that faces the garden.

546
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:25,416
Therefore, the perp had to have made
their way through the veranda window,

547
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:27,611
and killed the resting Mr. Yamazaki.

548
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:31,057
Then they fled the scene of the
crime the same way they entered.

549
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:34,817
But when they checked, there weren't
any shoe prints under the window.

550
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:39,250
Besides, all the other rooms surrounding the
guest room were properly locked up for the night!

551
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:43,581
That's true that, there were no shoe prints under
the window, and all the other windows were locked.

552
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:46,146
There was no way to get to the open window.

553
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,053
If that's the case, then how did...

554
00:31:48,258 --> 00:31:50,912
Hmph. He flew in from the outside.

555
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:51,920
What?!

556
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,786
That's ridiculous.

557
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,995
Come now.

558
00:31:55,156 --> 00:31:57,005
Are you being serious, Kudo?

559
00:31:57,414 --> 00:32:00,462
Of course, he didn't come flying down from the sky.

560
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:04,961
There's a small window diagonally
across from the window in question.

561
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,280
The perp jumped from that window
all the way to the guest room window.

562
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:10,844
That's nonsense!

563
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:14,238
Those two windows you're talking
about are at least 5 meters apart!

564
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,240
That's utterly impossible...

565
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:21,476
On the edge of the roof leading to the small
window is a ledge, though a very narrow one.

566
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,267
If you use that as a foothold and move towards the wall,

567
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:29,096
it's only a meter or two to the veranda.

568
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,820
And so, the perp is someone who already knows

569
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,532
the unique structural characteristics of the house.

570
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,767
And is someone who could easily walk around
the place as they please without suspicion.

571
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:44,571
Alright, well get on with it then!

572
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,280
Who was it who killed President Yamazaki?!

573
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,687
That would be...

574
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:50,996
You right there!

575
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,315
Hm?

576
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,160
Mr. Yamazaki's best friend,

577
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,996
as well as the head of this household...

578
00:32:56,569 --> 00:32:58,120
Takanori Sewa!

579
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,180
D-Don't be ridiculous!

580
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,552
That'd be impossible with this foot!

581
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:04,751
The cat's out of the bag!

582
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:08,756
Hmph.

583
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:12,824
Just what do you think you're doing?!

584
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:14,378
Ah... Father...

585
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:15,406
Mr. Sewa...

586
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:16,353
Hmm..? Huh?

587
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,894
Oh my dearest... It's your foot.

588
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:25,363
It's something I noticed when I
met you at the Suzuki residence.

589
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:30,614
You used your broken foot to try and stop
yourself when your wheelchair malfunctioned.

590
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:35,157
I bet that foot has long since healed, am I right?

591
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,278
Argh... Damn it!

592
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,076
Wait, hold it!

593
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:44,206
Uh-uh, you're not getting away!

594
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:51,348
Yes! Goal!

595
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:59,276
Well, thank you for your kind
assistance yet again, Mr. Kudo.

596
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:00,291
Don't mention it.

597
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:02,584
If another tough case should arise,

598
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,699
you can rely on the great detective Shinichi Kudo!

599
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,712
Hey, so have you heard?

600
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:20,730
That high school detective solved another case!

601
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:22,731
Yeah! He's so fantastic!

602
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,849
This young detective is being hailed as a
bright new hope, for Japan's law enforcement agency.

603
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:29,468
Ah! Guh...

604
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,534
Ow! What was that for?

605
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,809
Idiot. Stop being so cocky about it.

606
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,504
Ran, are you upset or something?

607
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:39,679
Not really.

608
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:43,087
Thanks to your great detective
work my Dad has less to do now.

609
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:45,368
So no. I'm not upset at all.

610
00:34:45,558 --> 00:34:46,193
Uh...

611
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:50,555
Okay, but it's not my fault nobody's
giving your dad any cases to work on...

612
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,446
It's because of his mediocre skills.

613
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:54,281
Ah... haha...

614
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,850
See what did I tell you? I'm not the least bit angry!

615
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,331
Why would I be angry?

616
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,925
That's the captain of the karate club for you.

617
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:11,480
Jeez.

618
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:14,735
Everybody makes a fuss over you being a great detective,

619
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,673
but you're nothing but a deduction freak.

620
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,554
But just look at all these fan letters!

621
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:21,477
Everybody else seems to like the
fact that I'm a deduction freak?

622
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,794
Whatever.

623
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,264
I don't mind you getting moonstruck over girls,

624
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:29,826
just make sure you can narrow
it down to your favorite girl!

625
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:32,360
My favorite girl?

626
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:35,032
Huh...

627
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,636
Just unbelievable.

628
00:35:38,663 --> 00:35:39,319
Hm...

629
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:41,555
What?

630
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,321
Woah!

631
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:44,670
What are you doing staring at my face like that.

632
00:35:44,695 --> 00:35:46,384
Um... you know, nothing...

633
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:49,166
If you keep snooping around all of those cases,

634
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,977
you're gonna wind up in real trouble!

635
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,160
Perhaps.

636
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,457
But why even become a detective?

637
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:54,981
Huh?

638
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:59,986
Since you love mystery novels so much, why
don't you aspire to become a novelist like your dad?

639
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,378
Hm... I don't want to write stories about detectives.

640
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:04,951
I want to be one.

641
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:05,832
Ah...

642
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:07,715
Hmph.

643
00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:11,910
I'll become the 21st century Sherlock Holmes!

644
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:14,819
Huh...

645
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,244
The more difficult the case the more excited it makes me!

646
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:23,374
The thrill of cornering the perp who's
used up all their tricks! The ecstasy!

647
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:24,676
I can't get enough!

648
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:28,571
Once you have a taste, you just
can’t stop! It's an addiction.

649
00:36:29,906 --> 00:36:30,247
Huh...

650
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:31,719
See you, Ran!

651
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:33,298
Uh... wait, Shinichi!

652
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,949
Hm?

653
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,453
You remember the promise you made for tomorrow, right?

654
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:39,128
What promise?

655
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:40,560
It was your idea!!

656
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:44,834
You said so yourself that you'd take me to
Tropical Land if I won the prefecture tournament!

657
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:46,423
Really? I said that?

658
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,283
Just forget it.

659
00:36:49,368 --> 00:36:51,611
I didn't really want to go with you anyway!

660
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:55,000
Go have fun with the girls that write you fan letters!

661
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,372
I was only joking! Come on, please!

662
00:36:57,397 --> 00:36:59,921
Don't get mad. I do remember, okay?

663
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,950
Tomorrow 10AM, Tropical Land.

664
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:05,364
Hehe...There's no way I'd forget.

665
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:09,353
And don't forget that you promised to pay for everything!

666
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,103
Urk! I did promise that didn't I.

667
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:14,890
Hey, hold on! Wait up, Ran!

668
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,744
No way!

669
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:23,582
We're back in Japan for the first time in forever,
and we have to leave without seeing our son first?!

670
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:28,784
I went through all this trouble to disguise
myself because I wanted to surprise him, and now...

671
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:31,812
Hmph! It was totally in vain.

672
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:35,984
Well, we're only in Japan to
retrieve some old reference materials.

673
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,583
We'll just have to save our disguises... for another time.

674
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,351
Besides, we'd only be getting in their way,

675
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,719
if we revealed ourselves now.

676
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,293
Mmmm!!

677
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,216
I wanna do that, so I can see his angry face!

678
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:16,574
Wah!

679
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,547
Thirsty? I got you a drink!

680
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,595
Oh, um thank you.

681
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:25,538
Come on, this way!

682
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:27,722
Hey! Where are we going, Shinichi?

683
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,113
Don't worry about it! Just follow me!

684
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,629
Ah, uh...

685
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,691
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

686
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,428
five, four, three, two, one, zero!

687
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:49,838
Heh.

688
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,314
This is totally cool! Wow!

689
00:38:57,108 --> 00:38:58,047
Uh...

690
00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:01,682
You do like things like this, don't you?

691
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,384
Mhm!

692
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,903
Uh!

693
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,041
Heh.

694
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:17,012
But do you wanna know what the most
amazing thing about Sherlock Holmes is?

695
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,311
He was such a great detective that when
he first met his assistant Dr. Watson,

696
00:41:21,336 --> 00:41:25,410
he could tell just by shaking his hand
that he'd been in Afghanistan as a medic!

697
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:27,651
Just like this, watch!

698
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:28,355
Huh?

699
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:32,402
Let me guess. You're in a gymnastics club, right?

700
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:35,421
Huh? How... could you possibly know that?

701
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:37,479
Who's that? Is he someone you know?

702
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:39,043
I don't think so?

703
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:41,034
I could tell from your hand.

704
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:41,641
Huh?

705
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:44,954
A woman who has this many blisters on her hand,

706
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,696
must be a gymnast who performs on a horizontal bar.

707
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,055
Uh, yeah but... You can get blisters from playing tennis.

708
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,225
Well actually,

709
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:56,360
the wind was blowing pretty hard outside,

710
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:59,375
and I was able to catch a short
glimpse when her skirt blew up!

711
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:05,302
The bruise I saw on her upper thigh is unique
to people who practice on uneven parallel bars.

712
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:06,357
Huh?!

713
00:42:06,912 --> 00:42:09,815
It's important for a detective to always be observant.

714
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,601
Can't let anything out of sight!

715
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,604
What in the world are you talking about?

716
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:17,688
Besides, it's cheating if you already
knew the truth before shaking her hand!

717
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,466
Hey, you!

718
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:19,919
Huh?

719
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:24,527
You better not even think
about making a pass at my friend!

720
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,781
Uuh, er...

721
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,904
Are those two friends of yours?

722
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,779
Well, yeah...

723
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:32,822
In that case, would you like us to change places with you?

724
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:34,664
Oh, no no! It's fine!

725
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:37,485
Yeah we sure wouldn't want to get in the way of those two!

726
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,792
Hmm...

727
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,758
You see...

728
00:42:48,296 --> 00:42:51,541
The thing is Ran, I've always had feelings for you...

729
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,131
Really? Me too, Shinichi.

730
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:57,842
Shinichi?

731
00:42:58,408 --> 00:42:59,382
Shinichi!

732
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,789
Gah!

733
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:03,009
Shinichi, hurry up!

734
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:03,513
Huh?!

735
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:07,232
Huh? Oh, yeah! Right!

736
00:43:14,255 --> 00:43:15,447
Thank you for riding!

737
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,869
Please watch your step as you exit!

738
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:19,118
Oh that was so scary!

739
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:20,523
Let's go on it again!

740
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,885
And then after that, Holmes decided to...

741
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,496
There's room for two more!

742
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,780
So that's basically what Conan Doyle
was trying to say about Sherlock Holmes.

743
00:43:31,805 --> 00:43:33,386
And when you think about it that way...

744
00:43:33,432 --> 00:43:36,445
I’ve heard more than enough
about Holmes and Conan Doyle already!

745
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,501
So knock it off you deduction freak!

746
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,219
You don’t know... You don’t even know how much I've
been looking forward to coming here with you, Shinichi...

747
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:51,139
I don’t understand how come you never notice how I feel.

748
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:51,587
Uh...

749
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:53,367
Ran...

750
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,080
Oh, hey, you know? Actually, I also um...

751
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:03,663
Huh?

752
00:44:05,372 --> 00:44:06,968
You're so silly.

753
00:44:07,421 --> 00:44:09,560
What are you getting so flustered about?

754
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:11,703
Come on, couldn't you tell I was lying?

755
00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:14,404
Damn it!

756
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,543
Aw, you took it seriously?

757
00:44:17,352 --> 00:44:21,642
If you fall for easy stuff like this,
you'll never make it as a detective.

758
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:24,622
Okay! Now departing!

759
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,062
See you all later!

760
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,944
Just so you know...

761
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:35,738
Huh?

762
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:38,526
I'm glad I'm here with you! I really am.

763
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,036
Huh?!

764
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:42,912
Ah...

765
00:44:58,055 --> 00:44:59,007
Woo!

766
00:45:27,326 --> 00:45:30,438
Hmm. So we're not seeing any action, huh?

767
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,716
Come on, let's go. We're pulling out!

768
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:34,959
Orders are to withdraw.

769
00:45:35,562 --> 00:45:36,173
Hm?

770
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,482
What's wrong? Wanna ride that?

771
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,133
Boo!

772
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:08,455
Wait what? Water?

773
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,933
And it's salty?

774
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:11,522
Huh?!

775
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,869
Ugh, woah! What is this stuff?!

776
00:46:17,332 --> 00:46:18,704
Huh? Woah!

777
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,920
What the heck is going on?!

778
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,900
Hope you all had a great ride!

779
00:46:36,948 --> 00:46:38,595
Please watch your step as you exit...

780
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:41,472
There must have been an accident!

781
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:42,491
Call an ambulance!

782
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:43,907
Call the police, too!

783
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:59,175
Why, why, why?!

784
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,235
Oh why, Kishida?! Why?!

785
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:03,504
Shinichi.

786
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:05,627
Ah, what a tragedy.

787
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:10,211
A truly terrible accident. No
reason for us to stick around.

788
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,428
Hold it! This was not an accident!

789
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:17,242
Not at all. It was a homicide.

790
00:47:18,524 --> 00:47:22,731
And the person who did it was
also riding on this roller coaster.

791
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,178
The perp is amongst the seven of us!

792
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,092
Really Shinichi?

793
00:47:27,413 --> 00:47:29,922
Hmph, I won't play along with all this crap!

794
00:47:30,336 --> 00:47:33,792
Excuse me, please let us through! Excuse me!

795
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:37,240
Excuse me! This way, please Inspector.

796
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,341
Oh, Kudo! And Ran, you're here too!

797
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:43,420
Oh hey there, Inspector Megure!

798
00:47:43,803 --> 00:47:44,611
Kudo?

799
00:47:44,851 --> 00:47:49,141
No way! That kid must be the famous
high school detective Shinichi Kudo!

800
00:47:49,323 --> 00:47:52,535
Yeah, the one who's solving one cold case after another!

801
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,671
Well maybe he can find the murderer!

802
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,460
Check it out, it's him! It's really him! It's Kudo!

803
00:47:58,548 --> 00:48:00,300
I wanna see just how he does it!

804
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:00,885
Hm...

805
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,566
Oh, well now...

806
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,562
Seriously?

807
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:06,399
I see.

808
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:12,682
Interesting. There are no signs of defects
or malfunctions with the roller coaster itself.

809
00:48:12,912 --> 00:48:16,568
Based on the circumstances, it's unlikely a suicide.

810
00:48:16,714 --> 00:48:17,171
Hmm...

811
00:48:17,484 --> 00:48:21,708
And that's exactly it, Inspector.
That's why it's clearly a homicide.

812
00:48:22,284 --> 00:48:25,395
Okay, but who's the perp, and how did they do it?

813
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:27,441
Inspector.

814
00:48:27,465 --> 00:48:27,897
Hm?

815
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:35,316
Hm.

816
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:40,459
We'll have to keep those who were
on the coaster around for questioning.

817
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,090
Everyone else, please clear the area while we investigate.

818
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:49,467
Please leave the area!

819
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,534
So this roller coaster is an eight-person ride.

820
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,537
Excluding you and Ran from the suspect pool for now,

821
00:48:55,562 --> 00:48:57,491
that leaves five other riders.

822
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,511
The victim's friend, Suspect
A was riding in the first row.

823
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:03,347
Likewise for Suspect B.

824
00:49:03,697 --> 00:49:07,175
The victim's girlfriend was riding
in the third row, right next to him.

825
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,140
We'll label her Suspect C for the time being.

826
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,103
The men in black that were riding behind the victim,

827
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,328
we'll label them Suspects D and E.

828
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,899
Now this is where it starts to gets tricky.

829
00:49:17,923 --> 00:49:22,049
Because of the safety bars, none of
them had any real freedom of movement.

830
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:26,540
The only one who could've kill the
victim was the person seated next to him.

831
00:49:26,608 --> 00:49:28,706
That would be his girlfriend, Suspect C.

832
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:31,519
Actually, the men behind him could've done it.

833
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:33,424
Hey, we've had enough.

834
00:49:33,814 --> 00:49:38,192
We don't have anymore time to play
along with little detective game of yours.

835
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:39,617
Uh, hey Bro...

836
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:42,817
We're really sorry. Please bear with us a little longer.

837
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,980
What's going on... What's with the icy look in his eyes?

838
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,944
He looks like he wouldn't even hesitate to kill people...

839
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,672
Wh-Who on earth is this guy?

840
00:49:57,506 --> 00:49:58,753
Inspector, sir!

841
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:01,201
Hm? Did you find something Chiba?

842
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,696
Yeah, we found something alright! A murder weapon!

843
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,408
No, lies! I haven't seen that thing before, it's not mine!

844
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:12,674
Aiko, what happened?! Why would
you do such a horrible thing?

845
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:15,924
I'm telling you! I didn't kill him!

846
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,040
And here I thought you and Kishida were hitting it off!

847
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,174
So why?!

848
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,176
Believe me! I really didn't do it!

849
00:50:24,662 --> 00:50:27,849
See there's your perp! That broad
over there's the one who did it!

850
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:31,480
So we're free to go now right, Mr. Officer?

851
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:36,358
Oh, wow, they found the perp even
faster than I expected. That's surprising.

852
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:38,762
I knew there was something weird about that lady.

853
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,932
A lover's quarrel huh?

854
00:50:40,006 --> 00:50:41,641
Pretty darn scary.

855
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:45,058
That's it, I've heard enough. Take
her in for immediate questioning.

856
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,525
Please come with me.

857
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:48,108
N-No! This can't be!

858
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,100
And just to cover all our bases,

859
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:54,131
we'll be checking the identities of everyone
else that was on the ride while we’re at it!

860
00:50:57,865 --> 00:51:00,112
Do you guys have a problem with that?

861
00:51:07,628 --> 00:51:09,511
Please wait, Inspector.

862
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:12,450
Hm? What's the matter, Kudo?

863
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,097
I'm certain that she's not the one who did it.

864
00:51:23,488 --> 00:51:25,139
Then who, Shinichi?

865
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,686
Really now?

866
00:51:27,523 --> 00:51:28,023
Hmph.

867
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:33,776
While on this roller coaster, the person
solely responsible for killing Mr. Kishida...

868
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:36,151
...is you!

869
00:51:38,168 --> 00:51:38,772
Huh?!

870
00:51:39,984 --> 00:51:42,173
What?! But how can that be?!

871
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,830
You can't be serious!

872
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:48,974
You saw the bloody knife that
was in Aiko's bag, didn't you?

873
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:53,135
You can’t expect me to believe that his
head was severed with a knife like that, can you?

874
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:55,583
Especially not with the strength of a woman.

875
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,420
And besides, if she really were responsible,

876
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:01,890
she had about a million chances
to get rid of the murder weapon.

877
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,460
There was no reason to go out of her way to
wrap it up and hide it in her bag like that.

878
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:06,863
Huh...

879
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:11,861
Which means, you had to sneak the
knife into Aiko's bag beforehand.

880
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:16,446
That way, you could easily shift the blame to
her, and no one would suspect you in the slightest.

881
00:52:16,471 --> 00:52:18,527
Where did you come up with an idea like that?!

882
00:52:18,807 --> 00:52:22,259
I was sitting in the very front!
I wasn't anywhere close to him!

883
00:52:22,608 --> 00:52:26,111
Are you crazy?! How could I have
chop his head off from over there?

884
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:28,520
Besides, you just said so yourself!

885
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:32,008
That a woman isn't strong enough
to sever a person's head like that!

886
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:35,545
Hmph, that's true. That is exactly what I just said.

887
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:36,767
However,

888
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,859
it is possible if you use the roller coaster's
speed with some piano wire or a steel ring!

889
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:49,480
Inspector, I'd like to ask for your fellow officer's
assistance in recreating the crime scene in question.

890
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,686
Well alright. That shouldn't be too much of a problem.

891
00:52:55,738 --> 00:52:56,921
Okay, everyone!

892
00:52:57,288 --> 00:53:00,299
I will be playing the role of the perp, Miss Hitomi.

893
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:04,153
And the Inspector will play the
role of the victim, Mr. Kishida.

894
00:53:04,252 --> 00:53:04,828
Mhm.

895
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:06,084
Mm...

896
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,183
Now first, before we start lowering the safety bars,

897
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:14,823
I'll take my seat and put
something like a bag behind my back.

898
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:17,674
Then, I'll lower the bar. Now before I start,

899
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:20,550
I'll take the bag out from behind me and create a gap.

900
00:53:20,685 --> 00:53:23,396
See? Now I can slip out easily.

901
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:27,203
Next, I'll pull out a murder weapon I prepared beforehand,

902
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,696
like some piano wire or a steel
ring with a hook-like attachment.

903
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:34,885
I'll climb up onto the safety
bars, and reach out behind me,

904
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,347
at which point I'll loop the victim's neck.

905
00:53:39,896 --> 00:53:42,748
Of course, this was all done in the pitch-black tunnel.

906
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,520
Then, all I'd need to do is
take the hook attached to the ring

907
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,485
and connect it onto the roller coaster's rail.

908
00:53:50,187 --> 00:53:55,580
The speed and power of the roller coaster would
then be used to chop the victim's head off at the neck.

909
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,321
Th-That's ridiculous!

910
00:54:00,393 --> 00:54:02,676
How could I do that on a moving roller coaster?!

911
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:06,464
Because, you are an experienced gymnast.

912
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,767
Perhaps others wouldn't be able to.

913
00:54:09,064 --> 00:54:11,405
But you have a great sense
of balance, and could do

914
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:14,576
something like that easily
even on a moving roller coaster!

915
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:16,429
Alright, stop! We've heard enough of your lies!

916
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:19,168
Then tell me. What happened to your necklace?

917
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:23,942
The one you had around your neck
before you got on the roller coaster.

918
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:28,200
Where exactly is your pearl necklace?

919
00:54:28,255 --> 00:54:28,963
Ah!

920
00:54:29,815 --> 00:54:33,660
You switched out the string that was
holding your necklace together for piano wire,

921
00:54:33,685 --> 00:54:37,069
and hid the hook that you would
later attach to it inside your bag.

922
00:54:38,372 --> 00:54:41,813
Hold on a second! If things
went down the way you say they did,

923
00:54:41,855 --> 00:54:46,442
wouldn't it be easier for those two scary looking guys
that were sitting right behind Kishida to pull it off?!

924
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,474
No, you’re wrong. They’re definitely not the
perps, no matter how suspicious they may appear to be.

925
00:54:52,511 --> 00:54:53,585
How do you know?!

926
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,091
I don't know why they were on the
roller coaster in the first place.

927
00:54:57,296 --> 00:55:00,793
But, it's strange how they changed
their tone the minute the police arrived,

928
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:03,302
like they wanted to get out of here as soon as possible.

929
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,603
If they were the perps, they would have
realized what would happen when the ride ended.

930
00:55:08,628 --> 00:55:09,126
Uh...

931
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,472
After all, the perp was aware of
one thing. The victim would die.

932
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:17,276
And that's why she cried on the ride.

933
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:21,908
Mmf! Huh?

934
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:23,442
Wait what? Water?

935
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:29,546
Not much time passed between the
victim's death after exiting the tunnel,

936
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,625
and when we got back to the station.

937
00:55:32,472 --> 00:55:36,935
In other words, the only person who would
shed tears while still on the ride is the perp.

938
00:55:37,253 --> 00:55:38,998
They'd be the only one who knew.

939
00:55:39,155 --> 00:55:43,409
So then what you’re trying to tell us is
that you saw Hitomi crying on the roller coaster?

940
00:55:43,434 --> 00:55:45,234
How exactly can you prove that?!

941
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,986
The trail of her tears is irrefutable proof.

942
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,392
Unless you're doing something
like riding a roller coaster,

943
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:55,712
those teardrops wouldn't streak sideways.

944
00:56:07,556 --> 00:56:08,343
It was...

945
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:13,127
It was all his fault! It's all because he dumped me!

946
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:18,226
H-Hitomi, don't tell me that
you... You were dating Kishida?!

947
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:21,580
I was! We were in love and together,

948
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,982
way before we met the rest of you interlopers in college!

949
00:56:25,084 --> 00:56:26,101
But Aiko...

950
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:28,627
To think someone like her!

951
00:56:32,384 --> 00:56:35,149
That's why... So that's why...

952
00:56:35,742 --> 00:56:38,848
Going on the roller coaster we rode on our first date,

953
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,469
using the necklace he gave me,

954
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,964
and framing it all on Aiko...

955
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:48,304
That why I killed him like this!

956
00:56:58,067 --> 00:57:02,504
Later, a large amount of sleeping pills
were found tucked away inside her bag.

957
00:57:03,367 --> 00:57:07,931
It seems as if she was planning on following
Kishida to her own death after the crime.

958
00:57:10,203 --> 00:57:14,866
Two hours later, the necklace used to
commit the crime was found inside the tunnel.

959
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,380
The string had indeed been swapped out for piano wire,

960
00:57:18,472 --> 00:57:20,276
and most of the pearls had scattered.

961
00:57:20,873 --> 00:57:25,214
The setting sun shone upon the
remaining pearls, giving them a faint glow.

962
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:29,976
As if, they were large teardrops.

963
00:57:40,554 --> 00:57:42,992
Hey come on, stop crying already!

964
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:46,045
How can you stay so calm through all this?

965
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,070
Well it's because I'm used to
seeing those kinds of crime scenes...

966
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:51,286
You know, like dismembered bodies and stuff?

967
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,258
That's horrible!

968
00:57:52,321 --> 00:57:55,402
Woah, hold on! The sooner you're
able to forget it, the better!

969
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,642
You know, this stuff happens all the time!

970
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,277
No, it really doesn't!

971
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:02,695
Uuh... Um...

972
00:58:07,479 --> 00:58:08,631
It's that guy...

973
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:11,753
One of the suspicious ones from the roller coaster.

974
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,305
You said incidents like that
don’t happen at amusement parks...

975
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,006
Sorry, Ran. Go home without me, okay?

976
00:58:19,188 --> 00:58:20,930
I'll catch up with you really soon!

977
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,114
Wait, Shinichi!

978
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:23,551
Ah!

979
00:58:26,723 --> 00:58:27,823
He's leaving.

980
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:33,140
Shinichi?

981
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:38,209
For some reason, at that moment I had a bad feeling...

982
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:43,522
A hunch that... I would never see Shinichi again.

983
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:46,089
I was certain of it...

984
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:56,370
Damn it. I lost track of him.

985
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,629
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. President.

986
00:59:03,202 --> 00:59:04,251
There he is!

987
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,826
I-I came by myself as I promised!

988
00:59:06,927 --> 00:59:09,534
Yes. I know you came alone.

989
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:13,427
Because I confirmed it while riding the roller coaster.

990
00:59:14,637 --> 00:59:16,700
Hey, just hurry with the stuff!

991
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:19,886
Hold your horses. The cash first.

992
00:59:21,803 --> 00:59:24,247
Fine then, there's no problem with that.

993
00:59:24,755 --> 00:59:27,282
No way... That's like a hundred million!

994
00:59:27,823 --> 00:59:30,088
Alright, we have a deal.

995
00:59:30,243 --> 00:59:32,217
Hurry, just give me the film!

996
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:33,161
Film?

997
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:34,914
Here you go.

998
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:40,225
Thats every last negative and print that
can prove that your company was smuggling guns.

999
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:42,865
Now just try to keep yourself out of trouble.

1000
00:59:43,258 --> 00:59:44,214
Shut up!

1001
00:59:44,535 --> 00:59:47,369
Hmph, compared to what your organization does...

1002
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,385
What we do is...

1003
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:52,303
Hey! What the hell do you think you
know about our organization anyway?

1004
00:59:52,652 --> 00:59:53,088
 Huh?

1005
00:59:53,508 --> 00:59:54,725
Gah! N-Nothing!

1006
00:59:55,308 --> 01:00:00,613
You do realize that we’re sparing your life
for the measly sum of a hundred million, don't you?

1007
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,196
Well now that you are aware, shut down
your company and get the hell out of town!

1008
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:10,068
All we want is to build a new lab on
that lot, got it? Nothing else to it.

1009
01:00:10,093 --> 01:00:10,965
R-Right!

1010
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,800
Unbelievable... Seriously?

1011
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:20,204
Ah...

1012
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,994
That's enough playing detective for you.

1013
01:00:26,772 --> 01:00:27,523
Aah!

1014
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:30,729
B-Bro!

1015
01:00:31,392 --> 01:00:34,913
Idiot. You let this brat follow you out here.

1016
01:00:35,436 --> 01:00:38,169
It's the detective... from the roller coaster!

1017
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,501
Damn it! So should we get rid of him?

1018
01:00:40,525 --> 01:00:41,608
Not this time.

1019
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,479
The cops are still all over the
place because of that murder earlier.

1020
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:49,283
Well then, what should we do?

1021
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,595
Heh. Let's see how this works.

1022
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,491
These capsules are filled with the
Organization's newly developed poison.

1023
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:01,479
They said the toxicology tests won't be able to detect it.

1024
01:01:01,802 --> 01:01:04,712
A drug that makes the perfect crime possible.

1025
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:09,393
From what I hear though, it
still hasn't been tested on humans.

1026
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:15,652
Hey bro, we better hurry.

1027
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:16,526
Yeah.

1028
01:01:18,577 --> 01:01:20,783
Farewell, detective.

1029
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,913
It feels like I'm on fire!

1030
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:51,095
It's like my bones... My bones are going to melt!

1031
01:01:54,316 --> 01:01:56,727
No..! No...

1032
01:01:57,936 --> 01:01:58,698
No...

1033
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,740
Hey, over here!

1034
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,049
There's a dead body!

1035
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:16,835
What?!

1036
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:19,696
Heh... So, I died after all.

1037
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:22,031
Wait! He's still breathing!

1038
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:24,558
An ambulance! Get an ambulance!

1039
01:02:24,685 --> 01:02:26,292
I-I'm alive?

1040
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,676
I see, looks like the drug doesn't work on humans!

1041
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,057
How lucky can I get!

1042
01:02:31,464 --> 01:02:32,512
This is terrible.

1043
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:33,869
He's bleeding from his head.

1044
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:34,915
We found a kid.

1045
01:02:34,966 --> 01:02:36,840
Oh, the police?

1046
01:02:37,173 --> 01:02:38,588
There are so many of them.

1047
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:42,808
Okay, I'll tell them all about
the evil deed that I just witnessed!

1048
01:02:42,868 --> 01:02:46,947
Hey, you'll be alright. Can you stand up there? Well, kid?

1049
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:49,235
Huh?

1050
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,579
Come on kid, are you alright?

1051
01:02:57,622 --> 01:02:59,030
Huh? "Kid?"

1052
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:02,590
Who are they calling a kid? I'm in 11th grade...

1053
01:03:03,353 --> 01:03:05,642
What happened kid? Your head's bleeding.

1054
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,796
Wounded? Ah, that's right!

1055
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:12,983
I remember... That man in black
hit me in the head from behind.

1056
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:18,764
Huh?

1057
01:03:19,584 --> 01:03:20,259
What?

1058
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:24,082
Wh-What's with these clothes?

1059
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,012
You must have been pretty scared, kid..

1060
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,890
But don't you worry your little head. We're here now.

1061
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:32,965
He lifted me up so easily.

1062
01:03:34,184 --> 01:03:38,955
Sir, we're taking custody of a boy found
below the Ferris wheel with a wound on his head.

1063
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:41,298
We're take him to the medical now.

1064
01:03:41,877 --> 01:03:47,025
Uh, he looks about six or seven,
likely still in elementary school.

1065
01:03:47,613 --> 01:03:50,839
Elementary school? What?!

1066
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:53,191
I'm home!

1067
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:55,987
Oh! So you're back, Ran.

1068
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:59,795
Aw jeez, Dad! You made another mess of the place!

1069
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,559
Now this is exactly why you never get any clients,

1070
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:04,346
and why mom Mom ran out on you!

1071
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:08,128
Shut up. I'm just picky when it comes to clients!

1072
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:11,879
By the way, where's that kid that thinks he's a detective?

1073
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,320
I thought you were gonna spend the day with him?

1074
01:04:14,345 --> 01:04:15,200
Hm...

1075
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:18,466
I'll catch up with you really soon!

1076
01:04:19,852 --> 01:04:22,182
I wonder what happened... Is he okay?

1077
01:04:22,642 --> 01:04:25,718
Aha! Trouble in paradise, huh?

1078
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:27,903
Well, just let him be!

1079
01:04:28,007 --> 01:04:31,478
Those detectives are all a
bunch of good-for-nothings anyway.

1080
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:34,187
But aren't you a detective?

1081
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:38,175
It's just like I've been telling you!

1082
01:04:38,566 --> 01:04:44,436
I swear, I know what I saw! There was a guy who was
smuggling guns, and another was there blackmailing him!

1083
01:04:44,595 --> 01:04:46,922
But then their accomplice found me!

1084
01:04:46,988 --> 01:04:48,996
And whacked me on the back of my head!

1085
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:52,319
Come on, kid. You've seen way too many cop shows.

1086
01:04:52,692 --> 01:04:56,425
I already told you, I'm not a kid! I'm in 11th grade!

1087
01:05:01,103 --> 01:05:03,797
What is this? Something's wrong...

1088
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:15,580
I checked in with park security. There's no
record of any corresponding missing child reports.

1089
01:05:15,932 --> 01:05:17,346
The way they're acting...

1090
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:19,271
Especially since he's been wounded.

1091
01:05:19,296 --> 01:05:20,770
These baggy clothes, and...

1092
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,583
and my voice..!

1093
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:28,452
Damn it, is that even possible?

1094
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,481
No. Doesn't matter how impossible it may seem.

1095
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,293
There is always only one...

1096
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:48,870
What the...

1097
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,291
Are you kidding me?!

1098
01:05:51,726 --> 01:05:53,692
Has my body really shrunk?!

1099
01:05:54,504 --> 01:05:58,039
That's why he doesn't want to go
home, and says whatever comes to mind.

1100
01:05:58,286 --> 01:06:01,201
It's looking more and more
likely that he ran away from home.

1101
01:06:01,844 --> 01:06:06,770
I guess we can contact headquarters for now, and
have the police daycare center take care of him.

1102
01:06:07,355 --> 01:06:09,550
What?! Daycare center?

1103
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,306
Alright then, kid...

1104
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:13,132
Huh? He's gone!

1105
01:06:13,523 --> 01:06:15,231
He must have run off through here!

1106
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:26,472
You've gotta be kidding me!

1107
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:29,476
No way I'm gonna let them put me in daycare!

1108
01:06:33,527 --> 01:06:35,506
Hey, kid!

1109
01:06:40,655 --> 01:06:41,489
Oh no!

1110
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:43,420
There he is! That way!

1111
01:06:44,323 --> 01:06:45,009
Damn it!

1112
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:48,353
Wait up, kid!

1113
01:06:50,943 --> 01:06:53,022
It's like I'm a criminal or something!

1114
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:08,159
Ran!

1115
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:11,782
All right! If I can get Ran to pick me up...

1116
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:12,766
Ah...

1117
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:18,217
But, with my current voice, and this body...

1118
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:19,910
Damn it!

1119
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:21,951
Ah...

1120
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,932
That's right! I can text her!

1121
01:07:26,571 --> 01:07:29,571
Wait, there's no way to explain what happened...

1122
01:07:30,866 --> 01:07:33,600
If you keep snooping around all of those cases,

1123
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,529
you're gonna wind up in real trouble.

1124
01:07:35,554 --> 01:07:35,966
Hm...

1125
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,137
Take a look over there!

1126
01:07:44,049 --> 01:07:47,400
No... Damn it! Damn it!

1127
01:08:00,822 --> 01:08:04,236
Hey, this is Kudo. I can't come to the phone right now.

1128
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:07,366
Please leave a message after
the beep and I'll call you back.

1129
01:08:10,617 --> 01:08:12,436
Oh, he's still not home yet...

1130
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:16,137
Hm? I'm sure he's just out somewhere having dinner!

1131
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,758
Probably with his famous novelist father.

1132
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,340
What? Come on Dad!

1133
01:08:20,424 --> 01:08:23,669
Shinichi's parents have been living
in the States for the past three years,

1134
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,060
and since then he's been living all by himself!

1135
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:27,983
Oh yeah? Is that right?

1136
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,038
I was right... Something did happen to him.

1137
01:08:37,632 --> 01:08:39,876
I'm going to Shinichi's house for a bit!

1138
01:08:39,971 --> 01:08:43,085
Huh? Hey! but what about my dinner?

1139
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:12,141
To think I'd be out of breath, after running so little...

1140
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:16,843
And then there's this body...
What the hell happened to me?

1141
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:18,472
Hold on.

1142
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:22,460
I remember now... Right before I was knocked out!

1143
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:30,190
Let's use this poison that the organization developed.

1144
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,585
From what I hear though, it
still hasn't been tested on humans.

1145
01:09:37,183 --> 01:09:40,153
Don't tell me... That poison I drank?

1146
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:42,649
It can't be...

1147
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:52,430
What in the world are you doing in
the middle of the road?! You damn idiot!

1148
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,867
Watch where you're going, dumb brat!

1149
01:09:59,379 --> 01:10:02,328
"Brat," huh... How pathetic.

1150
01:10:33,322 --> 01:10:34,068
Ugh!

1151
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,658
Urgh... Oh... wah!

1152
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:38,174
Ugh!

1153
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:42,438
Aw man! I can't even get into my own house now?!

1154
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:43,116
Ugh...

1155
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:46,613
And there's nothing I can do about it!

1156
01:10:47,231 --> 01:10:47,835
Hmph!

1157
01:10:48,804 --> 01:10:51,212
What? Oh no!

1158
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,073
Ugh!

1159
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,964
Ugh... Hm?

1160
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:56,758
Huh?

1161
01:10:57,331 --> 01:10:57,824
Oh?

1162
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,816
Oh! Doctor Agasa!

1163
01:11:00,059 --> 01:11:01,555
Ooh!

1164
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,505
And who might you be?

1165
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,548
It's me! Me! Shinichi!

1166
01:11:06,704 --> 01:11:09,956
Oh, how wonderful! So you're one
of Shinichi's little cousins, huh?

1167
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:13,174
As a matter of fact, you look a
lot like Shinichi when he was little.

1168
01:11:13,222 --> 01:11:15,795
Of course, that's because I am Shinichi!

1169
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,377
You know, Teitan High School, 11th grader,

1170
01:11:18,402 --> 01:11:19,654
Shinichi Kudo!

1171
01:11:21,804 --> 01:11:25,604
Hey are you home, Shinichi?
You've got yourself a guest out here!

1172
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:27,871
Argh!! You've got to be kidding me!

1173
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:29,242
Agh! Ow!

1174
01:11:29,266 --> 01:11:30,515
Oh! What's going on?

1175
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,794
You alright little guy?

1176
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,919
Well since you don't believe me, fine!

1177
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,423
I'll tell you about you!

1178
01:11:35,568 --> 01:11:35,982
Huh?

1179
01:11:36,164 --> 01:11:38,732
Hiroshi Agasa, 52 years old!

1180
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,329
You're my neighbor and an eccentric inventor.

1181
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:45,127
You call yourself a genius,
but everything you make is junk!

1182
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:45,548
Huh?!

1183
01:11:45,573 --> 01:11:48,654
You also have a hair sticking
out from a mole on your butt!

1184
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:50,258
M-My butt?!

1185
01:11:50,687 --> 01:11:53,159
That's something that only Shinichi knows about.

1186
01:11:53,653 --> 01:11:55,256
Don't tell me Shinichi's...

1187
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:57,441
telling everybody about my secret?!

1188
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:01,350
I didn't hear about it. I'm telling you, I'm Shinichi!

1189
01:12:01,536 --> 01:12:04,536
I was forced to swallow poison that shrank my body!

1190
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,340
Hm? A poison?

1191
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:07,887
Shrank your body?

1192
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:08,810
Yeah.

1193
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:12,053
A poison?

1194
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:13,891
Hmm...

1195
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:14,315
Huh?

1196
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:18,535
Hmph, if there really is a poison
like that, I'd be interested to see it!

1197
01:12:18,698 --> 01:12:22,668
Come along, suspicious brat! I'm turning
you over to the police, this instant!

1198
01:12:22,693 --> 01:12:25,098
Wait! Just give me a minute to prove it to you!

1199
01:12:25,275 --> 01:12:29,389
Look! You just got back from the
restaurant Columbo, after having dinner!

1200
01:12:29,675 --> 01:12:31,876
And, you were in a hurry to get back home!

1201
01:12:32,004 --> 01:12:33,877
Wh-wha-? How do you know that?!

1202
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:35,783
Take a good look at your clothes.

1203
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:40,415
The front of your shirt is all wet, while
the back of your coat is completely dry!

1204
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:41,058
Huh?!

1205
01:12:41,385 --> 01:12:43,474
That proves you've been out in the rain.

1206
01:12:44,095 --> 01:12:46,359
And your pants have been splattered with mud.

1207
01:12:46,477 --> 01:12:47,128
What?

1208
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:49,712
And there's only one road here that gets muddy.

1209
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:52,182
The construction zone in front of Columbo!

1210
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:55,075
You also have meat sauce on your mustache,

1211
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,520
that's the exact same color as
the meat sauce served at Columbo!

1212
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,753
Huh?! Uh...

1213
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:03,560
Wait that must mean... No way!

1214
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:08,413
Uh-uh-uh! It's elementary, my dear Agasa!

1215
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,872
Shinichi! So then it really is you! But how would that...

1216
01:13:12,952 --> 01:13:16,749
That's what I keep trying to telling
you! I was shrunken down by poison!

1217
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:20,076
Hmm... It's still not easy to believe.

1218
01:13:20,202 --> 01:13:22,333
Something like this shouldn't even be possible.

1219
01:13:22,868 --> 01:13:26,226
But you knew about the mole on my butt! Hmm...

1220
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:29,047
Can you just let me inside my house?!

1221
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:39,573
Wow, really? A gun smuggler, you don't say?

1222
01:13:39,644 --> 01:13:40,327
Yeah.

1223
01:13:40,828 --> 01:13:44,570
A couple of guys who were
trying to blackmail the smuggler.

1224
01:13:44,972 --> 01:13:48,409
So in order to shut you up,
they force fed you a poison pill?

1225
01:13:48,956 --> 01:13:50,592
Hmm... Oh!

1226
01:13:50,744 --> 01:13:55,345
Now I see! And because the poison was untested,
it must have had this strange side effect.

1227
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:57,919
That must be why it shrunk your body like it did!

1228
01:13:59,556 --> 01:14:00,778
That's about right.

1229
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:03,496
Look, since you're a genius and all...

1230
01:14:03,848 --> 01:14:07,287
Can you make an antidote that
will return my body back to normal?

1231
01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:08,906
Well, ehem...

1232
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,789
You're asking for the impossible.

1233
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,981
Without knowing the drug's
components, there's nothing I can do!

1234
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:16,594
Oh man...

1235
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:19,695
The clothes I wore as a kid fit me perfectly now.

1236
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:24,035
So all I have to do is locate their hideout,

1237
01:14:24,145 --> 01:14:25,988
and find some of that poison!

1238
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,222
Right, I might be able to make an
antidote if I had a sample... But...

1239
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:31,365
Huh?

1240
01:14:31,688 --> 01:14:36,133
Shinichi! Don't tell anybody else
about how you've been shrunk down in size!

1241
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:38,025
Huh? Why not?

1242
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:40,098
Because you're still alive!

1243
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:45,524
If the men who did this to you realize that,
they’ll stop at nothing to make sure you wind up dead!

1244
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:49,624
Not only that, but they may go
after the people close to you as well!

1245
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:50,362
Ah...

1246
01:14:51,018 --> 01:14:55,115
You got that? The fact that you are
Shinichi Kudo has to remain a secret we keep,

1247
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,020
just between you and me! You must never tell anyone else!

1248
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:01,652
I mean it! You can't even tell Ran, got it?

1249
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,059
Alright... I understand.

1250
01:15:11,344 --> 01:15:13,762
Shinichi, are you here?

1251
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:17,947
Ugh! If you’re at home, the least
you could do is answer your stupid phone!

1252
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,219
And you left the door unlocked!

1253
01:15:25,519 --> 01:15:27,152
Oh no it's Ran!

1254
01:15:27,259 --> 01:15:29,166
Not good! Hurry up go hide!

1255
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,422
Yeah, I gotta get out of here!

1256
01:15:32,255 --> 01:15:34,513
Hey are you in here? Doctor Agasa!

1257
01:15:34,908 --> 01:15:38,851
Wah! Hey there! Long time no see Ran, how are you?

1258
01:15:39,331 --> 01:15:40,841
Have you seen Shinichi?

1259
01:15:41,211 --> 01:15:44,700
Oh! Well um... He was just here a minute ago, but...

1260
01:15:44,762 --> 01:15:48,002
Uh well, he said something about, there's a case...

1261
01:15:48,036 --> 01:15:49,165
And ran off somewhere!

1262
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:51,213
Urk!

1263
01:15:51,294 --> 01:15:51,738
Huh?

1264
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:53,431
Uuh...

1265
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,260
So, who's this kid?

1266
01:15:57,308 --> 01:16:00,795
Him?! Well, he's... that young man! Well he is a... Aah!

1267
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,252
Aw, talk about shy!

1268
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,174
Hey! Let me take a look at you.

1269
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:07,158
Aah...

1270
01:16:08,739 --> 01:16:09,888
Not good...

1271
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,370
Hey this kid, he's...

1272
01:16:16,621 --> 01:16:17,400
Aha...

1273
01:16:18,995 --> 01:16:21,054
Just so darn cute!!

1274
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:23,556
Not bad... Hehe...

1275
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,327
Whew!

1276
01:16:26,004 --> 01:16:28,204
Doc, who is this kid anyway?

1277
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:28,775
Wah?

1278
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:33,434
Oh, well... He's a very distant relative of mine!

1279
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,200
So then, how old are you?

1280
01:16:35,244 --> 01:16:37,332
Uh, I'm sixteen... I mean...

1281
01:16:37,412 --> 01:16:38,898
Uh... I'm six years old!

1282
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:42,014
Oh really? So you're in first grade, huh?

1283
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:43,363
Uh... Yeah!

1284
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,536
What's your name?

1285
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:45,036
Uuh!

1286
01:16:45,395 --> 01:16:48,435
My name is uh... Well its actually, uh...

1287
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,370
Well you see, it's uh...

1288
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:51,267
Hmm?

1289
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:55,011
Well it's kinda, unusual really... It's um...

1290
01:16:56,925 --> 01:16:57,727
Uh... Conan!

1291
01:16:57,848 --> 01:16:58,203
Huh?

1292
01:16:58,787 --> 01:17:01,811
Um yep! That's my name! Conan Edogawa!

1293
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:06,849
Crap. What a slip of the tongue!

1294
01:17:07,245 --> 01:17:09,797
Conan? That's an unusual name.

1295
01:17:09,856 --> 01:17:14,661
Uh... my Dad's a big fan of Conan
Doyle... So that's where my name comes from!

1296
01:17:15,294 --> 01:17:18,546
You know you kind of remind me of Shinichi...

1297
01:17:18,832 --> 01:17:20,831
Doyle's fine, but he's still got some homework to do!

1298
01:17:20,858 --> 01:17:21,581
Hey Doc?

1299
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:25,560
Why did you go with Conan?! It's
not like you were born in England?

1300
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:29,120
I couldn't help it, okay? It was
just the first thing I thought of!

1301
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:29,565
Hm?

1302
01:17:30,049 --> 01:17:30,446
Oh!

1303
01:17:33,339 --> 01:17:35,007
Ran, I um, hate to ask,

1304
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:40,178
but could Conan stay at your place? He would be
no trouble, and he would only be there for a while.

1305
01:17:40,345 --> 01:17:41,736
You've gotta be kidding!

1306
01:17:41,777 --> 01:17:45,115
His parents are in the hospital
right now because of a car accident!

1307
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,052
So they asked me to take care of him.

1308
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:49,721
But seeing as I'm a guy living alone, I...

1309
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:54,290
Well, I don't really mind, but I'll
have to talk it over with my father first.

1310
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:55,696
Well, that's great news!

1311
01:17:55,965 --> 01:17:58,165
So you'll do it! Thanks so much!

1312
01:18:03,593 --> 01:18:05,460
Ouch!! Ow! Ah...

1313
01:18:05,761 --> 01:18:10,053
Hey! What if they're able to figure out
who I am while I'm staying over at Ran's?!

1314
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:11,254
Will you just listen?

1315
01:18:11,372 --> 01:18:16,834
The men in black will eventually realize that your
body was never found, and that you may still be alive!

1316
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:22,010
And when they do, the first people they'll
suspect is anyone seen staying at this house!

1317
01:18:22,216 --> 01:18:25,570
Okay but, what about at your house?
Don't you think it would be safe there?

1318
01:18:25,723 --> 01:18:27,778
For your body to return back to normal,

1319
01:18:28,099 --> 01:18:31,679
First you'll need to find the ones
responsible for your condition, right?

1320
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,650
Well yeah, of course...

1321
01:18:34,124 --> 01:18:36,953
Ran's home is a detective agency, remember?

1322
01:18:37,365 --> 01:18:41,594
Hey wait, you're right! If I stay
there I might find some info on the perps!

1323
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:42,983
My thoughts exactly.

1324
01:18:43,127 --> 01:18:43,467
Hm...

1325
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:45,080
Hmm...

1326
01:18:46,328 --> 01:18:47,908
Excuse me, Doc?

1327
01:18:48,175 --> 01:18:50,968
Yay! I'd rather stay over at your place!

1328
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,663
He's so cute!

1329
01:18:53,599 --> 01:18:55,506
If you only knew...

1330
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:57,145
Okay then, Doc.

1331
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:59,748
Make sure you tell Shinichi to call me when he gets back.

1332
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,830
Right, I'll be sure to let him know.

1333
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:04,335
See you later, Uncle! Bye-bye!

1334
01:19:04,359 --> 01:19:07,847
I'll see you later, uh, C-Conan! Hehe...

1335
01:19:09,928 --> 01:19:12,596
The rest is up to you to figure out, Shinichi.

1336
01:19:13,035 --> 01:19:15,995
I mean... Conan... Edogawa.

1337
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:22,741
Hey so, Conan?

1338
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:25,906
Hey Conan?

1339
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:27,745
Huh..?

1340
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,495
Oh! What is it, what did you say?

1341
01:19:32,035 --> 01:19:33,958
I gotta get used to this name.

1342
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,460
Do you have a crush on anyone?

1343
01:19:38,886 --> 01:19:39,353
Huh?

1344
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:43,119
Come on, there's gotta be
someone you like. At school maybe?

1345
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:44,848
Who me? No...

1346
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:46,529
Well I have a crush!

1347
01:19:46,763 --> 01:19:47,267
Huh?

1348
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,953
Someone I really care for!

1349
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:53,575
Hehe, I know who it is!

1350
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,904
It's that Shinichi guy you
were looking for just now, right?

1351
01:19:57,594 --> 01:19:58,198
Hmph.

1352
01:19:58,895 --> 01:19:59,454
Huh?

1353
01:20:03,594 --> 01:20:04,403
That's right!

1354
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,910
He's been a meanie since we were little.

1355
01:20:09,016 --> 01:20:12,420
He's a pretty cocky guy, and a total deduction freak

1356
01:20:12,698 --> 01:20:15,932
but when it matters, he's really reliable,

1357
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,410
and courageous, and awesome!

1358
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,993
When it comes to Shinichi, I like him a lot!

1359
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,555
Um... Promise me, you won't ever tell him this.

1360
01:20:29,643 --> 01:20:30,359
Okay...

1361
01:20:31,563 --> 01:20:34,094
You're the only person I've told this to, okay?

1362
01:20:35,411 --> 01:20:37,946
You really can't tell Shinichi what I said!

1363
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,194
I won't...

1364
01:20:41,595 --> 01:20:43,206
Well, this is my house!

1365
01:20:44,216 --> 01:20:46,551
It's like I just adopted a cute little brother.

1366
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,365
I feel like I can tell you anything!

1367
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,794
Ran...

1368
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,768
Looks like Dad's home. Let's
introduce you to him. Come on!

1369
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:57,786
Actually, Ran...

1370
01:20:57,955 --> 01:20:58,461
Huh?

1371
01:21:00,472 --> 01:21:02,265
Well, it's just that...

1372
01:21:03,403 --> 01:21:04,087
What is it?

1373
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:07,630
The thing is, I'm really...

1374
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,343
Yes! I did it!

1375
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:10,029
Huh?

1376
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:14,756
Woah-woah! Aah!

1377
01:21:14,785 --> 01:21:16,734
Ow! Uh...

1378
01:21:17,282 --> 01:21:18,809
What is going on, Dad?

1379
01:21:19,581 --> 01:21:22,835
I got one! I got one, I got one! I got a job!

1380
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,109
I got my first decent client in six months!

1381
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:29,422
Watch where you're going! Did you say you got a client?

1382
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:33,784
Yeah, a rich family's daughter was
kidnapped! Supposedly it was men in black!

1383
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,295
Men in black?!

1384
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:38,963
Finally!

1385
01:21:40,948 --> 01:21:42,482
Huh? Wait, Conan!

1386
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:50,279
You just wait, men in black.

1387
01:21:51,478 --> 01:21:55,490
I'm gonna find out where you
are and get a hold of that poison.

1388
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:58,525
And once I'm back to normal...

1389
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,309
I'll make sure everyone knows about your acts of evil!

1390
01:22:08,211 --> 01:22:12,398
And so, in order to gain information on the men in black,

1391
01:22:12,501 --> 01:22:14,411
I wound up staying at Ran's house,

1392
01:22:14,485 --> 01:22:16,671
where her father works as a detective.

1393
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,024
And it turns out, he’s not exactly great at his job...

1394
01:22:22,852 --> 01:22:25,649
I couldn't just sit idly by and watch him fail,

1395
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,740
so I used my own powers of deduction,
and Doctor Agasa's inventions,

1396
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,410
to solve one tough case after another on Pop's behalf.

1397
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:43,890
Don't tell me that Dr. Narumi...
Intended to die all along?

1398
01:22:46,364 --> 01:22:48,076
Ugh... Damn it, Narumi!

1399
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:49,491
Conan you can't do this!

1400
01:22:49,787 --> 01:22:51,398
No Ran, let me go!

1401
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,228
That music... What is it?

1402
01:22:57,267 --> 01:22:58,626
It's a type of code...

1403
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:04,260
I can't believe it... He's still playing... In the flames.

1404
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,153
You idiot.

1405
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,173
There isn't any win or lose to deduction.

1406
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:14,406
No top or bottom to it.

1407
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,498
There's always only...

1408
01:23:18,108 --> 01:23:21,256
There's always only... One truth... Heiji.

1409
01:23:23,836 --> 01:23:24,882
Uh, Heiji...

1410
01:23:24,906 --> 01:23:25,396
Huh?

1411
01:23:25,443 --> 01:23:26,546
Have you ever...

1412
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:29,775
Have you ever had to kill somebody before?

1413
01:23:30,473 --> 01:23:30,972
Huh?

1414
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,141
You idiot...

1415
01:23:33,855 --> 01:23:36,272
A detective who has a perp cornered,

1416
01:23:36,415 --> 01:23:39,259
and is willing to just let them commit suicide...

1417
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:43,263
...is no different from a murderer.

1418
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:47,507
So therefore, when you exclude all impossibilities...

1419
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:54,244
What remains, now matter how hard it
may be to believe, is the undeniable truth.

1420
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:58,320
Didn't I tell you? That was your last chance.

1421
01:23:59,288 --> 01:23:59,764
Aah!

1422
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:02,219
Ugh...

1423
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,500
No, Masami!

1424
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,876
Hurry up! Go call an ambulance!

1425
01:24:06,924 --> 01:24:08,433
And bring Pops! Go!

1426
01:24:08,469 --> 01:24:09,036
Okay!

1427
01:24:10,404 --> 01:24:12,413
It's... It's no use...

1428
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,448
It's already too late.

1429
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,047
Gotta save your energy! If you don't then you might...

1430
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:21,335
Kid...

1431
01:24:22,956 --> 01:24:26,863
You're that kid? The one at the detective agency...

1432
01:24:29,015 --> 01:24:30,343
The Organization?

1433
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:31,559
Yes...

1434
01:24:33,133 --> 01:24:35,715
A large one that's shrouded in mystery.

1435
01:24:38,838 --> 01:24:41,984
The only thing I learned, from
being at the low end of it...

1436
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:45,274
...is that the organization's color is Black.

1437
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:46,289
It's Black?

1438
01:24:47,838 --> 01:24:49,062
Yes, that's right...

1439
01:24:50,255 --> 01:24:52,940
The guys in the organization all wear...

1440
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:56,928
...clothes that are black, just like ravens.

1441
01:24:58,643 --> 01:24:59,892
It can't be...

1442
01:25:00,623 --> 01:25:01,973
The men in black.

1443
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:06,671
I'm counting on you...

1444
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:09,520
Little Detective...

1445
01:25:12,555 --> 01:25:15,647
He's gone by many nicknames over the years.

1446
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:20,000
"Lupin of the 21st Century,"
"Magician under the Moonlight."

1447
01:25:20,244 --> 01:25:25,180
However, there is one nickname in
particular that most people are familiar with.

1448
01:25:25,326 --> 01:25:26,339
A nickname?

1449
01:25:26,796 --> 01:25:30,343
A young novelist took interest in Phantom Thief 1412,

1450
01:25:30,368 --> 01:25:35,310
who lead global police forces on a wild goose
chase. He had them right where he wanted them.

1451
01:25:35,499 --> 01:25:39,306
That novelist saw the number
1412 and read it as follows...

1452
01:25:42,314 --> 01:25:44,351
K-I-D. Kid.

1453
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,691
K-I-D?!

1454
01:25:46,152 --> 01:25:47,775
Wait, but that's...!

1455
01:25:49,896 --> 01:25:53,083
That's right. Phantom Thief 1412.

1456
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:56,190
Better known as...

1457
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,019
Kid the Phantom Thief!!

1458
01:26:08,884 --> 01:26:11,769
You know kid. You're no ordinary brat.

1459
01:26:12,406 --> 01:26:15,249
Conan Edogawa. I'm a detective.

1460
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,544
Yeah. Right.

1461
01:26:24,788 --> 01:26:27,732
I'm heading over to a drama filming as we speak.

1462
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,736
It's our last day of filming so I can go in
your direction when we're all wrapped up there.

1463
01:26:33,165 --> 01:26:36,105
And all I have to do is to make
sure that Pisco doesn't mess up?

1464
01:26:36,587 --> 01:26:39,124
I was already going to head over there anyway.

1465
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:42,334
I have my reasons.

1466
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,062
I've gotta go now.

1467
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:51,136
I need to shake an FBI kitten that's on my tail.

1468
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,853
I'll see you when I get there, Gin.

1469
01:27:11,003 --> 01:27:11,619
Hm.

1470
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,444
Damn it! Move it! Get outta my way! Move!

1471
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,518
Forget it.

1472
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:30,266
But, we're so close!

1473
01:27:30,739 --> 01:27:33,835
You'll never catch up with
her. She's just the better driver.

1474
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:38,370
But don't worry. I know where she's headed.

1475
01:27:38,847 --> 01:27:40,061
What? Where to?

1476
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:43,852
To Japan.

1477
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:18,061
Huh?

1478
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,690
Conan Edogawa?

1479
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:44,368
You know, the boy with glasses that I told you about.

1480
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:47,380
You went somewhere in Beika-cho right, to someone's house?

1481
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,539
You said you had something you needed to do there.

1482
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,527
Right, Shinichi Kudo.

1483
01:29:53,715 --> 01:29:57,103
That's right. He lives at a detective agency near there!

1484
01:29:57,567 --> 01:29:59,304
So, tell me about the boy.

1485
01:29:59,537 --> 01:30:01,496
Well, he's kind of a weird kid.

1486
01:30:01,776 --> 01:30:04,555
He's surprisingly calm especially for a child.

1487
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:06,071
He's rather mature.

1488
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:09,917
I see...
