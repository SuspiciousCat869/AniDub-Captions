[man] The land of the samurai.

5
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,317
There was a time, long ago,

6
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,220
when our country was called by that name.

7
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,458

upon which the samurai once gazed

12
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,173
are now filled with ships from strange worlds.

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,477
The streets where the samurai once proudly walked

14
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,747
are now filled with swaggering, arrogant aliens.

15

- [alien] One more! Now! - [glass shattering]

17
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,886
[man] But a select few rose up to face the crisis,

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,256
one unprecedented in the Edo of old.

19
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,759
They were the samurai.

20
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,327
[ominous music]

[man] Part One: The Super Long Story So Far!

27
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,288
So, planets out there in the universe

28
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,357
have a thing called Altana,

29
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,394
a sort of energy that's like that world's life force, right?

30
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,763
On Earth, it's known as ley lines.

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,834
That energy led to the birth of the immortal fiend, Utsuro.

32
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,737
As a result of living life after life,

33
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,706
an existence of never -ending suffering,

34
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,510
Utsuro ended up with a whole bunch of personalities.

35
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,278
One of these was my teacher,

36
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,682
the founder of the Shoka Sonjuku school, Shoyo Yoshida.

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,619
With the goal of destroying the entire planet,

38
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,321
himself included, Utsuro waged war

39
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,690
against the whole dang universe.

40
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,860
Of course, the people of Edo resisted with all their might,

41
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,763
and at the end of a long, fierce battle,

42
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,467
the Odd Jobs and their allies showed some real strength,

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,436
and forced Utsuro to fall into the ley lines.

44
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,305
It was then, after using up

45
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,607
all his energy to contain the ley lines,

46
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,711
the dog deity called Sadaharu fell into a long coma.

47
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,713
Later, the members of the Odd Jobs

48
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,715
discovered their respective goals

49
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,618
and set off on their own personal paths.

50
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,424
And so, two years have gone by.

51
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,627
[dramatic music]

52
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm gonna do it! I shall become the Pirate King!

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,635
[man] Huh? No, wait.

54
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,637
Not that \"two years later.\"

55
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,974
We've done so many two and five year little time jumps.

56
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,776
It's hard to keep everything straight at this point.

57
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,345
Ah, here! This is it!

58
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,381
[clears throat] Let's see. Uh...

59
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,652
Kagura looked to find a way to return Sadaharu back to wakey -wakey town,

60
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,589
while Shinpachi, he remained in Edo.

61
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,492
Meanwhile, Gintoki, having foreseen Utsuro's return,

62
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,895
made the rounds of the gates,

63
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,897
the openings in various scattered areas

64
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,032
from which the ley lines' power erupts.

65
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,035
You see, Utsuro's genes continued to survive

66
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,371
deep underground within the ley lines.

67
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,541
And over the two years, they rebuilt his physical form,

68
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,511
and he was reborn at one of the most remote ley lines.

69
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,815
Gintoki wandered the lands with Utsuro in tow,

70
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,717
who grew very rapidly.

71
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,753
One day, it became clear that the body housed

72
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,356
a personality that could actually be Shoyo.

73
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,892
However, Utsuro was captured by the Death Star Sect,

74
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,462
led by the remnants of the Tendoshu.

75
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,864
To prevent them from gaining a perfect immortal,

76
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,333
he left his heart alone with Gintoki.

77
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,803
In order to complete Utsuro's recovery,

78
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,406
and by extension, their own immortality,

79
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,675
the Sect then sets its sights on what?

80
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,310
Earth's Altana.

81
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,014
At the ruins of the Shoka Sonjuku,

82
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,349
Gintoki is reunited with Takasugi,

83
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,952
who has used the bones of senior student Oboro,

84
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,553
to become partially immortal.

85
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,989
In order to thwart the Sect's plans,

86
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,892
Gintoki and Takasugi head for Edo.

87
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,761
[upbeat music]

88
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,431
Gintoki spots the older Shinpachi and Kagura,

89
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,632
but doesn't make contact.

90
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,704
Meanwhile, Katsura, the first Prime Minister,

91
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,674
uses his office to investigate the Sect's actions.

92
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,710
- [explosion rumbling] - In order to draw out the Sect,

93
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,845
Takasugi blows up the Terminal

94
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,947
and attempts to assassinate Katsura.

95
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,050
- [explosion rumbling] - Katsura uses the attempt

96
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,352
to relinquish his position as Prime Minister.

97
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,455
The pupils of the Shoka Sonjuku school

98
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,057
once again come together.

99
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,792
- [siren wailing] - Even the Shinsengumi,

100
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,828
who were pretending to have disbanded, regroup.

101
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,900
Also, meanwhile, the gorilla was holding a wedding ceremony. Aw!

102
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,637
And after much ado, the ship carrying Kondo

103
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,006
attacks the Sect's Mobile Cathedral, Kuyo,

104
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,042
causing the wreckage to fall on top of the Terminal.

105
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,646
Kondo reunites with the Shinsengumi.

106
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,615
However, the Sect occupies the Terminal,

107
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,652
and the city is plunged into dangerous danger.

108
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,622
Edo is once again in harm's way.

109
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,158
This is when Shinpachi, Kagura,

110
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,094
and the residents of Kabuki District,

111
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,564
gather in front of Odd Jobs and set off to battle.

[upbeat music]

To fulfill the wishes and save their teacher,

Gintoki, Takasugi, and Katsura, decide to rescue Utsuro,

115
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,677
with the Terminal as the battlefield.

Will the Z Warriors be able to reclaim the future?

00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,884
I don't know. You'll have to watch to find out.

119
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,752
Nobody is gonna pay attention

120
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,521
to a recap with those crappy visuals!

Not only was the recap way too long,

00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,000
the art style made it look like it was for a different show!

127
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,836
It looked like some damn fan -made \"Dragon Ball\" nonsense!

128
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,671
What? \"Dragon Ball\"?

129
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,540
What are you talking about, Katsurass?

130

[Katsura] It's not \"Katsurass,\" asshole! It's Katsura!

131
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,113
So the anime staff have finally gotten serious, have they?

132
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,949
Free from the shackles of TV production,

133
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,819
they've finally started putting some effort in the actual animation.

[man screams]

135

This is what the animation staff is truly capable of.

[Katsura] They're just drawing while holding

00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,528
And why do I have to be Yamcha,

139
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,496
while this meat head gets to be Vegeta?

140
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,665
That makes me look like a total freaking loser!

141
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,635
Give me a break. You are a loser.

142
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,104
[Katsura] It pains me to say it, but you're virtually identical,

143
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,773
and when did you become a master at growing a widow's peak?

144
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,476
You morons just don't get it, do you?

145
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,245
We've gone beyond the final TV episode,

146
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,848
beyond the manga's annoying cliffhangers.

147
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,683
and finally reached this point right here.

148
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,553
This is a new world, called the movie theater!

See that Shoyo, it all worked out somehow.

153
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,236
Yeah. It all did work out somehow.

154
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,638
No matter what anybody out there says.

of the cinematic exploits of Gintoki and his companions.

159
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,117
Their path ahead is sure to be rife

160
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,620
with trials and tribulations.

161
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,089
But they will no doubt be able to overcome them.

162

They will be fine, for they have the Silver Balls.

[man] Galick Gun!

[speaks indistinctly, groans]

167
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,306
Are they the type of balls that can grant wishes?

168
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,908
Or are they the tiny little balls

169
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,010
rolling around in your head you call a brain?

170
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,946
If balls that wonderful really existed,

171
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,651
none of us would be here, stuck in this position right now.

[footsteps thumping]

175
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,967
[Takasugi] But well, I guess I do feel grateful.

176
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,670
We managed to get this far,

177
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,239
and on top of that, we're still alive.

178
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,942
[doors creaking]

179

[music continues]

180
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,848
[Takasugi] With our own power,

181
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,654
and with our very own hands,

182
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,357
we will take back all we lost,

183
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,127
because that's how we,

184
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,196
the students of Shoyo, get things done.

185

Eliminate them!

202
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,899
Bring the hammer down upon those heretics

203
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,268
who would interfere with our divine summon-- [groans]

204
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,237
Divine summoning?

205
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,273
That's rich, coming from a bunch of fools

206
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,341
looking for immortality on the cheap!

207
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,943
- Catch! - [bomb beeping]

208

[ominous music]

210
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,850
Look there, their ship is down,

211
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,185
but it's still drawing Altana

212
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,387
from the Earth through the Terminal's core.

213
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,055
[Takasugi] Does that mean the Star-drain gate

214
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,156
is still operating?

215
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,427
[Gintoki] Okay, question, and with that Altana,

216
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,031
can even an incomplete god without a heart

217
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,866
be brought back to life?

218

- [bomb beeping] - [bomb explodes]

221
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,476
[Katsura] I'm more surprised that so many people

222
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,911
want to live forever in this awful world.

223
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,413
My life has put me through

224
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,448
more than enough joys and sorrows.

225
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,185
If I can overcome that last final trial with you guys,

226
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,287
then guess what fellas?

227
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,023
[man groaning]

228
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,527
I won't mind, if my life were to end right here and now!

229

[scoffs]

232
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,201
Would our meeting be one of the joys?

233
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,403
- [bomb beeping] - [bomb explodes]

234
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,838
Or is it one of the sorrows?

235
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,240
- [bomb beeping] - [bomb explodes]

236
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,542
[Takasugi] There's really no telling at this point.

237
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,814
But one thing is for sure, without a doubt.

238
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,317
[glass shattering]

239

[both screaming]

241
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,263
We hated each other and we tried to kill each other,

242
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,032
but still our ties could not be broken.

243
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,233
[ominous music]

244
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,969
I'm so sick of saving you idiots.

245
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,940
I'm sick of the runaround. I'm sick of your dumb faces.

246
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,576
I only hope this is the last life you ruin for me!

[Gintoki groans]

249
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,218
That so?

250
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,519
Got some bad news then.

251
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,289
You guys can't die just yet.

252
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,126
I will not let you die.

253
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,530
I understand how they feel.

254
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,935
I don't wanna die. I mean, I wanna keep on living.

255
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,269
[bell dinging]

[footsteps thumping]

257
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,443
Because there's this damn fool of a teacher

258
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,146
who's put me through a lot, and this other idiot

259
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,547
who just threw me like a stone,

260
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,650
and I'm not done kicking their sorry asses yet.

261
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,120
I also have a few things I'd like to say to Sensei.

262
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,656
- [soft music] - I have some things to say too.

263
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,092
How long will you need to beat him up to feel better?

264
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,162
[footsteps pattering]

[ray gun zapping]

275
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,046
[man over speaker] To those occupying the Terminal,

276
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,549
you are completely surrounded.

277
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,053
Resistance is futile.

278
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,522
Give yourselves up now!

279
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,325
If you refuse--

280
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,093
Shoot them all down!

281
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,595

[man over speaker] Uh, if you refuse,

284
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,469
let me express my gratitude.

285
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,672
It is thanks to you all

286
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,610
that our country has become so damn strong!

287

Those freaky guys.

Let's go!

291
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,002
It has been many long decades

292
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,538
since you last came to Earth, Amanto.

293
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,775
We've lived! Lived full of doubt and agony!

294
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,378
But now we can say this,

295
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,114
those days have not been in vain!

296

Amidst all that we have lost,

299
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,789
we have found which is important,

300
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,791
that which we must protect!

301
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,593
[music continues]

302
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,261
Our shadows on the ground

303
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,098
have shown us the way to the light and here to you!

304
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,304
You don't scare us, not anymore.

305
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:50,175
We are going to take you all head on! Face to ugly face!

[music continues]

310
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,792
Huh?

311
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,728
A land whose people have minds of steel.

312
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,465
And a land whose people possess souls of silver.

313
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,702
[both] We're glad you could pop by!

[Kondo] Hey Pops! Little help down here!

327
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,747
We need to split up the enemy's defenses

328
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,748
surrounding the Terminal!

329
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,485
Yeah that sounds like some tedious crap to me.

330
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,354
We'll just attack the mother -scratchin' mothership up top!

331

[Kondo over radio] Um, right now, that ship contains all the Altana

332
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,126
it has already taken from the Terminal!

333
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,295
If we launch an attack it now,

334
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,529
no telling what will happen.

335
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,431
So ix-nay on the help.

336
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,700
[man grunts]

337
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,669
[upbeat music]

338
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,373
Yo. You took you your sweet ass time.

339
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,477
You took so long, I thought you guys [grunts]

340
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,778
got scared and run away.

341
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,647
You can't have a party without the guests of honor.

342
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,183
[grunts] Know what I mean?

343
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,353
Well, well, so you finally admit

344
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,689
the Odd Jobs are better than you, huh?

345
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,258
The hell are you talking about?

346
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,227
I'm just saying, if we're gonna raise a little hell,

347
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,797
it's more fun to do it with the nastiest devils around.

348
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,799
And you guys are nasty.

349
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,302
So I guess that would mean we're out, then, huh?

350
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,405
[music continues]

351
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,409
Let's get going. Let's go see our guests of honor.

352
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,514
And raise hell one last time!

353
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,251
[ominous music]

354
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,820
[alien] This is shaping up to be a long, drawn-out battle.

355
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,389
We should fall back and regroup.

356
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,658
Even if we're able to revive Utsuro,

357
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,327
it would be for naught if we lost the Sect in the process.

358
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,364
We would lose the ability to produce the elixir

359
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,833
and thus our chance to return to power.

360
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,803
There is no need to worry. Everything is going as planned.

361
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,706
It truly does appear as though Utsuro

362
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,309
can only be fueled by the Altana of Earth.

363
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,480
Just look! Our god is truly pleased!

364
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,385
He's absorbing Altana.

365
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,719
I'm not sure I understand.

366
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,855
Is it actually reconstructing his heart?

367
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,890
Time is nigh.

368
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,625
Soon my friends,

369
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,862
our god will awaken.

370
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,964
Is it not enough by now?

371
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,699
Prolonging any further will make it

372
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,367
more difficult for us to leave.

373
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,336
Prepare to withdraw!

374
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,506
[both groaning]

375
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,545
You have no control of your bodies.

376
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,647
It happened to me as well.

377
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,786
We Tendoshu self-destructed by stealing Utsuro's blood,

378
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,790
but that very same blood also brought us back.

379
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,928
We were being kept alive, we were being used.

380
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,763
[ominous music]

381
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,966
We were controlled by his genes.

382
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,802
Taken from the very moment that we took them in.

383
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,272
[both groaning]

384
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,979
We've always been a part of Utsuro,

385
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,818
and now it falls upon us to execute his will.

386
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,325
[soft music]

387
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,580
[music continues]

388
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,430
[Takasugi] Give up the heart.

389
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,733
Such treasures do not belong in your hands.

390
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,336
They are meant to hold better things.

391
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,773
[soft music]

392
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,474
[Gintoki] Since we had the same teacher,

393
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,611
we were fated to cross swords.

394
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,651
If I could do it all over again, I...

395
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,755
I would have loved to be one of you.

396
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,593
[Takasugi] I have my own things,

397
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,597
and you have your own things to take back, yes?

398
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,601
[metal clanking]

399
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,571
Takasugi, listen I...

400
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,006
[explosion rumbles]

Let's get a move on.

409
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,807
Takasugi.

410
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,275
Yeah?

411
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,045
There's nothing left for me to take back anymore.

412
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,113
Everything is done.

413
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,919
Whatever I have lost, somehow, it has come back to me.

414
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,790
It's all right here and I'm here to make sure

415
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,959
that I don't lose any of it ever again.

416
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,734
- [explosion rumbles] - [both grunting]

- [Katsura groans] - [Gintoki] Zura!

419

Hang on, okay!

420
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,712
Now!

00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,448
[explosion rumbles]

422
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,489
- [Gintoki] You're stepping on me. - Huh?

423
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,092
[Gintoki] Now we're even.

424
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,229
You're the last person I wanna owe anything.

425
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,999
What a coincidence, I could say the sa-- [groans]

- [Gintoki growls] - It's over.

430
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,483
You people cannot defeat me.

00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,752
[music continues]

432
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,724
Did you see it, the Utsuro that lives within me?

433
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,093
[Gintoki groans]

434
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,264
Utsuro rules over and decides for all.

435
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,635
His designs are inescapable. He is our fate.

436

[Takasugi] Is that so?

439
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,779
Then what you're telling me,

440
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,049
is that the only reason I'm standing here in front of you

441
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,919
and totally not dead, is because it is the will of Utsuro?

442
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,156
I don't think so. Oh, no.

443
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,058
We weren't led here by anyone.

444
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,627
We are here of our own free will.

445

Why would you go this far?

460
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,595
Why do you want the heart of your former chief, Utsuro, so badly?

You will never be able to take us down,

will end up draining out of our bodies first.

527

Ah, Sadaharu. You've finally come back to us.

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,049
You've come back to help us and help us help Gintoki.

I'm pretty sure I just saw an arm.

573
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:15,259
Hold it! I'm happy Sadaharu's back, but he ate Gintoki!

574
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,695
I mean, did you see that? He just swallowed him whole!

575
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,364
It's understandable.

576
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,467
Sadaharu just recovered, so he needs something to eat, duh.

577
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,069
[Shinpachi] Then he didn't come to help. He just showed up 'cause he was hungry!

578
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,839
Don't you even worry about it. Gin's trash.

579
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,608
He'll probably pass right through, like the turd he is.

- [Shinpachi gasps] Gin! - [Kagura] See!

What kind of nightmare reunion is this?

Come on!

583
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,081
Squeeze him out.

Uh, sorry. I was looking for someone else.

Some freaking old dude just came out his ass!

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,298
And then went right back in!

591
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,700
[Kagura] A parasite, maybe?

592
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,735
Sad is always eating junk off the ground.

593
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,303
[Shinpachi] What kind of parasite looks like

594
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,671
it needs to pay butt rent?

595

[Sadaharu farts]

Oh yeah, that felt good.

00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,712
What the H is going on? There's more!

598
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,615
Wait! What was in there? Were you guys in a bathhouse?

599
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,151
Your skin looks great! Excuse me you guys!

600
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,853
Did you happen to see a young silver-haired fella in there?

601
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,622
So prematurely gray?

602
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,892
Oh, I take it you must mean the new fella.

603
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,162
Ah! That kid said he was taking a different exit.

604
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,432
Saying he didn't wanna be covered in a bunch of filthy filth.

605
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,700
[Shinpachi] Ew! I guess that's kind of better.

606
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,602
[Gintoki coughs]

607
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,374
- Gintoki. - [Gintoki] Remember what I said?

608
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,610
If you ever found something that you really needed

609
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,380
to with your life, I would close up shop.

610
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,349
Does the fact that you're here

611
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,120
mean that you've gone back to having absolutely nothing?

612
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,521
Not at all.

613
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,125
We're here because there's something that we need to do.

614
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,229
Gintoki, we didn't become Odd Jobs

615
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,798
because we had nothing else better to do, you know.

616
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,402
I mean, we were fine with anything.

617
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,904
Anything at all would have done.

618
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,774
As long as we could be here,

619
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,243
with you and everyone else.

620
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:17,248
[both] That's why we will be Odd Jobs forever!

621

[soft music]

622
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,518
Well, jeez.

623
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,320
In the time that I was away,

624
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,190
you two've gone and grown up so much.

625
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,392
[music continues]

626
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,829
My back really hurts, do you mind giving me a hand?

627
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,364
[both chuckle]

628
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,633
Come on, you are sounding pretty pathetic.

629
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,702
And you call yourself an Odd Job?

630
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,771
[Gintoki] Surely your list of services includes compassion.

631
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,607
Can I get an employee discount?

632
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,409
Apparently, it's not that we've grown bigger or anything,

633
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,278
but that Gin's gotten smaller.

634
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,646
Even dumber too.

635
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,315
[all laughing]

636
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,954
But, seriously, you shrunk and look pretty stupid.

637
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,956
Hey, you better watch your mouth Shinpachi,

638
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,893
Or my Shun Oguri legs are gonna kick your scrawny, puny ass.

639
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,961
Whatever! More like Short Oguri!

640
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,631
What is going on? I mean, What happened to you?

641
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,967
Maybe a little bit of me got digested inside Sadaharu?

642
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,235
Think so?

643
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,971
Did you happen see anything else come out before I did?

644
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,308
A couple of old-timers fresh from a bath!

645
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,977
[Gintoki] Hey, what do you two farts think you're doing?

646
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,713
Gintoki Sepia! Gintoki Austere!

647
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:23,948
Sepia? Austere?

648
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,584
You know, you can't just split off from me without asking.

649
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,821
Only when together are we, Ginto-three.

650
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,423
[Shinpachi] Wait, what? Ginto-three?

651
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,725
Okay, lets go! Get back in there! I need my legs back!

652
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,327
Piss off, I'm never going back

653
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,562
to being someone's appendix.

654
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,397
What kind of brainless moron

655
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,998
stuffs his damn feet into boots?

656
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,233
What is wrong with him?

657
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:43,768
Why is he starting to add to his character profile

658
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,203
in the last freaking movie?

659
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,271
- [explosion rumbles] - [gasps]

660
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,306
[Shinpachi] Oh crap!

661
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,309
- [gun firing] - Hurry up, Gin! We need to go!

662
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,011
[Shinpachi] Great, now we're back to square one again!

663
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,949
Shinpachi, focus, we need to somehow get Gintoki Sakata

664
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,017
reconstructed inside of Sadaharu!

665
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,320
- What in the hey-hey? - [growls]

666
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,556
Okay fine. Whatever happens, happens!

667
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,495
[both] Come back to us, Gintoki Sakata!

668
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,764
- [Sadaharu farts] - [glass shattering]

669

[upbeat music]

670
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,842
[man] That man had eyes too fierce to be a samurai,

671
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,814
but too focused to just be some thug.

672
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,750
Just like always.

673
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,420
[music continues]

674
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,939

00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,000
[blood dripping]

682
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,668
Uh, you okay?

683
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,371
- [banging] - [gasps]

684

[electricity crackling in distance]

685
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,512
Huh?

686
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,416
[Gintoki] Dammit!

687
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,452
I got all the way up there once,

688
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,620
and now I have to do it all over again.

689
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,888
[tires screeching]

690
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,023
[car engine revving]

691
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,158
Uhh...

692
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,794
[tires screeching]

693
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,130
[car window creaking]

694
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,732
- You kids in a hurry? - [all gasp]

695
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,035
I can give you a ride to the final boss for super cheap.

696
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,772
Oh! Look it's you, Madao.

697
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,174
Yeah. I kind of quit being a hero.

698
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,776
I'm gonna starting over from scratch again.

699
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,744
- [glass shattering] - [grunts]

700
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,680
Come on and get in, you stupid Earthlings!

701
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,417
[all shouting]

702
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,619

00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,154
[all screaming]

704
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,092
- Yeah! Get some! - [gun firing]

705
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,962
[all screaming]

706
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,832
[Shinpachi] Somebody let me in!

707
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,835
[all screaming]

708
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,947
You people could not have done it.

709
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,482
[sighs]

710
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:26,190
You finally met your teacher again. [groans]

711
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,493
How could you have put an end to him?

712
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,898
You were trying to prevent Utsuro's return, weren't you?

713
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,602
Now, at long last,

714
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,139
he will finally be able to rest.

715
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,875
[ominous music]

716
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,045
Now that I have this body,

717
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,483
which refuses to die even when rotting away,

718
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:58,155
I now understood the pain of being eternal.

719
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,627
I caught a glimpse of his deep solitude.

720
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,131
[Hitsugi sighs]

721
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,533
[electricity crackling]

722
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,036
[Hitsugi] I pray that at least in the end,

723
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,774
he may go out humanely.

724
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,643
[dramatic music]

[ominous music]

00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,598
Ah! Yes!

728
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,772
[glass shattering]

- [Kagura grunts] - [Gintoki groans]

733
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,184
Well that hurt.

734
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,886
Get your asses moving!

735
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,562
[panting]

[man groaning]

744
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,359
[Utsuro] Who brought me back to this world? Was it you?

745
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,393
[man] Utsuro.

746
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,730
I have inherited your blood.

747
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,167
Tell me, what is your desire?

748
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,905
Revenge on mankind? The destruction of the universe?

749
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:32,009
Whatever it is, I shall follow you and your commands.

750
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,845
There is only one thing that I truly I desire.

751
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,180
[squelching]

752

[electricity crackling]

753
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,160
But, well, it would seems that there is

754
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,796
something else I need to take care of first.

755
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,732
[ominous music]

756
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:55,766
[Takasugi] Sensei.

757
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,305
[soft music]

[groans]

759
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:06,944
You're Sensei,

760
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,346
are you not?

761
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,817
Please, do not look so sad, so down-trodden,

762
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:18,022
I will protect you, we will protect you

763
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,357
from anything and anyone who means you harm.

764
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,927
So please... [groans]

765
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,196
[groans]

766
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,969
Please come back with us... [coughs]

767
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:36,840
To the school. [coughs] Come back--back to Shoka Sonjuku.

768
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:43,080
I have so much to tell you, so very much to tell you.

769
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,416
And it is my sworn duty

770
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:50,120
to attend to you every need, Sensei.

771
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,122
Sensei...

772
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,858
[Utsuro] I...

773
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,862
I'm not the kind of person you should call Sensei anymore.

774
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:03,834
That time is over, I cannot go back to being Shoyo Yoshida.

775
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,769
[ominous music]

776
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:06,770
Forgive me.

777
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:12,509
You were the ones who I truly wished to protect,

778
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,512
but I could not.

779
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,982
In the end I couldn't help a single one of you.

780
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,753
Please forgive me.

781
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:29,259

[electricity crackling]

784
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,036
[Utsuro] There's no need to apologize.

785
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,238
Oh, Shoyo.

786
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,174
I knew all along that you couldn't protect anything.

787
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,044
It is beyond your capabilities.

788
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,014
How I waited for this, this moment to come,

789
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:56,053
just like you waited, oh, so long ago.

790
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,189
I just needed you to let your guard down,

791
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:04,528
while hiding away like a coward inside this pupil of yours.

792
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,931

[ominous music]

801
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,042
Two years ago, young Gintoki,

802
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,110
as you decided to reject me,

803
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,479
I believe I gave you some advice.

804
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,515
So long as you live,

805
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,184
tragedy and misery will continue.

806
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,520
I can hear his voice very clearly.

807
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,157
It says he wants to put an end,

808
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,192
[chuckles]

809
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,028
to anything and everything.

810
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,599
[Gintoki] Yeah? Well, I couldn't agree more.

811
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,568
Let's end this.

812
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,273
With our swords.

813
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,576
You still carry that little twig? [chuckles]

814
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,312
[Utsuro groans]

[Utsuro gasps]

820
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:35,512
[Gintoki] Utsuro, we may have to put several of these twigs

821
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,348
together to do it, but we will take back

822
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,050
what we lost that day.

823
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,387
That's a promise, I swear to you.

[swords clanking]

827
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,636
Your little promise was broken along time ago,

828
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:04,107
by the very man you foolishly call your friend.

829

[wind whistling]

830
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:13,216
Utsuro, no matter what number of tragedies

831
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,218
may forever fall on that man,

832
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,220
he is not the type of person

833
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,356
to ever say he wants to end things.

834
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,127
You know what he's more likely to say at times like these?

835
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,165
Oh, he knows, I will simply destroy

836
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:32,135
this rotten festering world you walk so freely upon.

837
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,771
You know a place where you don't belong.

[ominous music]

Utsuro, you are not alone. You are not the only one here.

[footsteps thumping]

845
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,461
Where is Shoyo's corpse?

846
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,098
I wanna see his lifeless body before me.

847
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,735
[Gintoki] A corpse?

848
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,571
There was never one here to begin with.

849
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:53,784
The one body lying flat on the ground was you, Utsuro.

850

[ominous music]

851
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,437
My Sensei, as much of a problem student I was,

852
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,772
it seems I had some homework left to do.

853
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,575
Go.

854
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,647
Don't worry. You have many more students.

855
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,883
Many more than just us.

856

- [Sadaharu growling] - [Shinpachi gasps]

859
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:43,366
[Utsuro] I'll leave you to them and them to you.

860
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,136
[all gasp]

861
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:50,407
[Utsuro groaning]

862
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,642
[Gintoki] You aren't some immortal demon anymore.

863
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,547
The moment you entered his body, you were done for.

864
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,919
I will put an end to you just like you wish, Utsuro.

865
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,689
And also, I'll end your pathetic sob story.

866
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,692
You think you have the ability to kill me?

867
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,661
You wanted to save him, did you not?

868
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,697
Wanted to protect him, I know you did.

869
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:16,433
I learned that fact all too well

870
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,235
during our travels to get here.

871
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,538
If you kill your master for your friends,

872
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,807
and then kill your friend for your master,

873
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,475
what will that leave you with?

874
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:27,944
Nothing.

875
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,914
You will be nothing but a hollow void.

876
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,653
Do you have what it takes to survive

877
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,289
through such dark emptiness? [grunts]

878
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,337
Utsuro, I will never be empty inside.

879

[swords clanking]

881
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,815
[Gintoki] What I wanted to protect is right here with me.

882
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,218
With me in spirit.

Humans beings are hollow,

900
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,040
but because they know that fact,

901
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,642
they take root in the hearts of others,

902
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,945
never fading, even after death has come for them,

903
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,583
and therefore, continue to live on forever.

[sword clanking]

[Takasugi] The score is now 246 to 247,

908
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:54,851
and you know what?

909
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,020
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

910
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,122
How the mighty have fallen, huh?

911
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,458
In our final duel,

912
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:05,128
I let someone else fight in my stead and lost.

913
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,932
It was your sword that finally took him down,

914
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,035
and the one who protected Shoyo and me,

915
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,537
was you, it was all you.

916
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,907
[chuckles] Nothing could feel any worse

917
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,810
than a victory given to me out of pity from you.

918
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,648
I couldn't make you, I couldn't force you

919
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,417
to cut down Sensei again.

920
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,421
Because, compared to him,

921
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,057
I was a much easier target, wasn't I?

922
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:35,825
Damn straight!

923
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,994
There's no other face in the universe

924
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,530
I enjoy punching as much as yours.

925
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,102
- [gentle music] - It was the same when we were kids.

926
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,838
We fought every time we met.

927
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,975
I figured growing up some would fix that,

928
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:56,212
but we remained competitive little brats the whole time.

929
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,749
And in your case, you didn't even manage

930
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,684
to grow out of being such a jerk.

931
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,720
[Takasugi] Eat it, you asshole.

932
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,555
[Gintoki chuckles]

933
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,893
Maybe this is just how we were fated to end up all along, my friend.

934
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,730
But hey, that's not too bad, is it?

935
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,134
Takasugi, you know what?

936
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,105
As much as we love to fight each other,

937
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,241
that's not all.

938
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,143
[music continues]

939
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,746
We're so much more than that.

940
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,585
I loved to get drunk with you just as much.

941
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,827
[music continues]

942
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,897
[chuckles] Yeah, no. That's not us.

943
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,633
Instead of wasting time on drinks,

944
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,102
I would've used it to beat your face in

945
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,637
as many times as I could.

946
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,039
[Gintoki chuckles]

[music continues]

948
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,512
But now, I guess, I'll have to give it a rest.

949
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,581
You should get going.

950
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,151
You aren't empty, you know.

951
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,553
You still have plenty to protect.

952
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,026
[music continues]

953
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,195
Takasugi.

954
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,297
[Takasugi] Gintoki,

955
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,801
this crushed left eye of mine

956
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,904
it closed forever on that day,

957
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:29,739
with the last thing it saw etched

958
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,174
into the back of its eyelid.

959
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,045
I've lived my entire life looking at your gloomy

960
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,815
pasty face and I gotta say, I'm sick of it.

961
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,819
So at least when my other eye closes,

962
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:47,123
don't go looking like a goddamn pouty pants again, all right.

963
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:48,825
[crying]

964
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,896
The cocky little kid who stood tall

965
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,764
before me when we first met.

966
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,234
The man I always wanted to best,

967
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,271
the man I spent my whole life chasing,

968
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,706
the man,

969
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,843
that prematurely gray man,

970
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,679
is so much better than that.

971
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,715
Do you hear me?

972
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,220
I... [sobs]

973
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,994
Wait for me in hell, Takasugi, my old friend.

974
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,064
You don't get to quit while you're ahead.

975
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,999
I'll beat you for sure next time.

976
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,102
Yeah, you wish.

977
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,876

[machines beeping]

Oh man! That ship sucked up way too much Altana!

982
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,074
[creaking]

983
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,448
I must say, I don't understand why you're helping me,

984
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,351
I'm the direct cause of all this pain and tragedy.

985
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,221
Whenever you see someone in need, you help them out

986
01:00:58,254 --> 01:00:59,589
and then run off with all their money.

987
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:03,459
That's what Gintoki Sakata has always taught us over the years.

988
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:07,063
And besides, I've always wanted to talk to the guy

989
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,198
who made him the person who he is today.

990
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,436
[Shoyo] I'm afraid it's the other way around.

[soft music]

992

If I had never met them,

993
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,214
I would have remained as empty as Utsuro.

994
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,820
They made... they made me human.

995
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,357
[music continues]

996
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:45,968
But, my mere existence only served to shackle them down,

997
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,370
and keep them from growing.

998
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,073
I have absolutely no right

999
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,175
to dare call myself their teacher.

1000
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:56,245
Yeah, well, even if everything you just said is true,

1001
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:00,149
it's because of you that we got to meet Gintoki Sakata.

1002
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:05,021
I've always wanted to meet you so I could tell you,

1003
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,290
thank you.

1004
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,425
Hm.

1005
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,196
[Shinpachi] I'm sure Gin and the others feel the same way as me.

1006
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,430
[radio static crackles]

1007
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,533
[Katsura] Gintoki! Takasugi! It's me.

1008
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,036
Can you hear me? Are you all right?

1009
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:25,174
Listen, we've managed to taken over Kuyo, the enemy...

1010
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,876
the enemy is in tatters, too,

1011
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,512
but the Terminal is still running out of control.

1012
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,047
It's only a matter of time before it

1013
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,849
collapses along with this ship.

1014
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:33,883
Get out of here at once!

1015
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,319
Zura! Running away won't help!

1016
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,222
Look, if the Terminal were to go down,

1017
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:42,024
all the Altana inside of it will go completely berserk.

1018
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,794
And if worse comes to worst, this entire planet could blow!

1019
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,030
Okay, but there must be something we can do.

1020
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,098
- [static crackles] - Uh--

1021
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:53,302
I ask that you allow me to handle this situation.

1022
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,205
Who the hell are you? [gasps]

1023
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,208
I'll use the weapons on-board this ship.

1024
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,178
I will fire all of the Altana and it's mine

1025
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,080
back down via the Terminal.

1026
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:08,084
And I'll do so by using the Altana within me.

1027
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:12,054
But, even if that manages to quell its rage,

1028
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:14,157
the Terminal will not be left standing.

1029
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,559
My school's biggest prodigy,

1030
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,029
can I ask you to handle the evacuations?

1031
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,299
I have complete confidence in you.

1032
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,102
I want you all to live on to the next adventure.

1033
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,436
[static crackles]

1034
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,208
All hands should evacuate!

1035
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:35,011
We need to get out of the Terminal as soon as we can!

1036
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,547
[man] Zura! Feel free to use our ships!

1037
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,316
Well, there you have it.

1038
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,617
You should probably hurry up

1039
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,320
and begin your escape as well. [groans]

1040
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,588
Shoyo, are you okay?

1041
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,624
It's ironic, isn't it?

1042
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,562
I've been full of hate for all my eternal life,

1043
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,964
but now time is not on my side.

1044
01:03:56,365 --> 01:04:00,970
That boy...that boy granted me what little life I have left.

1045
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,306
A path has been paved to the future.

1046
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:06,008
[energy whooshing]

1047
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:10,112
You are that future, and it's my job to protect you.

1048
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,019
[rumbling]

1049
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,996
[door shuts]

1050
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,969
I must last, every second counts.

1051
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,371
[Shinpachi] Mere seconds won't be enough.

1052
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,275
If we were to add up all our lives,

1053
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:40,209
we could buy you enough time

1054
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:42,511
to see your stupid student's stupid face.

1055
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,679
[Sadaharu barks]

1056
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,147
You kids...

1057
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,583
We're very sorry, but we can't just...

1058
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,152
We really can't just leave, you know.

1059
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,021
Remember what I said?

1060
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,156
Our job isn't over until we leave

1061
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,192
with all your money, or something like that.

1062
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,028
[Shinpachi] If the future's within our reach,

1063
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,330
then we'll grab it and take off.

1064
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,934
That is the Odd Jobs way.

1065
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,470
Why don't you let us join you, then.

1066
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,140
This faction, they'd been collecting Altana

1067
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,175
from several planets across the galaxy

1068
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,044
to mass-produce their elixirs.

1069
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,380
If we fire it all in, then you'll

1070
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,315
not only have time to see him,

1071
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:22,385
but also smack your stupid student on his stupid head.

1072
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,587
And how exactly would you fire it all in?

1073
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,323
Just so you know, I can't operate anything

1074
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:28,591
other than my ancient flip-phone.

1075
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:31,727
What the matter? Is modern tech too much for you to handle?

1076
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,596
Asked the with the robot body guy.

1077
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,098
It's a good thing I'm a cellphone expert.

1078
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,169
Machines are much the same as people.

1079
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,639
When they refuse to listen to you, you kick their ass!

[electricity crackling]

1081
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:51,414
[man] Hey, take it easy, you cuckoo crazies!

1082
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,482
All this violence won't just get you blocked,

1083
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,419
it'll make even Siri snap and start cussing our asses out!

1084
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,120
Oh, that's okay.

1085
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,056
All our feelings combined are powerful.

1086
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,658
Even without a cellphone, they're sure to get through!

Back on your feet. We got places to be!

[radio static crackles]

1098
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,703
[Katsura] Gintoki, keep going,

1099
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,440
[indistinct] and the rest of the Odd Jobs should be down that way.

1100
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:53,542
If there's anything you've left undone,

1101
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,144
take care of it at once.

1102
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,681
[Gintoki] Oh! Mister Shoka Sonjuku's biggest prodigy.

1103
01:06:58,714 --> 01:06:59,815
So good of you to call.

1104
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,718
Weren't you tasked with getting everyone to safety?

1105
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,687
[Katsura] Everyone has already evacuated.

1106
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,556
Well, that is, except for, you losers.

1107
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,594
Zura, Takasugi is...

1108
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:15,331
[Katsura] What happened? Sensei was unaware.

[upbeat music]

1110
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,435
That back then, whenever you two

1111
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,370
got yourselves into some mischief,

1112
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,607
there was another little troublemaker out there,

1113
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,209
and he was cleaning up all your messes for you.

1114

[thuds]

1115

Isn't that right, Gintoki?

1116
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,153
So I'll tell you what, if you two are up for one last act of mischief,

1117
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,355
there is no way I can leave this place,

1118
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,723
not until I've had the chance to

1119
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,159
clean up your messiness all over again.

1120

Zura.

1121

[Katsura] Live or die, the two of us are in this together, right?

1122
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,199
[Sakamoto] Then I would say you have to make sure

1123
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,468
you come back alive, eh, Gintoki?

1124
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,371
So just relax! I'll rescue you.

1125
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,274
I'll save you from the depths of hell if I have to.

01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:03,766
[electricity crackling]

1156
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:10,506
[glass shattering]

1157
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,810
[music continues]

1158
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:27,890
[Shoyo] Gintoki,

1159
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,895
the people here must be to you what you once were to me.

1160
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,767
Just as long ago on that fateful day,

1161
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,036
the eternal beast became human

1162
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,939
by meeting you, meeting all you kids.

1163
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,778
The little monster, the one with the saddened eyes

1164
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:53,749
he changed too, he has also become human,

1165
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:55,684
has he not?

1166
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,821
[music continues]

1167
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:19,074
[ominous music]

1168
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,550
[machine beeping]

1169
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,886
[woman] Data transfer is now complete.

1170
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:42,498
Good morning, it's good to see you Fuyo Number Zero.

1171
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,067
- Where am I? - [machine whirring]

1172
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,803
This would be Master Gengai's robot warehouse.

1173
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,839
You suffered damaged during the war

1174
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,741
and then you fell into a lengthy coma.

1175
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,979
I am your clone, and during the time while you've been asleep,

1176
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,847
I have been collecting all the data for you.

1177
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,349
I am Tamako.

1178
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,484
[Tama] I'm very sorry.

1179
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,755
It seems my circuitry is still acting a bit glitchy at the moment.

1180
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,694
How long did...how long was I asleep?

1181
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,736
- [whooshing] - [bright music]

1182
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,642
[vehicle engines revving]

1183
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,410
[Tama] Is this really Edo?

1184
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,846
[Tamako] No, now it is called Tokyo.

1185
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,149
In the years following the war, Edo was reborn

1186
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,919
and entered into a period of long sustained development.

1187
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,888
But Tokyo would be nothing like it is today

1188
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,524
without all of the efforts you and your friends put in.

1189
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:46,795
Okay, so then I assume the world has returned to peace.

1190
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:49,398
[music continues]

1191
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:53,936
Although, it no longer resembles the world I once knew,

1192
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,405
the place I once lived.

1193
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:03,912
What became of everyone after the war?

1194
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,482
[Tamako] I believe you already know the answer to that.

1195
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,551
Oh!

1196
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:13,055
[machine beeping]

1197
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,424
[whooshing]

1198
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:21,830
[Shinpachi] Tama.

1199
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,499
Tama!

1200
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,434
Shinpachi!

1201
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:29,805
[Shinpachi] By the time you finally wake up, and obtain this data,

1202
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,841
who knows how much time will have passed?

1203
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:35,978
[soft music]

1204
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:42,951
Just what was it we fought against? What did we defeat?

1205
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,721
Or were we the ones who were defeated?

1206
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,557
There's still no clear answer to that,

1207
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,527
but we did make it back, back to Edo,

1208
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,862
and back to our lives.

1209
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,698
[electricity whooshing]

1210
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,200
[music continues]

1211
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,869
But when I saw Gin's slightly sad smile,

1212
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,906
I started to fully realize

1213
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,108
the significance of the things we'd regained

1214
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,978
and also, the things we'd lost.

1215
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,619
[music continues]

1216
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,157
[Shinpachi sighs]

1217
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:26,128
There really was no way he'd be back here, huh?

1218
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,730
- [squelching] - [Gintoki snoring]

1219
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,132
[Shinpachi screams]

1220
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,267
How long have you been sleeping in here?

1221
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,002
Ah! I stepped in your puke! [grunts]

1222
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,104
I've been worried sick about you,

1223
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,006
and you are just out getting sauced again.

1224
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,944
Oh! O, quit your nagging! This is my own place.

1225
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,745
Free to come home whenever I want

1226
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,881
and puke wherever I want. [retches]

1227
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:48,083
No! Don't puke in here anymore!

1228
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,118
[retches] Now I puked.

1229
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,120
Whoa! Whoa! What do you think you're doing?

1230
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,156
What makes you think you can sit on my seat?

1231
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,557
What are you talking about?

1232
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:56,992
I've been taking care of things and keeping

1233
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,228
Odd Jobs going while you butt-wads were gone!

1234
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,029
And now, you're starting over as a lackey!

1235
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:01,997
This was your idea, you know!

1236
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,099
[Gintoki] I never said any crap like that.

1237
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,269
You were the one who said you'd start over as a glasses frames or some shit.

1238
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,537
[Shinpachi] I did not say that!

1239
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,706
I think you need to start over from your dad's pair!

1240
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,775
Your face could start over from your dad's pair.

1241
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,644
You are not even making any freaking sense!

1242
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:16,979
Now go sleep in your bed!

1243
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,915
- [both screaming] - You can't just waltz into a lady's room!

1244
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,184
How many times do I need to tell you losers?

1245
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,752
Since I was the second to came back,

1246
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:26,054
I am the COO, and this is my room now!

1247
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:30,092
You're the COO, huh? You blew away the CEO too, you know.

1248
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:33,128
CEOs everywhere are just figureheads.

1249
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,197
All lazy, good-for- nothing leeches.

1250
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,199
The real power rests in the hands of strong women,

1251
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,601
like me and Beyoncé, no matter where we go

1252
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,904
we can't help but get stuff done, too bad.

1253
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,273
[Shinpachi] Beyoncé and you are very different kinds of strong,

1254
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,941
and she was never COO!

1255
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:47,643
[Kagura] Put that worthless heap of trash

1256
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,810
in the closet where he belongs.

1257
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,212
- [door bangs] - [munches]

1258
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:53,115
[Shinpachi] Beyoncé Muscles -Carter, the closet was a no-go too.

1259
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:55,817
Oh, damn it! Will you two get it together!

1260
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,686
Where the hell do I belong in this place?

1261
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,222
Maybe, I'll just have to go ahead and mark all my spots.

1262
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:01,590
[Kagura] No I don't think so!

1263
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,328
[Shinpachi] But still, in the end, we remain the same as always.

1264
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,297
It must be because the four of us

1265
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,998
are finally back together again.

1266
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,367
[electricity whooshing]

1267
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,770
[soft music]

1268
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,605
Oh, good grief.

1269
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,874
I was hoping you'd have made a bunch of money

1270
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:23,178
to pay off your rent, but it looks like over two years passed by

1271
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,247
while you were just sitting around picking your nose.

1272
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,882
Oh, with a matter this critical

1273
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,817
we should let the new CEO handle it.

1274
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,352
Could you not force me into the role

1275
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,054
whenever things go south?

1276
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,822
You can leave it to me, your leader.

1277
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,023
I'll handle the right nostril,

1278
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:38,126
and Gin can take the left one, Shinpachi can do the rest.

1279
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,629
We need to do more that just picking out boogers.

1280
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:43,131
And here I thought Shinpachi and Kagura

1281
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:46,668
had actually grown in some capacity, but here you are,

1282
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,104
and dear God, its right back to square one.

1283
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:50,138
[groans]

1284
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:51,473
Well, you know what they say,

1285
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:55,010
one bad apple can spoil the whole barrel of monkeys.

1286
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,279
I'd rather be one of those sweet canned apples

1287
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,147
than a wormy one in a monkey barrel.

1288
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,416
If you're locked up in the can, you can go bad

1289
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,285
and it won't affect the whole bunch.

1290
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,754
Can we please stop assuming I'm a bad apple?

1291
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,089
[laughs]

1292
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,725
[Shinpachi] Everyone was quick to bust our balls,

1293
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,427
but nobody asked any questions about why we came back here.

1294
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,296
[electricity whooshing]

1295
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,198
[Umibozu] Because the answer was obvious.

1296
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,934
Allow me to ask you a question in return.

1297
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,169
Why would I ever travel across

1298
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,205
the vastness of space to come see you?

1299
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:24,840
Probably because you're bald.

1300
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:26,141
I'm trying to be serious here!

1301
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:29,411
I'm sorry, maybe because... Because you're bald?

1302
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,079
Okay, okay, that's quite enough.

1303
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,782
There is no particular reason.

1304
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:37,019
One doesn't need a reason to see their family, do they?

1305
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,155
And this is the same.

1306
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,923
If you would like to remain here

1307
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,126
and be a part of Odd Jobs again,

1308
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,695
you don't need to have a reason for that either.

1309
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:49,197
But it is also why that walking

1310
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,199
disaster of a brother of yours,

1311
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:54,436
might show up as well without reason.

1312
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,172
[Shinpachi] Kagura said Umibozu looked a little sad

1313
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:01,209
and he left with those words, and he also looked bald.

1314
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,211
[electricty whooshing]

1315
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,313
Well, whatever, I won't pitch a tizzy

1316
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,482
as long as you still manage to pay your rent.

1317
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:11,153
They say we've entered a new era and everything.

1318
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,121
Surely, there'll be some sort of good news

1319
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,189
to kick it off, right?

1320
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:15,991
[Soyo] Have a look at this, everyone.

1321
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,326
Can you believe how well the rebuild

1322
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,095
of the Terminal is going?

1323
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:22,931
No matter how many obstacles we find in our way,

1324
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,801
as long as we never give up, we should be able

1325
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:29,204
to get back up and continue as many times as it takes.

1326
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,372
So please, everyone--

1327
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,374
Princess Soyo, I hate to interrupt,

1328
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,543
but we're all here to ask you about the assassination

1329
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:36,978
of former Prime Minister, Donald Zuramp.

1330
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,847
Rumors say that you are the one who actually

1331
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,049
masterminded the whole thing, is it true?

1332
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,251
[upbeat music]

1333
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,256
[Nobume] If you believe the princess to be the kind of person

1334
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,425
to kill anyone who gets in her way,

1335
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,995
I have to assume you all stand here

1336
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,131
before her, ready to die yourselves?

1337
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,399
Nobume, please.

1338
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:58,600
It's an assassin!

1339
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,036
So then that means all the rumors were true!

1340
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,038
Oh, man.

1341
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,508
[Shinpachi] The only reason Edo was able to get back on its feet

1342
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,443
was thanks to these girls.

1343
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:11,179
Actually, I'm sure they had on their side

1344
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:12,848
the spirits of three great men,

1345
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:15,016
and, well, maybe one more.

1346
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,384
[ObaZ laughs]

1347
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,154
You pathetic, petulant peons.

1348
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:23,458
These little puny girls could never do in the great Zuramp!

1349
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,028
That man continues to watch over this nation

1350
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:28,864
as a heroic spirit!

1351
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:31,933
Never forget, if you stray from the right path,

1352
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:34,903
I shall return to punish the crap out of you!

1353
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:39,074
I am the Heroic Patriot ObaZ!

1354
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,310
And so, every year, [indistinct] Katsura died.

1355
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:43,578
Hey, don't take over the narration

1356
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,980
and start killing people off!

1357
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,449
I mean, we don't even know if that's really Katsura!

1358
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,317
Even though it obviously is.

1359
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:51,052
That idiot's already brain-dead.

1360
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:52,587
Why don't you lets the numbskull go?

1361
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,456
Oh, and this whole narration thing

1362
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:55,657
you've been doing, when's it gonna end?

1363
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,560
Wait a minute, you mean you guys could hear all that stuff?

1364
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:01,396
I just wanted to make something to inform Tama

1365
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,597
about everything that happened.

1366
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,332
Are you trying to forcefully wrap up

1367
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,868
this whole damn story with a sappy narration?

1368
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,603
It's too long, who cares?

1369
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,605
You're gonna need to keep things more concise.

1370
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,474
[ominous music]

1371
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:16,111
[Gintoki] Now, Tama, a lot has happened since then,

1372
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:18,380
but I just want you to know this...

1373
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,650
- [bell dinging] - ...everybody died, the end.

1374
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:22,851
[Shinpachi] You cannot just say that!

1375
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:26,221
What's the problem? Everyone out there dies eventually.

1376
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:28,924
It's just lazy! Tama will want more details.

1377
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:30,559
Character arcs and plot development.

1378
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,227
Shinpachi's right, you know.

1379
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,363
So much has happened while she wasn't around,

1380
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:37,232
and all the emotions we felt.

1381
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,467
I want her to know everything we went through.

1382
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,002
[soft music]

1383
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,638
The egg rolls were super yummy.

1384
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,141
[Shinpachi] Nobody gives a solitary shit about that!

1385
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,243
- [both laughing] - [ObaZ] I hope you saw all that.

1386
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,277
[both] Huh?

1387
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:51,780
[ObaZ] Without proper supervision, people will even stoop

1388
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,148
- to falsifying endings. - Who is that?

1389
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:55,817
- Well, it's not me! - [ObaZ] Society needs watchful eyes

1390
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,987
that can monitor people and nations across eras.

1391
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:00,589
And the only one capable of that

1392
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:04,593
is the Heroic Spirit ObaZ, and ObaZ alone!

1393
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,061
- [Kagura grunts] - [utensils clanking]

1394
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,299
We do our best to ignore him,

1395
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,368
and he still finds a way to sneak in.

1396
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,704
Either way, that takes care of at least one problem.

1397
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:16,838
'Kay, so, who's next?

1398
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,908
Quit trying to force an ending where everybody dies!

1399
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:23,278
And that was be the last time he played the straight man.

1400
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,447
- [Shinpachi] I'm not dead! - [electricity whooshing]

1401
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,251
[Shinpachi] Don't worry folks, I'm not handing over the narration. Okay.

1402
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:31,553
The Zuramp Administration handed things over

1403
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:34,022
to the next generation, and with that,

1404
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:36,091
the Shinsengumi returned to power.

1405
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:40,161
I'd like to say welcome back,

1406
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:44,699
but what you've returned to is a war-zone.

1407
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,067
[tense music]

1408
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,136
If you are prepared to die,

1409
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:53,208
then drink my friends, and puke!

1410
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,676
[all cheering]

1411
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,011
[glasses clanking]

1412
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,345
[laughter]

1413
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:58,914
[soft music]

1414
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,216
[Kondo] There are no breaks in their war.

1415
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:05,053
A life like that can be overwhelming at times,

1416
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:07,956
but they'll be fine, because they have her.

1417
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,592
The woman who once rebuffed all the moves

1418
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:14,162
Kondo tried on her, now supports him wholly,

1419
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:17,032
in both his professional and personal life.

1420
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,601
I'm a little saddened by that,

1421
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:21,970
but I'll accept it for Sis's happiness.

1422
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:26,074
And perhaps, I've grown from weak little boy to grown ass man.

1423
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,309
[Shinpachi screams]

1424
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,544
Have a taste of the straight man's return!

1425
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:33,315
Are you the a-hole who's been bullshiting the narration?

1426
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:35,483
[Kondo] The question concealed my own pain,

1427
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,386
because in was not a man, but still puny and sad.

1428
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:40,755
You can stop it, I'm standing right here.

1429
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,058
And that goes for you too, Sis!

1430
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,360
Why are you going along with all this nonsense?

1431
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:48,096
Huh? I did nothing of the sort Shinpachi.

1432
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,597
I was just checking in.

1433
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:52,667
[soft music]

1434
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:57,539
[Otae] Yo, Gorilla.

1435
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,642
Didn't I say you'd have to pay triple the price

1436
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,510
if you were ever to show your face here again?

1437
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:05,280
[Shinpachi] You were saying all kinds of crazy stuff during the narration!

1438
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,083
Yes, my very wallet...

1439
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:11,753
No, the government's coffers, they belong to you now.

1440
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:14,689
Take this, it's a B's concert ticket.

1441
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,727
Well, Gorilla, you're a naughty one, aren't you?

1442
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,295
Not as naughty as you are sweet.

1443
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:22,530
[Shinpachi] This footage has become evidence of official corruption!

1444
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,133
You use narration to hide it, huh?

1445
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,802
Oh, come one. You ate up all that screen time.

1446
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:28,970
And the punch-line was just that

1447
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,539
you're still a bunch of idiots? You need to fix this.

1448
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,709
Yes, well, no news is good news, right?

1449
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,680
I don't need a fake narration or a spin-off series,

1450
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,715
just as long as I have this.

1451
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,684
[Gintoki] Oh, you're wrapping things up?

1452
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:44,352
Okay, you get one minute.

1453
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,155
[ominous music]

1454
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:50,458
[Sogo] Things went back to how they used to be. Alas!

1455
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:53,528
That only signaled the start of a new battle

1456
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:54,829
for the Shinsengumi.

1457
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,564
[music continues]

1458
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:59,401
Forget the ending, we're getting a new damn preview!

1459
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:02,570
[Sogo] What is the Shinsengumi's new battle? You ask.

1460
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:03,872
Who is their new foe?

1461
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:06,341
[Gintoki] He's not new at all! We saw him earlier!

1462
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,676
[Sogo] What is the Shinsengumi's new weapon?

1463
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,412
[Gintoki] Hey, what happened to blandy?

1464
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:16,151
It ain't easy being Vice Chief, is it my old friend?

1465
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,721
But I'll keep the Shinsengumi going,

1466
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,623
just like you would have have done yourself.

1467
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:24,592
- Hijikata. - What?

1468
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,828
Now, you're falsifying narration too?

1469
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,864
Why are you hairy rat farts drinking instead of working?

1470
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,467
To atone for your lack of discipline you must kill yourself!

1471
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,703
Hijikata, its all over after this movie.

1472
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,173
We won't get paid for any extra work.

1473
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:39,507
I mean, just look at Yamazaki.

1474
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,444
He's playing mechabaddi with the Mechazakis.

1475
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,746
[Hijikata] Yeah, look, I don't know what mechabaddi is,

1476
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:47,215
or even Mechazakis for that matter!

1477
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,383
[Gintoki] Vice Chief, Vice Chief!

1478
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:50,385
Look, we totally understand that none of you guys

1479
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,487
have any idea how to wrap any of this up.

1480
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,456
- So here, just take this. - [Yamazaki] Mechabaddi down.

1481
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:55,490
Now pose.

1482
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,560
Ooh, nice! That's the stuff.

1483
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,261
[sighs]

1484
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:02,530
[Kagura sighs]

1485
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,334
Don't just walk away from me!

1486
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,503
Why the hell did you make me dress up in this thing?

1487
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:10,872
[both] I mean, the Shinsengumi have always been a little--

1488
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:14,409
You know what? You two are stupid! Stupid faces!

1489
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:15,777
You need to calm down.

1490
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,712
Don't be so on edge, Hijikata.

1491
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,581
This is the end, just take it easy.

1492
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,749
There is no end to the duty of the police, okay!

1493
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,418
- [Kyubei] Is that so? - [ominous music]

1494
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,487
Then it must be the police's job to shout

1495
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,655
and cause a scene at a private establishment?

1496
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,958
In that case I shall also do my job.

1497
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:34,729
Well, Kyubei, go on then. What's your job?

1498
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:36,464
Why don't you show me? Huh?

1499
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,534
Care for some fruit. Say, aah!

1500
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:40,802
Aah!

1501
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:42,804
So, you're a cabaret girl?

1502
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:45,273
When I invited her to come visit with everyone,

1503
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,941
she insisted on helping out.

1504
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,643
I came up with a way where I could

1505
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,678
serve men without approaching them.

1506
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,747
With this skill I can be ranked number one.

1507
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,415
[Gintoki] Why do you make a girl who measures

1508
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,584
personal space with her sword serve patrons?

1509
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,686
It's a sales tactic.

1510
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,289
In Yoshiwara, they often play hard-to-get,

1511
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:03,424
making the customers more obsessed with them!

1512
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,859
Huh! So predictable.

1513
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,299
That's is. Cleanup's complete.

1514
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,735
[Gintoki] Forget hard-to-get, this is down right dangerous.

1515
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,905
Gin, you can't...

1516
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:20,241
[Gintoki] What in the name of all that is holy is she doing?

1517
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:23,378
What's up? I came here to hang out like you asked me to

1518
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,413
but I'm not really seeing any uggos here.

1519
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:26,548
[utensils clanking]

1520
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:27,882
[Gintoki] Your order is served sir.

1521
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:30,585
Tsuki! Kyubei! Hi.

1522
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:31,819
Kagura.

1523
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,821
- I hope you've been well. - Mm-hm.

1524
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:35,957
I didn't know you guys were here.

1525
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,959
Yes. All of us.

1526
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,361
[laughter]

1527
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,431
Oh, now they all decide to show up.

1528
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:47,435
They just wanna be in the spotlight of the big finale.

1529
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:48,970
But now, we can wrap up

1530
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:51,639
- all their stories in the narration. - [shouting]

1531
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,008
What do we say about this, exactly?

1532
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,244
That everybody got black-out drunk together?

1533
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:57,979
[Otae chuckles]That doesn't sound too bad.

1534
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:00,682
It suits us perfectly, does it not?

1535
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,483
[gentle music]

1536
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,586
[Shinapchi] Yeah, same as always.

1537
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:08,389
That might just be the perfect description for all of us.

1538
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:11,392
Come on, keep it together, okay.

1539
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:15,363
Whatever man, I'm in perfect control over here.

1540
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,632
Want me to list all of the Dragon Ball's

1541
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,968
adversaries to prove it, I can do it!

1542
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,469
[Shinpachi] Just by saying that, you've only proven

1543
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:22,670
that you're wasted!

1544
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,540
- [Gintoki] There's, uh-- - [Shinpachi] No! No! No! [thuds]

1545
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,810
[man] Hey, lady, I'll take 10 more of these please.

1546
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:31,779
Come on, now, would you just give it a rest?

1547
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,047
We don't have any money,

1548
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,516
we don't have any backers to pay for all this.

1549
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,419
[man] What? Food on the Earth is so freaking good.

1550
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,990
Besides, they say you shouldn't fight on an empty stomach.

1551
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:47,395
Fight, huh? Yeah, we can't afford to do that either.

1552
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:51,299
[man] Then I'll look forward to when we can. There you go lady.

1553
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,070
Next time I'll come here to feast on the Earth itself.

1554
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,506
[man 2] Those are some tall words

1555
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:00,441
you're spoutin' there, big britches.

1556
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,677
[man] Gotta dream big, money or no money.

1557
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:04,979
[man 2 chuckles] Don't be a nincompoop.

1558
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:10,551
Oh! Good job noticing us! [laughs]

1559
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:16,591
- [gun firing] - [ObaZ screams]

1560
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:20,728
[soft music]

1561
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:23,097
[paper rustling]

1562
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:25,566
[Sakamoto] We haven't talked in a while.

1563
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,568
Hope this letter finds you well.

1564
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:30,338
How have you been, Peen-toki?

1565
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:34,676
Yeah, I've been flying across the universe as always.

1566
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:38,112
You know, space is pretty bitchin', my friend.

1567
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,883
You should join me on a trip sometime, Vagin-toki.

1568
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,886
Anyway, the reason I'm writing you

1569
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,721
is because I have something

1570
01:28:46,754 --> 01:28:48,122
important I'd like to say.

1571
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:52,727
That day, when I promised a brave and heroic

1572
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,863
rescue of you and everyone else, well,

1573
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:57,632
once I saw the Terminal crumble down,

1574
01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:01,803
I was thinking, \"They dead, lololol.\" [chuckles]

1575
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:04,138
[soft music]

1576
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:09,177
I don't mean this to sound as

1577
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,813
some sort of consolation or anything,

1578
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:14,749
Because I truly believe, deep in my heart of hearts

1579
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:18,119
that he saved you back then, so please,

1580
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:20,822
you don't need to beat yourself up over it.

1581
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,725
Your teacher's soul lives on everywhere on Earth,

1582
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:27,161
and he continues to watch over you, I'm sure of that.

1583
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,063
And I know you can feel it too.

1584
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:34,836
To my beloved friend, Peen-vaginto-fuk-u.

1585
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:38,573
PS, I heard something when I ran into Zura the other day.

1586
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:41,075
It would seem the remnants of the Kiheitai

1587
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:42,910
are making some curious moves.

1588
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:45,947
[Katsura] The gates?

1589
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,782
Indeed.

1590
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:49,417
[Katsura] Who do you think you're mimicking?

1591
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:52,553
She probably couldn't stand the fact

1592
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:54,655
that she was so powerless.

1593
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,624
[soft music]

1594
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,092
But she was thankful

1595
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,062
that after he was a prisoner for so long,

1596
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,431
she could see him smile, once again.

1597
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:05,700
[music continues]

1598
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:10,772
And she says that now it's her turn.

1599
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:14,876
[Katsura] Well, there is no chance of him

1600
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,978
coming back to life like Utsuro did.

1601
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:19,814
That was a miracle which only occurred

1602
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,682
because he was born from Altana.

1603
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:26,587
[groans] That's how it is and it's fine.

1604
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:30,091
This is simply how we, the Kiheitai,

1605
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:31,959
atone for the sins we've committed.

1606
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:38,833
Takechi, you too. You're also abandoning me.

1607
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,238
[paper rustling]

1608
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:52,947
[Sakamoto] In the end, here's what I believe.

1609
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:57,118
Miracles are not real. Sorry, they're just not.

1610
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,153
[panting]

1611
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:02,156
[soft music]

1612
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:05,493
[indistinct chattering]

1613
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:16,737
Whenever a teacher protects their student...

1614
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,140
[baby cooing]

1615
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:22,844
[Sakamoto] ...you cannot call that a miracle.

1616
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:26,080
[music continues]

1617
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:29,016
- [water trickling] - [coos]

1618
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:32,019
[Sakamoto] Because that is just what they do.

1619
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:34,155
[crying]

1620
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:39,026
[footsteps approaching]

1621
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:41,929
Oh, look who's here?

1622
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:46,901
It's been a while since we came to see Father together.

1623
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:50,838
- Do you have any news for him? - I don't.

1624
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:54,942
When Father died, he lamented the state of Edo's skies...

1625
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:58,679
[spaceship engine revving]

1626
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:01,816
[birds chirping]

1627
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,619
...but whenever I look upon them now,

1628
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:06,921
these same old skies look a bit different.

1629
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,057
[soft music]

1630
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,965
[Shinpachi] After all, there is one thing we do know,

1631
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:23,037
that the people we care about, they live under these skies.

1632
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:26,240
[electricity whooshing]

1633
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,914
Sure, the skies might get cloudy at times,

1634
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,117
but in our hearts, beneath our skies

1635
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:39,687
live all the people I love so much.

1636
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:44,825
[music continues]

1637
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:57,838
[Shinpachi] So, Tama, even if you find yourself

1638
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:02,977
beneath unfamiliar skies, please don't cry.

1639
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:06,847
We will always remain in your heart with you.

1640
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:11,152
And if you'll believe in that, then I'm certain,

1641
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:16,757
we will come to you and wipe your tears away.

1642
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,764
[soft music]

1643
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:37,778
Let's keep going.

1644
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:41,415
[siren wailing]

1645
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,718
[Hasegawa] After that, these lovely ladies

1646
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:46,787
went on to live as citizens of the modern age.

1647
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:52,293
The world was entering a golden age of techno technology.

1648
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,028
Machines, and not people,

1649
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:56,831
were to be the new leaders of civilization.

1650
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,266
And these girls, well, they were robots,

1651
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,801
so they lived happy lives.

1652
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:05,706
Turns out it was the humans who ended up unemployed.

1653
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,775
Yeah, that's right, every last one of them.

1654
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,143
You see, if nobody has a job,

1655
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:12,013
they can't ridicule anybody else for being unemployed.

1656
01:34:12,046 --> 01:34:15,182
The jobless become one and everyone's happy. You dig?

1657
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:16,951
[chuckles]

1658
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:20,388
Every single person can be happy. [laughs]

1659
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:24,225
That's Mister Hasegawa. Why is he here in the future?

1660
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,227
[electricity crackling]

1661
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:28,195
Tamako, let me tell you how

1662
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:30,064
this story really ends, all right?

1663
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:33,234
You see, Edo's gonna turn into a... [burps]

1664
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:36,070
Um, hey Number Zero, the data I gave you

1665
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:38,706
might have contained some massive errors!

1666
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:40,808
What kind of massive errors?

1667
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:46,847
[all] You're trying to bullshit the narration too?

1668
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:49,884
[Shinpachi] What in the holy hell did you tell Tamako?

1669
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:51,852
[Hasegawa] I was just saying how hard it was to find work

1670
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:52,953
after I quit being the hero.

1671
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:55,256
I mean, turns out that people like heroes, right? [groans]

1672
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:59,160
My sincere apologies, it seems this world we perceived

1673
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:00,394
has encountered a few glitches,

1674
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:03,998
with the inclusion of Hasegawa's data, it has some problems.

1675
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:05,433
[electricity whooshing]

1676
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,334
[upbeat music]

1677
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,970
The real world must be something else.

1678
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:12,740
[music continues]

1679
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:16,977
Hey, and good morning to you.

1680
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,415
You look like you're half-asleep or something.

1681
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,485
Whatever, we've got some extremely

1682
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:26,787
urgent work to take care of.

1683
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:28,422
We'll have to catch up with you later.

1684
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:30,224
[Shinpachi] Huh? Wait, Gin!

1685
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:33,294
Oh, and,

1686
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:37,031
you don't need us to wipe those tears away, right?

1687
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:40,801
Looks like the big guy upstairs feels better.

1688
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:42,269
He stopped his crying, too.

1689
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:45,272
The skies above are all clear.

1690
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:50,878
Let's go.

1691
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,546
[music continues]

1692
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:53,781
[Sadaharu barks]

1693
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:58,185
[Kagura] Hey, Gin, where are we going?

1694
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:01,122
What--what is this work we have to do?

1695
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:02,356
[Gintoki] Oh yeah. What was that?

1696
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:05,292
[Shinpachi] You forgot? You said it was extremely urgent!

1697
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:06,427
[Gintoki] You mean, you don't remember?

1698
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,461
[Shinpachi] What? No!

1699
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:09,463
[Gintoki] Well, hey, it doesn't matter what, right?

1700
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:13,467
- [Kagura laughs] - [Gintoki] After all,

1701
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,570
we're the Odd Jobs!

1702
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:19,273
[music continues]

[music continues]

[music continues]

1707
01:40:14,441 --> 01:40:17,077
[Ginpachi-Sensei] Attention Class 3-Z.

1708
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:19,580
[class] Teach us, Ginpachi-Sensei.

1709
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:23,250
[Shinpachi] Stand, bow, take your seats.

1710
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:26,086
Listen up, everyone, the manga and movie

1711
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,354
have reached the final chapter.

1712
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:29,289
So you guys, who have repeated this class,

1713
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:31,558
year after year, finally get to graduate too.

1714
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:34,328
Now meet transfer student, Hideaki Sorachi.

1715
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:35,629
He says you can ask him

1716
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:37,831
anything you want right now and he'll answer.

1717
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:39,066
Question Sensei!

1718
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:41,001
How are we supposed to communicate with a gorilla?

1719
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,002
[Ginpachi-Sensei] What's he saying?

1720
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,772
- All I hear is \"Unga-bunga.\" - Unga-bunga.

1721
01:40:44,805 --> 01:40:47,574
Sensei, an establishment containing multiple gorillas

1722
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:50,210
would be a zoo, and not a school, may I go home now?

1723
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:51,678
[Ginpachi-Sensei] Kondo, Sorachi, and Otae,

1724
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:52,846
you may go home to your cages.

1725
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,349
[groaning] Excuse me.

1726
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:58,218
I can interpret the unga-bunga if you'd like, Sensei.

1727
01:40:58,252 --> 01:40:59,720
[Ginpachi-Sensei] You're the Sensei, Shoyo.

1728
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:02,189
As someone who's been repeating all eternity,

1729
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:03,724
I can understand every language.

1730
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:05,859
[Ginpachi-Sensei] A guy who repeats forever is a crazy person, you know.

1731
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,662
- This is the question Kondo has. - [ominous music]

1732
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:11,432
Getting kicked off of a jump, two final chapter scams,

1733
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:14,468
and series of multiple delays, why did all that happen?

1734
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:15,803
[Kondo] That is a dangerous question!

1735
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:17,504
He really is crazy, Sensei!

1736
01:41:17,538 --> 01:41:19,239
- [grunting] - Uh-huh.

1737
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:20,707
Oh, I see. Is that what happened?

1738
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,709
[Kondo] Sensei! You didn't even need an interpreter!

1739
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,478
It's a rather delicate matter,

1740
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:25,813
so we'll have to banana-coat it.

1741
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:27,581
[Otae] Could you sugarcoat it instead?

1742
01:41:27,614 --> 01:41:28,882
- [ominous music] - [Ginpachi-Sensei] It's like this.

1743
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:30,751
[Kondo] The banana peel isn't working!

1744
01:41:30,784 --> 01:41:32,820
The Sekiro is there for all to see!

1745
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:34,221
Okay, forget the banana.

1746
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:35,722
Things got crazy after Isshin

1747
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,357
tore his way out of Genichiro's back.

1748
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:38,859
[Otae] Please, stop talking about Sekiro.

1749
01:41:38,892 --> 01:41:40,461
It'll just cause online drama.

1750
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:41,662
Anybody else got a questions?

1751
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:42,930
[Kondo] I'm too scared to ask!

1752
01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:44,164
I have a question.

1753
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:47,334
We never got any details about Gintoki Sakata's origins.

1754
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:48,368
So I would like to know.

1755
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:50,437
There's a fan theory that says he's half-Amanto

1756
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:52,473
because of the whole silver hair thing.

1757
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:54,241
Does that mean Sacchan with her purple hair

1758
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,909
is really half-Osakan hag?

1759
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:59,213
So rude! How can anyone be half an Osakan hag?

1760
01:41:59,246 --> 01:42:01,648
Don't worry, Sarutobi. You are not an Osakan hag.

1761
01:42:01,682 --> 01:42:03,250
More of a Nagoyan hag.

1762
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:04,451
I'm not a hag!

1763
01:42:04,485 --> 01:42:06,653
Does that mean silver -haired guy is--

1764
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:08,622
Half-Sugamo-old-fart-geezer?

1765
01:42:08,655 --> 01:42:11,391
- Ooga-booga-booga. - I hate to say it, but you're all wrong.

1766
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:13,660
Keep it between us, but there's a banana-coated

1767
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:15,262
reason for the silver hair.

1768
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:16,296
[ominous music]

1769
01:42:17,564 --> 01:42:18,699
[Kondo] Too blunt! The banana-coating is failing!

1770
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:20,868
Are there any other questions out there?

1771
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:22,936
[Kondo] That's enough, Sensei! We'll just dig our own graves!

1772
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:26,273
Okay, then I shall turn everything hollow,

1773
01:42:26,306 --> 01:42:28,542
with this one perfect question to end them all.

1774
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:31,411
[Ginpachi-Sensei] Shoyo's other persona, Hollow-Brain's here.

1775
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:32,779
He's gonna say something stupid!

1776
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:36,850
Sorachi, I have a question for you. Riddle me this.

1777
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:39,386
Do you count bananas as snackies?

1778
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:41,822
- [Kondo] That was Shoyo! - Stay out of this, Shoyo!

1779
01:42:41,855 --> 01:42:45,492
What I want to ask is, do you consider bananas as royalties?

1780
01:42:45,526 --> 01:42:47,528
No, no, bananas count as snackies.

1781
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:49,296
[Ginpachi-Sensei] Looks like both of their questions are trash.

1782
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:50,397
Banana is royalties!

1783
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,967
[Ginpachi-Sensei] Somebody stop those two morons or that one moron.

1784
01:42:54,001 --> 01:42:55,235
Any other questions?

1785
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,905
Sensei! What was that ObaZ stuff all about?

1786
01:42:57,938 --> 01:42:59,606
[Ginpachi-Sensei] You need to drop it already.

1787
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:02,309
Sensei, I have a question about

1788
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:03,710
something very important to me.

1789
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:05,379
Am I alive? Or am I dead?

1790
01:43:05,412 --> 01:43:07,347
[Kondo] It's Takasugi! He's right.

1791
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:09,616
His survival was kind of left up in the air, wasn't it?

1792
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,286
It was obviously left vague

1793
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:14,388
so that the people out there could have a little hope.

1794
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:16,423
Are you prepared to accept reality,

1795
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:18,625
as cruel and unfortunate as it may be?

1796
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:20,360
Sure

1797
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:25,666
[Kondo] No! Too blunt! Banana -coat it! Banana coat-it!

1798
01:43:26,967 --> 01:43:29,336
Not that I really care, but we can decide

1799
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:31,438
if Takasugi's alive or dead by vote.

1800
01:43:31,471 --> 01:43:33,473
[Kondo] Don't use a poll to decide someone's fate!

1801
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:36,043
Okay, was that bare ass Takasugi's ass

1802
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:37,878
or just some random person's ass?

1803
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:38,946
Pick whatever you like.

1804
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:41,481
[man] Sensei, why are there two votes already?

1805
01:43:43,383 --> 01:43:45,852
Um, Sensei, one vote for everybody died.

1806
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,622
- [low music] - [indistinct chattering]
