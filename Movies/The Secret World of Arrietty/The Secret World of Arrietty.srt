1
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:53,291
It's funny how you wake up each day

2
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:56,941
and never really know if it will be
one that will change your life forever.

3
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,838
But that's what this day was.

4
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:03,880
The day I left the city to spend a
week in the house where my mother grew up.

5
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:05,926
A day I'll never forget.

6
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:13,387
<i>So many years have passed.</i>

7
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:18,589
Almost there. Feeling all right?

8
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,620
I'm okay.

9
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,708
<i>I left my childhood.</i>

10
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:34,327
<i>In a garden green.</i>

11
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,438
<i>Come in the garden.</i>

12
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:44,476
<i>And look at the trees.</i>

13
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:51,158
<i>I used to play there when I was a child.</i>

14
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,779
Oh, Hara. How many times have I told her?

15
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,139
Wait here. All right? I won't be a minute.

16
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:00,830
Okay.

17
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:08,523
Hara! Your car's blocking the driveway again.

18
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:16,558
<i>So many years have passed.</i>

19
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:24,948
<i>The dew is still on the roses.</i>

20
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:31,748
<i>I left my childhood.</i>

21
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:37,859
<i>In a garden green.</i>

22
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,406
Shawn? Where are you?

23
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:51,773
Shawn?

24
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:54,031
I'm here, Aunt Jessica.

25
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,549
Come meet Hara!

26
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:32,193
Supper is done and night has come.

27
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,989
Let's have tea together near the fireplace.

28
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,055
Nice try.

29
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,924
My house, my home Is so small, so pretty.

30
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:51,858
My mom, my dad We are family.

31
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:54,446
Joy everywhere.

32
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,475
Hey, back off!

33
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:02,786
Hey! Go get your own!

34
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:24,669
Arrietty!

35
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,209
What?

36
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,759
You went outside again, didn't you?

37
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,577
How many times have I... What happened to your room?

38
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,429
It's my own little garden.

39
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:38,171
If you ask me it looks more like your own little jungle.

40
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,254
Hmm.

41
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:41,868
Is that a bay leaf?

42
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,484
Hmm.

43
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,865
Where did you get that?

44
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:47,477
Oh!

45
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,821
I wanted to wait and give it
to you on your birthday, but...

46
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,287
Happy birthday!

47
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:59,607
This will last me all year.

48
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:02,405
But the bay tree is so far away.

49
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:05,039
If a bean saw you it would...

50
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,074
Beans don't scare me.

51
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,053
The beans should scare you. That's what worries me.

52
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,540
The world is a dangerous place for a Borrower.

53
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,880
Your Aunt Eggletina wasn't scared either and she...

54
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,411
Was eaten by a toad. I know, I know.

55
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,741
If you don't like your gift I can put it in my room.

56
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:21,546
No, no, I should keep it.

57
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,547
I have just the recipe for these.

58
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,510
I'll have your father borrow some sugar.

59
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:28,234
Oh, you don't have to.

60
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,792
Because tonight I'll borrow some for you.

61
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:32,816
What?

62
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,199
Don't tell me you forgot!

63
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:37,553
Tonight's my first borrowing!

64
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,031
Look, Papa's home.

65
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:43,912
Papa. Papa, I made it all the way to the bay tree today.

66
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:44,693
Mmm-hmm.

67
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:46,735
And I used the leaves over my head just like you said.

68
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,509
Mmm-hmm.

69
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,405
And I didn't even get seen by the cat.

70
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:49,993
Mmm.

71
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,076
So, what I'm trying to say,

72
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:52,005
if there was any doubt...

73
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,596
There's a new bean in the house.

74
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:54,669
What?

75
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,983
I know. I saw him.

76
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,563
Arrietty, I told you to be...

77
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,644
Yes, Mama, I was careful and he didn't see me.

78
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,855
And he's much smaller than other beans.

79
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,806
Papa, you just have to let me come borrowing tonight.

80
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,940
We know nothing about this new bean.

81
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:10,030
But you promised this would be my night.

82
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,098
And I've seen him.

83
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:14,242
Papa, please, I am telling you, he's just a child.

84
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:17,517
And the children are more vicious than the grownups.

85
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,160
I'll be fine.

86
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,460
Well, the young beans do go to bed early.

87
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,105
Oh, thank you, Papa!

88
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:29,825
Pod!

89
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,041
The boy is very sickly and weak. She'll be fine.

90
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,210
But...

91
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,052
Oh, and don't worry, Mother. I'll get Papa back safely.

92
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,349
Arrietty will be turning 14 soon.

93
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:47,524
She'll need to know how to take care of herself out there.

94
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,708
Without our help.

95
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,336
Sometimes I worry that we are the only Borrowers left.

96
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,502
What'll become of us?

97
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:13,446
Remember what the doctor said, Shawn.

98
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,999
Your heart needs rest. No excitement.

99
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,213
Is that clear, Hara?

100
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,881
Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.

101
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:22,635
Whatever you need, Shawn, you ask Hara,
and she'll get it for you, all right?

102
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:23,756
Yes, Aunt Jessica.

103
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,454
Make him feel at home, Hara.

104
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:26,664
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,028
Hmm.

106
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,707
We'll start by keeping the bugs out.

107
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:58,777
Hmm.

108
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:00,676
Mmm-hmm.

109
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:26,402
Don't you think you should wear
something a little darker and longer?

110
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:28,629
No, I think this one's perfect.

111
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:30,475
Mmm-hmm.

112
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:34,700
So, I need you to get me some tissue paper and some sugar.

113
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,336
Oh, and promise, dear husband,

114
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,329
you won't let our daughter get
eaten or squashed like a bug.

115
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,574
Oh, please God. Please help them.

116
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,053
Don't worry about me. Everything's fine.

117
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,169
Hmm.

118
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,175
Okay, bye, Mom. I love you.

119
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,867
Oh, goodbye. Love you, too. Stay close to your father.

120
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,883
I will.

121
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:01,416
Do I get one of those?

122
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:04,394
Nope? Okay.

123
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,658
Wow.

124
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:26,768
Arrietty!

125
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hmm?

126
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,810
Ha!

127
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:43,891
Oh!

128
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:46,879
Did you see that?

129
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:47,903
That's my girl.

130
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,718
Don't look down.

131
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,898
One step at a time.

132
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,252
All right. You need to hold this for me.

133
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,271
Okay.

134
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:06,129
Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.

135
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:07,808
Mmm-hmm.

136
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,874
Arrietty!

137
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,216
Let's go.

138
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Right.

139
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:11,727
Wow.

140
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:18,761
It's so big.

141
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:21,881
Papa, what is this place?

142
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,755
This is where beans store all their food.

143
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,745
The sugar is over there.

144
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:33,959
When you get down there, wait for me.

145
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:50,498
Yeah!

146
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,072
Papa, you are great!

147
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,090
Yay!

148
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,733
Huh? Oh.

149
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:48,101
There. That wasn't so hard.

150
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:49,539
Where to now?

151
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,012
Tissue paper. Then home.

152
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,605
Wow.

153
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,959
Papa, look what I found.

154
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,628
Looks like someone got their first borrowing.

155
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:14,637
Hmm.

156
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,269
Careful with it, it's sharp.

157
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:17,016
Okay.

158
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,532
Papa, borrowing is so much fun!

159
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:43,491
Hmm.

160
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:47,735
Look down there.

161
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:48,783
Mmm?

162
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:57,446
Filthy rats. You want to stay away from those things.

163
00:17:58,299 --> 00:17:59,393
I'm not afraid.

164
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,132
I will cut them down to size with my sword.

165
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:08,171
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.

166
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,468
What is this place?

167
00:18:56,682 --> 00:19:00,098
I've heard human beans call it a dollhouse.

168
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,306
Dolls are toys for beans.

169
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:04,930
And we are not toys.

170
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,091
These things are not for borrowing.

171
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:10,549
Oh, but it's so perfect for us.

172
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:15,034
Don't you think Mother would
absolutely love that dresser over there?

173
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,943
If anything went missing, they'd know right away.

174
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:20,122
Borrowers take only what they need.

175
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,389
Oh.

176
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,851
Don't be afraid, okay?

177
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:05,125
Hey.

178
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:10,312
I know it was you in the garden. I knew I saw you.

179
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,597
My mother used to tell me stories

180
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:23,568
about the little people who lived under the floors.

181
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:27,196
Was it you?

182
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:29,008
Was it?

183
00:22:31,412 --> 00:22:32,499
Please don't go.

184
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,261
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

185
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:23,984
He might have seen me out in the garden today.

186
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,816
We all make mistakes.

187
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:30,522
So we'll just have to be extra careful now.

188
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:33,306
Best not to tell your mother about this.

189
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,220
You know how she worries.

190
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,448
Right.

191
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,668
I'm very proud of you.

192
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:48,189
A lesser Borrower would've panicked and run away.

193
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:51,794
Mmm.

194
00:23:58,292 --> 00:23:59,010
Oh.

195
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,504
Well, we're home.

196
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,689
Safe and sound.

197
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,564
Mmm-hmm.

198
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:18,738
Is everything okay?

199
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:22,168
Not quite the adventure we'd hoped for.

200
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:25,472
This old light gave out halfway to the kitchen.

201
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:27,053
No.

202
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,798
Mmm.

203
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:31,087
Well, I'm afraid we had to give up on the sugar.

204
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:35,191
That's okay. I'm just happy you made it home.

205
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,358
It wasn't a total loss.

206
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:40,859
Arrietty, why don't you show
your mother your first borrowing?

207
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,727
What a beautiful pin.

208
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,637
Hmm.

209
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:56,719
Okay. Off to bed.

210
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:05,409
Night, Mama, Papa.

211
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:12,624
She looks so worn-out.

212
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,649
Should I make us some tea?

213
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:16,407
Mmm-hmm.

214
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:52,897
Shawn, come inside. You'll catch your death of cold.

215
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,749
What did you say? Why would he do that?

216
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:42,345
I think he was just being nice.

217
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:46,247
It's the same cube of sugar I
dropped in his room last night.

218
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:48,714
Pod,

219
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:52,230
what does she mean, she dropped it?

220
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:59,032
Do not touch it. Do you understand me?

221
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:03,526
It's a trap.

222
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,729
I just know it. They're going to trap us like cockroaches.

223
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:11,278
Homily, let's try not to get hysterical, okay?

224
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:13,806
Don't tell me to not get hysterical!

225
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:16,342
We'll probably have to move now.

226
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,594
Goodbye, old table.

227
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:22,726
We had so many fun times together.

228
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,903
Let's not say goodbye to anything just yet.

229
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:29,997
Eat your soup before it gets cold.

230
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,657
I told you that young bean would be trouble!

231
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,519
But no one ever listens to me.

232
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,801
Thank you, Arrietty.

233
00:29:58,092 --> 00:30:01,083
Smart girl, doing this when the sun came out.

234
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:04,680
Or maybe I have a smart mama who taught me.

235
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:09,738
You're a good girl.

236
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:12,306
If you've got this, I think I'll go lie down a bit.

237
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:13,141
Okay.

238
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,180
Is that you from last night?

239
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:17,237
No, wait. Don't go.

240
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,476
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

241
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,167
Please leave us alone.

242
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:25,830
We don't need your help.

243
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:28,924
But can I please just talk to you?

244
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:32,856
No! Human beans are dangerous.

245
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,051
Whenever we're seen, we have to move. My parents said so.

246
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:40,366
So you have a family. That must be nice.

247
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,991
You don't have a family?

248
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,534
Yeah, I have one.

249
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,267
But they sent me here to get
the care and attention I need.

250
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:51,387
Because they're both very busy with their work.

251
00:35:52,346 --> 00:35:53,728
Sorry to hear that.

252
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:00,755
Anyway, my name is Shawn. What's your name?

253
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:01,423
Hmm?

254
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,325
What do they call you?

255
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:10,386
Not that it's any of your business, but it's Arrietty.

256
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:14,086
Arrietty. Arrietty.

257
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,558
That's a beautiful name.

258
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:22,061
Maybe we could be friends?

259
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:35,588
Could you at least come out so I can see you?

260
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:37,540
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.

261
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:38,161
Hmm?

262
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:43,066
Mmm-mmm! Mmm-mmm!

263
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,737
I won't hurt you, I promise.

264
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,611
Help me! Help me!

265
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:04,559
Ow!

266
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,222
Ah! Whoa!

267
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:37,071
Hey! Hey! Hey!

268
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:41,996
What in the world? A crow!

269
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:46,602
Oh! Attack! Ow!

270
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:51,666
You get out right now!

271
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,469
What got into that bird?

272
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:08,252
Don't think I've ever seen one behave like that.

273
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:11,207
Maybe it's nesting season or something.

274
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:14,537
I don't know. Looks me to like it was after something.

275
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:17,170
Oh, look at the holes in the screen.

276
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:19,643
Which I'll have to replace, of course.

277
00:38:20,443 --> 00:38:22,397
Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?

278
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,076
Your aunt said for you not to get too excited!

279
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:26,684
Should I get your medicine?

280
00:38:27,077 --> 00:38:30,315
No, that's okay, Miss Hara.
I'm actually feeling pretty good.

281
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,749
Mmm-hmm.

282
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,799
Nesting season, huh?

283
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:51,406
Well, Shawn, you have a nice, long rest now.

284
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:56,813
Phew.

285
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:52,272
Papa!

286
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,729
I hear you visited the young bean.

287
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,608
I'm sorry.

288
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:01,302
I went to ask him to leave us alone.

289
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:04,670
But I really don't think he intends to hurt us.

290
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:08,652
Many Borrowers have lost their lives thinking the same.

291
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,520
It must never happen again.

292
00:40:12,068 --> 00:40:13,077
Do you understand me?

293
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:13,889
Yeah.

294
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:26,205
We'd better start looking for a new home.

295
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:27,056
Huh?

296
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:31,144
The boy knows that we're here.

297
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:37,072
Are we safe?

298
00:41:10,822 --> 00:41:12,849
Delivery. Package for you, ma'am.

299
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:18,315
Thanks for the drink, Hara. It's pretty hot today.

300
00:41:18,663 --> 00:41:22,394
Do you happen to know of any good pest control companies?

301
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,764
Pest problem, huh?

302
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:30,268
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Pest Extermination ."

303
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:33,647
1 -800... Oh, hang on.

304
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,104
So you got yourself a mouse problem?

305
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,280
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

306
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:44,237
Maybe it's mice, maybe it's little tiny people.

307
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:45,056
Huh?

308
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:50,825
Strange things have been happening here and I know why.

309
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,196
That's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.

310
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,173
I mean, when Hara told me, I just couldn't believe it.

311
00:41:57,604 --> 00:42:00,689
Why on earth would a crow try to fly into your room?

312
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:02,487
Were you frightened?

313
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:06,564
No, I wasn't scared. Hara came and chased it away.

314
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:09,857
And it's a good thing I came in when I did.

315
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,894
That bird had huge wings and claws...

316
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,162
Let's not relive the excitement, Hara,

317
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:20,475
considering Shawn came here for a little peace
and quiet and tranquility before his operation.

318
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,688
Yes, ma'am. Forgive me.

319
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:30,637
I'm sorry, Hara. I don't mean to be short with you.

320
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:35,350
But why his mother chose this time to
go away on business is just beyond...

321
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:39,912
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother here to look after you.

322
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:42,628
Hmm. You know, not so much lately.

323
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,018
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped,

324
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,187
but honestly, why couldn't she
be here when her son needs her so?

325
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:50,740
It's the last thing his poor heart needs.

326
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:02,310
Aunt Jessica, I was noticing
that miniature house in my room.

327
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:04,012
And the detail's amazing.

328
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:06,372
Oh, you mean the dollhouse.

329
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:09,265
That beautiful little house belonged to your mother.

330
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:13,276
She had to leave it here when
she moved away to go to college.

331
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:14,349
It was Mother's?

332
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:17,343
Your grandfather had it specially made

333
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,677
because he was hoping it would be
a lovely home for the little people.

334
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:22,767
What?

335
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,308
That's right. Little people who lived in the walls.

336
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:27,961
He was quite obsessed with them.

337
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:30,948
People laughed, of course, and called him mad.

338
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:33,621
But your mother, she believed him.

339
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:37,379
They worked on that house together for hours.

340
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,574
And he told her they would come,
but of course, they never did.

341
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:46,876
Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen
any tiny little people in your room?

342
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:48,727
Mmm...

343
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:52,216
Mmm-mmm. Can't say that I have.

344
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:56,596
I think it's why your mother
doesn't like to come here anymore.

345
00:43:56,866 --> 00:44:00,567
Too many memories of wishes that never came true.

346
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:02,279
Can we look inside it?

347
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,190
Yes!

348
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:09,102
You know, I haven't looked inside it in quite a long time.

349
00:44:13,212 --> 00:44:16,217
Hara, could you be a dear and turn off the lights?

350
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:17,152
Ma'am.

351
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:29,629
<i>So many years have passed.</i>

352
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:30,948
This is the living room.

353
00:44:31,065 --> 00:44:36,021
Your grandfather had all of this handmade
by a real furniture maker in England.

354
00:44:36,688 --> 00:44:39,591
Isn't that just insane?

355
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:42,449
Look at the attention to detail.

356
00:44:42,736 --> 00:44:45,368
They really were preparing it for someone to live in.

357
00:44:45,756 --> 00:44:49,960
And just in case you don't believe
what I'm saying is absolutely true,

358
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:52,885
have a look at that room right there.

359
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,170
<i>Come in the garden.</i>

360
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,509
Wow, what a kitchen!

361
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,588
<i>And look at the trees.</i>

362
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:06,602
Everything in it a miniature of the real thing.

363
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:10,621
That oven actually works. You could bake real cookies.

364
00:45:10,645 --> 00:45:12,612
Some really little cookies.

365
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:15,171
What a pity their dream never came true.

366
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:19,661
It really would've made a lovely home.

367
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:27,465
<i>Settled down there long ago.</i>

368
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:37,694
<i>So many years have passed.</i>

369
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:45,617
<i>The dew is still on the roses.</i>

370
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:52,503
<i>I left my childhood.</i>

371
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:58,932
<i>In a garden green.</i>

372
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:02,034
<i>Come in the garden.</i>

373
00:46:03,278 --> 00:46:06,069
<i>And sit on the grass.</i>

374
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:13,293
<i>I used to sit there when I was a child</i>

375
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,983
<i>Ivy and moss.</i>

376
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:21,037
<i>Little daisies.</i>

377
00:46:22,843 --> 00:46:28,257
<i>Covered the lane long ago.</i>

378
00:47:42,197 --> 00:47:45,400
You know, Mother, we've had these same pictures for years.

379
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:46,821
Wouldn't you like some new ones?

380
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:49,816
Well, Arrietty, I like those pictures.

381
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:53,699
And I've always dreamed I'd see the real ocean someday.

382
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,546
Besides, there's no point in changing them now.

383
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:04,595
I wonder what's taking Papa so long.

384
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,132
Why is my first thought always
that he got eaten by the cat?

385
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:09,619
What's wrong with me?

386
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:13,901
There he is!

387
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:15,732
Does he look eaten?

388
00:48:18,624 --> 00:48:20,714
Hey, Papa, how was it out there?

389
00:48:20,756 --> 00:48:21,379
Oh.

390
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:25,390
I slipped and twisted my leg.

391
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:27,440
I'm lucky that Spiller here found me.

392
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:35,194
Well, what is going on down...

393
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,109
Pod, you're hurt!

394
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:39,784
It was the cat, wasn't it? See, I'm not crazy.

395
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:40,808
Get up here!

396
00:48:42,064 --> 00:48:43,340
Does it hurt, Papa?

397
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,585
It's just a sprain. Go calm your mother.

398
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:49,468
I'll get some cold water. I'll be right back.

399
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:50,609
Everyone relax!

400
00:48:52,408 --> 00:48:54,207
Here's a towel. Dry yourself.

401
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,420
Who's that?

402
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:05,012
I wonder if he has news about any of the other Borrowers.

403
00:49:13,664 --> 00:49:14,920
Okay, I leave now.

404
00:49:14,972 --> 00:49:18,026
Can't you at least stay and have some tea?

405
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:27,974
Arrietty, I'll take care of your father.

406
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:30,858
Why don't you see if Spiller would like a cup of tea?

407
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:36,043
Won't you please stay, Spiller?
I've never met another Borrower before.

408
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:38,464
Hmm.

409
00:49:39,503 --> 00:49:41,773
We can't thank you enough for your help.

410
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:45,003
Tell us, have you seen other Borrowers?

411
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:46,237
We're all alone here

412
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:49,272
and we're starting to believe
we're the only ones left. Are we?

413
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:53,945
This many.

414
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:57,273
Oh! Then cousin Lupy could still be alive.

415
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:58,297
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:49:59,178 --> 00:50:01,422
Oh, that's a bow, isn't it? Can I see it?

417
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:09,010
You use this for your borrowing?

418
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:17,539
Give that back, Arrietty,
before you shoot someone's eye out.

419
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,969
Okay. Go now.

420
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,199
Oh, but couldn't you stay a little bit longer?

421
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,279
I'll cook dinner.

422
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:43,483
Already got this.

423
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:48,894
A cricket leg!

424
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,130
Want some?

425
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:52,925
Very fresh.

426
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,940
No, thanks.

427
00:50:58,795 --> 00:50:59,363
Bye.

428
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,575
Thank you, my friend.

429
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:07,862
I'll go with him. To see him out.

430
00:51:14,175 --> 00:51:17,138
What were you doing out there in that storm?

431
00:51:17,761 --> 00:51:20,112
I was looking for a safe route for our journey.

432
00:51:20,264 --> 00:51:22,325
And now I know which route not to take.

433
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:23,398
Oh, Pod.

434
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,830
Spiller knows of more Borrowers a few days journey away.

435
00:51:28,439 --> 00:51:30,709
There's a small river past the forest.

436
00:51:30,773 --> 00:51:32,331
He's offered to take us on it.

437
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:34,693
Mmm. That's great.

438
00:51:36,363 --> 00:51:39,282
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.

439
00:51:40,326 --> 00:51:44,041
And I'm sure it will almost be as nice as this.

440
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,187
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.

441
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:51,712
Or that I met anyone.

442
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,736
Hey, maybe next time you could
bring your whole family with you.

443
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:57,858
No family. Only Spiller.

444
00:51:58,427 --> 00:51:59,109
Oh.

445
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:01,863
Well, we... We could be a family.

446
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,167
And when you come back you could stay for a family dinner.

447
00:53:09,832 --> 00:53:10,626
Hara?

448
00:53:29,685 --> 00:53:32,872
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.

449
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:34,302
You'll have to start over.

450
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,536
Aw!

451
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:38,541
Why do we need such a big bag anyway?

452
00:53:38,617 --> 00:53:40,145
Are we putting the whole house in here?

453
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,549
Hmm.

454
00:53:48,078 --> 00:53:50,653
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.

455
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:54,527
Papa, can I come in?

456
00:53:54,552 --> 00:53:55,238
Mmm-hmm.

457
00:53:57,802 --> 00:53:58,498
How's your leg?

458
00:53:58,523 --> 00:54:00,818
Ah, well, better than that cricket's.

459
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:02,272
I'm serious.

460
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:07,989
Papa, why do we have to move?

461
00:54:08,807 --> 00:54:12,780
Once a Borrower has been seen, the
beans' curiosity can't be stopped.

462
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:20,040
Well, isn't it possible that
not every human bean is dangerous?

463
00:54:21,346 --> 00:54:24,182
Arrietty, before you were born

464
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:27,367
there were two other families
who were living in this house.

465
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:31,248
One family went missing, they just disappeared.

466
00:54:31,288 --> 00:54:33,149
The other one moved away.

467
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,232
They were seen by humans.

468
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:39,345
And so, we have to do whatever it takes to survive.

469
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:42,084
But, Papa...

470
00:54:50,182 --> 00:54:51,553
Oh! Oh, no!

471
00:54:54,814 --> 00:54:55,549
Huh?

472
00:54:57,606 --> 00:55:01,478
Pod, what is it? An earthquake?

473
00:55:25,968 --> 00:55:26,693
Mother!

474
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:31,449
It won't open!

475
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:37,082
Frame is buckled!

476
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:00,606
The wall!

477
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:37,742
Homily!

478
00:56:39,872 --> 00:56:41,944
Homily, are you all right?

479
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,725
Pod, remember how I always said I wanted a new kitchen?

480
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:56,278
Huh?

481
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:09,920
Huh, more bills.

482
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:17,703
Oh.

483
00:57:20,535 --> 00:57:21,309
Hmm.

484
00:57:33,874 --> 00:57:34,474
Hmm.

485
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:38,812
Hmm.

486
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:44,779
Hmm.

487
00:57:52,044 --> 00:57:54,284
Remember, take only the things we need.

488
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:55,135
Mmm-hmm.

489
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:04,255
We can't possibly carry all of this.

490
00:58:05,043 --> 00:58:08,898
And, Homily, don't take anything from the dollhouse.

491
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,624
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.

492
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,952
You stay with your mother.

493
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:15,644
Okay.

494
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:49,981
So you finally came.

495
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:02,667
Did you like your new kitchen?

496
00:59:04,698 --> 00:59:06,486
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.

497
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:12,058
But it doesn't matter. Because I came to tell you goodbye.

498
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:18,464
Can I turn around?

499
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:22,201
Mmm-hmm.

500
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:44,270
You're beautiful.

501
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,841
My papa said we have to move now.

502
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:53,598
We've been seen, and.

503
00:59:54,164 --> 00:59:55,808
Borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.

504
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:58,152
What are Borrowers?

505
00:59:58,407 --> 01:00:00,787
My mother, father, and I are all Borrowers.

506
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,357
We borrow things that beans won't miss if they are gone.

507
01:00:03,856 --> 01:00:06,819
Just little things, soap, cookies, and sugar.

508
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:08,663
All things that we need to survive.

509
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:11,298
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.

510
01:00:12,452 --> 01:00:14,739
I think my grandfather saw one of you once.

511
01:00:14,816 --> 01:00:16,980
Hmm. It's possible.

512
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:21,821
And it's my fault that you're leaving.

513
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,285
Niya! Niya!

514
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:26,592
Don't be like that. Be nice to her.

515
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,474
So, in my aunt's house,

516
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,176
how many other Borrowers are
there who are living with you?

517
01:00:33,206 --> 01:00:36,484
It's just my father and my mother and me.

518
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:38,574
What about in other houses?

519
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:39,902
I'm sure there are some.

520
01:00:40,198 --> 01:00:42,789
But I've only met one other so far.

521
01:00:43,404 --> 01:00:44,284
Oh.

522
01:00:45,912 --> 01:00:49,192
You must be afraid you'll be the
only ones of your kind who are left.

523
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,125
What?

524
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:53,199
Every year there's fewer and fewer of you, right?

525
01:00:54,014 --> 01:00:57,116
Aren't you scared that soon you'll all be gone?

526
01:00:59,544 --> 01:01:01,274
What a horrible thing to say!

527
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:04,583
I know that there's more of us because Spiller said so!

528
01:01:05,284 --> 01:01:06,293
Who's Spiller?

529
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:09,718
He's one of us. He lives out in the forest,

530
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:12,654
and he said that there are hundreds more of us.

531
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,548
That might be true.

532
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:17,739
But, you know, none of us can live forever, can we?

533
01:01:19,988 --> 01:01:21,835
We all have to die sometime.

534
01:01:22,991 --> 01:01:25,096
Why would you say something like that?

535
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,228
Because it's true.

536
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:29,459
I guess so.

537
01:01:30,082 --> 01:01:32,634
Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

538
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:37,080
Sometimes things happen to us
that are just beyond our control.

539
01:01:39,007 --> 01:01:42,622
And when these things happen, there's
really nothing you can do about it.

540
01:01:43,749 --> 01:01:46,632
You just accept it and prepare for the worst.

541
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,483
I wish it wasn't that way.

542
01:01:49,797 --> 01:01:52,895
But you can't live a life
that's built on nothing but wishes.

543
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:55,538
It isn't practical.

544
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,105
Sometimes you just have to accept the hand of fate.

545
01:02:00,395 --> 01:02:01,626
Oh, no, you don't.

546
01:02:02,697 --> 01:02:06,959
Sometimes you have to stand up and fight
for the things that are worth fighting for.

547
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:11,402
You have to survive. That's what my papa says.

548
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:14,729
And so we're leaving even though it's dangerous.

549
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,284
And we are going to survive.

550
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:20,662
We are Borrowers and we'll make do. We always have.

551
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:24,270
As long as we have each other
to live for, we'll keep on living.

552
01:02:26,919 --> 01:02:30,028
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

553
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:33,056
I'm actually the one who's going to die.

554
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:34,663
What?

555
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:40,365
There's something wrong with my heart.

556
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:42,533
They're gonna operate next week, but

557
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,284
it probably won't help.

558
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:45,843
That's terrible.

559
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:51,754
I've always been sick and I've
had someone looking after me.

560
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:54,179
And that's why when I saw you,

561
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:57,038
I just wanted to find a way to protect you.

562
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,672
But I guess I messed up.

563
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:02,627
I made it worse. I'm sorry.

564
01:03:04,419 --> 01:03:06,742
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.

565
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:14,827
Hmm.

566
01:03:25,447 --> 01:03:26,024
Hmm?

567
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:33,667
Now what on earth is this doing here?

568
01:03:34,633 --> 01:03:35,544
Hmm.

569
01:03:38,132 --> 01:03:39,061
Mmm-hmm.

570
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:49,509
Hmm.

571
01:04:01,287 --> 01:04:04,082
Now how did you get in there?

572
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,186
There you are!

573
01:04:25,043 --> 01:04:26,043
Mom!

574
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:28,877
What? What's wrong?

575
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:32,755
My mother, I think she's in danger.

576
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:44,870
No!

577
01:04:53,105 --> 01:04:55,020
Give me that, you little thief!

578
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:06,626
Now we'll see who they call crazy.

579
01:05:07,992 --> 01:05:11,842
And I bet there's more of you, aren't there, hmm?

580
01:05:13,487 --> 01:05:15,422
Wait, no! Wait, wait! Wait!

581
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,667
I have to go help her.

582
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:36,367
But...

583
01:06:01,219 --> 01:06:03,937
Oh, no! Help! No, no, please! Help!

584
01:06:04,081 --> 01:06:05,896
Pod! Arrietty!

585
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,141
Let me out of here!

586
01:06:20,205 --> 01:06:21,810
Hey! Hey!

587
01:06:23,917 --> 01:06:26,022
Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!

588
01:06:26,132 --> 01:06:28,747
Arrietty! Help!

589
01:06:32,331 --> 01:06:33,856
Ah! Watch it!

590
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,110
Hmm. Let's see.

591
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,763
Now to find the others.

592
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:01,660
Let me out! No! No!

593
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:19,618
Huh?

594
01:07:33,775 --> 01:07:35,507
Something terrible has happened.

595
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:02,259
Squeaky Klean.

596
01:09:02,293 --> 01:09:03,412
Yes, hello.

597
01:09:03,552 --> 01:09:06,055
I'm calling from 833 Elm Lane.

598
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:08,073
Could you get out here right away?

599
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:11,326
I have a very unique pest problem.

600
01:09:11,329 --> 01:09:12,339
Is it mice?

601
01:09:12,363 --> 01:09:14,627
Oh, much worse than mice.

602
01:09:15,129 --> 01:09:16,604
Do you want them exterminated?

603
01:09:16,988 --> 01:09:19,979
No, I need you to trap them.

604
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:33,035
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!

605
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:36,198
Shawn! Shawn!

606
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,390
Arrietty!

607
01:09:43,366 --> 01:09:44,588
My mother is missing.

608
01:09:45,368 --> 01:09:48,848
Someone took the roof off! I think a human bean got her.

609
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:56,290
Oh, Mama.

610
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:08,619
We will find her.

611
01:10:41,507 --> 01:10:42,121
What?

612
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:45,402
Someone's locked us in.

613
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,201
There's a room next door. Hold on tight.

614
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:58,467
Oh!

615
01:10:59,038 --> 01:11:00,399
One step at a time.

616
01:11:00,735 --> 01:11:01,364
Right.

617
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:12,463
It's stuck!

618
01:11:12,994 --> 01:11:13,633
Wait.

619
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:25,538
I can get us in.

620
01:11:49,707 --> 01:11:50,731
Oh, no, no!

621
01:12:01,095 --> 01:12:02,095
Keep going.

622
01:12:37,851 --> 01:12:39,710
What do you mean you're lost?

623
01:12:40,543 --> 01:12:42,823
How can you possibly be lost?

624
01:12:43,004 --> 01:12:44,625
It's the only road!

625
01:12:44,684 --> 01:12:45,971
Is it before the bridge?

626
01:12:45,996 --> 01:12:48,607
What bridge? There's no bridge!

627
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:57,529
Hara must have found it and opened it.

628
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,420
This is what I was afraid of.

629
01:12:59,444 --> 01:13:00,620
Mother's been taken.

630
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:02,980
Oh!

631
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:38,850
Are you okay?

632
01:13:40,019 --> 01:13:41,915
Be careful. Shawn, please.

633
01:13:49,445 --> 01:13:51,660
Where are those idiots?

634
01:14:10,787 --> 01:14:11,649
Huh?

635
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:28,869
Mother! Where are you?

636
01:14:30,113 --> 01:14:33,397
...be wise. They're supposed to catch pests.

637
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:46,651
But... How did you...

638
01:14:47,295 --> 01:14:48,094
Hara.

639
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:52,842
Could I have some warm milk?

640
01:14:53,306 --> 01:14:55,822
Okay! Wait just a minute.

641
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:06,508
Thank you, Hara.

642
01:15:06,596 --> 01:15:07,493
Mmm.

643
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:47,980
I'm a little hungry. Are there any cookies?

644
01:15:48,004 --> 01:15:50,996
Cookies? Now he wants cookies.

645
01:15:54,545 --> 01:15:55,545
Mother!

646
01:15:57,573 --> 01:15:58,633
Mother!

647
01:16:06,607 --> 01:16:07,607
Mother!

648
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:08,588
Arrietty!

649
01:16:08,612 --> 01:16:09,239
Huh?

650
01:16:13,185 --> 01:16:14,261
Over here!

651
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,987
Arrietty! Here I am! Here I am!

652
01:16:19,012 --> 01:16:20,012
Oh, Mother!

653
01:16:23,517 --> 01:16:25,337
Oh, Arrietty.

654
01:16:52,545 --> 01:16:54,829
Oh, good. There they are.

655
01:16:54,854 --> 01:16:57,492
They finally found the road. The only road.

656
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:20,597
Another bean!

657
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,164
It's okay, Mother. He's a friend.

658
01:17:47,752 --> 01:17:51,349
Mmm-hmm. Ma'am, we'd like to take a look around.

659
01:17:51,365 --> 01:17:52,499
See what we see.

660
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:54,284
Yes, of course.

661
01:17:59,987 --> 01:18:01,336
Mmm-hmm.

662
01:18:01,957 --> 01:18:02,957
Mmm-hmm.

663
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,255
Mmm-hmm.

664
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:21,503
Squeaky Klean Exterminators?

665
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:23,744
Hara? Hara!

666
01:18:24,512 --> 01:18:25,281
Oh!

667
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,410
What's going on here?

668
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:30,498
It's finally happened.

669
01:18:30,643 --> 01:18:32,585
I found the little people.

670
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:33,555
Little people?

671
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,445
Mmm-hmm.

672
01:18:35,286 --> 01:18:38,899
Yes! And what little robbers they are.

673
01:18:50,955 --> 01:18:52,607
I wouldn't have believed it either

674
01:18:52,623 --> 01:18:55,322
unless I'd seen it with my own eyes. It's remarkable!

675
01:18:55,806 --> 01:18:58,636
It's the eighth wonder of the world.

676
01:18:59,492 --> 01:19:01,775
And they're so teeny!

677
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:05,444
And they have a whole house full of things they've stolen.

678
01:19:05,845 --> 01:19:08,265
Are you sure you didn't find the sherry again?

679
01:19:08,305 --> 01:19:11,535
All these years you thought I was losing things.

680
01:19:11,559 --> 01:19:14,231
But it wasn't me. It was them!

681
01:19:14,256 --> 01:19:17,415
You didn't mention little people
to the exterminators, did you?

682
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:19,729
No. I didn't want to scare them off.

683
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,505
Because I'm sure the house is just full of them.

684
01:19:23,886 --> 01:19:26,117
You'll see when I show you.

685
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,979
This is their nest.

686
01:19:31,055 --> 01:19:31,842
Nest?

687
01:19:31,878 --> 01:19:33,515
Mmm-hmm.

688
01:19:38,044 --> 01:19:40,856
Looks like a pile of old junk to me.

689
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,789
W-What?

690
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,707
It was here! It was here!

691
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:49,028
Where's that little teapot?

692
01:19:49,053 --> 01:19:51,851
Okay, Hara, I'm sending the exterminators away.

693
01:19:51,932 --> 01:19:54,335
No! No, no! Wait just a minute.

694
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:57,784
Oh. Oh! I'll clean that up later.

695
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:01,964
Oh, please!

696
01:20:05,525 --> 01:20:08,487
Hello, Shawn. Can we come in for a minute?

697
01:20:08,728 --> 01:20:09,680
It's open.

698
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:24,356
You'll see. Those little thieves stole the tiny kitchen.

699
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:29,696
I don't know how they did it, but the whole thing is gone.

700
01:20:29,953 --> 01:20:30,523
Huh?

701
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,391
Not gone.

702
01:20:33,891 --> 01:20:36,548
Perhaps you need a little time off, Hara.

703
01:20:38,065 --> 01:20:40,418
Yeah. Hmm!

704
01:20:48,734 --> 01:20:51,443
Wait! Wait! I can prove it!

705
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:53,557
I've got one of them in a jar!

706
01:20:56,288 --> 01:21:00,017
Poor Hara. I think she's finally gone bonkers.

707
01:21:03,352 --> 01:21:05,359
Do I smell fresh herbs?

708
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:13,457
Mmm!

709
01:21:20,103 --> 01:21:22,400
Someone's been making tea.

710
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:26,419
It's just as my father told us.

711
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,901
There really are little people living here.

712
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:33,184
Yes, there are.

713
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:36,453
Your mother really should be here to see this.

714
01:21:36,478 --> 01:21:39,155
She waited so long for some proof of them.

715
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,437
But they're not thieves like Hara said.

716
01:21:41,709 --> 01:21:43,023
They're just Borrowers.

717
01:21:43,043 --> 01:21:43,839
What?

718
01:21:44,896 --> 01:21:47,647
I mean, they must be very frightened.

719
01:21:49,907 --> 01:21:52,291
I just hope they're still here.

720
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,467
I hope so, too.

721
01:22:13,604 --> 01:22:15,329
Excuse me. Ma'am!

722
01:22:15,784 --> 01:22:17,851
Where would you like us to start looking?

723
01:22:26,438 --> 01:22:28,257
Oh, are you all right?

724
01:22:31,032 --> 01:22:32,758
Where did she go?

725
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:36,125
Who took my lady?

726
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:38,694
There are little people! There are!

727
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:40,081
Easy, easy.

728
01:22:40,378 --> 01:22:43,322
And, no, I'm not losing my mind!

729
01:22:58,369 --> 01:23:01,145
If I collapse, leave me behind.

730
01:23:01,784 --> 01:23:03,067
With my tea kettle.

731
01:23:03,248 --> 01:23:06,974
You're doing great. It's just a
little further until we break for food.

732
01:23:08,148 --> 01:23:09,769
Can't we just head back?

733
01:23:09,963 --> 01:23:13,109
We can live with the rats in the compost heap.

734
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:13,654
Shh!

735
01:23:14,088 --> 01:23:14,611
Oh!

736
01:23:14,635 --> 01:23:15,635
Oh, no!

737
01:23:28,538 --> 01:23:29,661
Let's hurry.

738
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:32,442
I can't do it.

739
01:23:58,971 --> 01:24:00,860
Arrietty, you really should eat something.

740
01:24:01,192 --> 01:24:03,435
We're gonna be walking at least until morning.

741
01:24:03,978 --> 01:24:04,769
What?

742
01:24:07,157 --> 01:24:08,429
I'm so sorry.

743
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:14,234
I feel like maybe it's all my fault that
we had to leave such a wonderful house.

744
01:24:18,407 --> 01:24:19,666
That's in the past.

745
01:24:21,262 --> 01:24:25,164
We'll make another wonderful
house, the three of us, together.

746
01:24:31,157 --> 01:24:32,660
I'm going outside for a bit.

747
01:24:33,863 --> 01:24:36,110
Arrietty, don't go too far.

748
01:24:37,514 --> 01:24:37,998
Mmm-hmm.

749
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,874
Niya.

750
01:26:23,648 --> 01:26:24,395
Niya.

751
01:26:31,623 --> 01:26:32,359
Huh.

752
01:26:43,668 --> 01:26:45,416
Just a little further.

753
01:27:07,534 --> 01:27:09,692
Ah! Spiller!

754
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:25,743
That's the last of it.

755
01:27:27,522 --> 01:27:29,575
Come on, we should keep moving.

756
01:27:29,723 --> 01:27:30,603
Okay.

757
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:37,409
Mother, are you all right?

758
01:27:49,927 --> 01:27:50,954
Arrietty!

759
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:52,606
Arrietty!

760
01:28:21,802 --> 01:28:22,802
Shawn.

761
01:28:26,822 --> 01:28:27,822
Arrietty.

762
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:46,251
We have to leave.

763
01:28:46,932 --> 01:28:49,316
But Spiller says there's more of us not too far from here.

764
01:28:49,339 --> 01:28:51,046
A two-day's journey, at most.

765
01:28:52,336 --> 01:28:54,026
He thinks it might be my mother's family.

766
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,285
You won't be the last of your kind.

767
01:28:56,339 --> 01:28:57,564
But how did you find me?

768
01:29:00,605 --> 01:29:02,289
Niya here showed me the way.

769
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,678
Thank you, Niya. Take care of him.

770
01:29:19,227 --> 01:29:20,909
I brought you something.

771
01:29:26,512 --> 01:29:29,771
Now think of it as a gift from one friend to another.

772
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:36,862
Thank you, Shawn.

773
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:52,890
Um, I have to go.

774
01:29:54,785 --> 01:29:56,159
When is your operation?

775
01:29:57,338 --> 01:30:00,061
Tomorrow. But I'm not scared.

776
01:30:00,405 --> 01:30:02,869
Because someone taught me how to be brave.

777
01:30:11,802 --> 01:30:13,213
So you'll remember me.

778
01:30:13,929 --> 01:30:14,447
Oh.

779
01:30:18,745 --> 01:30:20,252
How can I forget you?

780
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,148
You protected me after all.

781
01:30:31,488 --> 01:30:32,569
Arrietty.

782
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:38,519
I hope you have a happy life.

783
01:30:40,722 --> 01:30:41,722
Goodbye, Shawn.

784
01:30:46,484 --> 01:30:50,571
Arrietty, my heart is strong now because you're in it.

785
01:30:51,258 --> 01:30:52,595
And you always will be.

786
01:30:53,485 --> 01:30:54,223
Forever.

787
01:31:02,816 --> 01:31:04,284
I never saw her again.

788
01:31:06,074 --> 01:31:08,084
But the following summer I returned

789
01:31:08,441 --> 01:31:11,382
and was happy to hear the
people in the house down the road

790
01:31:11,436 --> 01:31:14,735
talking about how many things in their home had gone

791
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:16,517
missing.

792
01:31:16,602 --> 01:31:21,295
<i>I'm 14 years old, I am pretty.</i>

793
01:31:22,205 --> 01:31:27,493
<i>I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady.</i>

794
01:31:29,087 --> 01:31:32,264
<i>I live under the kitchen floor.</i>

795
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:40,057
<i>Right here, not so far from you.</i>

796
01:31:41,842 --> 01:31:47,790
<i>Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue.</i>

797
01:31:47,814 --> 01:31:52,041
<i>In my dreams, oh, I wish I could.</i>

798
01:31:52,065 --> 01:31:54,780
<i>Feel my hair blowing in the wind.</i>

799
01:31:54,796 --> 01:31:57,598
<i>See the sky and the summer rain.</i>

800
01:31:58,202 --> 01:32:02,534
<i>Pick a flower from the garden for you.</i>

801
01:32:03,496 --> 01:32:06,157
<i>Now I know there's another world.</i>

802
01:32:06,181 --> 01:32:09,359
<i>Butterflies floating in the air.</i>

803
01:32:09,613 --> 01:32:14,101
<i>There is someone out there for me.</i>

804
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,112
<i>Walking down, picket fence.</i>

805
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:00,112
<i>Run my hands along the edge.</i>

806
01:33:00,128 --> 01:33:03,353
<i>And music plays in my head.</i>

807
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:05,371
<i>Hear the song before I go to bed.</i>

808
01:33:05,387 --> 01:33:08,573
<i>When stars are bright outside my window.</i>

809
01:33:08,597 --> 01:33:11,215
<i>Wake up to tree boughs filled up with snow.</i>

810
01:33:11,231 --> 01:33:13,733
<i>And I remember Oh, I remember</i>

811
01:33:13,749 --> 01:33:15,971
<i>I remember my summer with you.</i>

812
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:18,722
<i>Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes.</i>

813
01:33:18,738 --> 01:33:22,193
<i>Rolled down windows Hold my hand, hold me close.</i>

814
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:25,794
<i>Pick up your phone Wanna hear your voice again.</i>

815
01:33:26,686 --> 01:33:29,981
<i>Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair</i>

816
01:33:29,997 --> 01:33:32,566
<i>I like you, I don't care.</i>

817
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:35,592
<i>Why did it have to end?</i>

818
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:40,112
<i>Summer love with my best friend</i>

819
01:33:40,136 --> 01:33:45,384
<i>I'd fly to you all the way across the states</i>

820
01:33:45,392 --> 01:33:49,912
<i>I'd fly to you hear me, the winter day.</i>

821
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:56,869
<i>Oh, I'd follow the sun and come right to your door.</i>

822
01:33:58,111 --> 01:34:00,491
<i>I remember my summer with you.</i>

823
01:34:00,655 --> 01:34:03,381
<i>Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes.</i>

824
01:34:03,397 --> 01:34:06,554
<i>Rolled down windows Hold my hand, hold me close.</i>

825
01:34:06,578 --> 01:34:10,392
<i>Pick up your phone wanna hear your voice again.</i>

826
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:14,325
