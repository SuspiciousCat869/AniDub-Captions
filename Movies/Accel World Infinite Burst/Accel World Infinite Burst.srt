1
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:42,685
Kuroyukihime: The year is 2046,

2
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:45,087
a world where people manage their daily lives

3
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,356
on the virtual network with a portable,

4
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,293
wearable device called the neuro-linker.

5
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:54,630
One day, Haruyuki, a boy who was constantly bullied,

6
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:56,799
received a program from Kuroyukihime,

7
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,168
the most popular girl in his school.

8
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,206
( over neuro-link ) What I'm about to do

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,577
is send you an application.

10
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,813
I'm sending it directly to your neuro-linker.

11
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:12,949
( Haruyuki gasps )

12
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,750
Kuroyukihime: This program made it possible

13
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,252
to reinvent one's reality.

14
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,988
â™ª

15
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:34,637
It was called \"Brain Burst.\"

16
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,350
Haruyuki: \"Welcome to...

17
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:49,552
the Accelerated World\"?

18
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:50,987
Kuroyukihime: \"Brain Burst\"

19
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,822
accelerated the brain's processing speed

20
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:56,359
one thousand times faster than normal.

21
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:58,160
( over neuro-link ) Now shout it!

22
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,729
Burst Link!

23
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:01,030
Haruyuki: B-B-Burst Link!

24
00:02:01,063 --> 00:02:02,765
Kuroyukihime, narrating: Or, to put it another way,

25
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:06,068
it made one second feel like one thousand.

26
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:06,936
( Avatar squeals )

27
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,537
Kuroyukihime: After learning the secret

28
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:09,905
of the Accelerated World,

29
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,377
the young boy vowed to fight by Kuroyukihime's side.

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,878
Want to accelerate?

31
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:18,881
Want to take this further, young man?

32
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,784
This, then, is the story of a boy

33
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:25,187
with the potential to become the fastest being ever.

34
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:31,360
Ash: I'm about ready to make you dance

35
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:33,529
to the beat of my bike!

36
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,532
Let's roll!

37
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:38,034
Kuroyukihime: In order to accelerate,

38
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:41,937
one must do battle with others and win Burst Points.

39
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,907
If a person loses all of their Burst Points,

40
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,743
\"Brain Burst\" will automatically uninstall itself

41
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,545
and can never be reinstalled.

42
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:51,213
Also, the person will lose

43
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:54,050
their memories of being a Burst Linker.

44
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,585
( Ash laughs )

45
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:58,721
Haruyuki: If this is just like the real world,

46
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:01,023
then that bike's gotta have a weak point.

47
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,024
( gasps )

48
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:07,696
- That's it. - ( Ash cackles )

49
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,899
Ready to dance some more?!

50
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:13,436
Haruyuki: Just this once, Silver Crow, move for me!

51
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,271
We gotta be faster than him!

52
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,311
Even if I can't believe in myself...

53
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,280
( yells )

54
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,582
Kuroyukihime: The key here is your heart.

55
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:27,817
It's what made that body.

56
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,785
You must believe in yourself, Haruyuki.

57
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,787
Ash: You really think a little shit stain like you

58
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,789
can stop a monster bike like this?

59
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,658
Haruyuki: I can at least believe

60
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,127
in everything she's said!

61
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,362
Almost there.

62
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:50,940
Okay, here I go!

63
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:55,377
- Avatars: Whoa! - ( Ash growls )

64
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,847
What the hell is this?!

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,182
Kuroyukihime: To continue to accelerate,

66
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:03,352
a person must win as many battles as possible.

67
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,189
Here's to your first victory.

68
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:10,126
At this rate, you'll reach Level Two in no time.

69
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,527
Haruyuki: Uh, yeah, thank you,

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,231
but I still have a lot to learn before getting that far.

71
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:18,267
Kuroyukihime: You do have a hard journey ahead of you.

72
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,236
Of the estimated 1,000 Burst Linkers

73
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,270
that are out there,

74
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,839
only a select few have ever made it to Level Four.

75
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:26,909
And if you run into a player from Level Seven or Eight,

76
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,878
it's safe to assume they're a Legion leader.

77
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,079
Haruyuki: W-What's a Legion?

78
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:32,148
Kuroyukihime: It's sort of like a team

79
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:34,717
that you would find in other online games.

80
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,952
It's just that here, we call them Legions.

81
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,156
Currently the Accelerated World has six major Legions

82
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,725
ruling over a number of different zones.

83
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:44,026
All these Legions are led

84
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,562
by Burst Linkers who have reached Level Nine.

85
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:48,063
Each has their own color--

86
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:50,799
blue, red, yellow, green, purple, and white.

87
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,736
They're known as the Six Kings of Pure Color.

88
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,271
Haruyuki: I've never heard of a game like this,

89
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:58,407
where only six people have ever reached the highest level.

90
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,441
Kuroyukihime: Not so fast.

91
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,911
I never said Level Nine was the highest level.

92
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,747
Haruyuki: Well, how many people are at Level Ten, then?

93
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,849
Kuroyukihime: \"Brain Burst 2039\" is something

94
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:09,185
people have been playing for seven years now,

95
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:11,220
ever since the program was anonymously released,

96
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,690
but due to the severe rules that come with the game,

97
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:16,091
no one has ever reached Level Ten.

98
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,994
Haruyuki: Is that because you have to fight all the time,

99
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,796
have, like, 10,000 wins or something?

100
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,364
Kuroyukihime: You only need five wins,

101
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:25,234
but those wins have to be against Level Nine opponents,

102
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:27,603
and if you lose just one of those fights,

103
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:28,837
you lose all your points,

104
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,841
and then the program automatically uninstalls.

105
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,845
Two years ago, all the young Kings

106
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,314
reached Level Nine at approximately the same time.

107
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,815
They soon received a system message

108
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:43,352
telling them the horrible rules in place for reaching Level Ten.

109
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,353
You would have expected

110
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,689
some sort of bloody power struggle to break out,

111
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,691
but instead the Kings chose

112
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,292
to remain at Level Nine indefinitely.

113
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:53,629
They called a truce and divided the Accelerated World

114
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,664
into realms each of them would rule.

115
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:56,999
The whole thing's a farce.

116
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,667
First they destroy countless Burst Linkers

117
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,238
to reach Level Nine, and then they create a truce? Why?

118
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:05,140
Haruyuki: So is that it? Is that what you're planning,

119
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:07,576
to challenge the Six Kings of Pure Color?

120
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,877
Kuroyukihime: No.

121
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,746
- I've already done that. - Haruyuki: What?

122
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,548
Kuroyukihime: There haven't always been six.

123
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,049
There used to be seven Kings,

124
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,752
and despite the fact that they were each essentially rivals,

125
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,721
there was also a strong bond between them.

126
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,556
But that changed two years ago.

127
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,925
One night, the Black King betrayed the others

128
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,760
and tried to hunt them all down.

129
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,195
Haruyuki: Who is this Black King?

130
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:27,796
Kuroyukihime: I'm the Black King,

131
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,832
otherwise known as Black Lotus.

132
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,034
I was the only one who rejected the truce

133
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:34,570
and instead argued that we should risk it all

134
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,305
and fight to the end.

135
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:38,340
( narrating ) Kuroyukihime was a wanted person

136
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:41,777
in the Accelerated World, but to her surprise, one day,

137
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,847
she was challenged to a duel while on the school's network,

138
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,116
( footsteps echoing )

139
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,585
She asked Haruyuki

140
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,921
to help her uncover the identity of Cyan Pile,

141
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,291
the blue Duel Avatar who was stalking her.

142
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:59,028
The prime suspect came as quite a shock...

143
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:07,603
Chiyuri Kurashima, Haruyuki's childhood friend.

144
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,737
Haruyuki: Uh...

145
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:10,139
- ( Chiyuri moans ) - Haruyuki: sorry.

146
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,045
( gasps )

147
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,249
Kuroyukihime: Believing his friend to be innocent,

148
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,484
Haruyuki cable linked with Chiyuri.

149
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,953
While searching through her neuro-linker's files,

150
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,257
he discovered something, a virus.

151
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:31,927
( Haruyuki gasps )

152
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,296
What was that lag about?

153
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,298
( beeping )

154
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:38,067
Hold on!

155
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:41,603
This is a back door program!

156
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:44,340
( rattling )

157
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,349
Both: Burst Link!

158
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:59,655
Kuroyukihime: Araya, the boy who was bullying Haruyuki,

159
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,490
tried to run him down.

160
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,791
After accelerating,

161
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:07,563
Kuroyukihime decided to confess her feelings to Haruyuki.

162
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:09,565
I suppose I deserve this.

163
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,968
It's punishment for toying with the lives of others

164
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,937
without caring how it affects them.

165
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,405
( Haruyuki crying ) Yeah, but...

166
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:18,440
Kuroyukihime: There's no reason to cry.

167
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:21,877
I have to say at least there's one positive thing

168
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,445
coming from all this.

169
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,214
Haruyuki: Like what?

170
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,516
Kuroyukihime: In a dire moment like this,

171
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,019
I think you might actually believe my final words.

172
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,622
At least, I hope so.

173
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:35,057
Haruyuki...

174
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,892
please know that I love you.

175
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:39,294
I've never felt this way about anyone,

176
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,864
and it's been very confusing for me.

177
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,566
I'm constantly thinking about you,

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,370
and these thoughts I have make me both happy and sad.

179
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,840
I guess that's just what being in love does to you.

180
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,943
Work hard. Get stronger and faster.

181
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:56,979
Climb your way to the top,

182
00:08:57,012 --> 00:09:00,115
and see the world from there in my place.

183
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,918
Haruyuki: No! Don't! You can't leave me like this!

184
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:06,054
I'm the one who's supposed to protect you,

185
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,757
but I haven't.

186
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,795
I haven't done anything for you.

187
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,596
â™ª

188
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,136
Kuroyukihime: It's okay.

189
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,472
I'm sure we'll meet again someday.

190
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,345
Haruyuki: No! Please don't do this!

191
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,313
Please!

192
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:36,385
- Stop! - ( crashing )

193
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:48,297
â™ª

194
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,233
Kuroyukihime: Kuroyukihime sacrificed herself

195
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:55,604
to save Haruyuki, and now she was in critical condition.

196
00:09:57,706 --> 00:10:00,209
Unconscious, she could not defend herself

197
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:02,444
against an attack by Cyan Pile.

198
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,981
Haruyuki: No. I won't let that happen.

199
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,716
I'll protect you.

200
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:08,984
( gasps )

201
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,486
Kuroyukihime: The next morning,

202
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,821
his best friend Takumu came to pay a visit.

203
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,122
Haruyuki: What? Taku?

204
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,691
Is he here visiting?

205
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:17,593
Taku!

206
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:20,329
Wait. Why is he here?

207
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,532
Takumu: Huh? ( chuckles )

208
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:25,467
( Haruyuki gasps )

209
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,938
Both: Burst link!

210
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,541
â™ª

211
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:39,781
Haruyuki: No way. That's Takumu?

212
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:41,483
He's Cyan Pile?!

213
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,419
So you're the one who installed a virus in Chiyu's neuro-linker,

214
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,989
spying on her, checking her memory and viewer apps

215
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,423
whenever you wanted!

216
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:51,426
Takumu: Weren't you poking around in her memory, too?

217
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,963
And you're not even her boyfriend!

218
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:57,900
But, hey, who gets chicks anyway?

219
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:59,334
You know, when I think about it,

220
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,137
Chi always did seem happier trying to take care of you

221
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,206
than she ever did going out with me.

222
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,742
It's always been like that, and I've hated it!

223
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,782
( Haruyuki yelps )

224
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,823
( gasping )

225
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:27,296
( gasps )

226
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,269
Takumu: This was inevitable, Haru.

227
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:40,375
Spiral Gravity Driver!

228
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:42,678
( Haruyuki yells )

229
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:57,092
Kuroyukihime: Takumu's Avatar, Cyan Pile, was Level Four.

230
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,596
At Level One, Silver Crow was no match.

231
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:06,068
Even so, Crow tried to protect Kuroyukihime,

232
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,102
and then...

233
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:09,705
Haruyuki: Senpai.

234
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:10,539
That's right.

235
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:12,874
Strength isn't just about winning.

236
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:16,278
Even if my attacks are ridiculous and pathetic,

237
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:18,246
even if I'm left lying in the mud

238
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,382
crushed and defeated,

239
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:23,585
as long as I don't quit, keep fighting,

240
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,854
keep looking up at the sky,

241
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,222
that's what really matters.

242
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:30,759
That's what true strength is!

243
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,596
Kuroyukihime: Silver Crow's true potential awakened.

244
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,802
Haruyuki: Are these wings?

245
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:44,906
Aah! It burns!

246
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,949
It's calling for me.

247
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,451
â™ª

248
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,433
Let's go. Hyah!

249
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,675
Takumu: Huh?

250
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,048
Kuroyukihime: His aviation ability

251
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,916
was the first of its kind.

252
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:31,119
Takumu: Take this!

253
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:34,756
Lightning Cyan Spike!

254
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:40,662
( Haruyuki yells )

255
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,300
Takumu: Haru!

256
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:48,870
Haruyuki: Taku!

257
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,605
Kuroyukihime: And I know that someday

258
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,642
the rest of the Accelerated World will know this as well,

259
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:56,078
that you are the fastest Linker to ever exist,

260
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:59,247
and by doing that, you will unlock the true potential

261
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:02,484
that lies deep within our minds and souls.

262
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:05,454
Haruyuki: I see it. I finally see it!

263
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,790
( Takumu gasps )

264
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:20,869
- ( armor clinks ) - ( Haruyuki gasps )

265
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,074
- ( gasps ) - Takumu: You win.

266
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:27,743
I'm sorry, Haru.

267
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,978
( Haruyuki gasps )

268
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:36,051
- ( Takumu gasps ) - ( sparks popping )

269
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,519
Haruyuki: In the real world,

270
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:39,521
you're better than me at everything,

271
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:42,290
but here, that isn't the case.

272
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:44,259
You can't beat me.

273
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,695
Now you and I are truly equals,

274
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:50,499
so stop trying to fight against me, and fight with me!

275
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,601
- Become my ally, Taku! - ( Takumu gasps )

276
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:55,470
Fight under her command, just like I do.

277
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,339
Come on. Will you do it?

278
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:59,407
Takumu: How can you still trust me?

279
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,309
I've betrayed everyone,

280
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,445
my Legion, \"Brain Burst.\"

281
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:07,015
I even betrayed the only two real friends I've had.

282
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,252
Haruyuki: That's why we need to tell Chiyu everything.

283
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,287
We'll tell her about \"Brain Burst,\"

284
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,321
about our fight.

285
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:14,589
We'll come clean.

286
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,992
We'll even tell her about all the feelings

287
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,594
you and I have kept buried all these years.

288
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:21,630
We can start fresh,

289
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:24,933
a chance to build our friendship all over again.

290
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,868
â™ª

291
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,543
( gasps )

292
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,713
( grunting )

293
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:46,955
Is that...

294
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,193
really you?

295
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:52,794
Senpai!

296
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:56,364
Oh, thank God.

297
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:57,599
I believed in you.

298
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:59,367
I knew you'd make it.

299
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:02,137
Kuroyukihime: You've taken so much damage.

300
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,638
Thank you, Haruyuki.

301
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,608
Haruyuki: Actually, the only reason I could do it

302
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:09,911
was because you told me to believe in myself.

303
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:12,214
Kuroyukihime: Look at this,

304
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:14,149
the real you. It's beautiful.

305
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,919
I'm glad to see my instincts were right about you all along.

306
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:21,389
Haruyuki, you're the one's who's going to change this world.

307
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,358
The time has come.

308
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:28,697
I must leave my peaceful cocoon and aim for the sky once again.

309
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:45,981
( Haruyuki gasps )

310
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:47,983
â™ª

311
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,563
Kuroyukihime: To all Burst Linkers

312
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:04,933
serving under the Six Kings, hear me!

313
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,434
I am Black Lotus,

314
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:09,404
the one who rebelled against your Kings's rule!

315
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,473
Me and my Legion, the Nega Nebulous,

316
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:15,810
have emerged from hiding to put an end to this ridiculous truce!

317
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:18,747
( narrating ) The news of Silver Crow's aviation ability,

318
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,749
along with the revival of Nega Nebulous,

319
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,885
spread quickly through the Accelerated World.

320
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,687
Then, three months later...

321
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,756
( aloud ) Listen carefully, Haruyuki.

322
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:31,459
The right to control a territory is decided every Saturday night

323
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:33,628
with a turf war between the Legions.

324
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:35,597
The Legions go against each other

325
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,332
with the same number of fighters,

326
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,566
regardless of their level.

327
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,101
To win, they must maintain

328
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:44,673
a winning percentage of 50% or higher.

329
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:47,842
Go on. We can take care of this.

330
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,412
( Takumu grunts ) We're counting on you, Haru!

331
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,514
Take 'em out with your usual attack!

332
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,849
Haruyuki: You got it!

333
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:57,686
Kuroyukihime: Nega Nebulous, now with Cyan Pile,

334
00:17:57,719 --> 00:18:00,622
secured the Suginami area around the school

335
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,257
with only three members,

336
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,960
but conquering further territories was difficult.

337
00:18:04,993 --> 00:18:08,730
Silver Crow's aviation ability, his biggest strength,

338
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:10,632
was vulnerable to long-range attacks,

339
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:13,134
keeping him from advancing past Level Four.

340
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:15,003
Haruyuki: Damn it!

341
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:18,340
Avatar: That move's gettin' a little old, don't you think?

342
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:20,075
Once people have seen it a few times

343
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:23,979
and figure out what it is, it makes you an easy target.

344
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:29,084
Haruyuki: Even so...

345
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:33,421
I have to try.

346
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,690
I want to get stronger!

347
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:39,594
Niko: Welcome home, brother.

348
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:41,162
Haruyuki: Wait. What?!

349
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:42,564
( gasps )

350
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,265
( Niko giggles )

351
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,267
â™ª

352
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:50,105
Haruyuki: She an angel?

353
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:51,639
( Niko giggles )

354
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,975
Haruyuki: Is this some kind of heavenly vision?

355
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,811
Kuroyukihime: Out of nowhere, a girl appeared

356
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,681
and claimed to be Haruyuki's distant cousin.

357
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,516
Niko: I hope you don't mind

358
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,851
that I used your kitchen without asking,

359
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,386
but I thought you might be hungry,

360
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,555
so I went and whipped up a batch of these for you.

361
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,657
Um, 'scuse me.

362
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,059
( Haruyuki gasping ) Ah, Crap!

363
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:13,828
Niko: Would you mind if I came in there and joined you?

364
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,296
Takumu: Okay, I'll get out now!

365
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,799
I'm sorry that you had to wait, but just give me a minute!

366
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:21,703
Niko: Look, we're cousins. It's really not a big deal.

367
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,904
Haruyuki: Uh, I don't know!

368
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:25,774
I kinda think that it is a big deal!

369
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:27,942
Huh?

370
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:31,679
Niko: But please don't stare at me like that.

371
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,248
It makes me uncomfortable.

372
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:46,027
( Haruyuki sighs )

373
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:46,961
Tomoko.

374
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,830
Niko: Yep, that's me. What is it?

375
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,131
Haruyuki: Okay, drop the act.

376
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:52,567
You're a new Burst Linker, aren't you?

377
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,701
- Niko: Huh? - Haruyuki: Look.

378
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,336
You've got tan marks on your neck.

379
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,005
( Niko gasps )

380
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:58,873
( sighs )

381
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:01,876
( Haruyuki gasps )

382
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,079
Niko: I can't believe you did all that digging around.

383
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:06,347
You are way too suspicious. You know that?

384
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:09,084
Enough of this crap.

385
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:12,854
You listen to what I have to say, and you listen good.

386
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:16,024
You've just insulted me, Scarlet Rain,

387
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:19,160
and because of that, I'm gonna make you pay!

388
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,396
( yelps )

389
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,199
( Haruyuki gasps ) Watch out!

390
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:36,811
( both gasping )

391
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,849
â™ª

392
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,885
( both screaming )

393
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:51,526
Niko: You're so dead.

394
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,694
( grunts )

395
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:54,362
Kuroyukihime: The girl was in fact

396
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:56,397
the Red King, Scarlet Rain.

397
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:59,767
She had figured out Haruyuki's identity in the real world

398
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,903
and broke into his home.

399
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:05,406
Haruyuki: Um, are you seriously the Red King?

400
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,407
( Niko chuckles )

401
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,879
â™ª

402
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:15,150
( Haruyuki gasps )

403
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:30,965
Niko: Hailstorm Domination!

404
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:43,144
Haruyuki: Here goes nothin'!

405
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:51,653
Silver Crow's All Or Nothing Kick!

406
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,824
( yelling )

407
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,192
( Niko chuckles )

408
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,329
( Haruyuki gasps )

409
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:13,341
( groaning )

410
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:16,077
( gasps )

411
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:18,580
Niko: Looks like I win.

412
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:19,714
Give up?

413
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:22,717
Haruyuki: Yeah. I surrender.

414
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,587
Niko: So will you listen to my request now?

415
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,988
Haruyuki: What request?

416
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:30,625
Niko: I want to meet your Legion master in real life,

417
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:33,494
the two of us in the flesh.

418
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:38,499
Kuroyukihime: So what is it

419
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,835
that made you want to meet Haruyuki that badly?

420
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:43,271
Had you perhaps, fallen in love with him?

421
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:46,007
- ( Niko gags ) Hell, no! - ( Haruyuki yelps )

422
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,743
Niko: I couldn't care less about this fatso.

423
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:51,012
What I want is his Avatar.

424
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:54,849
Silver Crow, I want to borrow your wings,

425
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:57,719
your ability to fly just once

426
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,688
so I can destroy the Armor of Catastrophe.

427
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:03,992
Haruyuki: Armor of Catastrophe?

428
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,330
â™ª

429
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:13,268
Kuroyukihime: What you're seeing is a VR movie

430
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:16,304
of a memory that I recorded 2 1/2 years ago.

431
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:20,708
The Armor of Catastrophe, also known as Chrome Disaster,

432
00:23:20,742 --> 00:23:23,811
seven years ago, it committed atrocities

433
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,313
with its devastating abilities.

434
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:28,583
The strongest Linkers at the time defeated it,

435
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,319
but they failed to destroy its Enhanced Armament.

436
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:34,789
Like a parasite, it possessed one of the Burst Linkers

437
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:36,758
and turned him into a bloodthirsty killer.

438
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,295
Then it possessed another and another.

439
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:41,329
This here...

440
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,301
was the fourth Chrome Disaster.

441
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:48,303
Niko: That thing looks absolutely nothing
