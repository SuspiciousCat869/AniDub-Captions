1
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:42,685
Kuroyukihime: The year is 2046,

2
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:45,087
a world where people manage their daily lives

3
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,356
on the virtual network with a portable,

4
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,293
wearable device called the neuro-linker.

5
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:54,630
One day, Haruyuki, a boy who was constantly bullied,

6
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:56,799
received a program from Kuroyukihime,

7
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,168
the most popular girl in his school.

8
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,206
( over neuro-link ) What I'm about to do

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,577
is send you an application.

10
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,813
I'm sending it directly to your neuro-linker.

11
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:12,949
( Haruyuki gasps )

12
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,750
Kuroyukihime: This program made it possible

13
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,252
to reinvent one's reality.

14
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,988
♪

15
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:34,637
It was called \"Brain Burst.\"

16
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,350
Haruyuki: \"Welcome to...

17
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:49,552
the Accelerated World\"?

18
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:50,987
Kuroyukihime: \"Brain Burst\"

19
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,822
accelerated the brain's processing speed

20
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:56,359
one thousand times faster than normal.

21
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:58,160
( over neuro-link ) Now shout it!

22
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,729
Burst Link!

23
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:01,030
Haruyuki: B-B-Burst Link!

24
00:02:01,063 --> 00:02:02,765
Kuroyukihime, narrating: Or, to put it another way,

25
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:06,068
it made one second feel like one thousand.

26
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:06,936
( Avatar squeals )

27
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,537
Kuroyukihime: After learning the secret

28
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:09,905
of the Accelerated World,

29
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,377
the young boy vowed to fight by Kuroyukihime's side.

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,878
Want to accelerate?

31
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:18,881
Want to take this further, young man?

32
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,784
This, then, is the story of a boy

33
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:25,187
with the potential to become the fastest being ever.

34
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:31,360
Ash: I'm about ready to make you dance

35
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:33,529
to the beat of my bike!

36
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,532
Let's roll!

37
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:38,034
Kuroyukihime: In order to accelerate,

38
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:41,937
one must do battle with others and win Burst Points.

39
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,907
If a person loses all of their Burst Points,

40
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,743
\"Brain Burst\" will automatically uninstall itself

41
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,545
and can never be reinstalled.

42
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:51,213
Also, the person will lose

43
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:54,050
their memories of being a Burst Linker.

44
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,585
( Ash laughs )

45
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:58,721
Haruyuki: If this is just like the real world,

46
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:01,023
then that bike's gotta have a weak point.

47
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,024
( gasps )

48
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:07,696
- That's it. - ( Ash cackles )

49
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,899
Ready to dance some more?!

50
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:13,436
Haruyuki: Just this once, Silver Crow, move for me!

51
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,271
We gotta be faster than him!

52
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,311
Even if I can't believe in myself...

53
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,280
( yells )

54
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,582
Kuroyukihime: The key here is your heart.

55
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:27,817
It's what made that body.

56
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,785
You must believe in yourself, Haruyuki.

57
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,787
Ash: You really think a little shit stain like you

58
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,789
can stop a monster bike like this?

59
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,658
Haruyuki: I can at least believe

60
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,127
in everything she's said!

61
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,362
Almost there.

62
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:50,940
Okay, here I go!

63
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:55,377
- Avatars: Whoa! - ( Ash growls )

64
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,847
What the hell is this?!

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,182
Kuroyukihime: To continue to accelerate,

66
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:03,352
a person must win as many battles as possible.

67
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,189
Here's to your first victory.

68
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:10,126
At this rate, you'll reach Level Two in no time.

69
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,527
Haruyuki: Uh, yeah, thank you,

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,231
but I still have a lot to learn before getting that far.

71
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:18,267
Kuroyukihime: You do have a hard journey ahead of you.

72
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,236
Of the estimated 1,000 Burst Linkers

73
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,270
that are out there,

74
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,839
only a select few have ever made it to Level Four.

75
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:26,909
And if you run into a player from Level Seven or Eight,

76
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,878
it's safe to assume they're a Legion leader.

77
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,079
Haruyuki: W-What's a Legion?

78
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:32,148
Kuroyukihime: It's sort of like a team

79
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:34,717
that you would find in other online games.

80
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,952
It's just that here, we call them Legions.

81
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,156
Currently the Accelerated World has six major Legions

82
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,725
ruling over a number of different zones.

83
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:44,026
All these Legions are led

84
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,562
by Burst Linkers who have reached Level Nine.

85
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:48,063
Each has their own color--

86
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:50,799
blue, red, yellow, green, purple, and white.

87
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,736
They're known as the Six Kings of Pure Color.

88
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,271
Haruyuki: I've never heard of a game like this,

89
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:58,407
where only six people have ever reached the highest level.

90
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,441
Kuroyukihime: Not so fast.

91
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,911
I never said Level Nine was the highest level.

92
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,747
Haruyuki: Well, how many people are at Level Ten, then?

93
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,849
Kuroyukihime: \"Brain Burst 2039\" is something

94
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:09,185
people have been playing for seven years now,

95
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:11,220
ever since the program was anonymously released,

96
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,690
but due to the severe rules that come with the game,

97
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:16,091
no one has ever reached Level Ten.

98
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,994
Haruyuki: Is that because you have to fight all the time,

99
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,796
have, like, 10,000 wins or something?

100
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,364
Kuroyukihime: You only need five wins,

101
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:25,234
but those wins have to be against Level Nine opponents,

102
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:27,603
and if you lose just one of those fights,

103
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:28,837
you lose all your points,

104
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,841
and then the program automatically uninstalls.

105
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,845
Two years ago, all the young Kings

106
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,314
reached Level Nine at approximately the same time.

107
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,815
They soon received a system message

108
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:43,352
telling them the horrible rules in place for reaching Level Ten.

109
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,353
You would have expected

110
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,689
some sort of bloody power struggle to break out,

111
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,691
but instead the Kings chose

112
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,292
to remain at Level Nine indefinitely.

113
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:53,629
They called a truce and divided the Accelerated World

114
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,664
into realms each of them would rule.

115
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:56,999
The whole thing's a farce.

116
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,667
First they destroy countless Burst Linkers

117
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,238
to reach Level Nine, and then they create a truce? Why?

118
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:05,140
Haruyuki: So is that it? Is that what you're planning,

119
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:07,576
to challenge the Six Kings of Pure Color?

120
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,877
Kuroyukihime: No.

121
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,746
- I've already done that. - Haruyuki: What?

122
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,548
Kuroyukihime: There haven't always been six.

123
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,049
There used to be seven Kings,

124
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,752
and despite the fact that they were each essentially rivals,

125
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,721
there was also a strong bond between them.

126
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,556
But that changed two years ago.

127
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,925
One night, the Black King betrayed the others

128
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,760
and tried to hunt them all down.

129
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,195
Haruyuki: Who is this Black King?

130
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:27,796
Kuroyukihime: I'm the Black King,

131
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,832
otherwise known as Black Lotus.

132
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,034
I was the only one who rejected the truce

133
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:34,570
and instead argued that we should risk it all

134
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,305
and fight to the end.

135
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:38,340
( narrating ) Kuroyukihime was a wanted person

136
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:41,777
in the Accelerated World, but to her surprise, one day,

137
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,847
she was challenged to a duel while on the school's network,

138
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,116
( footsteps echoing )

139
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,585
She asked Haruyuki

140
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,921
to help her uncover the identity of Cyan Pile,

141
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,291
the blue Duel Avatar who was stalking her.

142
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:59,028
The prime suspect came as quite a shock...

143
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:07,603
Chiyuri Kurashima, Haruyuki's childhood friend.

144
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,737
Haruyuki: Uh...

145
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:10,139
- ( Chiyuri moans ) - Haruyuki: sorry.

146
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,045
( gasps )

147
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,249
Kuroyukihime: Believing his friend to be innocent,

148
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,484
Haruyuki cable linked with Chiyuri.

149
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,953
While searching through her neuro-linker's files,

150
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,257
he discovered something, a virus.

151
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:31,927
( Haruyuki gasps )

152
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,296
What was that lag about?

153
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,298
( beeping )

154
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:38,067
Hold on!

155
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:41,603
This is a back door program!

156
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:44,340
( rattling )

157
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,349
Both: Burst Link!

158
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:59,655
Kuroyukihime: Araya, the boy who was bullying Haruyuki,

159
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,490
tried to run him down.

160
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,791
After accelerating,

161
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:07,563
Kuroyukihime decided to confess her feelings to Haruyuki.

162
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:09,565
I suppose I deserve this.

163
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,968
It's punishment for toying with the lives of others

164
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,937
without caring how it affects them.

165
