1
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,125
That was a great meal.

2
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,541
Why don't you come
with me to see

3
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,916
the Imperial Operetta Troupe?

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,916
Oh!

5
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,291
I wonder if grandpa
will come visit us?

6
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,125
Oh yes.

7
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,166
I couldn't agree with you more.

8
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,083
Mommy let's bring home a cake!

9
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:30,708
Yeah!

10
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,750
That sounds yummy!

11
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,500
Let's raise the curtains now.

12
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,375
Thank you very much for
attending this performance

13
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,583
held in our Great
Imperial Theater House.

14
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,000
We would like to express
our deep appreciation

15
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,791
for your patronage.

16
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,208
Great work, everyone!

17
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
We all did great work.

18
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,333
--Good job!
--Great work!

19
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:33,833
Thanks for your announcement.

20
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,916
Sure.

21
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,875
Wasn't that an
amazing audience, Leni?!

22
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,208
I couldn't believe it!

23
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,583
I know-the crowd was
especially wonderful today.

24
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,166
We should be grateful for
an audience such as that.

25
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,041
Yeah, you've got
that right Ms. Maria!

26
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,875
It was almost as if we were
one with the audience today!

27
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,875
It was so much fun wasn't it.

28
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:54,125
Well, it seems you all
did do a nice job today.

29
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,666
Are you feeling all right?!

30
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,375
It's a rare occasion for Ms.
Sumire to give us a compliment!

31
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,416
That's for sure!
Wow. What an honor.

32
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,333
I've got to admit it
feels good even though

33
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,875
I'm exhausted
from all the hard work.

34
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,958
Well you deserve it-You've
worked hard all year Orihime.

35
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,291
That's true you have - but
I think that Ms. Kanna

36
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,250
has worked the hardest
out of all of us!

37
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,833
Oh really?!

38
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,375
Well I don't recall Ms. Kanna
exerting herself particularly.

39
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,583
What?

40
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,291
You're the only one
who disagrees ya know.

41
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,958
This is our theatre.

42
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,208
This is where we, the members of
the Imperial Operetta Troupe;

43
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,500
"The Flower Division," come
together to give our sweat,

44
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,875
tears, and hopes all combined
into one, to shine brightly.

45
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,958
There's no place I'd rather be
than right here, right now.

46
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,833
That's what makes me happy.

47
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:37,666
Surprise!

48
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,041
Happy birthday to you, Leni!

49
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,708
Happy birthday Leni!

50
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,666
Congratulations -
you're 17 now, Leni.

51
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,875
That's true - Thank you.

52
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,750
Wait for me you guys -
I'll be right there!

53
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,083
Oh dear...

54
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,333
Don't leave me out!

55
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,458
Please! I'm coming right now!

56
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,541
Sorry about that -
Happy birthday Leni...

57
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,166
That's all right -
Thanks' Sakura.

58
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,416
I'll never understand how
you manage to be such a klutz.

59
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,708
I suppose you'll always have
the co-ordination of a Bafoon.

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,458
Ah, isn't the
Flower Division wonderful.

61
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,375
Hi there ladies.

62
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,458
Good work.

63
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,375
Merry Christmas
and Happy birthday Leni!

64
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,208
Captain Kayama.

65
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,625
I was just thinking...

66
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,125
...With the Flower Division
Captain Ichiro Oogami

67
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,666
being away in Paris and all,

68
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,958
I thought that I'd try
to cheer everyone up.

69
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,708
But Mr. Kayama-right now Maria
is our temporary captain!

70
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,500
Boy, it seems to me
like we were having

71
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,875
a whole lot more fun before
Mr. Kayama showed up.

72
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,958
Hey! C'mon now!
We can still have fun.

73
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,916
Let's live it up tonight!-Okay?

74
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,458
This doesn't look
as interesting.

75
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,333
That one looks better,
don't you think?

76
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,125
Oh, ' Sumire?

77
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,166
Is that you?

78
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,750
Oh, Ms. Maria!

79
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,625
Well, what a coincidence.

80
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,250
I'm surprised to see you
here ' Sumire -

81
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,708
I didn't know
you liked these films.

82
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,458
Well I just thought that
I should try and understand

83
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,208
more about the films
the common people see.

84
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,416
Would you care
to join me, Ms. Maria?

85
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,583
Eh?

86
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,916
A powerful friend has arrived
at the imperial capital Tokyo;

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,958
the United States of America.

88
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,291
Among the many corporations
to be found there,

89
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,625
the Douglas-Stewart
Corporation stands out

90
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,458
with its advanced science.

91
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,416
Mr. Brent Furlong, the young
president of Douglas-Stewart,

92
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,750
is a man passionate
about charity work.

93
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,250
Amazed at the rapid pace
of our nation's recovery

94
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,375
and the strong work
ethic of her people...

95
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,875
Excuse me, Ms. Maria?

96
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,916
Is something bothering you?

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,875
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,166
It's nothing, really.

99
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,833
Oh-all right then.

100
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,416
Uh, Thank you
for coming, Ma'am!

101
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,833
Excuse me.

102
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,625
Do either of you speak English?

103
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,500
Uh, sorry I'm not
very good with English.

104
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,416
Ms. Sakura!

105
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,666
What?

106
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,833
Oh, I'm not very good
with English either...

107
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,708
How are-you?

108
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,875
Did I get it wrong?

109
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,041
Let's see...

110
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,291
Nice-to-meet you!

111
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,541
Hmm?

112
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,208
What are you trying to say?

113
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,291
You are not making
any sense ' at all.

114
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,375
Will you please
stop wasting my time!

115
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,375
Uh, My name is Sakura!

116
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,208
Sakura is a cherry!

117
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,375
Um cherry...

118
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,333
Ms. Sakura, you're
not making any sense.

119
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,708
Please calm down...!

120
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,625
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,583
I was just playing.

122
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,666
Huh?

123
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,583
Where can I find
the owner Mr. Yoneda?

124
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,875
Mr. Yoneda...?

125
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,666
The manager...?

126
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,125
I see, so the Elders Institute
has finally decided to setup

127
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,375
a Fighting Troupe
even in America.

128
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,666
Yes-Sir.

129
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,375
Following in the footsteps
of Tokyo and Paris,

130
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,125
the Third City
Defense Program will be

131
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,250
the New York Fighting Troupe.

132
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,833
Really?

133
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,541
So, why did you decide to come
all the way out here to Tokyo?

134
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,041
Tokyo has defended itself
against two Invasions

135
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,458
by the demons ' and Paris
has just repelled the Parisy.

136
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,125
To learn from these successes,
it would seem more efficient

137
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,375
if I actually worked in the
field with them rather then

138
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,625
study them from afar.

139
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,958
Efficient...

140
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,416
eh?

141
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,250
As of today,
I have been assigned

142
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,708
to the Imperial Fighting
Troupe, Flower Division.

143
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,666
Lachette Altair
reporting for duty, Sir.

144
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,541
I look forward
to serving under you.

145
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,791
So I suppose you
already got permission

146
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,166
from the Elders Institute
to do this, eh?

147
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,375
And if I'm not mistaken, ah...

148
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,250
...You probably brought your own
Eisenkleid to Japan, didn't you?

149
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,375
Where is it?

150
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,208
We'll have to go
pick it up right away.

151
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,875
That's not a problem, Sir.

152
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,000
I brought it with me
on the truck.

153
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,708
I should have known.

154
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,041
As always you've got
it all worked out.

155
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,333
I merely chose the most
efficient course of action, Sir.

156
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,583
Well, well.

157
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,208
What to do now...

158
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,791
She was against the break up.

159
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,125
She wanted the Star Division
to stay together.

160
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,458
She more than anyone else
took pride in her role

161
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,833
as a guardian of the people
against the darkness.

162
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,166
I understand.

163
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,458
But however exceptional
their skills and abilities

164
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,500
were as a unit they
were still too fragile.

165
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,125
We'll see if Lachette
has come to realize

166
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,875
the reason why the Star
Division was broken up or not.

167
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,000
Our imperial capital,
Tokyo, is enjoying

168
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,791
great prosperity at the moment.

169
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,416
What are you
worried about then?

170
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,958
Have we not rushed to improve
the city's infrastructure

171
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,791
at the expense of her defenses.

172
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,708
You're needlessly raising
a cause for alarm.

173
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,541
What exactly do you think
we've come here to address?

174
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,208
Our imperial capital
is open in four directions,

175
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,875
connecting us to
other areas via waterways.

176
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,375
This geographic advantage
has brought the prosperity

177
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,875
we enjoy today, but we
may have also brought in

178
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,750
diseased elements
in the process.

179
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,541
Are you talking about America?

180
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,625
Even if that was the case,
the capital can certainly rely

181
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,250
on the Imperial Fighting
Troupe for its defense.

182
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,166
Do you think it's wise
to be completely dependent

183
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,583
on those young girls?

184
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,916
No doubt there are issues
that must be addressed,

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,416
but these are rather trivial.

186
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,208
We needn't look further than
our capital and Paris to see

187
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,083
that the Fighting Troupe
program is a success.

188
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,791
Our nation needs a capital
city, and a city needs

189
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,000
to be open to the free
movement of the people

190
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,250
for it to be
prosperous and thrive.

191
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,041
It is unavoidable for the
bright lights of prosperity

192
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,916
to create and give rise
to the shadows of darkness.

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,333
We must be prepared to accept
this and learn to live with it.

194
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,875
And I trust ' that
all of you understand.

195
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,416
What might be the opinion of
the government on this issue,

196
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,250
Mr. Tanuma?

197
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,000
Well it appears...

198
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,583
...That for this city
to develop further

199
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,208
as an occult stronghold,
clearly our existing spiritual

200
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,416
quarantine measures will likely
offer inadequate protection.

201
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
Therefore, there really is
nothing else we know of

202
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,000
that can replace the Fighting
Troupe Flower Division

203
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,000
at this time.

204
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,208
However in the spirit of
being constantly mindful

205
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,916
of our surroundings, I believe
we should not shy away

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,750
from infusing new blood
to meet different challenges

207
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,416
as the need arises.

208
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,666
Yes, I dare say darkness
will come upon us again.

209
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,166
But if this city should
fall, that would mean

210
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,375
the entire nation would succumb
to the onslaught of darkness.

211
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,500
That must never happen!

212
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,833
A real cute face
from America, huh?

213
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,541
There you are Ms. Sakura.

214
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,041
Oh, thank you very much.

215
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,166
So tell us Ms. Sakura
is this new girl from America

216
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,000
really as beautiful
as they say?

217
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,958
Actually she's speaking
with Mr. Yoneda right now.

218
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,208
When she comes by
you can see for yourself.

219
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,375
But I'm interested in hearing
what you thought about her

220
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,875
- What was your
first impression?

221
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,250
Why do you wanna know that?

222
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,125
It usually takes more
than one pair of eyes

223
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,291
to get a true
understanding of something.

224
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,583
Now I don't know how
much of a beauty she is

225
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,416
but we've all gotta see her
with our own eyes

226
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,833
to get to the
"heart of the matter."

227
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,708
Oh really - Is that so?

228
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,791
Ah!

229
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,916
Here comes that
"heart of the matter" now!

230
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,916
How embarrassing.

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,916
She must've heard
every word we said.

232
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,833
Well you know they say that
"curiosity killed the cat."

233
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,791
Where'd you hear that?

234
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,458
It's just a Western saying.

235
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,291
Oh I see so now you're trying
to act like an America.

236
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,041
No I'm not!

237
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,791
Ms. Sakura!

238
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,125
Wow, you weren't kidding!

239
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,541
She's a real beauty all right!

240
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,916
Told you.

241
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,666
I know what you mean, Sir.

242
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,500
This country is
in need of a true king.

243
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,833
Rationalism demands that the
world be united under one will.

244
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,875
We must teach them that.

245
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,916
I knew you were going
to say that, Sir.

246
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,166
Beautiful.

247
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,458
Descending Demons have
appeared in Zaimoku-Chou.

248
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,083
The number confirmed
so far is 13.

249
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,000
A fire has broken out,
but the Moon Division

250
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,541
is currently at work
putting it out.

251
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,750
Fire can spread quickly
this season, so be mindful

252
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,083
of the surrounding
houses during combat.

253
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:52,958
Yes, Sir!

254
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,375
Right.

255
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,500
Imperial Fighting Troupe,
Flower Division move out!

256
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,708
Yes-Sir!

257
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,250
Deputy Commander -
we've just completed

258
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,875
calculating the
path to the scene.

259
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,250
Put it up on the screen.

260
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,583
Gourai-Go's preparations?

261
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,541
It'll be complete
in 60 seconds.

262
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,208
Flower Division members
have starting boarding

263
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,666
into their Koubu Kai's.

264
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,875
Ignition complete.

265
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,041
Yours truly
ready for dispatch.

266
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,291
Maria Tachibana,
ready for dispatch.

267
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,291
Sakura unit ignition complete.

268
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,291
Koubu Kai's ignition
is... complete.

269
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,083
Right, begin loading!

270
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,333
Begin loading.

271
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,416
Moving engine into position.

272
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,166
Rotation complete!

273
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,500
All levels are green.
We're ready to go.

274
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,666
Descent complete.

275
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,166
Moving Gourai -
Go into launch position.

276
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,208
Just cleared Asakusa Station!

277
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,541
Don't let your guard down!

278
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,750
Yes, Ma'am!

279
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,458
Ah!!

280
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,583
Leni!

281
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,750
Lachette!!

282
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,750
Stop fighting on your own!

283
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,625
Don't forget
we fight as a team!

284
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,750
Understood?!

285
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,333
What is that?

286
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,208
Is it a friend or an enemy?

287
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,166
What could that have been?

288
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,041
What the hell's going on?

289
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,458
What is that?

290
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,000
I dare say,
what could they be?

291
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,958
Heh, How the hell
are we supposed to find out?

292
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,208
We were all
quite surprised, Sir.

293
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:47,166
A humanoid steam unit
of unknown origin?

294
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,083
Yes, Sir.

295
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,250
Hm...

296
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,708
Well, I suppose
that it has all started...

297
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,625
What do you mean, Sir.

298
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,166
Well ' you know that
in a capitalist nation

299
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,250
freedom means the
freedom to compete.

300
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,416
Huh?

301
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,958
I just hope this won't get
too complicated.

302
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,666
Uh Sir I'd like to talk to you
about the new company member.

303
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,625
Huh?

304
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,708
Lachette?
And what about her?

305
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,208
Sounds like this is
going to get complicated.

306
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,375
Who the hell is this?!

307
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,916
Lachette Altair...

308
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,625
She used to be our
captain ' when we were

309
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:29,958
in the Star Division.

310
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:30,666
What?

311
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,041
You know this person?

312
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,041
I see, then what is
she doing here?

313
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,000
I have no idea.

314
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,125
Lachette!

315
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,375
Hi, Orihime.

316
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:44,000
It's been a long time!

317
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,041
You two have already met?

318
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,125
Lachette, it's been so long!

319
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,125
It certainly has, Orihime.

320
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,916
You're looking well.

321
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,291
Oh!-And...

322
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:57,083
You too, Leni...

323
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,958
What are you doing here?

324
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:13,666
Leni!

325
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,750
Wait for me Leni!

326
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,583
Hmm...

327
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:21,416
Well it looks like Leni is
still uncomfortable around you.

328
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,916
Since we'll all be members
of Flower Division

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,083
this will be a problem...

330
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,250
Is that so?!

331
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,000
I am Lachette Altair.

332
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,750
I hope that we will
all work well together.

333
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:38,416
And so it has been decided
that this unit will be leased

334
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,666
to the Army along with technical
advisors from Douglas-Stewart.

335
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,458
While we are still
in the trial stages...

336
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,375
...I'm certain they'll
be adopted into service

337
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,708
within a year.

338
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,041
Once that happens...

339
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,625
... There will be no need
for the Flower Division

340
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,916
And, we will no longer have
to expose young girls

341
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,750
to unnecessary dangers.

342
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,833
Will we, Count Hanakouji?

343
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,916
Mr. Tanuma, if you
have something to say

344
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,333
I'd appreciate it if
you'd say it directly!

345
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,500
My apologies, Sir.

346
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,041
I was simply trying to point
out the winds of change

347
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,958
to my senior
officer - that's all.

348
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,583
What is new to us now will
eventually become obsolete.

349
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:19,416
While this latest demonstration
was typically American

350
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,875
in its recklessness...

351
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:23,291
I believe now you know just
how capable the unmanned,

352
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,833
low-cost humanoid steam
unit "Yafqiel" is.

353
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:28,208
What grandstanding!

354
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,875
You knew of this beforehand
didn't you Tanuma?!

355
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,791
But of course, Sir!

356
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:36,541
Only a fool would show his hand
before all the cards were dealt.

357
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,875
Are you implying that you treat
governance the same as gambling?

358
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,458
No my dear Count,
the analogy is often made

359
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,625
that life is one big gamble.

360
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,583
Is it not more important
that the government take

361
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:50,541
proper action than worry about
how it words these actions?

362
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,791
My how Leni
has certainly changed...

363
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,083
A defect.

364
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,208
Please, wait a minute.

365
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,541
This will never do!

366
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,416
If they find out...

367
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,375
Please refrain from
such imprudent statements.

368
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,375
Or else our amicable
relationship will

369
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:25,208
have to be terminated
right here.

370
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,833
Is that what you want Tanuma?

371
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,083
You and I are not equal
partners in this endeavor.

372
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,083
You'd do well
to remember that.

373
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:04,500
Make way!

374
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:05,208
Watch out!

375
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,041
Comin' through!!

376
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,750
Move it!-Step aside!

377
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,625
That's wonderful Ms. Kanna!

378
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:12,916
Faster please-Faster!

379
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,625
No problem-leave it to me!

380
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,916
Hii-ya!!

381
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,791
Kasumi is it all right
if we look inside

382
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,500
some of the stores here?

383
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:33,625
Not yet Iris, but we can after
we go and pray in the shrine.

384
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,791
Aww. That's boring!

385
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:44,125
The texture
of this is reminiscent

386
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,875
of the Italian dish, gnocchi.

387
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,750
Gnocchi?

388
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,500
Well that's a funny name.

389
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:49,541
Really?

390
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,250
I think the Japanese
names for foods

391
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,750
are even stranger
sounding than that.

392
00:32:53,833 --> 00:33:00,250
Yuba ganmodoki tokoroten
kiritannpo kinchaku...

393
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,666
Hmph

394
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,708
And these are miso
rice cake balls,

395
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,250
but where is all
the miso sauce?!

396
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,916
It's mitarashi, not miso!

397
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:15,083
And how on Earth is someone
supposed to eat the last one?!!

398
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,541
Aah...

399
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,416
Aah...

400
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,625
Thank you!

401
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,958
And now our master juggler
will add two more!

402
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,208
And another one!

403
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,333
Oh!

404
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,166
Hey! What the hell is this?!

405
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,875
Your wishes will not be
granted-Your health may suffer.

406
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,416
Lost possessions
will not return...

407
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,208
Romance and
relationships will sour!

408
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,750
What's the big idea here?!

409
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,916
What have I done in my
short life to deserve this?!!

410
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,750
Don't let it bother you, Kouran.

411
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,875
If your fortune
is really all that bad -

412
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,708
then that means that
it can't get any worse.

413
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:59,541
What about yours?
- Let's see what it says.

414
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:01,208
Your prediction
for luck looks fair

415
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,041
but it's not very interesting.

416
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,375
All the same - you seem
pretty happy about it.

417
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,291
Ah-ha!

418
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,458
This must be why!

419
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,875
The one you await
will soon return!

420
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,875
I wonder who that could be?

421
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,125
I have no idea!

422
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,208
Oh really?-I don't know...

423
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,875
I was thinking
it might be Mr. Oo...

424
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,416
Come on, now!

425
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,000
We should be more concerned
about our new stage production.

426
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,708
Right?

427
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:24,875
I suppose.

428
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,916
But I'm stuck with
a bit part in the play.

429
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,500
You've only got a bit part?

430
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:33,416
Yeah And I've always liked the
author Kyouka's Izumi's work.

431
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,250
Did Lachette really
get the starring role

432
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,500
even though she just joined us?

433
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:37,375
Yes-it's true.

434
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,166
Won't it be exciting to see?!

435
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,583
Okay everyone let's
do the next scene!

436
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,916
Now remember...

437
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,541
This is the Dragon King's
Palace, and the prince

438
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,750
has bought the girl he loves
with a gift of treasure

439
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,916
for her father.
The exchange is agreed to,

440
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,708
and he's waiting
for the girl to come.

441
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,208
Hear me, Souzu.

442
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes.

443
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,500
What is it, young master.

444
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,875
I wonder if they are
satisfied with the treasure

445
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:00,375
that I sent to them in
exchange for their daughter.

446
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,791
Do you think
it will please them?

447
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,166
Yes, master.

448
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,916
They would not have sent
their daughter if they were

449
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,291
not happy with the generous
gift you have given to them.

450
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:11,583
Avarice truly runs
deep in all humans.

451
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,000
But the dear maiden
that has won the affection

452
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,916
of our young master
will enjoy true happiness.

453
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,125
I do so wish for
the fair maiden to arrive soon.

454
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,083
Hmm?

455
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,250
Alas!

456
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,416
The bright beacon
of light has arrived!

457
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
It appears that she is here!

458
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,916
Are you alright Lachette?!

459
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,708
No problem-I'm fine!

460
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,750
Aah!

461
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,291
How can we fight like this!

462
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,166
Everyone alright?!

463
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:35,875
What do you think you're doing!

464
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,041
C'mon, fix me up!

465
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,958
Just a little more.

466
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,583
Oh no-are we gonna have
to rely on the Yafqiels?

467
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,083
Watch out!
They're focusing on Leni!

468
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,833
Leni!

469
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,291
No it's too late!

470
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,750
Leni!

471
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,666
To hell with this!

472
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,041
Ms. Orihime!

473
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,416
Two Koubu Kai units
of Flower Division

474
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,083
suffered major damage
in the last engagement.

475
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,916
And one of the members
was seriously injured.

476
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,416
The severely damaged Koubu Kai
units have been transported

477
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
to the Kanzaki Heavy Industry
factory for repairs.

478
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,958
For the duration of the
repairs, we plan on making do

479
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,125
with two Eisenkleider's that
were previously mothballed.

480
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,291
Next regarding the status
of the Imperial Army

481
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,375
13th Special
Mechanized Squad...

482
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:21,416
...5 Yafqiels were dispatched
and suffered no damage.

483
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,833
Their Descending Demons
kill score appears to be

484
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,333
significantly larger than
that of Flower Division.

485
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:30,125
It would appear that
times have indeed changed.

486
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:33,875
If I may be permitted to,
I would like to make a request.

487
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,541
Actually This is
a very simple matter.

488
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,708
A command of a Yafqiel unit?

489
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:41,041
But this makes no sense!

490
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,041
Why should we have
to do something like that?

491
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:46,083
The military is a place where
you must always follow orders

492
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,833
that come from your superiors.

493
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,083
Of-course, ' But deploying
the Yafqiels' like this

494
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,916
is extremely suspicious!

495
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,708
I've been informed
that their deployment

496
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,416
is top secret and classified.

497
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,375
Then what are we?
Window-dressing?

498
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:01,041
Military officers will
be doing the commanding!

499
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,916
This is hardly
window-dressing!

500
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,750
But this is like a de facto
break up of Flower Division!

501
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,750
Even though we've been
relieved of intercepting

502
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,125
the Descending Demons, it
doesn't mean Flower Division

503
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,541
is going to be broken up.

504
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,208
If this is their final word
I'll go to the Army.

505
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,833
Oh really and just who
do you think you are?!

506
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,666
In listening to
Lt. General Yoneda I feel that

507
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,666
I would be the most appropriate
candidate for such a mission.

508
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,750
Hmm...

509
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,291
Well-I suppose
that Lachette would...

510
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:29,458
I'm the one who should go!

511
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:30,500
I want to go!

512
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,083
I am GOING!!

513
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,708
All right-all right, fine!

514
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,958
If you want it that
much-then fine by me!

515
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,000
You can go to
the Army-all right?!

516
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,541
Hmph!

517
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,291
Our next challenge,
is to figure out how

518
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,958
to put together a production
in this state...

519
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Hm?

520
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:02,958
What!

521
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,250
Ugaah!

522
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,375
Commander Yoneda is missing?!

523
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,291
Commander Yoneda is missing?!

524
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,583
Commander Yoneda is missing?!

525
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,666
Both Moon Division
and Dream Division

526
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,833
are currently doing
their best to locate him.

527
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:19,083
Actually, Lt. General Yoneda
isn't the only one missing.

528
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:22,541
Count Hanakouji
is missing as well.

529
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:25,458
I'm afraid I have
another piece of bad news.

530
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,541
The operation of the
Imperial Operetta Troupe

531
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,541
has been indefinitely
suspended.

532
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,875
Suspended?!

533
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,750
We are to relocate to the
Flower Mansion Branch

534
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:33,958
right away.

535
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,500
The Imperial Theater
complex will be under

536
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,208
the command of the Army.

537
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:38,041
That can't be...

538
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,708
Oh no...

539
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,250
The Yafqiels squad
has requested dispatch

540
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,083
of their commanding officer.

541
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,375
I'll go right now.

542
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,083
Orihime...

543
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,708
Make us proud as
a former member

544
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,833
of the Star Division, Orihime.

545
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,166
This has nothing to do
with Star Division.

546
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,583
Right now, I am
a member of Flower Division.

547
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,916
Everyone prepare
to pack your belongings.

548
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,916
We will head out to the
Flower Mansion in one hour.

549
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,458
Ms. Orihime...

550
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,875
Ms. Orihime, disembark from
the Gourai-Go at Nihonbashi,

551
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,541
and head to Fukagawa
from there on land.

552
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,291
Roger that.

553
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:25,875
Orihime...

554
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,083
As a proud member
of the Flower Division

555
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,000
I am ready for the challenge.

556
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,750
'N' that's why...

557
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,458
I refuse to allow Lachette
to try and out do me again!

558
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,333
It's amazing how well
these things are able

559
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,291
to move on their own.

560
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,291
Where are the
Descending Demons?!

561
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,166
There you go!

562
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,958
There you go birdies!

563
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,625
Catch-it! 

564
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,375
There you go! You got it!

565
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,250
Here!

566
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,666
I wonder how Orihime is?

567
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,500
I hope she's managing well.

568
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,708
Yes I know.

569
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,041
I'm sorry to say but
information no longer

570
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,125
comes my way.

571
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,750
Oh. I see...

572
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:19,833
I wonder if we'll ever be able
to ride the Koubu's again.

573
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:22,875
If it means that the
peace of Tokyo is secure

574
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:26,000
then there's nothing
wrong with that.

575
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,375
But what if...

576
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,208
What if the Flower Divsion
were to be disbanded...

577
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,083
All the Yafqiels on
this production line

578
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,666
are empty shells...

579
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,458
Where'er the insides?

580
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,041
Ah!!

581
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:20,541
This is what's
inside the Yafqiels?

582
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,375
The demons?

583
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,583
Oh no what have they done?!

584
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,791
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Maria.

585
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,000
How flattering.

586
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,583
Are you one of my fans?

587
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,708
My name is Patrick.

588
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,375
As you are about to die,
I thought I should

589
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,125
reveal my real name to you.

590
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,500
You have learned too much!!

591
00:42:56,958 --> 00:43:01,833
Unfortunately for you,
bullets have no effect on me.

592
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,250
Maria did what?!

593
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,125
I heard she left behind
a note saying she was

594
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,208
going to investigate
Douglas-Stewart.

595
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,000
They say, no one's
heard from her since.

596
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,541
Let's go look for her!

597
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:28,583
Yes! We should act recklessly.

598
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,416
Huh?!

599
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,708
But, I don't know...

600
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,916
There's no need
to worry about Ms. Maria.

601
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,583
She knows what she's doing -
After all she's our captain.

602
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:38,500
I know but does that mean
we're supposed to just

603
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,833
sit here and do
nothing at all?!

604
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,541
I never did
give this to her...

605
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,708
I made this special bullet
filled with spirit power...

606
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,208
I only managed to get
one round to Mr. Kayama...

607
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,333
Gotta do what you can
while you can or,

608
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,541
you might end up regretting it.

609
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,708
What can we do I ask you?!

610
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,458
Shougei-Maru has been sealed...

611
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:05,583
Wind Division and the Deputy
Commander are being held

612
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,833
at the Imperial Theater House.

613
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,083
What can we do
in such a predicament?!

614
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,916
Hey. I know - Why not?

615
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,125
Hm?

616
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,958
Do what we can while we can!

617
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,875
I don't want to live
with regrets in my heart.

618
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,041
Come on.
Let's do this together!

619
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,000
Let's do it!

620
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:28,875
Let's do it!

621
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,000
Let's go for it!

622
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:30,833
I'm with you!

623
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:32,333
I suppose that we must.

624
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:33,791
I agree!

625
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,875
Mr. Yokihiko from
the Rose Division!

626
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,833
This entire affair seems to
involve a segment of the Army

627
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:40,333
that has been
incited into action

628
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,833
by a particular
politician named Tanuma.

629
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,708
It appears that
Douglas-Stewart and Tanuma

630
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:46,708
have been scheming together.

631
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:49,125
Moon Division is searching
for Commander Yoneda

632
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,250
and Count Hanakouji.

633
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:54,708
Let's go to
the Great Imperial Theater!

634
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:57,125
We'll use the underground
waterways to go from Hibiya

635
00:44:57,208 --> 00:45:01,041
to the HQ hangers, and get
your Koubu Kai's there.

636
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,541
We have underground waterways?

637
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:05,083
Yes!

638
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,958
We had them made when we were
building the subway system.

639
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,708
But how are we supposed to get
around all of those waterways?

640
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,125
Ha ha ha.

641
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:13,791
No problem at all.

642
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:15,708
I designed and created
a secret machine

643
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,250
for urgent cases like this...

644
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,500
...It's called Katsuryu-Maru!

645
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:27,750
Hey Kouran what's with all those
machines you've got on board?

646
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,375
Oh those are just the upgrade
components that I designed

647
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,750
for the Eisenkleider
and the Koubu Kai's!

648
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,791
Just wait
'til you see the rest!

649
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:46,375
Quite a picturesque
cityscape at dusk, isn't it?

650
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,916
But of course it
pales in comparison

651
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,750
to the city of New York.

652
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:58,083
And what exactly is it
you brought us here to see?

653
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:21,666
You continue to market
these things-now?

654
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,125
Hmph.

655
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,125
Good-God may
heaven help us...

656
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:53,166
An impressive sight
isn't it Count?

657
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,916
So this is where it leads to.

658
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,041
We'll have better mobility
if we all split up.

659
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,250
Yeah you're right!

660
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,333
All clear!

661
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:19,666
Hey! Halt there!

662
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:21,958
Sakura!

663
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,041
Damn

664
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:37,375
No!

665
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,833
No!!!

666
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,791
Don't you think
you're going too far...

667
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,041
Ms. Lachette.

668
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:45,916
Really?

669
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,500
Didn't I make myself clear?

670
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:51,250
I simply prefer adopting
the most efficient option.

671
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:54,541
Nevertheless I think it's time
to return to our Koubu's.

672
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,208
Identify yourself!

673
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,375
Flower Division.

674
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,583
We've come here
to take back our theater.

675
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,541
Kanna...

676
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:05,208
Stand down!

677
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,625
You're out of line young lady.

678
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:08,708
You've been ordered to standby
at the Flower Mansion!

679
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,541
Hmph!

680
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:10,916
I don't think I can do that.

681
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,041
If I stayed there any longer
I'd go nuts from Sumire

682
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:14,125
and her hysterics.

683
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:14,875
Huh? Ms. Kanna?!

684
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,000
Enough of this nonsense!

685
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,416
Don't you respect orders?!

686
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,625
Of course!

687
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,333
We'll obey any order
as long as it's designed

688
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:22,000
to safeguard Tokyo.

689
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:25,416
You tell me how cozying up to
Douglas-Stewart is gonna help.

690
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,166
You think that's gonna
make this city any safer?!

691
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,375
Deputy Commander...

692
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:35,750
Ever since
Commander Yoneda has been gone

693
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:39,458
I guess I lost my nerve
without realizing.

694
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,625
Shame on me.

695
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:42,083
In times like this
I suppose I should be

696
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:43,833
the one standing strong.

697
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:46,666
You all taught me a very
valuable lesson today.

698
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,875
Let's do it, Deputy Commander!

699
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,041
I'll start upgrading
the Koubu Kai's.

700
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,291
There's a whole lot
we gotta do here guys

701
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:56,000
so any extra help
would be great!

702
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:59,791
Fighting Troupe Flower Division
prepare for dispatch!

703
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,500
What is it that
you hope to accomplish?

704
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,916
It appears that the fair
maidens of the Flower Division

705
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,791
intend to defy us
no matter what happens.

706
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:15,500
I believe some discipline
is in order here...

707
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,458
Wouldn't you agree?

708
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,875
Or what if we were to
propose being entrusted

709
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,041
to safeguard Tokyo?

710
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:27,000
Would you be willing
to accept such a proposition?

711
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,875
We're not in need
of your assistance.

712
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:32,000
We shall guard
our imperial capital alone!

713
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,708
Listen to me.

714
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,791
Do you have any idea what
it is that those brave girls

715
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,083
are fighting for?

716
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,291
Can you even begin
to fathom what goes through

717
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,208
their minds and what
they are made of?

718
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:46,041
Can you not understand
what they wish for?

719
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,916
Those girls are damn tough.

720
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,916
They've done a fine job
keeping this city safe

721
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,833
and they will
continue to do so.

722
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:56,166
And further more
I believe in them.

723
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,083
Descending Demons in Ginza!

724
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,458
Huge numbers, Ma'am.

725
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:40,791
Listen up everyone!

726
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,375
With the backpacks you're
wearing that I invented

727
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:45,000
your maneuverability
has increased 120%!

728
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,416
Time to get cracking!!

729
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,083
Behold!

730
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:03,208
We - are - the Imperial
Fighting - Troupe!!

731
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:07,125
It's our-duty '
to protect this great city!!

732
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,666
Ms. Kaede!

733
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,875
It looks like
we're ready to go!

734
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,500
Our spirit power
is building up just fine!

735
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:01,458
Understood!

736
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,083
Get into formation
and standby!

737
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:06,750
The Dream Division is
ready and waiting Ma'am.

738
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,250
Adequate spirit
power build-up!

739
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,041
Critical level reached!

740
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,750
Imperial Capital
Barricade Formation!!

741
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:52,958
Hey!

742
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:54,041
Look!

743
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,250
Yafqiel!

744
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:59,916
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

745
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,125
Leni!

746
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,041
Leni!!

747
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:37,958
Is that her?!

748
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,333
Ms. Orihime...

749
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:55,708
Orihime!

750
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:57,375
Ms. Orihime!

751
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,250
Ms. Orihime!

752
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,416
Aah!

753
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:33,750
Look - out!

754
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,416
Orihime!

755
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,666
Orihime!

756
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,625
Wake up please!

757
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:50,791
Come on!

758
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,583
I'm-sorry-but, '
We must bring an end

759
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,958
to this meaningless
waste of time Orihime.

760
00:54:58,791 --> 00:54:59,833
Ms. Lachette, please wait!

761
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:01,416
There must be another way!!

762
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:06,625
You must stay out of my way!

763
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:07,875
What are you doing?!

764
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,916
Ugh!

765
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,791
No!!

766
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:52,416
Leni!

767
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,291
Leni!

768
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,416
Hold on!

769
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:11,291
Oh. Thanks so much.

770
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:12,083
Leni!

771
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,750
Are you OK?!

772
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:16,250
I'm fine, Iris.

773
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,666
Thank God.

774
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:45,666
Orihime!!

775
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:48,916
Ms. Orihime!

776
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,583
Orihime!

777
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:50,666
Orihime!

778
00:56:59,166 --> 00:56:59,916
Orihime!

779
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,000
Orihime!

780
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:14,291
I'm so sorry.

781
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,583
I guess I really
blew it this time.

782
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,541
Hmph.

783
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,000
I'm sorry we were delayed,
Count, Lt. General.

784
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:46,416
You needn't worry any more.

785
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,125
We've completely secured
the perimeter of the building.

786
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:51,000
We've also helped
ourselves to taking care

787
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:54,833
of that Descending Demons
incubation facility of yours.

788
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:01,875
Bravo!!

789
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,041
C'mon, give it all we've got!

790
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:06,458
Fire!!

791
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:23,166
You employed
the Navy didn't you?

792
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,083
If there was even one
of those Yafqiels

793
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,125
around it wouldn't have
gone this smoothly.

794
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,375
It seems your fixation
on the Imperial Theater

795
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:31,500
just got the better of you...

796
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:33,083
Hmph.

797
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,875
I could sink the entire Imperial
Navy with one of my Yafqiel's.

798
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:38,000
It seems you used
those girls as decoys.

799
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,333
A futile tactic nonetheless.

800
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,208
Decoys?

801
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,875
Just what do you take us for?

802
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:45,250
Regardless of what you
think-you've been defeated!

803
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:47,333
Oh, is that so?

804
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,208
Ugh!

805
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,541
Stop it Brent!!

806
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,333
Everyone behave
yourselves now.

807
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,750
You are about to
witness the defeat

808
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:18,083
of Imperial Fighting
Troupe Flower Division!!

809
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:25,833
Dammit!

810
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:56,833
The Yafqiels...

811
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,333
What in Heaven?!

812
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,916
Members of the Imperial
Fighting Troupe...

813
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,083
Allow me to introduce myself.

814
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,916
I am the one and
only Brent Furlong.

815
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,083
So you're the 'big cheese'
of Douglas-Stewart!

816
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:19,250
All of you have
fought very well.

817
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,875
And your efforts
are to be commended.

818
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:26,416
However you have gravely
overstepped your boundaries.

819
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,041
You and your friends...

820
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,416
You've caused serious trouble.

821
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,541
Such transgressions
can't be forgiven.

822
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:35,166
Therefore...

823
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,000
I have decided
to personally teach you...

824
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:40,333
... Where your
proper place is!

825
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:12,375
No it can't be.

826
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:13,416
Hey!

827
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,083
Look at that!

828
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:18,375
Captain!

829
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,958
Incoming message.

830
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:20,875
Hey!

831
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:21,875
Hi Kayama.

832
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:23,541
Kotone here!

833
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,791
So -sorry - to-keep
you-waiting.

834
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,333
We just got in.

835
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:28,958
Ah, Seiryuin.

836
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:30,666
So tell me-is he...?

837
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:33,375
Well actually he just
rushed out even before

838
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:34,708
we reached our berth.

839
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,500
Honestly, the man
can be so impatient.

840
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:38,541
I know.

841
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:41,541
Okay, it's all yours now!

842
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,625
Lt. General...

843
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,333
Deputy Commander!

844
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,541
Sakura...

845
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:57,666
Look at how enormous it is!

846
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:26,458
Please...!

847
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,000
Get - up!

848
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:38,000
Oh no My Eisenkleid...

849
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,916
You bastard!!

850
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:46,416
Uah!

851
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:55,041
Kanna!

852
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,041
Are you all right?!

853
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:57,791
Yeah, I guess so.

854
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:58,541
Ms. Sakura!

855
01:02:58,625 --> 01:02:59,625
Are you okay?!

856
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:00,583
Yes-I'm fine!

857
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:01,458
I can still fight!

858
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:02,750
Ms. Lachette what's the matter?

859
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:03,916
Ms. Lachette!

860
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,916
I can't...

861
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,583
I can't move anymore...

862
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:12,416
Farewell my dear Eisenkleid...

863
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,833
Ms. Lachette...

864
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,250
This isn't good!

865
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:27,000
Everyone's spirit power
is beginning to fall off!

866
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:27,958
This is getting serious.

867
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:29,541
What are we going to do?!

868
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,875
Your so called Imperial
Capital of Flowers

869
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,708
will be no more as of today.

870
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:40,750
I will crush it
under my feet.

871
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,250
Proclaiming it to be
a 'mighty imperial capital'

872
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:46,250
doesn't change the fact
that it's completely fragile.

873
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:49,750
It's nothing more than a speck
of dust compared to my Yafqiel!

874
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,000
You're wrong!

875
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,708
This place may seem like
nothing more than

876
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,166
an insignificant town to you...

877
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,250
... But there are thousands
of people's lives at stake

878
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,208
who thrive in this city!

879
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:02,041
Passionate people
who spend their days here!

880
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:06,458
People who feel joy &amp; sorrow,
and anger, or sadness!

881
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,750
They all go about living their
lives as best as they can.

882
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,208
How dare you...

883
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:14,625
How dare you dismiss all
of this as something trivial!!

884
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,583
As long as there are good
citizens and people that we

885
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:20,208
love to defend in this great
city-we will not 'Be-defeated!

886
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:21,916
Hah!

887
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:26,958
Ms. Sakura!!

888
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:42,083
The Yafqiel is taking
heavy cannon fire!

889
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,625
Fast moving object inbound!

890
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:45,416
Its speed is incredible!!

891
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:09,583
Sakura , are you all right?

892
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:10,250
Yes!

893
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,416
Yes-Sir!

894
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,000
Hey-I'm sorry I took so long.

895
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:17,708
Lieutenant!

896
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:18,541
Big brother!!

897
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:19,750
Captain!!

898
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:20,916
Mr. Oogami!

899
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,416
Hello everyone!

900
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:30,791
Damn you!!

901
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,041
Huh?

902
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,208
Oh!

903
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:47,708
Wait-a-minute!

904
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:48,333
That's it!

905
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:48,916
That's the sound!

906
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,708
Mr. Oogami!

907
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:50,333
Everyone!

908
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:51,333
I figured it out!

909
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:52,291
Are you sure?!

910
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:54,083
What are you talking about?

911
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:55,333
Sound waves!

912
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:57,166
All of those different
Yafqiels were controlled

913
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,958
by special sounds that were
unique to each one of them!

914
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,208
Does-that-mean...

915
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,708
some special set sound
frequency is being used?

916
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:04,791
That's right!

917
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,166
Sharp as ever-Oogami!

918
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,333
Now sit back and watch!

919
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:09,541
I'm gonna make that
thing go to pieces!

920
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:11,833
But those big arms
of his are in the way.

921
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,083
They have got to go!

922
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:19,208
Well in that case...

923
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,666
Just leave it to us!

924
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,250
And here we go!!

925
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,458
Man! The two of you
are somethin' else!

926
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,750
Uah!

927
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,583
Mr. Oogami!

928
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:07,083
Iris!!

929
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:07,916
Help me!!

930
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,791
Huh?

931
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,958
Hah! Ok!

932
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:05,708
Sakura.

933
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,458
Um, Yes!

934
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:10,541
You did a great job.

935
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:14,875
I can't thank you enough.

936
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:16,833
Oh, thank you Sir but
The Flower Division

937
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:19,166
was able to carry
on this far...

938
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,500
...Because of you,
Mr. Oogami.

939
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:28,000
More than anything else we were
able to win because of you...

940
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,666
This is a great victory for the
Imperial Flower Division!!

941
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,416
Huh?

942
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,625
Oh!

943
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,375
There's something else
I forgot all about!

944
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,333
Are you Japanese
or aren't you?!

945
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:49,958
Then how about showing some
respect for your country!

946
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:53,875
That's what makes all
of those girls so strong.

947
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:07,208
It's been sometime
hasn't it, Patrick.

948
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:08,875
You are still alive?

949
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,041
Yes, but no thanks to you.

950
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:14,875
This time I'll
make sure you die!

951
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:16,791
Oh really? I don't
think you should

952
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:19,291
be making promises
you can't keep.

953
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,250
You're out of bullets.

954
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:32,458
Not that bullets
work on me, anyway...

955
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:45,208
Tell me why...?

956
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:47,083
Oh dear, did I
forget to mention?

957
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:50,208
That last round was
filled with spirit power.

958
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,416
Good night
Sweet dreams Patrick.

959
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:05,208
When Maria showed up
all battered and bruised -

960
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:06,416
we were shocked.

961
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,666
We couldn't get back
to the Imperial Theater

962
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,375
with the Army
watching over it...

963
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:11,416
...We were really at
a loss for while.

964
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,291
I understand.

965
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,416
Thanks for looking after her.

966
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,208
I really appreciate it
you know?

967
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,833
Actually we did consider
telling you about it...

968
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:19,375
Like they say,
"To deceive your enemies

969
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:20,875
- first deceive your friends."

970
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:22,250
Everyone was pretty upset.

971
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,750
I bet!

972
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:25,875
I'm just one of the Flower
Division's unseen stage crew.

973
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:27,458
It's different
from how you do it

974
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:30,041
but I try helping
out in my own...

975
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:34,375
Ladies and gentlemen, the
intermission is about to end.

976
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,500
Well, should we
go to our seats?

977
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:36,583
Sure!

978
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,416
It is good to see you,
my Princess.

979
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,583
What troubles you,
I dare ask.

980
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:44,458
I'm afraid I'm
gripped with fear.

981
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,625
Young Master, you must
remove your armor.

982
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:48,333
''Tis only natural
for her to be fearful

983
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:51,000
of your appearance as such.

984
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:53,083
You must not
be fearful of this!

985
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,583
For this armor is the
reason why I am strong!

986
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,958
This was what allowed me
to save the lady-in-waiting

987
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,166
from the Sharks.

988
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:05,083
Alas I have come to
a land filled with terror...

989
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:07,166
Is there a nation
without enemies?

990
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,958
Foes abound in every quarter.

991
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,958
I need only to win!

992
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,083
I'll be victorious!

993
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:35,625
Clad in this armor that I wear,

994
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,250
'I will fight foes
and the world...

995
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:38,458
...To protect you from all!!

996
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:39,875
Oh...

997
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,791
I dare ask, what is the source
of your mighty strength?

998
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,583
Because I...

999
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:27,875
Because I hold you so dear...

1000
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:31,458
I must slay you Princess.

1001
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:32,875
Why, why must you?

1002
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,583
What other reason do I need?

1003
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:37,250
You are already mine
to do with as I please.

1004
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:40,541
As your king should I not
do as I please Princ-ess?

1005
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:41,333
Huh?

1006
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:42,583
Those aren't the lines...

1007
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:44,375
Could Lachette be...

1008
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,541
under someone's control?

1009
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:53,083
You are powerless before me.

1010
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:55,833
I hold your life in my hands.

1011
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:56,958
What delight.

1012
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:59,208
Such pleasure I take
in knowing this.

1013
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,583
Oh!

1014
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:02,208
And to think that I would be
treated in such a manner

1015
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,916
by the very one who
professes love to me!

1016
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,666
I wonder if it could be that you
are under some sort of a spell

1017
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,291
cast upon you by the Demon
King who resides on the land?

1018
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:20,208
This is bad!

1019
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:21,375
This is really bad!

1020
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:23,250
Get that lift down right now!

1021
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:30,125
Let it be known my heart
is dominated by no one.

1022
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:34,250
And let it be known, that my
heart is also dominated by

1023
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,708
Deep...

1024
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:38,416
deep...

1025
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,916
By a very deep hatred!

1026
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,625
A heart full of hatred? But why?

1027
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,833
You, who possesses all?

1028
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,208
I held power over everything.

1029
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:51,000
Alas, people knew not
what my heart held!

1030
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,291
And they deserted me!

1031
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:55,208
As do you, one
who blossoms so!

1032
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:58,208
But I I...

1033
01:15:58,291 --> 01:16:00,708
I was born a
king! - Understand?!

1034
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,916
Just because
I had everything...

1035
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,666
No one could begin to
understand the torment

1036
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:10,208
that I ' suffered in
losing everything!

1037
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:13,291
My aim was to be more
noble and powerful

1038
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,333
than all of the others...

1039
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:17,708
Even after selling my
soul to the demons of

1040
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,041
the land I endeavored
to protect my dignity.

1041
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:21,166
That can't be...

1042
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,583
What's with Lachette...?

1043
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:27,416
I am mired in mud and my heart
is hideously warped now!

1044
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,458
And so, my heart...

1045
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,416
Believe in them...

1046
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,208
Wait! I beg of you!

1047
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,750
If even for only a
brief moment we shared

1048
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:37,041
a dream with one another!

1049
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:37,625
Perhaps.

1050
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:38,958
What of it?

1051
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,833
Our shared dreams combine
and become the future!

1052
01:16:41,916 --> 01:16:44,541
What is your reason
for reminding me of this?!

1053
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:47,791
We've laughed together
fought and dreamed together...

1054
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:50,041
And you and I have
shared even more than that!

1055
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:52,416
We've appreciated this place.

1056
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,833
And - I...

1057
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:55,208
And I

1058
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:56,333
You see...

1059
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:58,583
I love you so!

1060
01:16:58,666 --> 01:17:00,791
Oh...

1061
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:13,458
My dear Prince, with all due
respect, will slaying your

1062
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,958
defenseless wife lift a
burden from your heart?

1063
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:18,541
Let me be the target
of your rage.

1064
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,166
My friends, companions,
comrades...

1065
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:25,041
Alas-I can feel my heart
turn cold as ice!!

1066
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,541
This world is rife
with enemies!

1067
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,875
As you stand here before
us all, you have shared

1068
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:32,666
your heart and
your deepest desires.

1069
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,791
And if what you say is
true; that you desire

1070
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,750
my life most of all...

1071
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:39,416
Know that I would
gladly give it to you.

1072
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,875
I commend your strength.

1073
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:43,791
Now resign yourself
to a death by my hands!

1074
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:49,291
I, for the want of making my
power felt, conspired with

1075
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:51,291
the demons of the land,
in an attempt

1076
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,625
to bring chaos to this world!

1077
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,541
I now have no place to return.

1078
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,958
With your death followed
by mine ' let us venture

1079
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,041
into the netherworld together.

1080
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,166
Cast your hatred upon me
dear Princess!

1081
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:08,541
I harbor no hatred at all.

1082
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,041
For hatred only
breeds further hatred.

1083
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,666
So you see...

1084
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,875
I can forgive you with
all of my heart.

1085
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,791
I forgive you.

1086
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,083
I too forgive you.

1087
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:29,875
And I forgive you.

1088
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:31,708
I also forgive you.

1089
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,375
I forgive you.

1090
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,125
I forgive you.

1091
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:36,666
I forgive you.

1092
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:40,125
I forgive you too as well.

1093
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:43,208
I will not be deceived
by this farcical story!

1094
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:46,750
I shall bring down the curtain
and in doing so end this story!

1095
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,041
But must this be the end?

1096
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:51,208
Do you really think that
by lowering the curtain

1097
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,708
that it will end all stories?

1098
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:54,875
As long as...

1099
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,833
As long as people are alive...

1100
01:18:56,916 --> 01:19:00,041
... Their stories will be heard
and will never end.

1101
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,208
That is enough.

1102
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:09,708
The time has finally come
to slay this story!!

1103
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:25,916
I...

1104
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,291
I...

1105
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:45,166
I cannot.

1106
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:50,750
I can't bring myself to slay
my love-my friends or dreams!

1107
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,416
The blood I shed my prince,
it is your blood.

1108
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,250
All of the blood of hatred
flows out to the sea and now

1109
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,666
a new story has been
born in it's place.

1110
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,333
For just a little longer...

1111
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:02,583
 I wanted this moment to last.

1112
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:05,500
I found contentment in
holding onto such a wish.

1113
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,916
There are as many different
stories as there are people...

1114
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,958
and each one
blossoms like a flower.

1115
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:13,083
Flowers now appear before us.

1116
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:16,041
For here and now, there are
many flowers; like dreams,

1117
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:18,833
that will blossom
again and again!

1118
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:22,708
And they will unfold their
blooms with the light of life.
