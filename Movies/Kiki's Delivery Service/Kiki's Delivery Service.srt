Dirigible?

814

Your face.

Fly safely.

No problem.

219
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,428
Hey, Tombo.

00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,843
Here we go.

419
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:05,401
Oh! A nest!

Jiji? Jiji?

626
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,120
Yes, but...

735
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,612
Mmm. Hmm...

749
01:05:51,953 --> 01:05:52,927
What is it?

772
01:08:03,147 --> 01:08:04,229
Watch this.

779
01:08:26,284 --> 01:08:28,239
I was sick.

807
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:39,044
Oh, my God!

847
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,934
Hey, Tombo!

Be careful.

Very pretty.

145
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,051
It's so big!

260
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:54,415
My pleasure.

303
00:25:03,288 --> 00:25:03,921
That's okay.

385
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:32,219
Yeah. I can.

400
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,463
She sure is.

494
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,982
Almost done.

512
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:07,206
That's okay.

594
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,390
Here we are.

629
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:14,369
Well, maybe.

647
00:56:52,016 --> 00:56:53,225
Now we wait.

653
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,752
There we go.

675
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:16,034
Here you go.

784
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,378
Okay. Ready?

845
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,197
Look at him.

77
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,176
I don't know.

180
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,342
Good morning.

208
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,338
Thief! Thief!

282
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,056
There you go.

426
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,178
Oh, be quiet.

450
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,130
This is dumb.

468
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,387
Anybody here?

620
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:50,987
Barsa. Barsa.

806
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,860
We're flying.

1091
01:33:28,918 --> 01:33:29,771
I have to go.

39
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:39,528
Come on, Jiji.

53
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,613
Yes, midnight.

198
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,211
Hey, you, kid.

232
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,662
Hey! Don't go.

250
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,192
Oh, poor baby.

267
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,229
There you are.

420
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,509
Oh, I'm sorry.

446
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:13,559
Can I breathe?

453
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,839
Uh, I'm sorry.

465
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,245
There you are.

523
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,205
There you are.

531
00:46:36,037 --> 00:46:37,250
No, I'm tired.

591
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,302
Come on, Jiji.

655
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:14,239
Stop worrying.

677
00:58:16,696 --> 00:58:17,202
Fly carefully.

702
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,965
Wake up, Kiki.

736
01:05:19,812 --> 01:05:22,305
Where are you?

757
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,778
Taking a walk?

810
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:06,071
Yeah. Are you?

817
01:11:40,669 --> 01:11:42,368
Yeah, me, too.

863
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:04,616
Well, I'll be.

1067
01:32:11,474 --> 01:32:12,752
What happened?

1142
01:38:35,395 --> 01:38:36,841
Get him, Kiki.

41
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,470
Of course I am.

50
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,543
Uh! Kiki, wait.

107
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,290
You're no help.

133
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,031
Oh. Yeah, sure.

164
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,016
Look. Up ahead.

168
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:06,444
Ready, set, go!

239
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,407
Oh, never mind.

261
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:55,869
Let's go, Jiji.

307
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,301
This is quaint.

330
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,076
Can I help out?

367
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,508
Hey. Pull over.

421
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,710
Leave me alone.

479
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,537
That's my girl.

492
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:11,117
How's it going?

1023
01:29:26,276 --> 01:29:27,526
Ah, no problem.

1027
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:37,161
You understand?

1057
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:24,508
I don't get it.

1132
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,471
It's a miracle.

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,736
Dad. Guess what?

88
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,078
Or maybe a town?

95
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,440
Kiki, it's time.

137
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,774
Fortune-telling?

151
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:05,650
What's my skill?

296
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:41,769
My name's Osono.

304
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:04,734
All right, then.

423
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,704
Oh, my goodness.

725
01:03:53,327 --> 01:03:54,684
Oh, my gosh. No.

345
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:53,583
I could use help.

447
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,874
No, no breathing.

472
00:41:58,842 --> 00:41:59,843
What do you want?

622
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,084
Certainly, madam.

731
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:18,230
Um... Never mind.

791
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:10,862
Should I get off?

1042
01:30:34,877 --> 01:30:36,106
Afternoon, ma'am.

1093
01:33:31,404 --> 01:33:33,433
Oh, dear. Oh! Oh!

46
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,086
You're going away?

127
00:09:57,187 --> 00:09:58,668
Hey. Good evening.

211
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,195
He's getting away!

259
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,459
Thank you so much.

326
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:51,474
Morning, everyone.

451
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,342
You're a bit late.

569
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:39,603
That's no problem.

570
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,139
Are you all right?

661
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,034
I'm gonna be late.

663
00:57:40,532 --> 00:57:42,826
Help. Barsa, come.

683
01:00:03,457 --> 01:00:04,622
I have a delivery.

695
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,422
Kiki, there he is.

764
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,612
Gee, thanks a lot.

770
01:07:57,124 --> 01:07:57,899
What do you think?

866
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:10,884
What's the matter?

900
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,598
Hey. Look at that.

1018
01:29:14,264 --> 01:29:15,578
That's why I came?

1033
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:56,883
Kiki. How are you?

1066
01:31:55,506 --> 01:31:57,019
You've got a deal.

1120
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:03,167
Aye, aye, Captain.

1141
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,324
She can fly again.

1162
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,542
Oh, Barsa. Oh, my.

38
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,692
then what'll we do?

123
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,674
Where are we going?

173
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,182
Wow! A clock tower.

236
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,527
No, sir, I'm alone.

328
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,534
Did you sleep well?

390
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:44,879
Huh? But that's me.

463
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,597
Please hurry, Kiki.

466
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,075
Hello. Anyone home?

624
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:00,387
Oh, no, I couldn't.

673
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:13,195
Hurry up. Hurry up.

716
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,676
There you go. Here.

801
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,307
We're quite a team.

967
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:10,945
You mean that's me?

972
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:25,533
You're very pretty.

1094
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,125
Come on. Over here.

1151
01:39:03,371 --> 01:39:05,353
You can do it. Yes.

74
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:28,954
I'm glad about that.

112
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,030
You be strong. Okay?

119
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,698
Aim your broomstick.

170
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,828
You okay back there?

185
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:58,694
Thanks, mister. Bye.

277
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:27,094
Wait. Wait a minute.

297
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:43,906
And I'm Kiki, ma'am.

327
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:52,716
Well, look who's up.

363
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:40,645
Kiki, look. It's me.

430
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:45,706
We've gotta go back.

433
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:06,712
We have to. Hold on!

449
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,997
Yeah. Give it to me.

459
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,194
I've gotta run. Bye!

501
00:44:32,092 --> 00:44:33,573
Thank you very much.

530
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,328
How are you? Hungry?

571
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,181
I do this every day.

688
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,830
Hey, what'd you get?

781
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,194
We're going on this?

790
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:05,876
Kick off. Now! Good!

833
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,517
That's all I can do.

880
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,019
Some friend you are.

925
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,719
Nice place you have.

948
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,714
It's beautiful here.

999
01:28:10,271 --> 01:28:11,731
That sounds like me.

1101
01:34:47,997 --> 01:34:49,755
He's still up there.

1110
01:35:21,509 --> 01:35:22,076
Thank you very much.

1123
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:08,979
Grab a hold of this.

176
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,237
And there may not be.

270
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:02,931
Now, come back again.

364
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:55,695
Any money left, Kiki?

381
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:24,502
What a charming girl.

425
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,182
But would you listen?

443
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:02,559
You gotta be kidding.

497
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:29,496
Ket. Did you hear me?

498
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,282
Ket, turn off the TV!

543
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:47,556
I mean, my customers.

596
00:53:19,254 --> 00:53:20,987
Right this way, dear.

668
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,476
We're ready. Come on.

674
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,544
Have a good time now.

750
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:54,811
We've got a delivery.

768
01:07:49,886 --> 01:07:51,233
Oh, you gotta see it.

1078
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:53,971
My, my. How terrible.

2
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,273
Skies are clearing up,

189
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,544
They're looking at us.

258
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,531
Really? You'd do that?

287
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,380
Depends on the people.

357
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,256
You know how boys are.

382
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:26,194
My name's Kiki, ma'am.

471
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,745
Why don't you come up?

524
00:45:40,229 --> 00:45:41,536
What took you so long?

526
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:45,579
Jeff helped me escape.

574
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,310
How much will that be?

593
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:41,018
There's the blue roof.

597
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,351
You are right on time.

606
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,624
Broom and a black cat.

682
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:03,224
Yes? What do you want?

684
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:06,884
But it is soaking wet.

744
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:37,169
The name is "Koppori"?

787
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:47,957
Oh, boy. Just hold on.

989
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:21,837
Go away? That's right.

1131
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:12,157
Hey, look. Over there.

21
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,452
Huh? But, Kiki... Wait.

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,851
Your little baby is 13?

129
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,828
You're new, aren't you?

156
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,449
Not if nobody finds us.

159
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,610
Mmm. This smells great.

210
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:57,910
Somebody call the cops.

233
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,565
Hmm. What a cool witch.

341
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,110
Don't waste your money.

349
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:01,605
Yeah! We've got a deal.

485
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,295
His head's falling off.

562
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,229
Here's your invitation.

584
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,385
- Really? - How's work?

652
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,836
What a wonderful witch.

705
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,729
You have quite a fever.

738
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:25,133
Are you feeling better?

843
01:13:15,036 --> 01:13:16,261
"Don't be such a clown.

849
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,183
Guess what's up, Tombo?

855
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:46,284
Hey, who's your friend?

1102
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,111
Stay out of the street.

81
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,757
And come back a failure?

155
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,557
Won't we get in trouble?

178
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,124
Too many, if you ask me.

188
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,143
Well, of course, we are.

221
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,456
Hey, shut up, all right?

276
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:25,085
Well, I'll be on my way.

321
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,922
And the amazing thing is

362
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,333
Wow! This costs so much.

398
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:19,617
Yeah. I got to see this.

414
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,620
They seem awfully upset.

434
00:38:22,629 --> 00:38:25,718
Hey. Stop that. Go away.

435
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:29,069
Leave us alone. Stop it.

445
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,363
Don't worry. Hold still.

507
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,392
Jeff's such a funny dog.

604
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,945
May I take that for you?

617
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:41,408
But I must admit defeat.

645
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,000
It should be about time.

690
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:19,693
Mmm, yummy. Herring pie.

739
01:05:25,157 --> 01:05:26,765
A lot better. Thank you.

754
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,431
He's all yours. Bye-bye.

755
01:06:51,106 --> 01:06:54,841
It's so pretty and warm.

793
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,819
Hey, look at that. Whoa.

820
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:50,080
Your bike's a real mess.

823
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:58,639
Uh-huh. What went wrong?

897
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,209
Well, that's no problem.

909
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:24,213
What? Kiki? She hung up.

1008
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,432
Sometimes it's not easy.

1104
01:35:05,838 --> 01:35:07,465
Do not block the street.

84
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,260
After all, she is a baby.

102
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:54,848
And that's why it's good.

205
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,084
Will you tell my parents?

212
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,763
Now you stay right there.

299
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:48,988
It's right up here, Kiki.

375
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,573
Oh, Kiki, perfect timing.

427
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,922
Look at them. Up so high.

461
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,985
Come on, you stupid bird.

565
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:29,879
Yes. May I help you, sir?

590
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,126
Thank you very much. Bye.

671
00:58:08,705 --> 00:58:10,133
But that's much too much.

672
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:11,248
Not for all of your help.

694
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:49,614
Maybe we still have time.

799
01:09:59,357 --> 01:10:01,174
Great. You're doing fine.

812
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,378
What are you laughing at?

865
01:14:06,906 --> 01:14:08,619
No thanks. See you later.

878
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,047
Hey, where are you going?

886
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:20,432
Oh, no. Talk to me, Jiji.

889
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:29,694
What's going on with him?

929
01:21:42,091 --> 01:21:44,291
Hey, there. Unbelievable.

992
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,613
I loved to paint so much.

1015
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,769
So I guess it's worth it.

1082
01:33:03,898 --> 01:33:05,999
Oh, no, no. It's useless.

1152
01:39:05,377 --> 01:39:07,136
Don't give up now, sonny.

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,353
Yeah. There's a full moon.

144
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:45,586
That's my town down there.

241
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,748
No, you can have it, Jiji.

247
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:12,561
Oh, dear. Oh, my goodness.

248
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:17,183
Hey, there! Your pacifier!

329
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:55,150
Yes. Oh, that smells good.

377
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:58,497
She's your first customer.

600
00:53:37,793 --> 00:53:40,581
My, delivery time already?

636
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,477
Ma'am, it'll work, really.

696
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:18,222
Come on. We can catch him.

706
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:50,992
My head's hurting so much.

839
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,211
You're a very nice person.

854
01:13:42,948 --> 01:13:44,568
Really? Wow! That's great.

860
01:13:55,193 --> 01:13:57,496
Oh. Why not? It'll be fun.

868
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,717
What are you so mad about?

924
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,709
You better believe I will.

8
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,413
tonight might be the night.

283
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:00,731
Thank you very much, ma'am.

312
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,703
Can we look for a new town?

313
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,450
Pardon me, Miss Snooty Cat.

351
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:07,841
Osono, you're the greatest.

412
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,886
And they're coming with us.

495
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,632
Ket, dear. Turn off the TV.

503
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,703
But I haven't finished yet.

511
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,612
He sure will. He sure will.

643
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:18,644
Oh, well, this is exciting.

704
01:02:42,246 --> 01:02:44,132
Not feeling very well, huh?

824
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,399
I think I pedaled too hard.

872
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,886
Forget her, Tombo. Come on.

905
01:20:12,918 --> 01:20:14,908
Hello? Kiki? Are you there?

949
01:23:58,883 --> 01:24:00,181
What's the matter with you?

1052
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,345
I'm the adventuresome type.

1077
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,275
It has broken loose from...

1114
01:36:32,808 --> 01:36:35,213
Come on, broom, fly for me.

1147
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,918
Hang in there, my good lad.

16
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,693
Please excuse me, Miss Dora.

57
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,160
Oh, Mom. I look really dumb.

101
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,071
But, Mom, that one's so old.

135
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,872
Oh, yes. A lot can go wrong.

339
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,740
But a phone is so expensive.

399
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,681
She's the most amazing girl.

635
00:55:31,015 --> 00:55:32,750
I think her plan is perfect.

717
01:03:26,232 --> 01:03:27,710
Now, don't burn your tongue.

756
01:07:01,137 --> 01:07:04,502
Hey. Hey, there, Miss Witch.

804
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,829
That's the dirigible, right?

815
01:11:28,996 --> 01:11:30,622
Do I really look that funny?

852
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,734
I'll be back in a sec, okay?

859
01:13:53,412 --> 01:13:55,098
Thanks, but I don't want to.

904
01:20:10,744 --> 01:20:12,463
Boy, did I have a cool time.

1072
01:32:34,846 --> 01:32:37,155
Goodness. It's a strong one.

1157
01:39:33,288 --> 01:39:35,579
Congratulations, young lady.

15
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,904
Don't worry. He doesn't mind.

117
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,747
Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki.

257
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,051
I could reach her in no time.

309
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,281
Hmph! If you wake up tomorrow

370
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,033
It's me, you remember? Tombo.

374
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:42,688
Better luck next time, Tombo.

393
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,595
Great. How much will it cost?

478
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:21,616
I really need to finish this.

528
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,755
He'll do it. He's a good dog.

551
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,438
What? Pardon? Uh, yes, ma'am.

557
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,443
I'll take this, please. Okay?

646
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,285
Yes, the fire's almost ready.

651
00:57:01,215 --> 00:57:03,707
Oh. How nice of you to offer.

670
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:08,610
Let me pay you for your time.

679
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:28,445
Not according to my whiskers.

692
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:26,297
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

720
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:39,183
Only if you want to get well.

745
01:05:37,193 --> 01:05:39,142
Uh-huh. Now, take this money.

751
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,904
Hey. Who's your friend there?

802
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,598
All right. We're doing great.

840
01:13:09,293 --> 01:13:10,444
Huh? You just found that out?

892
01:17:58,511 --> 01:18:00,553
I'm losing my witch's powers.

906
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:16,675
Please don't call me anymore.

955
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,638
You get along with the crows.

988
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:19,408
You think my problems will...

1017
01:29:12,178 --> 01:29:14,117
You've got such a great face.

1032
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,778
Yes? Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

1049
01:30:55,634 --> 01:30:57,651
Barsa, bring the package now.

1085
01:33:13,348 --> 01:33:14,725
It's being lifted like a toy.

1154
01:39:09,179 --> 01:39:11,737
Don't give up. Don't give up.

45
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,525
I've decided to leave tonight.

69
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,507
All right. It's yours already.

230
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,518
You sound like my grandmother.

310
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:31,708
and find a white cat, it's me.

314
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,945
And the excitement is building

325
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:28,396
Yup. We're gonna need a phone.

332
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:20,483
Ooh, a delivery business, huh?

337
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:36,422
You mean it? Oh, that's great.

395
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,011
Aha! How about this much then?

460
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,953
Thank you. Enjoy your present.

532
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,065
Yeah, me, too. I'm very tired.

665
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,486
Is the pie baked? Is it ready?

828
01:12:32,342 --> 01:12:35,142
Well, yes. Since I was a baby.

894
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:05,449
It's become very weak, so I...

990
01:27:21,934 --> 01:27:23,761
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

1074
01:32:40,146 --> 01:32:43,674
Oh, goody! It's back on. Look.

1105
01:35:07,532 --> 01:35:09,661
Are you all right, young lady?

140
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,633
And what exactly is your skill?

353
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:41,435
Jiji, come on. I'm all through.

409
00:35:26,614 --> 00:35:28,507
I'm getting sick to my stomach.

439
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:50,719
That was a long time ago, okay?

462
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:26,711
I got a brand-new home for you.

493
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:12,717
Trust me. He'll be good as new.

529
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,399
Could you take this in, please?

550
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,143
Hello. Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

576
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,222
I wrote the address on the box.

577
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,044
Oh! Oh, the box. Oh, I'm sorry.

641
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:02,484
Madam, here. Look what I found.

753
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:01,385
Stay there. I'll be right back.

759
01:07:13,848 --> 01:07:15,521
Hey, that's my name. That's me.

775
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,399
Miss Witch, I got a great idea.

883
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,412
Why are you talking like a cat?

981
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,001
But I just can't figure it out.

1002
01:28:20,266 --> 01:28:22,156
I had to discover my own style.

1004
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:28,124
Uh-huh. We fly with our spirit.

1014
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,301
But it ended up being so great.

1054
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,058
Could you turn it down, please?

1121
01:37:03,306 --> 01:37:05,468
Hey, there. Over here. Come on.

138
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:30,128
Yes. I tell fortunes about love.

231
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,181
Just go away and leave me alone!

238
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,612
Do you have some identification?

467
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,087
Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello.

480
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:26,336
You're just about through, okay?

509
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,799
I'll bet he thinks it's a puppy.

608
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,984
My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.

752
01:05:57,015 --> 01:05:59,641
Lily's her name. Be right there.

786
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,664
This is my first time on a bike.

870
01:14:19,617 --> 01:14:21,253
So, please, just leave me alone.

1060
01:31:30,049 --> 01:31:31,753
It's my way of saying thank you.

1062
01:31:35,395 --> 01:31:37,403
Then I can bake her another one.

1073
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:40,029
It'll pass quickly. Don't worry.

1088
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,778
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

59
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:50,123
What matters is the heart inside.

118
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,861
Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go!

181
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,979
Do any witches live in this town?

215
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,845
Hey, that was me yelling "thief."

284
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:02,575
And, this is for you, little guy.

340
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:42,447
I have a little saved up already.

350
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,710
I'm gonna work very hard for you.

354
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:45,623
We're gonna go shopping. Come on.

369
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:29,515
How come you're not flying today?

391
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,201
Are you sure it won't be too far?

411
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:52,913
Look who's behind us. Wild geese.

417
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:27,977
They say a gust of wind's coming.

436
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,051
Maybe we better rethink our plan.

448
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,805
It must be my present from aunty.

475
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,468
You're a good birdie, aren't you?

693
01:00:32,035 --> 01:00:34,376
I cannot believe they're related.

887
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,537
You mean you can't speak anymore?

908
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:20,630
You know what the captain said...

946
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,952
Hurry. Hurry. The bus is leaving.

958
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,455
Hello, everybody. I'm home again.

997
01:28:04,068 --> 01:28:05,989
and not very good copies, either.

1037
01:30:04,604 --> 01:30:05,948
She has another delivery for you.

1041
01:30:16,525 --> 01:30:18,437
Thank you so much for everything.

1050
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:01,026
Gosh, I hope it hasn't taken off.

1071
01:32:31,609 --> 01:32:33,594
They'll be hitting us any minute.

22
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,683
My, oh, my. What's this all about?

104
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:00,664
Now, Kiki, do this for me, please.

124
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:16,044
I'm headed south to see the ocean.

146
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes, to you I'm sure it looks big.

177
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,883
Look at how many people there are.

204
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:49,120
Now give me your name and address.

244
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,845
Why don't we go find another town?

252
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,079
I better go give it to her myself.

294
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,513
You'd really let me stay with you?

366
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:13,304
Look, Jiji. Aren't they beautiful?

442
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,980
Unless we buy ourselves some time.

456
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,677
Mom, can I put the canary in here?

552
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,648
About time we got a customer, huh?

644
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:21,575
Mmm-hmm. Yes, this is much better.

780
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:29,052
Then we gotta see it. Let's do it.

819
01:11:45,074 --> 01:11:47,368
I'm not sure. Anything's possible.

984
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,365
Yeah, but still, if I can't fly...

1134
01:38:16,598 --> 01:38:18,981
But how can anyone rescue him now?

1150
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:03,300
And she's trying to reach the boy!

10
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,450
Jiji, wake up. Tonight's the night.

51
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,994
Yeah, I'll expect you then. Thanks.

154
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,708
We better rest here until it's dry.

207
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:54,791
I have to do that with every minor.

240
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,623
Kiki, aren't you going to eat that?

242
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:12,964
Where are we going to stay tonight?

246
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,578
Ones that are friendlier than this.

268
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:54,930
Here you go. See you tomorrow. Bye.

274
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,699
"Thanks for returning the pacifier.

386
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:34,426
It's a birthday gift for my nephew.

392
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,137
I can fly there straight from here.

402
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:54,884
Kiki, how high do you intend to go?

431
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,540
They're calling you an egg stealer.

506
00:44:52,387 --> 00:44:54,738
Jeff likes my present more than me.

518
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,689
He's getting to be such an old dog.

519
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,078
Yeah. All he does is sleep all day.

621
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,594
Would you get Kiki's money, please?

762
01:07:23,217 --> 01:07:25,874
Osono, how could you do this to me?

809
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,093
What happened, Tombo? Are you okay?

947
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:45,785
Okay, now I'm officially exhausted.

983
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,822
Maybe you should just take a break.

1024
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,823
So you really think I'll fly again?

1136
01:38:21,912 --> 01:38:24,210
He can't... Something just flew by.

157
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,249
I'm soaked through down to the bone.

166
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:49,466
I wonder if they have a witch there.

191
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,686
Smile, so we make a good impression.

193
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,329
And this is Jiji. He's my black cat.

196
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:24,852
Really. That's very nice, dear. Bye.

401
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:33,560
Hey, what can you tell me about her?

441
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,126
We won't be able to make it in time.

533
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:42,030
We're both gonna sleep well tonight.

542
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:45,118
I know that. That's not what I mean.

558
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,963
Thank you very much. Good afternoon.

610
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,563
Oh, my, what a pretty witch you are.

701
01:01:49,402 --> 01:01:52,371
Maybe we should eat something, okay?

715
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,889
This oatmeal will pick you right up.

719
01:03:34,107 --> 01:03:37,467
- Here it is. - Do I have to eat it?

746
01:05:39,617 --> 01:05:42,400
Oh, no, ma'am. No money. It's on me.

862
01:14:01,286 --> 01:14:03,294
You mean, she's working, at her age?

891
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,852
What if it means... Oh, my goodness.

940
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:32,205
How about it, kitty-cat? Wanna come?

942
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,673
Rather be with your girlfriend, huh?

952
01:24:25,568 --> 01:24:28,153
Huh? You really thought I was a boy?

1076
01:32:48,115 --> 01:32:49,706
Freak winds blowing in from the sea.

66
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,171
Dad. Oh, can I please take the radio?

125
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,989
Jiji, climb up and turn on the radio.

187
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,663
Tell me we're not landing down there.

298
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:46,144
And Jiji here is my very best friend.

311
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:38,053
Jiji, we can see the ocean from here.

378
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,873
Customer? Oh, my! I'll be right back.

415
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:26,076
They say they're going to fly higher.

540
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,000
I am, but today this place is boring.

578
00:51:15,695 --> 00:51:18,899
Osono! Osono! I've got a big problem.

599
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:37,180
Oh, madam, the delivery girl is here.

623
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,311
All of it. Pay her what we agreed on.

708
01:02:55,232 --> 01:02:57,866
Do you think I'm going to die, Osono?

836
01:12:57,019 --> 01:12:59,063
I know. I still feel that way though.

842
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,942
You know, my mom says the same thing.

882
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,287
And you can wash your plate yourself.

956
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:46,096
Yup. We've become real close friends.

977
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:46,564
You mean it? Then what? What happens?

998
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,174
I just felt like I'd lost my ability.

1022
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,152
Sorry about taking your bed from you.

1038
01:30:06,054 --> 01:30:07,760
I said I wasn't sure you could do it.

1043
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,054
Well, well, we've been expecting you.

1068
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:15,214
Oh, there's been a terrible accident.

1099
01:34:38,857 --> 01:34:40,883
Sir, is there any word about the boy?

1171
01:43:07,009 --> 01:43:09,432
My delivery service is a big success.

1173
01:43:11,583 --> 01:43:13,651
and everything is falling into place.

87
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,955
You're gonna find a city by the ocean?

89
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:22,644
Uh-huh. That's what I'm hoping anyway.

346
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:55,519
If you mind the store once in a while,

379
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,645
Dear, this lady is a customer of ours,

580
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,468
I'm sure it'll be a great party, Kiki.

666
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,533
It seems fine. Now you'd better hurry.

711
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,712
and maybe you should have some potpie.

920
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,291
I thought I'd come here and visit you.

959
01:24:49,555 --> 01:24:52,561
Good afternoon. I wanna say I'm sorry.

976
01:26:41,936 --> 01:26:43,799
Sometimes I'm unable to paint a thing.

1159
01:39:42,424 --> 01:39:44,968
She actually caught the boy in midair.

1175
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,856
but all in all, I sure love this city.

5
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:12,715
pushing the clouds out by this evening.

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,670
My goodness, but time flies so quickly.

82
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,224
Will you write us if you have the time?

92
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:28,247
But I'm not going just for a good time.

94
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,727
Yeah. Be sure to tell that to the boys.

147
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,974
I hope you don't have too tough a time.

152
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,055
What are we gonna do? We can't stay up!

249
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:20,848
Ma'am, you forgot your baby's pacifier.

383
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:28,404
Osono's told me great things about you.

388
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:40,439
I can get it there for you, guaranteed.

662
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:38,912
Check the potpie and see if it's ready.

697
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,257
Kiki, we were all so worried about you.

778
01:08:24,428 --> 01:08:26,153
Don't tell me you didn't hear about it?

818
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,967
Was it your magic that made us stay up?

822
01:11:54,809 --> 01:11:56,445
Will you keep an eye on my bike for me?

856
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:48,048
That's Kiki. I'll get her to come over.

857
01:13:48,153 --> 01:13:49,899
Hey, come over and meet the gang, Kiki.

902
01:20:05,726 --> 01:20:07,311
I was waving at you from the dirigible,

1059
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,898
She was kind to me and a very big help.

1080
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,966
and keep it from drifting into the air.

1090
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:28,894
Are you sure it's your friend, my dear?

1109
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,466
Huh? I'm not gonna give you my broom...

1167
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:57,838
Listen, we just got a letter from Kiki.

1
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,524
But, first, here's the weather forecast.

62
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,470
Just follow your heart and keep smiling.

90
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,227
Wow! You're gonna have such a good time.

91
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,189
I'm so jealous. You'll have so much fun.

99
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,419
Honey, it's too small to be really safe.

192
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,902
Um. Hi. My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.

201
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,369
zooming around on your broom back there.

223
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:58,154
Thank you for getting me out of trouble.

356
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:07,240
I'm sorry. We're still alive, aren't we?

437
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:45,740
Frankly, I think this is a major insult.

476
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,355
So, why was it alone in the forest, huh?

502
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,349
Better go get Jiji before it's too late.

541
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:42,164
But it always gets busy about this time.

545
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,954
And what am I supposed to do about that?

612
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,592
I think there's something wrong with it.

625
00:55:00,412 --> 00:55:03,699
Please accept it. This was all my fault.

632
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,975
I used to help my mom bake all the time.

633
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,282
But it's such a big job to build a fire.

639
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:48,842
I can't take her money and not help out.

821
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,684
My propeller. I have to go get it, Kiki.

874
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:08,159
Jiji, I think something's wrong with me.

907
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:18,811
What did you say? I can barely hear you.

911
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:33,053
I'm still in training to become a witch.

943
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,921
Come on, girl. Why not? We'll leave now.

965
01:26:02,772 --> 01:26:05,601
But I really haven't got the face right.

1011
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:54,516
Maybe I have to find my own inspiration.

1040
01:30:12,585 --> 01:30:15,435
Great. Stop there on your way back. Bye.

1097
01:34:00,749 --> 01:34:02,734
Release the helium from the tail. Quick!

132
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,147
I prefer to fly without being distracted.

229
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:17,062
You're kind of old-fashioned, aren't you?

347
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,001
I'll let you have the room and the phone.

348
00:29:57,155 --> 00:29:59,408
And I'll throw in a free breakfast, okay?

566
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:32,666
They tell me you have a delivery service.

614
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,683
It's old. Like me, it's seen better days.

864
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,776
Come on. I'll introduce you to everybody.

919
01:21:12,843 --> 01:21:14,261
Well, since you didn't come and visit me,

971
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,221
Come on, Kiki. You have got a great face.

1048
01:30:53,089 --> 01:30:55,550
My legs are bothering me more than usual.

1055
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:14,362
Would you do me a favor and open the box?

1146
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:45,486
Come on. Be a good broom. Hold on, Tombo.

55
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,196
Lilac would look prettier on me, or white.

163
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,415
Big deal. It's just a big puddle of water.

194
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,847
And we'd be honored if we could live here.

206
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,339
Of course, I'm going to tell your parents.

245
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,672
I'll bet there are bigger and better ones.

317
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:22,206
Jiji, I've decided not to leave this town.

396
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,928
I hope it'll be enough. What do you think?

397
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:03,281
This much for me? That's great. Thank you.

455
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,846
Could I please have your signature, ma'am?

489
00:42:57,848 --> 00:43:00,585
Hey! I know. How about we work out a deal?

628
00:55:09,698 --> 00:55:11,596
How about we use that old oven over there?

654
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:13,059
You're never gonna make the party on time.

687
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,585
Oh, no. I told Grandma I didn't want that.

698
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,790
And that poor boy waited such a long time.

740
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:29,330
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I'd overslept.

935
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,614
Hmm. I kind of thought you looked unhappy.

953
01:24:28,243 --> 01:24:30,569
Well, it's the way you're dressed and all.

1020
01:29:19,996 --> 01:29:21,614
Let's turn out the lights and go to sleep.

1034
01:29:58,701 --> 01:30:00,954
Well, you take plenty of time coming home.

1070
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,394
Midsummer is always when these winds come.

1089
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,598
The dirigible is being blown towards town.

1160
01:39:45,025 --> 01:39:48,044
You saw it all live as she saved his life.

67
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:10,252
Mom, didn't you say I could have the radio?

214
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,414
Miss. Wait up. I sure fooled that cop, huh?

338
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:39,169
I was planning on putting a phone upstairs.

368
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,154
Hey, there. Miss Witch, do you remember me?

422
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:16,159
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs. Really.

428
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,535
That gust of wind took them all the way up.

474
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,765
and, you see, it's mine and I need it back.

522
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:29,535
Jeff, shut the door when you're done. Okay?

554
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,127
And the address? Yes. The blue roof. Right.

592
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,230
We can't keep our next appointment waiting.

631
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:22,480
Well, if it burns firewood, I can help you.

637
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:39,047
You think so? All right then. Let's try it.

648
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,341
You think 40 minutes should be about right?

1046
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,569
Um. It's very nice to see you again, ma'am.

1108
01:35:17,823 --> 01:35:19,736
Please. I promise I'll bring it right back.

1122
01:37:05,634 --> 01:37:07,488
Get outta the way. The blimp's gonna crash!

1169
01:43:01,233 --> 01:43:03,610
"Dear Mother and Father, How are you doing?

1172
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:11,477
I've really started to gain some confidence

4
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,379
Mild winds will be blowing in from the west,

20
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:24,069
And I want to leave on the perfect midnight.

61
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,990
And I know having a good heart is important.

141
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,168
Um. Well, I haven't really decided that yet.

150
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,726
Jeez, what a snob. And did you see that cat?

179
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:44,920
Bless my hourglass. It's a real, live witch.

235
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,721
Your parents are here with you, aren't they?

319
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,928
who will like me and accept me for who I am.

342
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:47,106
What I think you should do is use our phone.

408
00:35:24,598 --> 00:35:26,474
I'm getting to like this town more and more.

429
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,903
Kiki, we've got a problem. The toy fell out.

496
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:26,231
Your birthday guests are gonna be here soon.

659
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,227
It's at 6:00, but it's only 15 minutes away.

722
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,826
That's right. When I told him you were sick,

771
01:08:00,092 --> 01:08:02,428
This is the engine of a man-propelled plane.

933
01:21:57,336 --> 01:22:00,466
- That bad, huh? - I'm not working much now.

1155
01:39:11,886 --> 01:39:15,453
Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up.

1163
01:39:55,318 --> 01:39:58,655
Kiki was so brave. She really saved the day.

126
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,371
I don't think I can handle it. Can you do it?

183
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:53,922
Nobody's seen one around here in a long time.

264
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:41,010
- Here you go. - Okay, I'd like one of those.

289
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,335
So, tell me, whereabouts are you two staying?

384
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:30,605
Do you think you can deliver this by tonight?

405
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:12,070
Now, let's see. Yup. It's just past the cape.

638
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,426
Don't blame me if you're late for your party.

657
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:22,291
Would you like some hot tea? It's no trouble.

691
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,077
Uh, will you please sign this receipt for me?

700
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,836
Kiki, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

727
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,721
You must be tired. You try to get some sleep.

758
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,956
Uh-uh. I'm looking for someone named Koppori.

937
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:24,810
Hey! Why don't you come and stay at my cabin?

143
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,434
I'm going home soon to show off my new skills.

616
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:38,816
It's my specialty, herring and pumpkin potpie.

618
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:44,020
I'll have to phone her and tell her I'm sorry.

800
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,235
Now, put your weight into it again. That's it!

927
01:21:33,273 --> 01:21:35,265
No tea, thanks, but some milk if you have any.

930
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,293
You're the spitting image of that stuffed cat.

931
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:49,877
I bet your name's Jiji, right? Coming through.

973
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,345
Now, don't you be nervous. Sit down over here.

987
01:27:15,371 --> 01:27:17,791
And then, pretty soon, you'll be flying again.

1029
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:45,428
And there it is, folks, the Spirit of Freedom.

1075
01:32:44,827 --> 01:32:48,090
Oh, look at that. It's completely upside down.

7
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:18,372
so if you have been planning something special,

97
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,236
That's the broom you're going to be leaving on?

98
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:46,239
Yup. I just made it this morning all by myself.

100
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,842
I'd rather you took my broom. I know it better.

130
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:06,414
Yup! How'd you guess? I just left home tonight.

131
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,592
Mmm-hmm. Would you mind turning off that radio?

200
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:39,242
You were almost responsible for a big accident,

389
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,393
Show me on the map where you want it delivered.

487
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,620
This is terrible. I can't deliver it like this.

581
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:27,249
No. But my problem is, what am I going to wear?

861
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:01,113
She made a delivery to my house on my birthday.

876
01:16:12,657 --> 01:16:15,214
but then I start feeling like such an outsider.

890
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:32,475
I can't understand anything he's trying to say.

901
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,634
Hi, Kiki. It's me, Tombo. Did you see me today?

1096
01:33:57,404 --> 01:34:00,635
Hold on there, son. Just hold your grip steady.

1106
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:16,947
Please, sir, may I use your broom for a minute?

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,052
Of course, they are. But Kiki will be just fine.

216
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,741
You'll be okay now. Worked out pretty good, huh?

535
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,971
told me she wants to do a drawing with me in it.

575
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:10,049
Will that be inside or outside city limits, sir?

586
00:51:41,196 --> 00:51:43,441
Can you watch the store until I get back, Osono?

607
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:03,191
Well, it's just as my great-grandmother told me.

816
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:36,752
I'm sorry, but when we flew up, I was so scared.

830
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:42,313
Gosh. You're so lucky, Kiki. I wish I could fly.

914
01:20:58,756 --> 01:21:01,243
Uh-huh. It's right over there across the street.

969
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:14,586
You'd make my life easier if you'd model for me.

986
01:27:12,216 --> 01:27:15,029
Doze off at noon. Don't even think about flying.

1045
01:30:43,487 --> 01:30:45,594
There are less than five minutes to takeoff now.

18
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:19,375
You mean tonight? Next month is what you told me.

106
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:07,057
Your broom is nice, but let's take your mother's.

120
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,256
May our little baby be well and have a safe trip.

234
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,070
Stay here tonight? I'm afraid I don't understand.

269
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:59,069
And that'll be all for you? All right. Thank you.

278
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:29,834
I really must do something to show you my thanks.

292
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,053
Why didn't you tell me you have no place to stay?

344
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:52,564
I'll make you a deal. Since I'm expecting a baby,

394
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,447
Oh! Well, I haven't really thought about a price.

470
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:44,059
Stop shouting. I'm on the roof. What do you want?

539
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,086
Wake up. You're supposed to be minding the store.

559
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,129
Oh, come on. You're not still mad at me, are you?

685
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:09,206
Oh. Well, I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way.

686
01:00:09,284 --> 01:00:11,453
But don't worry. The food came through all right.

899
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,679
I really don't know. Maybe if I make a new broom.

932
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:53,419
So, how's the delivery biz? You making any money?

1010
01:28:47,317 --> 01:28:50,498
I got so caught up in all the training and stuff.

1016
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,963
Today when I saw you, I thought, "I wanna paint."

1098
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:34,138
All citizens are kindly requested to remain calm.

1130
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:09,917
It's snagged on the building across the street...

1135
01:38:19,219 --> 01:38:21,887
That brave young boy is hanging on for dear life.

9
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:23,813
Tomorrow also looks good with clear skies and sun.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,520
Mom, it's a perfect midnight for me to leave home.

27
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,628
I know. She seems so young to be leaving home now.

73
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,182
You look just like your mother when she was young.

105
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,842
But I put so much work into this one. Right, Jiji?

175
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:57,730
But there may be some witches living here already.

218
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,787
Do you think maybe you can teach me how to fly it?

275
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:22,598
"Your new delivery girl is really quite special."”

279
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,575
Follow me. Bakery is downstairs. Upstairs is home.

301
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,977
Oh, my! It's a little bit dustier than I remember.

335
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,763
It's a great idea. Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

521
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,233
Ket, dear, go open the door. Jeff wants to go out.

534
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,811
By the way, that painter who found the stuffed cat

601
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:45,300
Come in, dear. Please make yourself right at home.

656
00:57:14,354 --> 00:57:17,739
It'll only take me 15 minutes if I fly there fast.

710
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,614
No, you're not. I'll bring some medicine right up,

713
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,128
Well, then, I'll just make something else for you.

765
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,714
About the other night. I'm sorry I didn't show up.

831
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:44,767
People like you can just fly away on a broomstick.

853
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,793
We're all gonna get to go for a ride in the blimp.

58
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,063
It's not really important what color your dress is.

80
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:52,073
If things don't work out, you can always come home.

272
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:14,089
The baby's mother told me to give you this message.

517
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,605
Well, I'm glad to see Jeff excited about something.

546
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,331
Well, I like pancakes, provided they're not burned.

619
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,165
I feel just awful having you come here for nothing.

649
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,415
Exactly right. So why don't we take a little break?

797
01:09:50,059 --> 01:09:52,650
Because otherwise we're gonna have trouble turning.

869
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,592
I'm not mad at all, Tombo. I have a lot on my mind.

873
01:15:24,982 --> 01:15:27,838
And don't forget that this summer, the hit music...

936
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:15,584
I didn't know things like that happened to witches.

954
01:24:31,911 --> 01:24:34,207
Tell me. What kind of a boy has these legs, mister?

1000
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,873
It's exactly the same, but then I found the answer.

1007
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:40,287
But we each need to find our own inspiration, Kiki.

1086
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:17,300
Oh, no, there's a young boy hanging onto the cable.

1127
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:46,187
We are listening to the sound of a helium gas leak.

64
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,945
And be sure to write home as soon as you're settled.

172
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:24,280
This is just the kind of place I've always imagined.

266
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:49,171
Mmm. These are nice and fresh. Just out of the oven.

293
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:33,829
We have a spare room in the attic. You can use that.

295
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:40,734
Why, of course. But we haven't introduced ourselves.

380
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:22,921
and we were talking about your new delivery service.

432
00:38:02,078 --> 00:38:04,873
If I were you, I wouldn't go back down there, again.

457
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:03,894
Uh-huh. But you be sure not to let it fly away, Ket.

473
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,517
Oh, well, you have a black cat in your cabin window,

490
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,709
So you're on your own at 13. That's pretty exciting.

567
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:35,199
Uh, oh. I'm sorry. Yes, of course, we can handle it.

583
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:33,844
Besides, it makes you look beautiful and mysterious.

678
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,461
We can beat the rain if we just fly a little faster.

841
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,055
Sorry. But at first I thought you were such a clown.

960
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,998
Why don't you go inside, and I'll go get some water?

975
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,822
Painting and magical powers seem very much the same.

982
01:27:01,192 --> 01:27:03,733
You know, it could be you're working at it too hard.

1084
01:33:10,171 --> 01:33:13,262
That's Tombo. That's my friend hanging on that rope.

1087
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,792
He's being lifted away together with the police car.

12
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,165
Hi, Miss Dora. Hey, Mom, it's gonna be clear tonight.

75
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:31,997
Dad, can you lift me up high, like when I was little?

121
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,693
I'm going to miss the wonderful sound of those bells.

220
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,399
Maybe you can sweep her off her feet with that broom.

376
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:57,058
There's a lady here who wants you to make a delivery.

491
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,004
To be completely independent and a witch. Impressive.

513
00:45:07,236 --> 00:45:09,699
Just don't forget to send your aunt a thank-you note.

664
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:45,998
Quickly! We have to hurry. Kiki is running very late.

995
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:58,586
I tried and tried, but nothing I did seemed any good.

1047
01:30:49,671 --> 01:30:52,948
I'm glad you came. Please excuse me for not standing.

1058
01:31:24,829 --> 01:31:27,605
Would you please bring this to a young delivery girl?

1158
01:39:39,242 --> 01:39:42,368
Now, she's bringing him down to land, safe and sound.

6
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,201
There'll be a beautiful full moon lighting up the sky,

142
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,695
Ah. Well, I'm nearly finished with my training period.

162
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:31,671
Jiji, you've gotta come see the ocean. It's beautiful.

280
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,064
Sit down and relax. Would you like some hot chocolate?

302
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,232
If I weren't about to have a baby, I'd help you clean.

333
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,979
Well, I really only have one skill, and that's flying.

438
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:48,718
Crows used to serve witches and do what you told them.

585
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,620
I almost forgot about that. It's already 4:00. Oh, no.

589
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,917
Please don't talk. I'm trying to fly this broom, okay?

680
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:54,031
Could we get out of the rain, please? I'm begging you.

724
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,204
Oh. And he said he wanted to visit you a little later.

835
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,812
Hey, wait. You can't not enjoy flying. You're a witch.

877
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:18,161
You should have seen how Tombo's friends looked at me.

13
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,376
And guess what? The radio says there'll be a full moon.

24
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,300
she has to leave home for a year to begin her training.

29
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:59,137
A little girl flew down from the sky on her broomstick.

31
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:09,523
Yes, but I could fly. Kiki barely knows how to do that.

79
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,467
How come you never told me you were growing up so fast?

202
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:44,405
But I'm a new witch, sir. We're supposed to fly around.

254
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:44,695
Excuse me. But would you like me to deliver it for you?

315
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,463
for the moment when the big blimp appears in our skies.

334
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:26,309
So I thought a delivery service wouldn't be a bad idea.

582
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:31,222
Kiki, you haven't got a problem. You look fine in that.

634
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:30,911
A great idea, ma'am. I never liked that electric thing.

985
01:27:08,907 --> 01:27:12,160
Then stop trying. Take long walks. Look at the scenery.

1039
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:11,461
She was really very insistent. What do you think, Kiki?

1164
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:04,030
Better call the hospital, honey. I think it's time now.

14
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,796
Did you borrow your father's radio again without asking?

19
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,901
Yeah. But the next full moon might be on a cloudy night.

56
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:41,618
Witches have worn this color for a very long time, Kiki.

323
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:24,844
How much do you think it would cost to get a phone here?

410
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:31,637
I can't wait to write Mom and Dad about my new business.

504
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,319
Don't worry. You've done enough. Now, go on and get him.

549
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,535
Her designs may be fabulous, but her cat's still a snob.

658
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:26,963
Dear! What did you say to me was the time of your party?

718
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,035
You should come and eat your meal while it's still warm.

721
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,900
Oh! You know that boy stopped by to see you again today.

741
01:05:29,484 --> 01:05:32,987
That's okay. Come down later. I have a favor to ask you.

760
01:07:17,054 --> 01:07:19,502
If you go around that way, I'll be right with you, okay?

769
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,050
The party was to celebrate the completion of this thing.

825
01:12:00,514 --> 01:12:03,279
That's why it busted. You wait here. I'll be right back.

858
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,822
We're all going for a tour inside the Spirit of Freedom.

893
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,858
What do you mean? You haven't lost your magic, have you?

993
01:27:48,732 --> 01:27:51,457
I'd paint all day until I fell asleep right at my easel.

996
01:28:00,144 --> 01:28:03,312
They were copies of paintings I'd seen somewhere before,

1019
01:29:17,358 --> 01:29:19,837
Hey, well, it's better than you cleaning my floor again.

1061
01:31:31,971 --> 01:31:35,165
Ah, yes, and can you find out when her next birthday is?

1137
01:38:24,543 --> 01:38:28,690
It's a bird? No, it's not a bird. It's a young girl. No.

184
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:57,014
That's great. Our trip is over. We're staying right here.

300
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,991
It may need a little dusting, but I think you'll like it.

440
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,533
How about if we go in after dark? Go in. Get it. Get out.

564
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:27,858
And, you know, everybody'd be really excited if you came.

568
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,378
It's very urgent this package arrive as soon as possible.

795
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:49,399
Lean your body to the inside when we go around the curve.

844
01:13:16,286 --> 01:13:18,645
"Quit looking up at the sky, and get back to your books."

979
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:54,715
Without even thinking about it, I used to be able to fly.

1129
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:58,206
It's falling. Too much gas has escaped. It's coming down!

1174
01:43:14,013 --> 01:43:17,171
There are still some times when I feel a little homesick,

23
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,240
It's one of our oldest customs that when a witch turns 13,

60
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,353
Well, I'm gonna be the very best witch that I can be, Mom.

103
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:58,251
You can rely on it time after time in any kind of weather.

195
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:20,046
Your city is SO amazing. And what a beautiful clock tower.

217
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:39,660
You gotta be a real witch, the way you can fly that broom.

343
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,093
You know, it will take some time to get regular customers.

355
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:04,666
Kiki, in the city, you can't just run out into the street.

372
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:39,875
Hey, wait. Come back, please. I didn't mean to insult you.

477
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,263
That's where I dropped it. Um. May I have it back, please?

510
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,320
He'll be upset when Ket wants to take it and play with it.

560
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,781
Listen, we're gonna have a huge party at the club tonight.

650
00:56:58,537 --> 00:57:01,021
Maybe I can help around the house while the pie is baking.

699
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:31,858
It doesn't matter anyway. I can't go in these wet clothes.

827
01:12:29,537 --> 01:12:32,223
Of course, you were flying since you were very young, huh?

898
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,024
I'll bet your powers come back after you've had some rest.

966
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,534
I've been waiting for you to come back so I can try again.

1003
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,406
When you fly, you rely on what's inside of you, don't you?

1065
01:31:52,282 --> 01:31:55,319
because she'll be able to give her a present to repay her.

1161
01:39:48,508 --> 01:39:51,134
That broom she used was mine. That was my broom, you know.

40
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,699
I'm gonna put my paws together
and pray you're not serious.

237
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:45,253
I've come to this town because
I'm a new witch in training.

251
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:29,039
Without this, the baby'll wake
up and cry all the way home.

318
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,331
Maybe I can stay and find some
other nice people like Osono

361
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,458
I wish I had something pretty
to wear. My dress is so ugly.

508
00:44:57,417 --> 00:45:00,197
He simply adores that stuffed
cat. He won't leave it alone.

613
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:25,345
It's got a mind of its own,
and it doesn't want to heat up.

627
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:09,603
Ma'am, since I don't have any
other jobs, maybe I can help.

851
01:13:30,132 --> 01:13:33,772
Something really great. You're
gonna love it. Come on over.

1069
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:28,019
Oh, darn this old thing. And
just when it was getting good.

28
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,672
I remember very well the exact
day you arrived in this town.

548
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,182
Beautiful, isn't she? They
tell me she's a clothes designer.

579
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,288
I got an invitation to go to
a party at Tombo's flying club.

723
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,543
he asked me how a witch could
catch cold in the first place.

766
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:44,481
Huh? Mmm-mmm. I'm sorry you
had to end up so sick like that.

834
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:52,584
Flying used to be fun until 1
started doing it for a living.

910
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:30,164
What's the matter, dear? Is
there anything I can do for you?

950
01:24:00,247 --> 01:24:02,531
Must've been blinded by two
beautiful girls in front of him.

964
01:25:59,014 --> 01:26:02,250
I have to say I became inspired
after the first time we met.

978
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:50,242
Kiki, please, don't move. It's
hard to draw a moving target.

1001
01:28:17,288 --> 01:28:20,187
You see, I hadn't figured out
what or why I wanted to paint.

1031
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,779
Well, it's been repaired, and
is now in final preparation...

1118
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:57,618
We gotta get up higher or else
we'll hit the tower, Captain.

3
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,853
thanks to a high-pressure front
moving in from the mountains.

85
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:15,125
Aren't you worried about Kiki
living in a big city all alone?

136
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,427
But since my skill is
fortune-telling, I can handle anything.

160
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:16,924
Oops! Sorry. We didn't mean to
fall asleep in your breakfast.

265
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:44,263
Yes, sir. Oh, hi, there. Come
in and wait a minute, will you?

404
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:04,477
Well, don't look now, but
that's an airplane flying under us.

452
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:49,187
After my sister telephoned, we
were wondering where you were.

464
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,905
I know you fell close by, so
you've got to be here somewhere.

895
01:19:05,548 --> 01:19:08,434
Well, I think I've got to take
a break from my delivery work.

926
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,218
Help yourself to some of these,
and I'll go make us some tea.

991
01:27:42,908 --> 01:27:46,396
When I was your age, I'd already
decided to become an artist.

1009
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,135
I guess I never gave much
thought to why I wanted to do this.

1035
01:30:01,037 --> 01:30:03,957
Oh, and by the way, that older
woman you made a delivery for?

1119
01:36:57,688 --> 01:37:01,622
There's not enough helium.
Jump onto the tower before we hit.

271
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,818
When I saw you fly off, I
thought for a second I was dreaming.

316
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,803
And so we're gonna go to Scott,
live, as he reports in from...

358
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,373
He's so cute. I hope he's still
invited to her birthday party.

365
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:59,530
Not much. Looks like all we
can afford to eat now is pancakes.

444
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:06,127
You can just pretend to be the
doll until 1 find the real one.

642
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:07,155
You're a very clever girl, my
dear. Your mother must be proud.

707
01:02:51,096 --> 01:02:54,397
Well, you flew in that weather
and you never really dried off.

923
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:23,485
Come on in, 'cause I'm done
now, and I can take a break, okay?

980
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:58,797
Now I'm trying to look inside
myself to find out how I did it.

32
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,943
And I have had no time to teach
her how to mix potions like me.

174
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:54,894
Look at this city. A place like
this would be great to live in.

322
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,494
there's never been a dirigible
this large and this safe before.

482
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,234
He keeps me company. I've gotten
sort of fond of him, you know?

767
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,960
Hey, come over to my place.
There's something I wanna show you.

783
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,353
I have to practice all the time
anyway. Gotta build up my legs.

912
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,790
If I lose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.

970
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:17,922
But I'm not very beautiful.
What do you want me to do that for?

1051
01:31:01,105 --> 01:31:05,710
Not yet. Barsa is absolutely
mad about lighter-than-air travel.

1133
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,391
The young boy has somehow managed
to keep his hold on the rope.

1138
01:38:29,016 --> 01:38:31,494
It's a young witch soaring
through the sky, and she's riding...

71
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:19,563
Well, now, you certainly look
very grown-up, my little princess.

199
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,929
Who do you think you are, jumping
out into the street like that?

203
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,057
You're supposed to obey the law.
I'm gonna have to write you up.

371
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,705
You can tell she's a witch "cause
she always wears a dark dress.

660
00:57:30,385 --> 00:57:35,170
Oh, my goodness. I'm afraid my
clock runs about 10 minutes slow.

728
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:05,622
Now, I'll just open up the window
so you'll have some fresh air.

1012
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:58,354
But am I ever going to find it?
And is it worth all the trouble?

1170
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:06,889
"I'm happy to say that Jiji and
I are doing fine at the moment."

224
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,615
But I really shouldn't be talking
to you, and you wanna know why?

256
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,654
The woman with the baby carriage
who just went around the corner.

285
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:08,278
So tell me if I'm right. I'm
guessing you're a witch in training.

288
00:24:15,475 --> 00:24:19,203
Now, take me, for instance. I
just met you and I know I like you.

689
01:00:14,855 --> 01:00:18,199
Oh, Grandma sent me another one
of her crummy herring pies again.

747
01:05:42,504 --> 01:05:46,914
Impossible. Work is work, and
make sure you deliver it in person.

994
01:27:52,054 --> 01:27:55,151
And then one day, for some reason,
I just couldn't paint anymore.

1026
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,195
You'll just have to wait for the
right inspiration to come along.

527
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,626
Kiki, if we ask him, I bet he'll
take the stuffed one back inside.

630
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:20,042
It used to bake beautiful bread,
but I haven't baked in it lately.

788
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:52,036
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her revved up. Let's go.

922
01:21:17,318 --> 01:21:20,180
Well, that's sort of a white lie.
I need to do some shopping, too.

974
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:37,569
Raise your chin up a little. Look
straight ahead. Now, don't move.

93
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:31,456
In order to be a good witch, I
have to train a year away from home.

1006
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:36,490
That same spirit is what makes me
paint and makes your friend bake.

1128
01:37:46,234 --> 01:37:49,388
The condition of the boy is
unknown, but from where I'm standing...

35
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,801
Hurry up! We always said we'd
leave on the perfect night. Didn't we?

222
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,469
You know, miss, I love flying,
too. Can I see your broom? Hey, wait!

555
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,862
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I have it
all. And thank you very much, ma'am.

561
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:16,547
It's called the Aviation Club,
and we'd really like for you to come.

774
01:08:09,531 --> 01:08:13,018
I'm planning on flying this thing
during most of my summer vacation.

1103
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:04,943
Get on the sidewalks. You there.
Young lady. Don't block the street.

1156
01:39:21,603 --> 01:39:25,329
She got him. She saved the boy.
I've never seen anything so amazing.

109
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:14,112
can't you make yourself another
fine broom when you get settled down?

305
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:07,595
Water and bathroom are downstairs.
Give a shout if you need anything.

714
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,642
How about some nice hot oatmeal
with honey in it? You want some, too?

829
01:12:35,296 --> 01:12:38,429
My mother used to take me with
her. She taught me never to be scared.

1081
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:03,139
But it's extremely doubtful whether
or not this can actually be done.

37
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:36,446
And if we put it off for a month,
and I find some wonderful boyfriend,

336
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,197
And since you're staying right
here, I can be your very first account.

481
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:38,753
Well, why didn't you tell me sooner
why you needed it in such a hurry?

826
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:29,132
How great would it be to go around
the world in a dirigible like that?

1005
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,932
Trusting your spirit. Yes, yes!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

253
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:36,667
I'm sorry, folks. But could you
wait just a minute? I'll be right back.

726
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:59,061
Well, I thought you might feel that
way, so I turned him down politely.

875
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:12,336
I meet a lot of people, and at first
everything seems to be going okay,

387
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:38,158
But something came up at work, and
I can't make it to the party on time.

553
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:34,352
Yes, ma'am, 4:30 will be a perfect
time to pick it up. If you'll just...

563
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:24,929
It's a serious club for kids who
are into flying and aircraft and stuff.

776
01:08:20,485 --> 01:08:23,141
Why don't we go down to the beach
where that dirigible landed yesterday?

773
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,419
We're going to assemble the wings
and the frame at somebody else's house.

134
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,783
Could you tell me? Is it really hard
to get settled into a brand new city?

286
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,672
I really love it here. But people
don't seem to like witches in this town.

403
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:59,159
This is my first job, and I do not
want to be stopped by that traffic cop.

424
00:37:27,824 --> 00:37:31,001
Well, it's your fault. The geese were
kind enough to warn us of that wind.

903
01:20:07,394 --> 01:20:10,390
'cause the captain let me come into
the control cabin during the test run.

939
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,925
It'll probably make you feel better.
Your boss would let you have a break.

1100
01:34:41,277 --> 01:34:44,940
All I know is that the radio said
that the police car dropped into a pool.

42
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:49,292
You know, ever since I turned 13,
I've been excited about making this trip.

1117
01:36:50,341 --> 01:36:53,510
If the wind doesn't shift, the Spirit
of Freedom will smash into the tower!

33
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:17,504
Hmm. Young people are all the same.
They all want to do something different.

486
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,737
Ooh, it must have been the crows. They
were making such a big fuss over him.

595
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:18,151
My name's Kiki, and someone telephoned
for a delivery service, so here I am.

681
00:58:54,153 --> 00:58:59,107
We can't. That'll make us even later,
and the food will get cold if we stop.

1116
01:36:47,028 --> 01:36:50,316
And look! The young boy is safe, but
he's clutching that rope for dear life.

34
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,866
But I hope you at least get to teach
her the potion that cures my rheumatism.

52
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,143
Hi, Mom, it's me. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

547
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:05,529
Look, fur ball, when you get as fat
and round as a pancake, you see if I care.

588
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,186
You were so mad at that boy. I don't
understand why you're going to his party.

1079
01:32:54,186 --> 01:32:58,102
A desperate last-ditch effort is being
made to tie the dirigible to the ground

838
01:13:03,563 --> 01:13:07,341
Why don't I bring you here whenever you
want and train myself at the same time?

837
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:03,421
But I'm very glad I came with you today.
I feel much better sitting by the beach.

611
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:16,013
I'm so sorry, but that special treat you
were supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.

615
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:34,605
I was hoping you'd be able to deliver a
dish to my granddaughter's birthday party.

1064
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:52,257
Of course, I will. And maybe the young
girl will want to know the lady's birthday,

263
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:21,174
Sorry to surprise you, but the lady in
the bakery asked me to return this pacifier.

544
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:54,786
Jiji, if nobody comes in, I'm gonna have
to eat pancakes forever and be fat, fat, fat.

1083
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:10,043
The tremendous lifting power of the helium
balloon is lifting the police patrol car...

881
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:03,224
Hey! You know, you can't be late for every
meal just because you have a new girlfriend.

48
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:05,501
Well, yeah, but what happened to the camping
trip we were supposed to take this weekend?

320
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,732
...and the ship making some kind of landing
just so that everyone can get a closer look.

1115
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:46,997
Ladies and gentlemen, it appears that the
blimp is heading directly for the clock tower.

30
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:05,078
And I was certain she was much too young to
hold such an important job as resident witch.

572
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,941
Well, I hope you make up your mind by 6:00.
"Cause that's when I'll be by to pick you up.

225
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:04,569
It's very rude to talk to a girl before you've
been introduced and before you know her name.

36
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,879
Uh-uh. Our plan was that we would stick around
for another month and play it safe. I like that plan.

1030
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:50,510
Recently downed in a spectacular forced landing
due to torrential rains just outside the city limits.

1013
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:04,035
Well, for example, there were quite a few times
when I thought of painting something over that painting.

896
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:13,352
But I promise I'll be really good with my work in
the bakery, so please let me stay in the room upstairs.
