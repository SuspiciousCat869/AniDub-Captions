1
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Are you all right?

2
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,750
Keep quiet now

3
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,490
or we'll be in real trouble.

4
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,590
Don't be afraid.

5
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,790
You're one of us.

6
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,940
My name's Stormend.

7
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,350
And what's yours?

8
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,930
Come on, Hei.

9
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,600
Through here.

10
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,180
Come on down.

11
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,490
The humans,
they abandoned this place.

12
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,890
That's Void,

13
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,800
he's charging
his spiritual energy.

14
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,770
Hey, you're back!

15
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,970
Well someone's home early.

16
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,610
Hm?

17
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,080
A kitten?

18
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,580
Meet Skytiger and Bamboo.

19
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,090
What are you doing
bringing a cat back here?

20
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,820
Hmm?

21
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,830
I'm not a cat, I'm a spirit.

22
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,670
Hmm. Mm-hm.

23
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,640
- Ah!
- What's with the ears?

24
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,840
Huh?

25
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,000
This form's not perfect yet.

26
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,340
Aw, aren't you cute?

27
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,580
Skytiger, give the kid
a friendly welcome.

28
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,840
Meat.

29
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,950
Master Infinity, I found him.

30
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,250
I found Stormend.

31
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,720
To our new friend, Hei, cheers.

32
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,160
- Hei?
- Hm?

33
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,130
I can tell you're on edge.

34
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,840
Let me show you something.

35
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,970
Huh?

36
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,170
Hm?

37
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,940
Ah!

38
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,810
Oh?

39
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,110
Ah!

40
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,390
You're pretty good with kids.

41
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,290
Wanna help make snowflakes?

42
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,790
No.

43
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,830
- Oh?
- Meat.

44
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,970
Mmm!

45
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,910
The meat stole your show.

46
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,710
Ah...

47
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,380
Hei, you know
you can stay with us.

48
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,180
I wha...? Uh, stay?

49
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
- That a no?
- Uh...

50
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,220
I'd love to!

51
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,920
From now on, this is your home.

52
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,430
Yeah!

53
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,500
- Booze?
- Hm?

54
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,700
Not for him.

55
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,270
Come.

56
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,380
What do you think?

57
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,910
- Go on.
- Ah?

58
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,910
This room's all yours.

59
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,260
I'll leave you to it,
get some sleep.

60
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,010
Hei?

61
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,910
Infinity, you're a human.

62
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,150
Why are you helping the Guild?

63
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,880
Not here to explain myself.

64
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,850
I'm taking you back.

65
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,220
Run!

66
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,150
Ah!

67
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,350
Hei, come back here!

68
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,100
- Get moving!
- What?

69
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,000
Go!

70
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,570
Now!

71
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,000
Where is this?

72
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,970
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

73
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,370
We lost Hei
and we lost the portal.

74
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,010
How could one human
send us packing?

75
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,220
It's Infinity,
their best Enforcer.

76
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,650
He's no ordinary human.

77
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,190
So we're gonna let him take Hei?

78
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,520
Of course not.

79
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,860
Can you track him?

80
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,320
Mm-hm,
got a mark on Hei already.

81
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,190
That's a start.

82
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,590
Infinity's gonna take him
to the Guild.

83
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,100
We can stop him.

84
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,130
We're no match for him.

85
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,300
Just find him.

86
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,530
I'll take care of Infinity.

87
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,270
You mean...?

88
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,110
I'm tired of waiting.

89
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,510
I see.

90
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,180
Leave finding Hei to us.

91
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,990
Thanks, I'm counting on you.

92
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,190
Where are we anyway?

93
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,520
I set this escape route
up last time

94
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,530
just in case
we got ambushed again.

95
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,730
My seeds can detect anything
within a 500-yard radius.

96
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,660
I'll know
when they leave the island.

97
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,300
How do you know where
they're going to leave from?

98
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,570
Well to be honest, I don't.

99
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,240
We'll have to spread these
along the coastline.

100
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,470
Got it.

101
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,310
Tiger, we're gonna need
some help.

102
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,440
Get your friends.

103
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,040
Stormend!

104
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,280
Stormend!

105
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,150
Stormend, Bamboo, Skytiger!

106
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,560
Stormend, Bamboo, Stormend!

107
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,120
So you don't know
how to leave either?

108
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,560
Your friends ran.
I'm taking you to the Guild.

109
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,330
Be good, you hear me?

110
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,890
Stormend?

111
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
Stormend?

112
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,430
Stormend?

113
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,470
Stormend?

114
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
You saved me
the trouble of looking for you.

115
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,280
We're about to set off.

116
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:19,910
Hm?

117
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
Behave yourself.

118
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,330
Just sit and wait.

119
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,730
Do you... hear me?

120
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,370
<i>From now on,
this is your home.</i>

121
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,940
- Mr. Min.
- Huh? Stormend.

122
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,000
It's been so long.

123
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,910
You looking to share some tea?

124
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,840
I have a favor to ask.

125
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,450
If the Guild permits it,
I'm happy to help.

126
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,350
What'd you need?

127
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,890
Stormend, there is no shame
in moving on.

128
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,890
Sometimes we must let go.

129
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,630
I know.

130
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,400
Now, may I borrow something,
Mr. Min?

131
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,990
Do you prefer being tied up?

132
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,760
And the coconuts?

133
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Master!

134
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,720
Good morning, Master.

135
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,720
- Maomao.
- Yes?

136
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,820
- Help me up please.
- Sure.

137
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,790
You broke my purple clay teapot.

138
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,860
My apologies, Master.

139
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,500
Hm?

140
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,970
What awful weather.

141
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,820
Hm.

142
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,660
A dragon.

143
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Well, that's rare.

144
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,500
Is this...

145
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,870
The Zone?

146
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,560
What's your name?

147
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,630
It's Hei.

148
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,170
Hei, huh?

149
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,670
Try to use your power again.

150
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,180
What power?

151
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,950
Wha... ah!

152
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,960
- Get in.
- Uh!

153
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,690
Just try and make me!

154
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,030
Mm? Hm?

155
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,370
Whoa, what is this place?

156
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,650
This is my Spiritual Space.

157
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,650
What?

158
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,920
Every living thing
has a Spiritual Space

159
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,950
to call their own,

160
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,920
a place to sow our spirit.

161
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,060
These places are the source
of all life and power.

162
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,760
Do I have a Spiritual Space too?

163
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,260
Of course.

164
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,000
And does it have a house in it?

165
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,960
No, yours is empty.

166
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,200
This is my childhood home.

167
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,100
I've been keeping it here.

168
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,370
Got any food in there?

169
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,370
No.

170
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,810
Give me your hand.

171
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,940
Mm? What for?

172
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,180
Hm?

173
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,390
Maybe I was wrong.

174
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,330
What the heck is
this crazy place? Huh?

175
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,370
- Hei.
- Huh?

176
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,900
You want to learn
how to control metal?

177
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,310
Huh?

178
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,310
I checked out your magic system.

179
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,010
You're Metal-type,

180
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,880
just like me.

181
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,010
But why teach me?

182
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,220
Call it payback.

183
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,380
Huh?

184
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Because you're gifted.

185
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,120
What?

186
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,030
Let's start by understanding

187
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,260
the properties of metal.

188
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,830
It's salty.

189
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,370
That might just be my sweat.

190
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I don't want your training!

191
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,000
It's up to you.

192
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:27,090
I won't force you.

193
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,990
<i>It couldn't hurt
to try, right?</i>

194
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,390
<i>Once I've mastered the power,
I can use it to escape.</i>

195
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,900
Forcing it won't work.

196
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,840
Then what should I do?

197
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,840
Come here.

198
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,480
Hm.

199
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,020
Yeah!

200
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,080
He really is gifted.

201
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,040
Excuse me.

202
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,940
We're closed for the night.

203
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,910
Are you Brush Tiger?

204
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,980
And you are?

205
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,190
Well, young man, if there's
anything that interests you

206
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,120
in my humble shop,
please do let me know.

207
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,750
Call them off.

208
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,020
Come on out or
I'll tear this place down.

209
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,340
So that's your true form?

210
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,440
What do you want?

211
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,770
Your name's Infinity, right?

212
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,100
Yes.

213
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,570
I thought you could fly.

214
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,310
Why don't we just fly back?

215
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,240
I can't fly that far.

216
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,650
Useless.

217
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,750
Why were you chasing Stormend?

218
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,320
Hey, you listening?

219
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,160
Hm.

220
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,270
Once we've landed,
can you let me go?

221
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,740
Sure.

222
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,610
Hm? Really?

223
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,180
Do you mean it?

224
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,580
Say something!

225
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,120
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

226
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,560
Pipe down.

227
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,830
Found him!

228
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,430
Here's the mainland,

229
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,300
here's the island and here's us.

230
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,640
They deviated
about a thousand miles south.

231
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,840
He has no sense of direction.

232
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,740
The fairy fish can't keep up.

233
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,410
They'll lose them before long.

234
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,480
What Guild is nearest
to their landing?

235
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,610
Longyou.

236
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,580
Then that's where we're going.

237
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,710
But that's Guild turf.

238
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
So we stop them
before they arrive.

239
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,450
Mm.

240
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:39,860
Longyou.

241
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,680
We made it.

242
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,380
Huh?

243
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,790
- Land ho!
- Hm?

244
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,790
Dry land at last!

245
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,790
- Woo-hoo!
- Hey!

246
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,590
Hm?

247
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,890
What are you doing here?

248
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Hello. What is this place?

249
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,470
Uh, Xiaoxiang Island.

250
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,940
Or rather which province?

251
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,500
Mm.

252
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,770
You're stowaways, ain't you?

253
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,240
No, just lost.

254
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,940
And you're just wandered
into another province?

255
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,310
Let me explain.

256
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,840
Explain, my foot!

257
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Hey, call the cops.

258
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,380
Hm?

259
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,850
I am a stowaway.

260
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,850
So please,
tell me which province is this?

261
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,890
Fulan province.

262
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,770
Well, I'll see you around.

263
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,270
- Let me buy you a meal.
- Hm?

264
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,910
I'll take this one and that one.

265
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,770
Oh, this too, this one,
one of those, this one,

266
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,810
and definitely this!

267
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,810
Our food's all made
with local ingredients

268
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,650
but we specialize in seafood.

269
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,750
Can I interest you in...

270
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,450
Nope.

271
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,520
Okay.

272
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,930
If there's
one thing that the humans

273
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
are good at, it's cooking!

274
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,340
We accept mobile pay.

275
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,720
This pendant's
my greatest treasure.

276
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,590
It should be more than enough
to pay for this meal.

277
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,830
Mm?

278
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,440
Stop those dine and dashers!

279
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,480
Dine and dash?

280
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,740
I could have done that
when I was alone and homeless.

281
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,880
That was an accident.

282
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,820
Anyway, later.

283
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,890
Where are you going?

284
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,320
To find Stormend.

285
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,330
Hey, come with me.

286
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,600
- Huh?
- To the Guild.

287
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,470
Get these off of me!

288
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,610
You told me you were gonna
let me go, dang it!

289
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,380
I lied.

290
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:43,980
I'm sorry.

291
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,910
I can't let you go.

292
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,080
All you want
is a place to stay, right?

293
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,880
Not if I gotta stay
with you humans!

294
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,680
Mm.

295
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,790
It's called the Spirit Guild

296
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,320
because it was formed
by your kind.

297
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,760
But aren't you a human?

298
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,860
Right now
I'm more spirit than human.

299
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
It's not like I live there.

300
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,960
I'm just an Enforcer.

301
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,730
What's an Enforcer?

302
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,800
Like a law Enforcer.

303
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,500
Huh?

304
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,440
I'm like a helper
to the spirits.

305
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,610
Are there other humans
in the Guild?

306
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,010
- Some.
- I'm not going.

307
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,710
You can either come along
with me nicely

308
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,580
- or I can hogtie you.
- Hm!

309
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,520
You're a jerk!

310
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,760
Let me go!

311
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,130
I'll punish you
if you try to run again.

312
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,370
I won't so just put me down!

313
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,940
You need to hide your tail too.

314
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,000
Let me go!

315
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,010
Your two-hour
punishment begins now.

316
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,440
Let me go!

317
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,000
Hm? Ah?

318
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,900
Huh?

319
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:20,940
Ah.

320
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,820
Hm!

321
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,930
Why are you always so mad at me?

322
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,730
'Cause you're a bad guy.

323
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,860
So is Stormend.

324
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,960
No, he isn't!

325
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,870
You didn't know him
for that long.

326
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,440
He gave me food
and he gave me a home.

327
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,700
- I gave you food too.
- Uh...

328
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,440
Hm.

329
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,680
It's not the food's fault.

330
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,820
What was this bird?

331
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,190
Don't think the bird's
the problem.

332
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,810
Why don't you fly over?

333
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,510
Flying without
permission is forbidden.

334
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:35,980
Lame.

335
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,710
Ah!

336
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,020
- No more drain pipes.
- Hm?

337
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,960
Oh.

338
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,270
Mm?

339
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,800
Mm-mm!

340
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,020
You want revenge on humanity?

341
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:50,820
Of course.

342
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,660
So what, you'll kill them all?

343
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,230
Not sure yet.

344
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,100
I just want to go
back to the forest.

345
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,900
Hm.

346
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,140
Quit it!

347
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,210
- They're done.
- Hm?

348
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,740
These should be good.

349
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,350
I guess not.

350
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,890
How do we look?

351
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,290
Pretty good.

352
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,760
They're not here yet.

353
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,760
Then let's start our
search by fanning out from here.

354
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,930
Let no one see you

355
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,130
and use extra caution
near the landing point.

356
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,500
What about Stormend?

357
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,830
We hold them
until Stormend arrives.

358
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,380
Have you heard of The Zone?

359
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,010
No.

360
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,720
It's another power you possess.

361
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,850
The Zone?

362
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,050
Is it cool?

363
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,390
It's like my Devour,
a Space-type power,

364
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,860
from the idiosyncrasies
of your Spiritual Space.

365
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,200
My Spiritual Space, huh?

366
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,970
Question, can't we just sleep

367
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,830
in that little cabin
you have in yours?

368
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,170
I can, you can't.

369
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,910
Thanks a lot.

370
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,280
Entering a Spiritual Space
can't be taken lightly.

371
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:17,980
Why?

372
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,980
The owner of a space
is essentially it's God,

373
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,850
go in rashly,
and they'll trample you.

374
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,760
Already feels like
you're trampling me out here.

375
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,320
Hardly.

376
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,760
Remember when we were in there?

377
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,460
How I teleported and moved you?

378
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,090
Mm.

379
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,860
You can't out here?

380
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,430
Right.

381
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,730
I only have those powers
in my Spiritual Space.

382
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,940
I could basically
turn you into a puppet in there.

383
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,270
Mm.

384
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,170
Just forget it.

385
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,410
Now you don't wanna go in?

386
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,210
Hm!

387
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,190
All right.

388
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,860
- That's enough.
- Huh?

389
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,730
The boy was trying to sleep.

390
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,000
Infinity, I missed you so much.

391
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,470
Hey! What's going on?

392
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,010
Relax, they're friends.

393
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,840
Did you take on an apprentice?

394
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,180
I'm not his apprentice.

395
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,910
No.

396
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,280
Hm...

397
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,950
Liar, he's a Metal and
Space hybrid like you.

398
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,290
Hm? Are you spirits?

399
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,820
Mm-hm.

400
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,460
They're all Enforcers
for the Guild.

401
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,200
Even spirits run errands
for 'em.

402
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,460
Huh? What do you mean, errands?

403
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,770
Enforcer is a sacred title!

404
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,970
He's not wrong.

405
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:52,670
- What?
- What?

406
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,070
Anyway, I'm going to bed.

407
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,450
Weren't you sent
to capture Stormend?

408
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,090
Yeah, he got away.

409
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,550
Then why haven't you
told the Guild?

410
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,020
You're dragging your feet.

411
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:09,820
What are you after?

412
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,330
I wanted to show him around.

413
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,890
Hm, I can see
why you're tempted,

414
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,000
it's rare to find
such a perfect type match.

415
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,970
Been a century
since your last apprentice.

416
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,900
Don't overthink it.

417
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,140
<i>I just don't
want him to go astray.</i>

418
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,310
You out on a mission?

419
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,010
Yes, but Flow
sensed your presence

420
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,910
and insisted we pay you a visit.

421
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,350
She dragged us
all the way up here

422
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,480
in the vain hope that she...

423
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,050
You have something
you want to say, old man?

424
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,920
I wouldn't dare, sweetie.

425
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,050
Hm!

426
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:46,990
Oh, by the way, do you plan
on taking Hei to the Guild?

427
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,030
Mm-hm.

428
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,030
I'll be long gone by the time
he even gets to the place.

429
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,970
Hm?

430
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,870
It seems we have a split vote.

431
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,010
I bet he hasn't told you
a thing about the Guild.

432
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,210
Don't mind that sad sack.

433
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,410
The Guild's a spectacular place.

434
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,120
They offer guidance
for little spirits, like you,

435
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,920
but they also help us old fogies

436
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,290
adapt to the modern world.

437
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,120
Then why are they after
Stormend?

438
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,360
Stormend?

439
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,000
Stormend.

440
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,630
I don't bear him any ill will.

441
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,070
It's his hatred of humanity.

442
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,570
He can't keep himself
from crossing the line.

443
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,510
We have attempted to talk to him
time and time again,

444
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,280
but he just keeps
shutting us out.

445
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,950
But the humans are evil.

446
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,080
Humans are like spirits.

447
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,150
They're not all bad or good.

448
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,520
And sometimes it's hard
to distinguish the two,

449
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,620
complex as we are.

450
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,090
The human-spirit relationship

451
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,860
has finally reached
a delicate balance,

452
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,060
a balance
we have to work to protect.

453
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,000
Why do we have to
get along with humans?

454
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,130
Do you actually like them?

455
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,470
Sure do!

456
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,170
Not really.

457
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,700
Many spirits prefer to stay

458
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,870
as far from human society
as they can,

459
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,570
but even living in their cities,

460
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,470
doesn't mean
we have to love them.

461
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,010
Look at those two,
they even hate Infinity.

462
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
I just mad I haven't
kicked his ass yet.

463
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,150
- You said it!
- You two are so shameless.

464
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,050
Hey cat, you want to come hang
with some real spirits?

465
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,520
Nah, you guys are wimps.

466
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,490
I don't much like
being around humans myself.

467
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,300
I use to have a cave house.

468
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,400
There was nothing like it.

469
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,130
Then humans turned it into
a tourist attraction

470
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,270
about 10 years ago.

471
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,370
Can't go home without a ticket.

472
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:36,870
It was deep in the wilderness.

473
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,710
I lived there
for hundreds of years.

474
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,510
Finding a place
out of humanity's reach

475
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,680
nowadays is impossible.

476
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,480
I honestly love humans.

477
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,510
- Uh.
- They're so creative.

478
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,380
It's like they invent
new gadgets every day.

479
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,950
Like this, it's a sound
transmission device.

480
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,950
And take a look,

481
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,290
it does so much more than that.

482
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,120
A lot of spirits at the Guild
are obsessed with them.

483
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,220
Hm?

484
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,030
Humans are so interesting.

485
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,030
And none more than our Infinity.

486
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,030
You can say that again.

487
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,200
Listen Hei, Infinity's done
so much for us spirits.

488
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,970
Please don't
hold anything against him.

489
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,940
Go check out the Guild.

490
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,070
If you don't like it

491
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:16,380
no one will
stop you from leaving

492
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,250
because we've got your back.

493
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,050
Okay, raise your cups,
everyone.

494
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,080
Oh, one sec.

495
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,280
You too, Infinity.

496
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,320
Hm.

497
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,320
You guys too, get over here.

498
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,760
Well, I won't turn down a drink.

499
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,030
Too true!

500
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:36,760
Cheers!

501
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,070
We should probably
be on our way.

502
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,080
Bye, Hei.

503
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,280
I'll see you again at the Guild.

504
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,710
Hold on.

505
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,020
I need cash.

506
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,720
Money is the best.

507
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,330
Our riches have changed you.

508
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,000
...ride that?

509
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,300
We could even buy our own.

510
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,780
Hey gorgeous!

511
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,120
Why didn't we get one of those?

512
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,620
I can't drive.

513
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,090
You moron.

514
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,700
Listen up in there!

515
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,140
We've got you surrounded!

516
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:50,740
Hm?

517
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,110
You have to surrender now!

518
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,670
You wanna bet?

519
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:55,740
Hm?

520
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,050
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

521
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,620
I, uh, surrender?

522
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,490
- You full?
- Mm-hm.

523
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,320
You said I'm a Space type

524
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,330
so why can't I use those powers?

525
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,530
Give it time.

526
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,770
You think I can master Devour
like you?

527
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,340
You only get one Space power.

528
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,270
So no.

529
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,210
Then is The Zone more powerful
than your Devour?

530
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,810
Depends on who's using them.

531
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,880
That's a yes.

532
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,740
You still have a lot to learn.

533
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,550
You're jealous.

534
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,480
Mind your manners.

535
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,650
You're a human,
why are you so powerful?

536
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:40,850
Wanna be my apprentice?

537
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,840
Mm. Oh.

538
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,700
Mm?

539
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,270
Ah! Mm.

540
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,890
Mm?

541
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:24,830
Hei?

542
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,470
If you end up hating the Guild,
I'll let you go.

543
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,570
I've heard that one before.

544
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,780
You really are talented and
you will grow up to be strong.

545
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,780
But if you do choose to leave,

546
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,720
I hope you use
your powers for good.

547
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,290
I never do anything bad.

548
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,820
Can you tell the difference?

549
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,460
Of course.

550
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,530
Yeah, I believe you.

551
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,570
Stormend isn't a bad person.

552
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:04,640
Neither are you.

553
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,910
But you're not great either.

554
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:18,780
Hm?

555
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,360
Now this is a fine mess.

556
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,560
You'd never seen him before?

557
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,390
Mm-mm.

558
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,490
Oh, I got it.

559
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,860
Hold this and think of his face.

560
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,440
- Hm?
- Okay, let me see.

561
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:40,910
Huh?

562
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,310
Was this him?

563
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,810
Yeah, a Wood-type spirit.

564
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,810
It was Stormend.

565
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:47,850
Stormend?

566
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:51,620
He's never raised a hand
against a spirit before.

567
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,590
He even stole my power.

568
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,560
What? Does he have that ability?

569
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,020
Hm,
not to my knowledge.

570
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,660
An impostor maybe.

571
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,460
Or he's hidden this from us.

572
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,870
Stealing powers
is strictly forbidden.

573
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,700
But are we
jumping to conclusions?

574
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,400
We'll know the truth
soon enough.

575
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,840
Flow, we're the fastest,
let's go on ahead.

576
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:12,870
Right.

577
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:14,810
Mr. Brush Tiger,
allow Bless to escort you

578
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,910
to the Spirit Guild.

579
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:17,480
Okay.

580
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:18,810
Let's go.

581
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,420
How much farther?

582
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,550
We'll see it
once we're through the tunnel.

583
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,770
Come on out.

584
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,600
Is this it?

585
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,440
We're out of gas.

586
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,340
We'll take the subway.

587
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,680
The what?

588
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,780
It's like a really long car.

589
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,650
Why, you scared?

590
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,550
No.

591
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,050
Hop on.

592
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,290
Only 'cause I hate
walking on the street.

593
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,320
Sure.

594
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,960
So this is definitely
a human city, right?

595
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,800
Correct.

596
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,900
Most of the Guild branches
are in cities.

597
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,440
This city is called Longyou.

598
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,970
It's home to 10 million people
and 500 spirits.

599
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:20,740
That many?

600
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,880
<i>Plenty of spirits love cities</i>

601
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,950
<i>and the variety of lifestyles
they provide.</i>

602
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,980
<i>They can live in
whatever form they want</i>

603
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,950
<i>provided they follow
one key rule,</i>

604
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,920
keep a low profile.

605
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:34,850
Master Infinity!

606
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,860
I sensed you from miles away.

607
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:38,890
What are you up to?

608
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:40,760
Flower delivery.

609
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,430
Hm?

610
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,760
Adorable!

611
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,400
Where did you adopt him?

612
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,400
- I'm not a pet, I'm a hostage.
- Hm?

613
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,840
Ah, so you're one of us.

614
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,840
My bad, didn't realize,
no hard feelings.

615
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,510
You're an Enforcer too?

616
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,150
Hm?

617
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,550
No, nothing like that.

618
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,580
I'm just a junior flower spirit.

619
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,780
Master Infinity adopted me too.

620
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,050
Are you heading to the Guild?

621
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,590
Yes, I'm taking Hei there.

622
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,590
It'll be nice
to have you around for a while.

623
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,800
Oh, right, my deliveries.

624
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,960
I better go Master Infinity.

625
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,830
I'll see you at the Guild, Hei!

626
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,970
Oh yeah,
and welcome to the big city.

627
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:25,840
You're gonna love it here.

628
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,910
Bye-bye!

629
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,910
Are there are a lot of
spirits in human cities?

630
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,610
Tons.

631
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,880
Shall we?

632
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,720
We're almost there.

633
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,550
Uh, cats aren't allowed
on the subway.

634
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:43,860
Oh.

635
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,920
What's this?

636
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,090
Uh!

637
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,440
Are we really
under the ground right now?

638
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,710
We got him.

639
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,610
Oh?

640
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:17,860
There really is a car
and it's so long.

641
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,430
Wrong way.

642
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,700
It's there.

643
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,630
That one goes
in a different direction.

644
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,030
Come get in line,
don't wander off.

645
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:39,850
Don't hurt them.

646
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,180
They're being controlled.

647
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,580
But for what? Hm?

648
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:45,720
What's happening?

649
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,090
Teleportation!

650
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,020
Hm?

651
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,090
Night-night.

652
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,830
He knows where we are.

653
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,970
My bad,
could only warp him so far.

654
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,100
They'll stop the train
if we make a scene.

655
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,970
I'll control the engineer.

656
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,800
You do your thing.

657
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,980
Sure, Roger that.

658
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,750
Hm?

659
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:21,620
Hey, mister.

660
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,790
That kid can't be comfy
like that.

661
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,930
Sorry, sir, but are you
that boy's guardian?

662
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,770
Hey, is that your kid
or not?

663
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,710
Sir, please answer
the question.

664
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,080
Hey, say something.

665
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,780
Probably human traffickers.

666
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:47,750
What kind of person
would treat his own son

667
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,050
- like that?
- Put the kid down.

668
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,680
- That can't be his Dad.
- Put him down already.

669
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,920
What'd you do?

670
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,590
That'll stop him.

671
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,340
Stop him.

672
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:26,690
Hei.

673
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,120
Mm!

674
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,130
Papa, Papa, Papa,
wake up, wake up!

675
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,030
Is he okay?

676
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,830
- Look after the passengers.
- Huh?

677
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,310
He's stubborn.

678
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,850
- Nicely done.
- Hm?

679
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,280
We'll work on your strength.

680
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,260
Save yourself the public...

681
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,030
embarrassment.

682
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,770
Who are these people?

683
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,770
Hm?

684
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,350
Spirits.

685
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,760
What about that kid?

686
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:42,860
- He's not gonna eat us, is he?
- Sh!

687
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,900
Are you hurt?

688
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,000
Not even a scratch.

689
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,270
Then let's go.

690
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,310
- Hey, hero boy!
- Hm?

691
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:55,940
Thank you.

692
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:02,380
No prob.

693
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,420
You are quite the charmer.

694
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:06,950
Hm.

695
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:09,220
Guild members
are already on their way.

696
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,690
Let's wait up here.

697
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,360
Why were they trying
to kidnap me?

698
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,290
No idea.

699
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:15,700
We'll ask when they wake up.

700
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,330
Why are we on the roof?

701
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,930
The fewer people who see us

702
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,700
the easier it'll be
for the Guild.

703
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,800
If the driver doesn't wake up
though,

704
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,740
I might need to
stop the train myself.

705
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,870
You told me
to keep those humans safe.

706
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,680
And you did quite well.

707
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,840
Hm?

708
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:36,210
Hm?

709
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,820
Hei, I'm taking you home.

710
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:42,750
Stormend!

711
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:45,090
Hei, he's with those guys.

712
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,760
Hm?

713
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:47,890
Keep Hei safe.

714
01:03:57,970 --> 01:03:59,110
Stop fighting!

715
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,940
- You've improved.
- Damn right!

716
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:09,980
Mr. Min's Sonic Wave!

717
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,150
Damn it.

718
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,350
Hei, I'll come find you!

719
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,500
- Infinity.
- Go help them.

720
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,370
- Was it Stormend?
- Mm-hm.

721
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,180
We recently discovered

722
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,480
that he's capable of
stealing powers.

723
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:39,410
He is?

724
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,250
I hadn't heard of this.

725
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,080
He has kept it a secret
all this time.

726
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:52,130
Then he only wanted Hei
for his power.

727
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,930
Is that the little spirit
Mr. Turtledove told me about?

728
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,430
Correct.

729
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,130
Hei has The Zone.

730
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,930
- Are you certain of that?
- Yes.

731
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,770
Then Hei is in danger.

732
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,200
If that power
is taken away from him...

733
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,840
I never saw him as a threat.

734
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,980
That was a mistake.

735
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,910
We need to find him fast.

736
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,850
I've arranged for
Longyou's borders to be closed.

737
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:16,250
He won't escape.

738
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,980
Good, let me know
what you turn up.

739
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,820
You're not taking command?

740
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:24,420
We have you, Hei only has me.

741
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:30,500
Guild Master,
we've attended to the crash.

742
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,860
No fatalities.

743
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:32,900
Erase their memories.

744
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,000
Let the humans do the rest.

745
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,400
Send all of our Sentients
after Stormend

746
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,440
and evacuate all civilians
from the city.

747
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,910
Mobilize everyone,
we'll need backup from HQ.

748
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,010
That's serious?
It'll cause a panic.

749
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,980
I'll ask the mayor to cooperate.

750
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,420
We need to prepare
for the worst.

751
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,120
The Zone is something
even the High Lord can't dispel.

752
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,950
- We can't take it lightly.
- Got it.

753
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,290
You said that the boy's powers
could be taken away.

754
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:01,990
What would happen to him?

755
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,060
A normal power
would be lost temporarily,

756
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,200
restored with practice.

757
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:09,370
But a Space-type power

758
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,600
draws on one's Spiritual Space

759
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,910
any spirit robbed of that...

760
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:16,410
dies.

761
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,950
So it begins.

762
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:25,920
You're not hurt, are you?

763
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,090
Not one bit.

764
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,120
Did you miss me at all?

765
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,160
Mm-hm.

766
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,200
Stormend?

767
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,870
- Hm?
- Are you okay?

768
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,570
I'm good.

769
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,340
Mm, uh...

770
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,110
Do you hate the spirits
of the Guild?

771
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:53,880
What'd they say to you?

772
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:57,050
They said the Guild is a home
to all spirits

773
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,380
and asked me to stay.

774
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,090
Stay here?

775
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:21,970
Of course,
this is my hometown, after all.

776
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,040
Huh?

777
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,950
This cold,
concrete city used to be

778
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,520
a place of extraordinary power.

779
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,990
<i>Lots of spirits were born here</i>

780
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,950
<i>and their presence made
the forest</i>

781
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:36,060
<i>grow lush and strong.</i>

782
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,990
<i>It was a paradise.</i>

783
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,230
And then came humans.

784
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:47,230
<i>They cut down trees to build
houses and feed their fires.</i>

785
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,370
<i>In time, they became
part of the forest.</i>

786
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,240
<i>I didn't hate them then.</i>

787
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,210
<i>They were fun
in their own way.</i>

788
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,640
<i>Humans are frail
and emotional.</i>

789
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,940
<i>They revered and respected us.</i>

790
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,680
At least they did
in the good old days.

791
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,690
<i>But then
their evolution accelerated.</i>

792
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,720
<i>A lot of our fellow spirits
chose to leave</i>

793
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,230
<i>but if anyone
was getting forced out</i>

794
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,430
<i>I thought it should be them.</i>

795
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,600
That's when the Guild
stepped in.

796
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,970
They disagreed with our values.

797
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:33,610
We were defeated,
we had to leave our home.

798
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:37,220
Why have we been reduced
to this?

799
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,150
If it keeps going this way,
humans will dominate the spirits

800
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,760
and the Guild maintains
this unfair balance.

801
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,090
But we can fix it together.

802
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:54,130
You might not have realized,

803
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:57,800
but your power, The Zone,
can expand your Spiritual Space.

804
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,770
Wherever you use it
becomes your domain.

805
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:04,280
And in that domain,
you're the God.

806
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:07,480
I... haven't mastered it.

807
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:08,780
Well, I'll help you.

808
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,380
We'll drive out all the humans

809
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,590
and make this our home.

810
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,350
Oh.

811
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,530
Is this why
you were so nice to me?

812
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:21,690
Mm?

813
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:34,670
Please Hei, don't forget,

814
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,810
the humans drove us out first.

815
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,780
Uh, I won't forget,

816
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,280
but even so this isn't right.

817
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:47,320
You still don't get it.

818
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,220
All they do is take and destroy.

819
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,190
Even the ones you trust.

820
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,360
Stormend, if you hate humans
that much

821
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,630
we can live somewhere
far away from them.

822
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,300
Let's leave this place together

823
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,400
and find another home
like the island.

824
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:06,740
That was a nice place too,
wasn't it?

825
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,410
We'll let them have the city

826
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,380
and start a new life
somewhere else.

827
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,780
Stormend, don't do this!

828
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,320
Stormend, let me talk to him,
please!

829
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,520
- I don't mind moving.
- Stormend!

830
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,520
- But it won't be long...
- Come on! Wait!

831
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,790
...till there's nowhere left
for us.

832
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,790
Please Hei, forgive me.

833
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,400
I have to take your power.

834
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:33,430
Stormend.

835
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:45,440
Stormend, stop! Stormend!

836
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:50,920
Don't do this, I'm begging you,
Stormend!

837
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:03,600
The Zone, at last.

838
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,570
<i>We got word from HQ,</i>

839
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,440
<i>they've given Stormend's power
the name Snatch.</i>

840
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,880
<i>It's the most aggressive power
of its kind.</i>

841
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:19,910
<i>It can rob a spirit of
their chi and power alike.</i>

842
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:24,850
<i>He's taken Sonic Wave,
Magical Brush and Time Bomb</i>

843
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,780
<i>to use against you.</i>

844
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:29,190
<i>These stolen powers
won't last forever</i>

845
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,190
<i>but if his real target
is The Zone,</i>

846
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:34,860
<i>then once
that's called into being,</i>

847
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,930
<i>there can be no dispelling it.</i>

848
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,800
<i>So it is with
all Space-type powers.</i>

849
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:40,730
That bastard.

850
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,170
<i>Master Infinity.</i>

851
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:43,000
- Huh?
- <i>I've detected</i>

852
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,770
<i>Stormend's spiritual wave.</i>

853
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,710
The Sentients must've
noticed the power I used.

854
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,480
We need to split up.

855
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,510
Once you've seen The Zone
come into being, come find us.

856
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:55,920
Got it.

857
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:57,920
Go.

858
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,860
Void.

859
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,780
Hei, Hei.

860
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,920
It's me, it's me, Hei.

861
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,830
It's Infinity, I'm here.

862
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,540
Will he be okay?

863
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,480
His Spiritual Spaces is
fading rapidly.

864
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,010
I'll take him to the High Lord.

865
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,780
If the High Lord could help

866
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,880
we wouldn't need to use
the Fire Rock.

867
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,650
How do I save him?

868
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,750
Take back
Hei's stolen Spiritual Space.

869
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,760
Give me Stormend's
possible locations.

870
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,990
I'm leaving Hei to you.

871
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:16,830
Don't worry.

872
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,570
Scratch location one, it's Void.

873
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,300
Requesting backup.

874
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,770
He's not at location seven.

875
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,440
Just Brush Tiger's
paint monster.

876
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,610
They've put Stormend's scent
on all of them.

877
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,650
Location three empty,
where's the next one?

878
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,060
Infinity!

879
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,770
Give Hei's Spiritual Space back.

880
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,430
It's already been stabilized.

881
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,100
The process can't be reversed.

882
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,610
You're a step behind.

883
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,610
Why did you take that step?

884
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,480
How can you claim
you're helping spirit-kind

885
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:40,980
if you're killing Hei to do it?

886
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,980
I... owe you nothing.

887
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:20,620
Listen...

888
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:23,590
give up before it's too late.

889
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:25,820
I still haven't figured out

890
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,030
how a human could get so strong.

891
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:32,460
Still, I'm not gonna surrender
to one.

892
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,900
Not when I owe my brothers
so much.

893
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,870
Stormend!

894
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,270
Infinity.

895
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,920
Everybody run!

896
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,160
Move out and cut all signal,
commence cleanup.

897
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:33,960
On it.

898
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,960
All Enforcers be advised,
all Enforcers be advised,

899
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,800
The Zone is being created
in the center of downtown.

900
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:42,900
<i>Move to a surrounding area
and prioritize evacuation.</i>

901
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:46,470
Mommy...

902
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,540
<i>...with a special report.</i>

903
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,180
<i>Strange shadows all over
Longyou...</i>

904
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,150
All the cars are stopped.

905
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:56,650
Move it!

906
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,120
No, we're not gonna make it.

907
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:04,620
Biggie, do it, you got it.

908
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,890
Master, how do we contain
a mess this large?

909
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,230
One problem at a time.

910
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,240
Can't open the door.

911
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,670
- Out of the car!
- Tiger!

912
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:22,570
Hm! Huh?

913
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:24,840
Oh come on!

914
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,920
Huh?

915
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,920
Sending you the location
of every remaining civilian.

916
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,650
Received.

917
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,000
Infinity, you followed me in?

918
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:57,140
You well know the danger of
entering someone else's space.

919
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:59,900
I do,
but I can't let you do this!

920
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,980
This space is mine.

921
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,920
And that means you're nothing.

922
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:53,590
<i>...reporting live
from Longyou City,</i>

923
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,130
<i>where a massive, shadowy orb
of sorts</i>

924
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,130
<i>seems to be consuming
the downtown district</i>

925
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,300
<i>and growing larger.</i>

926
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,740
You guys serious?

927
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,810
These are the chumps
giving you trouble?

928
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:46,040
- Master Nezha.
- Guild Master.

929
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,350
Infinity's gone into The Zone.

930
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,250
That doesn't sound like him.

931
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,420
Why'd he do that?

932
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:54,020
So reckless, he doesn't stand
a chance on his own in there

933
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,020
so I'm going in
to help clean all this up.

934
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:01,930
Hmm, did anyone mention
that the space was closed?

935
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:06,160
Hm?

936
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,300
What's going on?

937
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:12,170
Oh, you wanna play?

938
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,870
Uh? What the heck?

939
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:19,010
Space-type powers
are such a pain in the ass!

940
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:27,220
So did HQ send anyone else or?

941
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,450
It's nothing
I can't take care of.

942
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,920
Uh, good luck then.

943
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,830
Lousy stupid Space-type powers.

944
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:38,860
How'd it go?

945
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,900
Most civilians are safe.

946
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,270
What about Hei?

947
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:43,940
Still unconscious.

948
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,440
The expansion of The Zone
has slowed,

949
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:48,210
Infinity must've
located Stormend.

950
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,280
We can only hope Hei
will hold out until he returns.

951
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:02,020
Hei, you know
you can stay with us.

952
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,150
I wha...?

953
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:06,320
From now on this is your home.

954
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,560
Yeah!

955
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:15,330
Stormend, don't do this!

956
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:16,400
I don't mind moving,

957
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:20,510
but it won't be long till
there's nowhere left for us.

958
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,570
Stormend.

959
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:23,980
I have to take your power.

960
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:54,840
Hm?

961
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,320
Does this mean that I'm dead?

962
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,940
Huh?

963
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,950
<i>Stormend!</i>

964
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,320
Infinity?

965
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,350
Infinity, stop fighting it.

966
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,990
You know you can't win
in my space.

967
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,120
You hurt other spirits.

968
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:19,360
Disgraced your people,
and for what, this empty city?

969
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,120
I wouldn't say empty.

970
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,590
This city is colossal.

971
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,700
There are still plenty of humans
trapped in here.

972
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:26,930
What do you think?

973
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,230
Will the Guild
want to trade hostages?

974
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,480
Don't move!

975
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:28,690
You know, there's
no going back for me now.

976
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,400
Not after all I've done.

977
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,570
If Hei had never met you,

978
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,400
we'd be creating The Zone
together right now,

979
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,740
building a home for spirit-kind.

980
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:45,480
<i>Reclaiming this land
would've made him happy too.</i>

981
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:50,750
But what a shame,
that time has passed.

982
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,590
What the...?

983
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,730
Hei!

984
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,630
Who says I'd be happy?

985
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,370
This is some kind of trick!

986
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,560
Huh?

987
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,100
You all right?

988
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:39,830
I don't know.

989
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,770
It felt like I was taking a nap

990
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,370
and in my dream I heard
you getting your butt kicked.

991
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:58,280
In order for us
to get out of here,

992
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,090
we gotta beat Stormend,
and Hei, I can't do it alone.

993
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:03,090
Huh?

994
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,420
But I don't even know
how I did that earlier.

995
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,230
- I can't even...
- You can.

996
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,090
This is your Spiritual Space.

997
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,670
In here, all things big or small
are under your control.

998
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,600
Besides, I'm with you.

999
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:20,870
Mm-hm.

1000
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:24,340
- Oh, and sorry.
- Oh?

1001
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,180
Go.

1002
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,380
How dare you!

1003
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:43,820
Hei!

1004
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,730
Just remember,
this is your Spiritual Space.

1005
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,940
This space is mine!

1006
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,780
- Die!
- Hei!

1007
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:31,940
Uh Hei, did you do this?

1008
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,340
Uh...

1009
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:36,870
Whoa.

1010
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,320
This can't be.

1011
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,920
This can't be happening!

1012
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:26,890
I'll kill...

1013
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:28,930
Now's the time.

1014
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:30,490
Tear down the space.

1015
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,900
Hei, with The Zone you are God,

1016
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:36,770
do you want to throw that away?

1017
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:39,870
If you tear it down,
you can never get that back.

1018
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,110
Neither can you.

1019
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:41,940
Hei!

1020
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:43,340
Don't do it!

1021
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,080
Hei!

1022
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,380
Hei, stop.

1023
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:52,480
<i>Don't take this... from me.</i>

1024
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:11,770
Hm?

1025
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:13,840
It's done.

1026
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,640
Infinity.

1027
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,880
Search for the ones
who are trapped inside.

1028
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:23,110
Got it.

1029
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:25,780
We have much work ahead of us.

1030
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,920
Our long-maintained balance
is broken.

1031
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:32,860
Tearing down trust is easier
than building it back up.

1032
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:46,100
Stormend.

1033
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:59,980
Humans and spirits have to find
a way to coexist.

1034
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,450
There's no point
in fighting each other.

1035
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:08,960
Coexist, hm,
you want us to assimilate?

1036
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:12,660
You still think you're right,
after all that.

1037
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,670
Well I encourage you
to think on it

1038
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,770
while you're in Guild custody.

1039
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:22,470
I've thought enough.

1040
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:24,540
This time...

1041
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,880
I'm not leaving my home.

1042
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,150
Hm.

1043
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:40,860
Hei, I'm sorry.

1044
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,110
What's the point?

1045
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,210
We're just gonna
cut the thing down.

1046
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:07,520
Perhaps they will turn it into
a park and charge admission.

1047
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:13,560
<i>I think we all have
a ways to go.</i>

1048
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:21,800
Was he... was Stormend bad?

1049
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:26,970
That's a question you'll have to
answer for yourself.

1050
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:30,810
<i>Infinity!</i>

1051
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,610
<i>Huh? Hei!</i>

1052
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,730
Double Spiritual Spaces.

1053
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:51,600
That is how he came back.

1054
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,930
A person with
two spaces is rare messages.

1055
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,770
Master Mysteria is the only
other one I know of.

1056
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,670
Hm, it is historically
a rare occurrence.

1057
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:03,980
But a Double-space-type
is all the more so.

1058
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:05,780
Truly a shame.

1059
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:12,180
Infinity, where are Bamboo
and Void?

1060
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:14,890
In custody.

1061
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,790
Well, what happens next?

1062
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,220
They'll be locked up
for a long while.

1063
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:26,960
Hm?

1064
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:29,700
What's up?

1065
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,870
You want an autograph?

1066
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,100
You're a guy, right?

1067
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,170
Yep.

1068
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:35,840
Your hair's a little too cute.

1069
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,810
I'd change it
if it weren't so iconic.

1070
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:38,880
What do you mean?

1071
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,980
Hm, who are you?

1072
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:43,150
- See?
- Who are you though?

1073
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:45,950
- I'm kind of a big deal.
- Oh.

1074
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,760
- We're finally here.
- Hm?

1075
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,970
Master Infinity,
Master Infinity!

1076
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:10,580
Hey, Guild Master!

1077
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,590
Hm?

1078
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:40,140
Hm?

1079
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:44,740
Come on,
I'll show you around the place.

1080
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,120
- Huh?
- Hm?

1081
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:33,190
Hei?

1082
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:38,030
I think it's time
we said goodbye.

1083
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,970
Mm-hm.

1084
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:48,870
What do you mean?

1085
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:50,740
Aren't you gonna stay?

1086
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:53,980
Can't, I'm not very popular
around here.

1087
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,880
Mostly because
he's too powerful.

1088
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:58,120
Some of the locals feel
a bit uneasy when he's around.

1089
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,350
You're going to love it here.

1090
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,850
I'll come check on you
when I can.

1091
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:00,410
Master!

1092
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,890
Ohh.

1093
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,320
Let...

1094
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:17,960
Let me come with you, Infinity!

1095
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:29,410
Of course.

1096
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,380
So they're just stopping by?

1097
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:40,550
Could have told us that.

1098
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:42,950
Oh, what do you know?

1099
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:44,220
Yes, sir.

1100
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,860
- Hm?
- Totally right.

1101
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:47,960
I'm coming with you too, Master!

1102
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,060
You sure you want
to wander the world?

1103
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,370
I thought you wanted
to find a home.

1104
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,370
Mm-mm.

1105
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,400
I just wanna be with you.

1106
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:06,980
Yeah,

1107
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:09,350
me too.
