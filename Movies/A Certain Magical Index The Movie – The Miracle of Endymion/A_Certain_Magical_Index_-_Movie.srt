[meows]

482
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,083
Thank you.

483
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,208
[ARISA] It may sound silly,
but I wanted to make

484
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,625
everyone happy with my songs.
I knew that if I was making

485
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:56,000
other people happy,
then I would be happy, too.

486
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,166
[ARISA] But now,
if anyone were to get hurt

487
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,541
because of my songs, then...

488
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,166
Don't say that. You can't
think about backing out now.

489
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,666
Not after they've
accepted your audition.

490
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,250
What I'm trying
to say is,

491
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,541
ultimately, singing is just
a selfish desire of mine.

492
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:14,000
What if people come after
me like they did before?

493
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,666
It could be worse this time.

494
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,541
They could hurt
somebody close to me.

495
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,458
So that's it?
You're giving up.

496
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,291
You're going to
sacrifice your dream because

497
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,041
somebody came along and
intimidated you with force?

498
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,291
Mmm.

499
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,541
Honestly. What do you
want more than anything?

500
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,333
[ARISA] I want to sing.

501
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,166
It's all I have.
It's what I love,

502
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,000
what I'm passionate about.

503
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,208
[meows]

504
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,416
[KAMIJO] Then go ahead and sing.

505
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,041
Singing is what you love to do,

506
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,666
and you really
have a gift for it.

507
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,250
You can't give it up.

508
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,208
We'll just have to
come up with a plan.

509
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,666
A way to keep you out
of danger while you sing.

510
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,625
Thanks!

511
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:01,125
In that case,
I guess that you'll be

512
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,875
staying here for a while.

513
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,208
Huh?

514
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,375
After what happened before,
the magicians aren't

515
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,208
likely to make any
moves in public.

516
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,666
And if Arisa's here at the dorm,

517
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,500
then we'll be
around to protect her.

518
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,375
Well, what do you think?

519
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,416
Magicians?

520
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,958
[KAMIJO] Aah!
She means the enemy!

521
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,083
As long as you're here,
they'll leave you alone!

[laughs nervously]

523
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,583
You don't mind?

524

[KAMIJO exhales heavily]

525
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,958
It does seem like the
most logical solution.

526
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,583
Okay, this'll be no problem.

527
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:28,958
A guy, two girls, and a cat.

528

The more the merrier!
Please, come in.

It's a pleasure to welcome
you to my humble home.

[INDEX and ARISA giggle]

531
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,958
[WOMAN] Yes.
The enemy used abilities

532
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,000
that are yet undetermined.

[GIRL]
Undetermined, you say?

534
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,333
I guess these days people
can do all sorts of things

535
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,250
they weren't able to before.

536
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,000
Especially in this city.

This is different, though.

538
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:57,041
I believe they possess power
that's particularly unusual.

539

[GIRL] Now, now is that
of any real significance

540
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,916
to someone such as yourself,

541
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,833
who possesses an
unusual power of her own?

542
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,791
You wouldn't be
worried, would you?

543

unusual simply in terms of

said she would be.

knowing the answer.

that this line is secure?

something in the background.

Quite a unique situation.

[ALEISTER] It certainly was.
If I had to guess,
