00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,436
COMMANDER: Reinforcements arrive at twenty hundred sharp!

6
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,705
All forces, defend the photon power reactor at all costs!

7
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,407
TETSUYA: Scramble Dash!

8
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,347
Where were all you bastards hiding?

00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,083
Great Mazinger and Tetsuya Tsurugi are here to take you on!

10

Great Booster! Ignite!

20
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,157
COMMANDER: CIC to Alpha 1. We can't authorize use

21
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,693
of special weaponry that could damage the plant.

22
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,428
TETSUYA: Damn it...

00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,497
SOLDIER A: [tense growl] Hang in there!

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,898

00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,779
TETSUYA: Failure?

41
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,982
Aren't you...

42
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,685
MALE/FEMALE ASHURA: Greetings, Tetsuya Tsurugi. My name is Ashura.

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,488
I am the loyal servant of Dr. Hell...

44
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,723
...the world's greatest scientist.

45
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,728
MALE/FEMALE ASHURA: Address me as Baron Ashura!

46
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,766
These guys... They aren't kikaiju we never mopped up...

47
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,369
They're old-world phantoms back from the dead.

48
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,905
MALE ASHURA: Rapid Rocket Gun!

WORKER A: Copy that. We'll continue working.

62
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,903
Huh?

00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,047
WORKER A: Yeah, y-yeah, I'm fine.

67
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,948
Huh? Is that... Wait... Wha?

JOB SITE CHIEF: What do you see?

70
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,591
WORKER A: Looks like a face.

[indistict chatter]

72
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,739
Huh? Hey, is that...

73
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,142
I think that might be Koji Kabuto strolling in.

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,344
I've never seen him in person.

75
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,914
I hear he finished a three-month survey

76
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,817
WORKER C: of some underwater ruins in four weeks.

77
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,685
WORKER D: I know Great Mazinger's pilot, Tetsuya Tsurugi,

78
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,088
stayed on as a civilian military contractor,

79
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,291
but Koji gave it all up and became a scientist?

80
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,660
Thank you for coming, Koji. It's level S classified up ahead.

81
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:02,628
Open a section!

82
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,567
Only photon power lab personnel can go past here.

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,636
Sayaka... I mean, our new director ordered it...

[awed exhale]

85
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:22,648
KOJI: I see. It's a Mazin so large Mazinger Z could be its pilot.

86
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,983
TAKAGI: [gasp] What's that light?

87
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:24,951
Huh?

SUWA: I'm detecting life signs inside!

89
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,391
How is that possible?

00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,926
[footsteps clacking]

91
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:41,634

KOJI: Call the medical team ASAP!

101
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,833
And after you do that...

102
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,538
Raise the classification level to triple S.

CONDUCTOR: Thank you for riding with us today via the

105
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:04,617
belt line servicing the Shin Fuji Science City area.

[jingle playing]

107
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,956
ANNOUNCER: Photon power,

108
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,326
known as mankind's ultimate energy source,

109
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,964
is completely non-polluting and possesses astounding capacity.

110
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,801
Its integrated infrastructure, the photon power network,

111
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,637
uses this energy to supply electricity

112
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,674
and communication services to support our daily lives.

113
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,810
The Fuji plant you see before you

114
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,279
is the large-scale main facility

115
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,981
that not only generates power

116
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,918
but also manages and maintains the network.

117
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,687
When completed, it will be the world's largest

118
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,124
photon power reactor and will single-handedly

119
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,695
meet the photon power demand of not just Japan but all Asia.

120
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,065
During the last conflict, humanity suffered a terrible

121
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,335
number of casualties. No doubt many among you...

122
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,271
Hey, Jun, where's Tetsuya?

123
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,939
He's still working.

124
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,274
They extended his assignment in the U.S. a week.

125
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,675
Seriously?

126
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,810
I thought I'd see him.

127
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,214
Sorry, Shiro, I know he's dying to see you too.

128
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,149
- Really? - Of course.

129
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,717
ANNOUNCER: ...a central role in promoting the use of

130
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,954
photon power for international peace.

131
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,757
The vast amount of photon power controlled

132
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,693
by the leaders of the new nations was instrumental

133
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,629
in resolving many diplomatic issues.

134
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,898
The world certainly would not have been able to

135
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,268
recover so quickly using traditional energy sources.

136
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,571
Today it is clear to see that we are living

137
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,440
in the world's most peaceful age

138
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,977
since the dawn of history, thanks to photon power!

139
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,112

142
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,119
the New Photon Power Lab Central Station.

143
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,656
Please be sure to take all your belongings.

144
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,592
Did you hear? They say that the old Photon Power Lab

145
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,760
will be getting torn down soon.

146
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,629
Seems like a waste if you ask me.

147
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,732
JUN: It's for the best.

148
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,202
We're better off without things that remind us of war.

149
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,473
SHIRO: Okay fine, then call it a symbol of peace if you like!

150
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,309
I mean they've got Mazinger Z on display at the museum!

SAYAKA: Shiro! Jun! Over here!

00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,293
SHIRO: Sayaka! It's been so long!

154
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,897
Looks like the baby's coming along nicely! Do you mind?

155
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:32,798
Mm-mm.

156
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,335
[gasp] It kicked!

157
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,904
SAYAKA: It's been about three years since your wedding, right?

158
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,806
JUN: Thanks again for coming all that way.

159
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,810
Aw, don't mention it! So, Jun, how's Tetsuya doing?

160
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,547
He's depressed, since he found a gray hair the other day.

161
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,182
[chuckling] SAYAKA: Oh no! [chuckling]

KOJI: Confirmed. Now copy the difference.

167
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,734
LISA: Roger.

168
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,069
[cell phone chiming]

169
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,739
You should go.

170
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,274
The director's downstairs.

171
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,143
Along with Shiro and Jun.

172
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,677
They're here?

173
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,079
Lisa, disengage.

174
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,080
Okay.

175
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,755
That thing is huuuge!

176
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,291
This is the Mazin they excavated?

177
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,761
Man, it's cool. Totally outta this world.

178
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,297
[Chuckling] And did I mention big?

179
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,199
- Is something wrong? - [surprised gasp]

180
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,834
The thing is...

181
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,637
You're fighting with Koji. Is that it?

182
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,305
Not quite.

183
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,774
Jeez, you two should hurry up and make it official already.

184
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,942
[somber exhale]

185
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,378
Hm?

186
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,581
What? Breaking up?

187
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,116
Please keep your voice down!

188
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,018
But why? Did something change?

189
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,120
Mm-mm.

190
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,390
Oh... in other words, nothing has.

191
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,292
Mm-hm.

192
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,628
Yeah I can see that. Koji's definitely a thickheaded

193
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,064
dimwit when it comes to things like this.

194
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,934
So it's not like I don't understand your feelings.

195
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,136
SAYAKA: Plus, my father's been saying that if

196
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,006
Koji has no plans for the future, I should move on...

197
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,777
JUN: I guess so... I'm sure there's no shortage

198
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,445
of potential grooms if you wanted it arranged.

199
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,450
Well well, what do we have here?

200
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,888
Big Bro! Huh?

201
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,425
LISA: Pleased to meet you. Thanks for all you've done for my master.

202
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,426
- Master? - Now hold on!

203
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,296
Huh? Is \"master\" the wrong word?

204
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,898
I believe I've been using the term correctly

205
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,899
as far as I understand it.

206
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,701
That's not the issue!

207
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,903
First of all, could you please

208
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,838
find yourself another way to address him?

209
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,975
I told you this before. It implies other things.

210
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,178
In Mycenaean, it's mistol. In German, meister.\"

211
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,412
And both mean the same thing as \"master.\"

212
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,249
That isn't what I'm disputing.

213
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,518
It's just that it could be taken the wrong way.

214
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,086
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

215
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,521
Would you wipe that self-satisfied

216
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,655
look off your face.

217
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,991
'Scuse me, but... who's she?

218
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,193
Right, you haven't been introduced.

219
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,997
Everyone, this is the control unit for the new Mazin, Lisa.

220
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,433
I'm the Large Intelligence System Agent, or LISA for short.

221
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,935
It's a pleasure!

222
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,138
She's a... control unit?

223
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,073
Given our current concept of her,

224
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,477
you could call her a humanoid computer of sorts.

225
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,413
Like the auxiliary combat AI inside the Ichinana models.

226
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,116
Oh yeah, that thing's always nagging me.

227
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,952
SAYAKA: Put in simple terms, she's an evolved form of that.

228
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,854
She serves as an interface between human

229
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,423
and machine with her enormous computing power.

230
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,492
A product of ancient Mycenae's supertechnology

231
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,427
that we can't replicate,

232
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,763
even with modern advances in the field.

233
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,033
[awed gasp] How nice...

234
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,635
LISA: Though your maker has a dubious design sense.

235
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,004
So I'm guessing you're not human.

236
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,840
But I'm not a machine either. Ninety-one percent

237
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,642
of my body mass is biological material!

238
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,845
KOJI: When I discovered her,

239
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,114
her system was still initializing

240
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,384
and apparently registered me as its administrator.

241
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,054
If we didn't have her cooperating with us,

242
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,523
the fact of the matter is that our technology actually

243
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,425
wouldn't have been able to access this giant Mazin.

244
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,261
SHIRO: For real?

245
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,129
KOJI: Just studying its infrastructure has led

246
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,332
to many discoveries that'll easily advance

247
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,900
current science a hundred years.

248
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,802
SHIRO: Amazing...

249
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,439
There's no doubt it's a being that's entirely beyond measure.

250
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,342
It's for that reason we chose to call it...

251
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,677
Mazinger Infinity.

252
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,646
A Mazin without limit.

253
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,450
- Still... - Huh?

254
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,952
This place has lots of tectonic activity.

255
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,021
So why would we find an ancient Mycenaean ruin

256
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,223
buried under Mt. Fuji?

257
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,825
[pensive sigh] I wonder too.

258
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,560
Wait. You dont know?

259
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:58,063
Could it truly have been waiting here for millennia?

260
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,565
Perhaps it isn't quite that simple.

261
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,700
What do you mean?

262
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,236
I've come up with one hypothesis.

263
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,039
Shiro, have you heard of adjacent dimensions?

264
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,241
Adjacent what?

265
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,076
They're realities that exist right next to

266
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,478
the substantial space that we inhabit.

267
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,180
Spaces created by other dimensions

268
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,583
that we're unable to discern.

269
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:22,054
Unknown worlds where all of our ordinary concepts don't apply.

270
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,990
When energy as intense as photon power accumulates,

271
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,626
the boundary surface between substantial space

272
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,863
and adjacent dimensions might become unstable.

273
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,731
By applying this phenomenon, it's quite possible

274
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,000
to change energy into matter.

275
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,835
In theory, it's possible for something

276
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,837
like teleportation to take place.

277
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,106
So are you saying since the Fuji plant

278
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,975
had huge amounts of photon power,

279
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,977
this thing came flying in from Mycenae?

280
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,812
Could be.

281
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,881
It's just a theory built on theories.

282
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,549
Don't take him seriously.

283
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,685
Everything he said is just preposterous.

284
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,054
You got it. But I don't get it.

285
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,426
- Hmm... - Huh? What is it?

286
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,394
Mmm... Nothing. Just thinking you've

287
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,762
got the researcher look down pat.

288
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,631
I do?

289
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,001
But you should do something about Sayaka. It's time.

290
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,403
Since it was the Mazin beyond your imaginations,

291
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,138
I wanted to name it Imazinger...

292
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,873
I'm not a fan of wordplay.

293
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,809
But why not?

294
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,445
I know that your relationship is none of my business,

295
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,880
but you aren't getting any younger.

296
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,415
There are no rehearsals in life, you know.

297
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,886
I'm aware of that. It's just...

298
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,588
But if it's originally from Mycenae,

299
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,256
isn't it wrong to give it...

300
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,392
What are you, some lovesick teen?

301
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,194
What's with that lost look in your eyes?

302
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,329
Aren't you the hero who risked his life

303
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,698
to save the whole world? Are you kidding me...

Yes? What? Sure.

00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,381
[gasp] I don't believe it!

310
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,782
What's wrong?

311
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,684
This report's about an hour old,

312
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,086
but the photon power plant in Texas was just attacked!

313
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,588
Attacked? By whom?

314
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,823
Kikaiju...

315
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,159
What? You're sure?

316
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,294
Luckily, the photon power reactor

317
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,296
wasn't damaged too seriously...

318
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,966
Though it seems Tetsuya deployed

319
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,567
in Great Mazinger and is now missing...

320
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,236
[gasp] He is?

321
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,138
The hell's going on...

331
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,072
was a good idea after all!

What's going on? I thought that you...

334
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,345
[Cackle] You thought I had died?

335
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,948
That was a long time ago, you minx.

336
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,285
Wait. Don't tell me that you've never died even once yourself.

337
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,520
Of course I haven't!

338
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,224
Well, that's a shame. But you don't have to worry.

339
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,828
I'll be sending you all to the other side momentarily.

340
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,196

Oh, Sayaka! You're all right!

392
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,474
I appreciate your concern, but Mr. Prime Minister,

393
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,576
you're releasing information far too slowly!

394
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,544
As it is, we're the ones providing

395
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,947
local authorities with the facts.

396
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,817
Oh, well... we're grateful for your assistance.

397
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,820
The security council just finished an emergency meeting.

398
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,223
The Texas and Fuji plant attacks have been acknowledged

399
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,092
as acts of terrorism by remnants of Dr. Hell's faction.

400
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,694
Remnants?

401
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,296
Correct. And these terrorist attacks of theirs

402
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,631
were carried out in order to once again

403
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,767
throw mankind into utter chaos.

404
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,569
Wait a second! That's impossible!

405
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,505
Once all the fighting came to an end,

406
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,507
we scoured every meter of the globe for them,

407
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,742
and you know that as well as I do!

408
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,879
Regardless, this is the time for a pragmatic plan of action.

409
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,515
In ten days, we'll carry out military operations

410
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,616
to retake the Fuji plant by force.

411
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:03,455
With that in mind, I hereby request Koji's participation.

412
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,125
[gasp] Don't be absurd! Koji's currently a researcher!

413
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,393
What merit could there be to using

414
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,929
someone who's no longer on active duty?

415
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:15,000
I know. But given that Tetsuya is missing right now,

416
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,469
if Koji were to be at the battleground, troop morale

417
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,738
So it's just propaganda in the end,

418
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,407
using his popularity to quiet the voices of opposition

419
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,543
to this reckless strategy. Is that the idea?

420
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,211
No... That isn't...

421
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,613
Enough, Father!

422
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,016
SAYAKA: The Photon Power Lab is a research facility

423
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,885
that strives to use photon power for peace.

424
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,887
Our scientists won't be participants

425
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,491
of military operations, let alone soldiers!

426
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,227
I have no doubt our reconstruction

427
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,529
was made possible by photon power.

428
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,099
However, it did not extend to all the scars left

429
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,801
in the people's hearts, which have yet to fully heal.

430
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:54,039
What we need, in the simplest terms, is hope.

431
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,442
How much longer must the world rely solely on him?

432
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,811
Note that this isn't an order.

433
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,379
It's merely the Japanese government's

434
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,982

all saved from the threat of annihilation.

439
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,762
He's done far more than his fair share...

LISA: So the battle will progress in our favor

497
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,987
because master is taking part.

498
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,156
But the logic behind that argument seems unclear.

499
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,357
It does?

500
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,159
Not that I'm opposed.

501
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,495
I just consider it to be rather meaningless.

502
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,231
The plan is that he'll only stay at the rear.

503
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,233
Just think about the troops on the ground.

504
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,701
I'm sure they'd take issue

505
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,469
with someone throwing his weight around on the front lines

506
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,104
if he's retired from active duty.

507
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,440
Sayaka?

508
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,575
There's nothing I could do.

509
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,444
- There are those who envy us. - Huh?

510
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,613
This laboratory

511
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,716
is required to release all of its research findings

512
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,585
related to photon power to the general public.

513
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,322
It's the trade-off for our vast budget.

514
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,525
However, now that photon power research is advancing

515
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,594
throughout the world, more and more people

516
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,763
are questioning the need for this laboratory.

517
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,633
That said, given our philosophy

518
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,601
of using photon power for peace,

519
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,936
we should always strive to be

520
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,172
at the forefront of its research.

521
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,541
Otherwise, if someone used it for evil,

522
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,709
we'd lack the means to stop them.

523
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,012
LISA: And it's for that reason

524
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,847
that you sent master to the battlefield?

525

You're fine with that? Really?

527
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,622
The safeguarding of freedom

528
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,525
can be a rather oppressive undertaking.

529
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,994
You're fine with that? Really?

530
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,930
Easy there.

You know, for a machine, you're pretty demanding.

532

If the strategy goes as well as planned,

533
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,436
then all of my issues are moot.

[door squeaking] [latch clicking]

663
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,981
The current instability of the photon power supply has

664
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,484
caused a severe impact on the everyday lives of our citizens.

665
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,586
I believe that the most pressing priority

666
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,654
is to first ensure

667
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,323
Simply acquiescing to a terrorist's threats

668
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,858
is something I find unacceptable!

669
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,129
LEADER A:: The international community should come together

670
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,331
and put pressure on them! This is absurd!

671
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,200
LEADER B: We need to have a diplomatic channel

672
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,135
prepared first to negotiate a settlement

673
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,570
LEADER A: No, we need a military operation!

674
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,574
It's right over here.

675
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,581
BOSS: Come on in! We've only got ramen today!

676
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,488
TV HOST: Twenty-five percent answered \"resist to the end,\"

677
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,224
twenty-three percent said \"negotiate,\"

678
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,427
while fifty-two percent responded \"don't know.\"

679
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,229
TV HOST B: The majority don't know,

680
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,499
and the remainder are more or less evenly split.

681
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,634
Even at today's security council meeeting,

682
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,838
a consensus could not be reached between all sides.

683
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,774
What was the response of Japan's government?

684
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,776
COMMENTATOR: Identical to the public-opinion poll.

685
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,812
Their standpoint was also I don't know.

686
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,315
I believe Prime Minister Yumi is being asked

687
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,050
to make a very difficult decision.

688
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,253
The TV's so boring! It's nothing but news!

689
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,055
Ever since that guy...

690
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,923
Would you shush? You shouldn't talk like that!

691
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,027
GIRL: I know... But it's boring!

692
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:30,761
Thanks for waiting.

693
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,398
Yeah, it's boring all right.

694
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,900
Gotta admit, I'm with you on that.

695
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,003
These are on the house.

696
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,304
Yay!

697
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,273
Hey, what do you say?

698
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,142
- Thank you! - Sure!

699
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,310
You know kids, Boss. Sorry.

700
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,479
Don't sweat it, Misato.

701
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,548
Gotta help each other out in tough times.

702
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,950
I know things can't be easy for you.

703
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,719
Well, doesn't that apply to you too?

704
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,922
Yeah, guess it does! [laughing] [laughing]

705
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:03,427
ANNOUNCER: This area is experiencing outages

706
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,162
due to the destruction of power...

707
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,231
- Hey, Boss. - Hm?

708
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,100
How are you getting your power?

709
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,702
Oh that? I generate it from Boss Robot's engine

710
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,471
and pull it over here.

711
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,174
Through a multipurpose shaft below.

712
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,709
- Sounds tricky. - I didn't wanna close shop.

713
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,645
Food service is about serving!

714
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,213
- [laughing] - [chuckle] Yeah.

715
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,750
- Here you go. - Ah... Thanks, Boss.

716
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,718
You've had this shop a while now, haven't you?

717
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,854
BOSS: Yeah, tried to do other stuff but

718
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:33,191
somehow made things work out here, least so far.

719
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,527
What is this... this foodstuff?

720
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:36,961
BOSS: It's called ramen.

721
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,366
Luscious... Meaty... Salty... It's perfection!

722
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,769
The nutritional balance is superb too!

723
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,271
It's the taste of mankind's wisdom in one bowl!

724
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,140
You're welcome, little lady.

725
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,509
Here. This one's on the house.

726
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,145
[delighted gasp] Thank you very much!

727
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,747
BOSS: It's at times like these that guys who can work

728
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,350
oughta give their all and do whatever they can.

729
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,785
LISA: This slow-simmered pork

730
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,821
is so succulent it's melting in my mouth!

731
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,690
It's exquisite!

732
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,426
So Tetsuya's still alive? You sure about that?

733
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,529
He is. I saw it myself.

734
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,832
But still... All I've seen in the news are reports

735
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,101
that say he's missing and that there are no details.

736
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,636
KOJI: Exactly.

737
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,805
So... I think it's safe to assume that it would be

738
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,173
a problem if that fact were to leak!

739
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,774
Here you go!

740
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,711
Thanks for waitin', guys. Two orders!

741
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,414
Oh yeah, you hear what happened with Koji Kabuto?

742
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,849
He took part in that battle the other day,

743
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,252
but I heard he was completely useless.

744
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,254
FUKUROKOJI: Yeah, that's what I heard too.

745
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,656
Do you think things really are gonna be okay...

746
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,826
'Scuse me, guys! How about some more water?

747
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,562
KOJI: Thanks, I got this.

748
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,830
BOSS: Heh! No problem.

749
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,532
Hey...

750
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,670
Whatever happens from here on out,

751
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,172
I believe in you and the stuff you do.

752
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,507
Just so you know.

753
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,519
[panting]

754
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,790
But Daddy...

758
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,596
MALE/FEMALE ASHURA: The photon power energy transmitted

759
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,732
by the Mazin to the adjacent dimension

760
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:58,202
now totals forty-two million gigawatt-hours.

761
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,404
Approximately one hundred twenty hours

762
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,074
until Goragon's activation.

763
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,776
However, I am concerned about the android

764
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,279
that is Mazin's activation key.

765
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,748
You still haven't located her?

766
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,883
It is my belief that she is purposely avoiding

767
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,286
connecting to the photon power network.

768
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,189
And what about Koji Kabuto?

769
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,692
BROCKEN: He is most likely moving in concert with her.

770
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,028
DR. HELL: No, I'm certain they aren't far.

771
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,664
MALE/FEMALE ASHURA: W-Why do you say that?

772
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,967
His Mazin was taken. As was his friend.

773
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,637
He's undoubtedly seething with anger at this very instant.

774
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,640
That's the sort of man that Koji Kabuto is.

775
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,043
MALE/FEMALE ASHURA: Master Hell... Are you...

776
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,078
Am I what?

777
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,981
MALE/FEMALE ASHURA: It's just... If I may say so...

778
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,250
It appeared as if you were looking forward

779
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,519
to seeing Koji Kabuto.

780
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,855
DR. HELL Kill him on sight.

781
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,924
As with me, Mazin were once all-consuming to him,

782
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,660
but he's just another human now.

783
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,963
An easy death is the least we can offer him.

784
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,631
MALE/FEMALE ASHURA: Yes, my lord.

DR. HELL: It's pointless.

792
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,365
The Baton of Bados controls Great Mazinger now.

793
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,634
Damn you...

794
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,770
You only live to serve as a dummy activation key,

795
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,506
yet you still think yourself a man.

796
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,874
TETSUYA: I heard your speech.

797
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,611
Why the co-existence and co-prosperity act, huh?

798
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,314
What ever happened to \"world domination\"?

799
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,484
DR. HELL: Don't you consider this state of affairs exactly that?

800
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,252
TETSUYA: What?

801
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,156
DR. HELL: All mankind is now focused on me alone.

802
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,461
They can make no move without considering my reaction.

803
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,629
What is that if not domination?

804
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,998
What a fool. Do you have any inkling

805
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,234
what humankind's greatest weakness is?

806
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,869
TETSUYA: Huh?

807
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,606
Allow me to tell you. It is diversity.

808
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,641
[indistinct arguing]

809
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,678
TETSUYA: Diversity? What?

810
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,348
In other words, multiple definitions of what's right.

811
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,884
But mankind is not intelligent enough

812
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,087
to be able to govern between its many complex value systems.

813
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,956
My mere mention of

814
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,025
co-existence and co-prosperity caused this.

815
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,828
Mankind, incapable of handling diversity,

816
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,632
once again squabbles amongst itself.

817
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,933

[indistinct arguing]

819
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,644
Humanity is at an impasse.

820
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,113
DR. HELL: Mankind has not changed.

821
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,049
How many years has it been since we left?

822
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,519
You thought if you eliminated us,

823
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,655
peace and an ideal society would result.

824

LISA: As you know, the universe began with the Big Bang.

838
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,617
It currently continues to expand,

839
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,886
and they say it has simultaneously branched off

840
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,722
into infinite potential universes.

841
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,526
Quantum theory. The many-worlds interpretation?

842
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,062
Right. Goragon is the ultimate weapon

843
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,764
that will forcibly cause a quantum superposition

844
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,467
so that it replaces not only the world,

845
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,771
but the entire universe with one of its user's own liking.

846
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,506
It'll activate when Infinity's fed enough

847
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,910
photon power to achieve critical mass.

to making that happen.

850
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,283
Yes. But it's clear that Hell was successfully able

851
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,785
to start up Infinity by substituting me with

852
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,089
Great Mazinger and Tetsuya as his activation key.

853
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,257
To think he would be able to do something like that.

854
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:53,063
If only I had been able to activate Infinity first...

855
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,499
None of this would have happened then.

856
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,201
It can't be helped.

857
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,269
After all, no one had any idea Hell was even coming for it.

858
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:02,940
LISA: I have just confirmed the increase

859
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,043
to Infinity's photon power supply.

860
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,847
It's clear that Hell is serious about triggering Goragon.

861
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,316
And once he does, it'll mean the end of this world.

862
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,051
And so...

863
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,953
Given the present circumstances,

864
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,188
choosing to enjoy one's happiness

865
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,791
in the short time left is the next best course of action.

One's happiness?

867
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,464
Since Sayaka has shifted her overall priorities

868
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,933
to social responsibility, she continues to give her

869
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,269

In other words...

Deep down, master, she doesn't want you to fight anymore.

872
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,978
She wishes to be as close as possible

873
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,447
as you share your daily lives. And that's what in her heart.

874
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,485
I know. It's pretty obvious.

875
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,421
Then I beg of you!

876
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,389
I've heard that among humans,

877
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,025
individuals who form a special intimate connection

878
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,961
will construct a contractual relationship called \"matrimony\"

879
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,964
and then form a social community called a \"family.\"

880
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,500
Before mankind perishes, could you please

881
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,738
construct that relationship with Sayaka at the very least?

882
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,807
You know, you make things sound so complicated.

883
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,111
For a machine, you're pretty demanding.

884
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:18,382
I apologize. Sayaka said the same exact thing as well.

885
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,318
Oh dear... I'm sorry.

886

This is the phenomenon called crying, right?

But I'm a machine... Why do I even have this function?

What's that?

898
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,825
Before I went aboard Mazinger years ago,

899
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,628
my grandfather, who was its creator by the way,

900
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,897
said those words to me.

901
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,967
He left it up to me to choose one or the other.

902
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,369
But it isn't like I had a real choice.

903
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,438
I couldn't become a demon.

904
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,207
And that's what I thought as I got on board.

905
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:21,445
After the fighting was over, I became a researcher.

906
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:24,715
I intended to never take part in another battle ever again.

907
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:29,319
And yet after all these years, being on the battlefield again?

908
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:32,222
To be honest, I was thrilled.

909
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,559
If that feeling is what you'd call being a demon,

910
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,427
I can't deny I felt it.

911
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,863
Master Koji...

912
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,233
And that's the reason I think I know now

913
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,669
just why your creator didn't make you all machine.

Or at least part of why.

So In order to entrust you with such enormous power,

our world would be...

987
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,676
Here's a question.

988
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,145
Why do you think Dr. Hell plots to conquer the world?

989
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,681
Well, so he can do what he wants with it.

990
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,883
But why? Why would he want that?

991
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,785
World conquest isn't easy.

992
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,755
Wealth, power, renown...

993
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,624
It's not like he has an interest in any of those things.

994
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,926
And ever since the end of the last battle,

995
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,962
I've been wondering what his interest was.

996
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,630
And I keep coming back to one hypothesis.

997
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,065
Which is?

998
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,433
He's curious.

999
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,568
Curious?

1000
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,038
KOJI: What is mankind? What is the world? The universe?

1001
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,741
He wants to know all of that in order to evaluate

1002
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,810
whether or not this world is worthy of existence.

1003
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,082
So it's likely that if he loses his interest in us...

1004
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,119
KOJI: That's right.

1005
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,055
If it all falls within the scope that he predicts,

1006
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,158
then he'll activate Goragon without hesitation.

1007
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,630
And the new universe will be his next object of study.

1008
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,270
SAYAKA: I was notified a few hours ago.

1009
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:17,207
Sporadic battles have sprung up in various parts of the world.

1010
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,744
We're reverting back to a state of war and conflict!

1011
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:23,980
And that, for Hell, has to be the dullest

1012
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,949
and most tiresome of all the outcomes.

1013
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,084
[fearful exhale]

1014
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,119
This may sound trite,

1015
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,855
but if there's anything I can do, I'd like to.

1016
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,624
Such as?

1017
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,460
KOJI: Rescue Tetsuya and destroy Infinity.

1018
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,095
Can you?

1019
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,831
If I do nothing, the result's the same.

1020
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,833
- But that's why you should - Lisa said something.

1021
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,702
She insisted that choosing to enjoy one's happiness

1022
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,872
in the short time left was the next best course of action.

1023
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:49,606
Happiness?

1024
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,315
I thought I'd become a little more level-headed

1025
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,585
when I got older,

1026
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,788
but I've finally come to realize that isn't the case at all.

1027
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:09,192
What I want is what's ideal, not second best. And so...

1028
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,794
[light gasp]

1029
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,797
When this battle's over, let's talk about us.

1030
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,133
Koji... don't say that before going off to war...

1031
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,802
Sayaka.

1032
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,070
Just don't... Please...

1033
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,404
Sayaka!

1034
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,305
[gasp]

1035
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,378
Koji...

1036
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,630
[phone beeping]

1037
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,297
SAYAKA: Yes?

1038
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:49,666
What?

1039
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,304
[klaxons blaring] [footsteps tapping]

1040
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,640
[rifles clacking]

1041
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,675
COMMANDER: Lieutenant Jun Hono?

1042
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,644
We're taking you in

1043
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,847
for commandeering restricted weaponry. Please come with us.

1044
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,216
[gasp] [defeated exhale]

1045
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:13,223
[somber music playing]

1046
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,867
I thought I'd die before ever saying

1047
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,335
I was better off back then.

1048
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,339
[lock chiming]

1049
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,074
[door rattling]

1050
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,543
What the hell were you thinking?

1051
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,212
Do you understand your current condition at all?

1052
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,614
I'll take care of this.

1053
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,251
Jun...

1054
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,825
Were you trying to go rescue Tetsuya all on your own?

1055
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,094
But I wasn't able to.

1056
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,496
I never imagined this belly of mine would

1057
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,131
make it impossible to step on the pedals.

1058
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:55,865
Dummy.

1059
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,737
It was your baby that stopped you.

1060
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,976
Tetsuya and I fought in order to better this world.

1061
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:09,779
And I think that it probably has improved a little.

1062
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,582
Since we were both soldiers, I knew this day might come.

1063
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,718
And yet when it finally came,

1064
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,654
I just couldn't bring myself to accept it.

1065
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,056
It'll be okay.

1066
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,258
I know that you're worried about Tetsuya. But you aren't alone.

1067
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,793
[gasp]

1068
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,362
Although he isn't here,

1069
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,532
he'll rescue Tetsuya. I'm sure.

1070
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,134
And we'll all be helping out.

1071
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,937
[moved sobs]

1072
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,407
[soft sobbing]

1073

MZ software OS version 1.55.

1074
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,412
Performing hardware check.

1075
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,347
Battery and sub-battery

1076
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:47,751
100% charged. External and internal temperatures nominal.

1077
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,287
Checking transmission status. Receiving band signal...

1078
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,189
- Signal received. - Main imager, check.

1079
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:55,992
Heat sink, check.

1080
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,494
KOJI: Let's run through it one last time!

1081
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,730
The plan has two intended objectives.

1082
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,900
The recovery of Tetsuya Tsurugi and Infinity's destruction.

1083
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:07,103
First, we'll infiltrate the locked-down Fuji plant

1084
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,105
via an underground tunnel.

1085
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,775
Lisa will act as co-pilot and mission specialist.

1086
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,244
Boss Robot and the professors will start

1087
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:17,380
a diversionary attack concurrently with our launch.

1088
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,816
Draw them in with firepower and then run for it!

1089
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,385
Right! Leave it to us!

1090
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,987
We'll give 'em one hell of a show!

1091
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,724
KOJI: After we arrive at the power plant,

1092
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:29,793
to avoid any unnecessary fighting,

1093
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,461
we'll use the tunnel elevator

1094
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,297
to bring us up to Infinity's feet.

1095
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,900
KOJI: From that angle, it won't be able to use its Breast Fire.

1096
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,072
Once there, we'll quietly ascend Infinity's armor.

1097
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,674
If we do it right, we can expect a weaker attack

1098
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,943
from the enemy since they wont risk friendly fire.

1099
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,512
After that, a program will be installed on Infinity

1100
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,548
that will force it to purge Great Mazinger.

1101
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,650
After confirming Goragon has been aborted,

1102
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,119
we'll recover Tetsuya and make our escape.

1103
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,122
[rotor whirring]

1104
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,225
KOJI: I want to thank you all for getting this ready

1105
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,360
on such short notice.

1106
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,830
Without the help of every one of you here,

1107
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,799
I would never have been able to pilot Mazinger again.

1108
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,169
Today, Mazinger deploys for its final battle!

1109
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,239
OPERATOR: All sequences complete. Cleared for takeoff!

COMMANDER: Welcome aboard, Mr. Prime Minister.

1116
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,730
We had the great honor of reviewing every single one

1117
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:49,332
of your combat logs from your previous battles.

1118
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,067
You flatter me.

1119
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,169
While we're powerless to intervene further,

1120
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,805
the elite joint forces will still maintain a presence here.

1121
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,273
It should serve as a deterrent to...

Hey! Look!

- What? How? - Don't ask me!

- That was just a replica. - Director!

1133
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,238
I don't condone what they're doing though.

1134
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,706
It's hardly appropriate.

1135
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,975
Wait, are you leaving?

1136
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,845
But as a respectable adult, I'm going to go apologize.

1137
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,180
You make a different impression when you show up

1138
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,249
before they call you in.

1139
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,117
I swear...

1140
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,286
It's just awful... These are the pitfalls of love.

DR. HELL: I've been waiting for you, Koji Kabuto.

1429
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,721
KOJI: The Great Marshal of Hell... Or rather, Dr. Hell!

1430
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,591
This is the end of your insane scheme!

1431

DR. HELL: Deluded fool!

1432
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,495
Peace is always a fleeting thing.

1433
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,729
I'm certain you found it dull.

1434
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,465
That isn't true at all!

1435
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:49,238
DR. HELL: Haven't you always searched for reasons to fight?

1436
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,140
Now that you're older,

1437
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:54,576
you feel you need a cause to justify your aggression.

1438
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:58,213
You're fundamentally a man who belongs on our side.

1439
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,916
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

1440
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:04,486
Not the peace, but the struggle for it.

1441
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,723
The beauty of peace is found in its absence.

1442
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:10,592
Think back. Your old self was more

1443
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:14,396
reckless, uncomplicated, honest, tough!

1444
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,533
Let your disgust for mankind awaken!

1445
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,135
Their happiness is a meager one.

1446
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,137
Surely that isn't your desire.

1447
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,340
I've heard enough!

1448
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,277
Let's settle this, Hell!

1449
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,612

[explosion booming] Huh?

1485
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,129
SHIRO: Koji!

1486
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,464
Great Mazinger's connections have all been severed!

1487
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,767
We've got your back.

1488

TETSUYA: Thanks, Shiro.

1489

Order them to shift their entire focus to assisting Mazinger Z!

TETSUYA: Let's do it! KOJI: Ready!

01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,356
TETSUYA: All yours, Shiro!

1499
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:54,990

Goragon countdown aborted.

SHIRO: We did it!

1507
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,939
We'll treat you as a prisoner of war,

1508

but only if you surrender quietly!

You're much too late! [energy chiming]

1511
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,251
Goragon countdown has just resumed!

1512
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,919
It's what?

1513
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,088
The Baton of Bados already

1514
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,823
has a backup of Great Mazinger's key code!

SHIRO: Wait. Does he mean... [energy ringing]

1516
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:37,266
I am fully able to control Infinity.

1517
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:41,036
Now... Goragon comes!

1518
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,149
KOJI: This is the adjacent dimension?

1519
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,951
LISA: Yes, though I've altered your vision

1520
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:57,753
to help you make some sense of it.

1521
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,988
It's like some like of heaven... or hell...

1522
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,725
Could it be that we died?

1523
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:07,229
We aren't deceased in this present state.

1524
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:11,033
All things exist here and yet this is an empty universe.

1525
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,736
KOJI: You're making things sound complicated again.

1526
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,605
LISA: That large light is Infinity's Mazin core,

1527
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:19,241
in other words, its soul.

1528
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:22,311
KOJI: That's Dr. Hell's.

1529
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:26,648
LISA: Yes, the baton signifies Hell's control over Infinity.

1530
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,717
And those are Mazinger Z

1531
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,320
and Great Mazinger's cores beside it.

1532
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,722
And these?

1533
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,925
LISA: Possibilities, each capable of becoming a distinct universe.

1534
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,127
KOJI: Possibilities?

1535
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,196
LISA: They aren't the universe we inhabit,

1536
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,533
but rather embryos that may become a universe.

1537
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,201
Now that Goragon has begun,

1538
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,869
they are now under Infinity's control.

1539
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,507

1543
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,351
KOJI: Where am I?

1544
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:06,154
Koji. Quit standing there and sit down, will you? After all,

1545
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,756
it's not your baby who's about to come into this world!

1546
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:10,225
A-All right...

1547
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,828

every minute, desperately asking \"How is the delivery going?\"

1553
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,776
He was so embarrassed when he found out I knew about it.

1554
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,644
Dad did that? [giggle] No way!

[baby crying] Oh! The baby! It's here!

It's gotta be theirs, right, Mom?

I'm sorry.

It's all right.

[gasp] Lisa!

1573
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,977
LISA: Don't worry. I'm all right.

1574
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,846
I'm still in the adjacent dimension.

[gasp] What are you doing?

1576
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,184
LISA: I am in the process of making myself the key

1577
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,653
so that I can forcibly break in to Infinity.

1578
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:46,455
KOJI: You are?

1579
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:50,125
LISA: Yes. I am currently analyzing Infinity's core.

1580
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:53,261
With Goragon advancing, this space may have become unstable.

1581
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,797
If that is the case, I might be able to grant

1582
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:59,468
Mazinger Z the same power as Infinity.

1583

KOJI: What do you mean?

1584
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,805
LISA: I cannot free Infinity from Hell's control,

1585
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,807
but if we could stand against it...

1586
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,276
Are you suggesting... That's crazy!

1587
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,212
Just tell me one thing!

1588
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,046
And what's that?

1589
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,050
Do you think that this world is worthy of existence?

1590
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:18,754
Hell asked me that before.

1591
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:21,056
Whether this world deserved to be.

Worthless things...

1595

But even so... Even so!

1596
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,549
It's ours. Am I for it? Hell yes!

so that you can use the existing control system.

What's going on?

It can't be...

He will. Fighting for us.

was the one you selected, master.

but a natural phenomenon?

1734
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:56,137
Correct, and we view this phenomenon

1735
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,906
as the superpositioning of parallel words

1736

No, it's not just humanity.

This planet, this universe... It's all so precarious.

And for that reason we should live life to the fullest.
