[NATSU]
Hey!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.481 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
Hm?

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.353 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is anybody there?

[NATSU]
Not the answer I was hoping for!

[screams]

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.320 position:30% line:83% align:start
Think, Natsu.
Ya need some power!

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.457 position:35% line:89% align:start
Aw, yeah!

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.116 position:24% line:83% align:start
All right, ya ugly
feather brain!

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was over from the moment

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.571 position:21% line:83% align:start
you put this wizard
in your little cage.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.639 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ya messed up.

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:05.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
And now I'm gonna show ya
the power of Fairy Tail!

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.607 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.574 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who goes there?

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.209 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SOLDIER B]
This shrine is under the control

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:38.211 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the Kingdom of Fiore!

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:39.279 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SOLDIER A]
Stop right where you are!

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:42.115 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SOLDIER B]
Don't get any closer!

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:43.984 position:30% line:83% align:start
Do you really
expect me to believe

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.353 position:21% line:83% align:start
that Fiore's biggest
secret is being protected

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:49.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
by a bunch of glorified
security guards?

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:53.593 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.430 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fiore's elite White Tiger
force is here as well.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.198 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now that's more like it!

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:03.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
So who among you woke up hungry
for a fight this morning?

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:11.344 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've got guts, girl.

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:15.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
Zash Caine. Betrayer
of the Fiore Kingdom.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:19.019 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's one way to look at it,
but I think it betrayed me.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
After all, we're talking
about a kingdom

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:23.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
that rewards its best fighters
by hiding them away

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:25.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
in the frozen tundra.

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:29.029 position:13% line:89% align:start
Quite unfortunate for you.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:33.266 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what's far more unfortunate
than your station...

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.339 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZASH]
...is that now,

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:43.411 position:13% line:83% align:start
you have to look into the
eyes of death himself!

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:50.384 position:27% line:83% align:start
[WHITE TIGER A]
Hm?

00:05:50.418 --> 00:05:51.719 position:19% line:89% align:start
[WHITE TIGER A yells]

00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:55.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
[WHITE TIGER B]
Captain! What're you doing?

00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:04.298 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:06:12.373 --> 00:06:13.674 position:27% line:83% align:start
[WHITE TIGER I]
What's happening?

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why are we fighting each other?

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.378 position:16% line:89% align:start
[WHITE TIGER I screams]

00:06:33.361 --> 00:06:35.296 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.364 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
All that we had to do
was get past them.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:45.439 position:13% line:83% align:start
There was no need for this
many lives to be taken.

00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:47.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
But this was more entertaining.

00:06:47.642 --> 00:06:52.413 position:7% line:83% align:start
I love to see "comrades" tear
each other apart like that.

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:58.854 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZASH]
Now, Lady Sonya,

00:06:58.887 --> 00:07:02.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
will you kindly lead us to
the reason we've come here?

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:04.893 position:16% line:89% align:start
Has your heart gone deaf

00:07:04.927 --> 00:07:08.429 position:10% line:83% align:start
to the sound of human souls
crying out in agony?

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:12.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
Their wails are no match for the
thunder of my rumbling belly.

00:07:26.648 --> 00:07:32.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY] Please!
You gotta help me, Natsu!

00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:33.522 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:34.756 position:30% line:89% align:start
[DOG barking]

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.526 position:7% line:83% align:start
That dog's lookin' at me like
I'm gonna be it's next meal.

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:39.393 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's scarin' me.

00:07:48.503 --> 00:07:49.838 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:07:51.406 --> 00:07:53.274 position:33% line:89% align:start
[DOG yelps]

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:55.344 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:07:55.377 --> 00:07:57.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, thanks a bunch, old buddy!

00:07:57.178 --> 00:07:59.381 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm always down
to keep you off a menu.

00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:02.183 position:27% line:89% align:start
[BOTH laughing]

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:04.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jerks! I can't believe you guys!

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:06.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
How could you terrorize
that poor little puppy?

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:09.324 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
All I did was look at the thing.

00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:11.326 position:33% line:89% align:start
[LUCY gasps]

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.229 position:19% line:83% align:start
I didn't know you were
afraid of dogs, Happy.

00:08:14.262 --> 00:08:17.633 position:30% line:83% align:start
Plue's a dog.
Are you scared of him?

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:18.700 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY]
Ha!

00:08:18.734 --> 00:08:21.269 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you kidding me?
He's not a real dog, anyway.

00:08:21.303 --> 00:08:22.371 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
Hmm...

00:08:22.404 --> 00:08:25.240 position:10% line:83% align:start
I always thought he was some
kinda weird-lookin' bug.

00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:27.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
And sometimes when
I'm super hungry,

00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:28.343 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see him as a nice fishy--

00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:30.278 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't eat my Celestial Spirit!

00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:32.581 position:7% line:83% align:start
Besides, he's just the cutest
widdle puppy-wuppy

00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:33.548 position:27% line:89% align:start
I've ever seen!

00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:36.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NATSU] I think you may
need glasses, Lucy.

00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:42.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh, something wrong?

00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:46.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey. You're gettin' kinda close.

00:08:46.294 --> 00:08:49.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
So what do ya think
I look like, huh?

00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:52.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Like the same Natsu
I've always known.

00:08:52.567 --> 00:08:53.368 position:30% line:89% align:start
[WENDY gasps]

00:08:53.402 --> 00:08:56.538 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, you guys!
It's good to see ya!

00:08:57.606 --> 00:08:59.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh my gosh! You two
are having a moment!

00:08:59.675 --> 00:09:01.844 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is not what it
looks like, I swear!

00:09:01.878 --> 00:09:03.211 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY]
You shoulda seen it, Carla,

00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:05.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
we almost got attacked
by this huge dog!

00:09:05.347 --> 00:09:07.349 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CARLA]
Fascinating.

00:09:07.382 --> 00:09:10.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
[GRAY] My Ice Make magic's
gonna fix you for good!

00:09:10.987 --> 00:09:12.287 position:41% line:89% align:start
There.

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:16.391 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, we should get as far
as the capital at least.

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:18.226 position:27% line:89% align:start
Excellent work.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.698 position:7% line:83% align:start
I never noticed how practical
your magic is. It's nice.

00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:28.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
[GRAY] Been a while since
we've visited Crocus, eh?

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.772 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
Indeed.

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:30.707 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.576 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so bored!

00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:34.877 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whines]

00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:37.512 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe you should try
crackin' open a book.

00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:40.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hear brains are gonna be
the new brawn pretty soon.

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:42.719 position:24% line:83% align:start
I didn't even know
that you could read!

00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:45.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
That is just a big picture
book about cats, right?

00:09:45.054 --> 00:09:47.890 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm furtherin' my
education over here, man!

00:09:47.924 --> 00:09:49.926 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:53.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wonder what my Gray is doing.

00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:55.498 position:35% line:89% align:start
Open wide.

00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:57.867 position:21% line:89% align:start
You spoil me, Lucy.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.902 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you mind scrubbing
my back for me, Gray?

00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:01.804 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll even scrub your front!

00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:03.271 position:27% line:89% align:start
[GRAY chuckles]

00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:05.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
Will you tell me
a bedtime story?

00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:07.877 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'd be happy to, sweetie.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.046 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GAJEEL]
Shut up!

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.314 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LEVY]
Hey, Gajeel.

00:10:11.347 --> 00:10:12.482 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:10:12.515 --> 00:10:14.484 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wanna go on a job?

00:10:14.517 --> 00:10:17.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's kind of a long
journey, but it pays!

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then you'd better
bring a real man!

00:10:19.455 --> 00:10:20.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're supposed to clean
the storeroom today.

00:10:20.923 --> 00:10:22.892 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oooh! I want a souvenir!

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.994 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let me come with you!

00:10:25.027 --> 00:10:26.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah, this'll be the
perfect opportunity

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:30.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
to make my ice-cold hunk
melt with jealousy!

00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:32.468 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're such a stud.

00:10:32.502 --> 00:10:36.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
And your cold, rock-like
chest is just so dreamy.

00:10:36.038 --> 00:10:38.808 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah. That's 'cause
it's iron, babe.

00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:42.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's like snuggling a
real life teddy bear.

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:45.581 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know. Just watch
out for the claws.

00:10:45.615 --> 00:10:49.318 position:19% line:83% align:start
Levy, my dear, you are
such a precious little thing.

00:10:49.352 --> 00:10:52.555 position:19% line:89% align:start
Juvia. Please hold me.

I just can't do it.

00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:04.333 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TOMA]
The Dragon's Tomb.

00:11:04.367 --> 00:11:06.970 position:30% line:83% align:start
Deep below the
Domus Flau coliseum.

00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:08.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
I recall that some of you
stumbled across it

00:11:09.006 --> 00:11:11.674 position:19% line:83% align:start
during the Grand Magic
Games years ago.

00:11:11.707 --> 00:11:14.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
A sacred and frightening place,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
where those brave dragons
who had fought in the war

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
against Acnologia
and lost their lives

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:22.418 position:10% line:89% align:start
now lay in eternal slumber.

00:11:22.451 --> 00:11:25.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
My ancestors investigated
it many times.

00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:28.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
They chose to erect the coliseum
on the mountain above it

00:11:28.424 --> 00:11:30.661 position:7% line:89% align:start
to commemorate the sacrifice.

00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:32.129 position:19% line:89% align:start
One hundred years ago,

00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:34.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
a particular staff was
discovered in the deepest depths

00:11:34.932 --> 00:11:36.066 position:19% line:89% align:start
of the Dragons' Tomb.

00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:37.333 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah?

00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:40.671 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ya think an old grandpa dragon
used it as a cane or somethin'?

00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:44.373 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, more than likely,
it belonged to a person.

00:11:44.407 --> 00:11:46.076 position:27% line:83% align:start
Over the years,
this staff had absorbed

00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:49.546 position:7% line:83% align:start
the residual sorrow and anger
that lingered in the tomb.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.685 position:10% line:83% align:start
So much so in fact, that it
took on a new crystalline form.

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:57.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
This staff is known
as the "Dragon Cry,"

00:11:57.754 --> 00:11:59.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
and it holds enough magic power

00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:02.960 position:27% line:83% align:start
to eradicate an
entire continent.

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:07.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
Several days ago, the staff was
taken by force by Zash Caine,

00:12:07.664 --> 00:12:11.068 position:10% line:83% align:start
the former Minister of State
of our fair kingdom.

00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:14.404 position:19% line:83% align:start
Zash is a wicked man,
a follower of the dark arts.

00:12:14.438 --> 00:12:17.608 position:13% line:83% align:start
He once even attempted to
overthrow me and my family.

00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:19.743 position:19% line:83% align:start
But before he could be
made to stand trial,

00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:23.447 position:16% line:83% align:start
his band of mercenaries
helped him to escape Fiore.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.781 position:19% line:89% align:start
To make things worse,

00:12:24.815 --> 00:12:27.918 position:13% line:83% align:start
once the Kingdom of Stella
had granted him asylum,

00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:30.621 position:10% line:89% align:start
he slaughtered all his men.

00:12:30.654 --> 00:12:36.026 position:7% line:83% align:start
This brutal act was to signal
his newfound devotion to Stella.

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:39.097 position:21% line:83% align:start
Seriously? He killed
his own guys?

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.265 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TOMA]
And what's more,

00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:43.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
after unleashing a campaign
of violence and blackmail,

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:45.736 position:19% line:83% align:start
he managed to rise up
in that kingdom as well.

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:48.572 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CARLA]
What a perfectly horrible man.

00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:50.174 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now, I'm afraid
this scoundrel

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:53.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
controls the destructive
power of the Dragon Cry.

00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:57.581 position:10% line:83% align:start
I need you to take it before
he can cause more mayhem.

00:12:57.614 --> 00:12:58.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
We shall.

00:12:58.715 --> 00:13:00.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY] Hey, do you know
where the Stella Kingdom is?

00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:04.155 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, I think it's
somewhere off Ishgar.

00:13:04.188 --> 00:13:06.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
An island completely
surrounded by cliffs

00:13:06.657 --> 00:13:09.559 position:10% line:83% align:start
and almost entirely cut off
from the outside world.

00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:11.062 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ugh. An island?

00:13:11.095 --> 00:13:13.797 position:19% line:83% align:start
That means we're gonna
have to take a boat.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.618 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] Stella's economy
is largely based

00:13:34.652 --> 00:13:36.486 position:10% line:89% align:start
on the export of Stellanium,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.190 position:24% line:83% align:start
one of the hardest
minerals in the world.

00:13:39.223 --> 00:13:41.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
They say the more
starlight it absorbs,

00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:43.861 position:7% line:89% align:start
the more brilliantly it glows.

You look great up there.

00:14:20.264 --> 00:14:21.232 position:16% line:89% align:start
From what I've gathered,

00:14:21.266 --> 00:14:23.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
Zash keeps all of his
stolen goods locked away

00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:25.203 position:27% line:89% align:start
inside a tower.

00:14:25.237 --> 00:14:28.139 position:19% line:83% align:start
He unlocks it using a
special ring he wears,

00:14:28.172 --> 00:14:32.010 position:13% line:83% align:start
but let's not forget he is
a high-ranking official.

00:14:32.043 --> 00:14:36.547 position:7% line:83% align:start
Taking the ring by force could
spark an international conflict.

00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:38.783 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why we've come
to his favorite bar

00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:40.985 position:27% line:83% align:start
to steal it from
right off his finger.

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:42.987 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just keep him distracted.

00:36:03.278 --> 00:36:04.513 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Lady!

00:36:04.546 --> 00:36:06.982 position:19% line:83% align:start
[CARLA] You never told
us what your name is.

00:36:07.015 --> 00:36:11.253 position:16% line:83% align:start
I am Lady Sonya, and I'm
an advisor to King Animus.

00:36:11.286 --> 00:36:15.457 position:13% line:83% align:start
[GRAY] Oh, yeah? So why'd
you help us escape?

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:18.293 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] You must have
some sort of reason.

00:36:19.895 --> 00:36:22.564 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, because I can't sit back

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:25.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
while my people
suffer any longer.

00:36:29.004 --> 00:36:31.139 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SONYA] King Animus and I
have known each other

00:36:31.173 --> 00:36:34.142 position:7% line:89% align:start
for as long as I can remember.

00:36:34.176 --> 00:36:36.945 position:7% line:89% align:start
He was once a kindhearted man.

00:36:36.978 --> 00:36:38.914 position:5% line:89% align:start
Until the day he became obsessed

00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:41.651 position:19% line:83% align:start
with getting his hands
on the Dragon Cry.

00:36:41.684 --> 00:36:45.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sir Zash told him about
the power that it holds.

00:36:45.555 --> 00:36:47.422 position:16% line:89% align:start
I even helped steal it.

00:36:47.456 --> 00:36:50.425 position:10% line:83% align:start
Trying to convince myself it
was for the good of the kingdom.

00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:53.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
How did you think it would help?

00:36:53.362 --> 00:36:56.131 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you happen to know
anything about Stellanium?

00:36:56.164 --> 00:36:59.201 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's Stella's special
mineral, isn't it?

00:36:59.234 --> 00:37:02.304 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SONYA] The more starlight
that the crystals absorb,

00:37:02.337 --> 00:37:07.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
the more lustrous, and therefore
more valuable they become.

00:37:07.543 --> 00:37:13.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
But for the last few years, the
Stellanium has been crying out.

00:37:13.449 --> 00:37:17.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems that a great deal of it
has absorbed too much starlight.

00:37:17.387 --> 00:37:19.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
Our kingdom now faces the threat

00:37:19.087 --> 00:37:22.023 position:16% line:83% align:start
of having all that light
released at once.

00:37:22.057 --> 00:37:24.694 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't get it.
Is that dangerous?

00:37:24.727 --> 00:37:27.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SONYA] When Stellanium absorbs
a certain amount of starlight,

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:30.932 position:19% line:89% align:start
it gains magic power.

00:37:30.966 --> 00:37:34.170 position:10% line:83% align:start
If all that built-up energy
were to suddenly be unleashed,

00:37:34.203 --> 00:37:37.673 position:13% line:83% align:start
Stella could be wiped out
in one brilliant flash.

00:37:39.242 --> 00:37:41.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SONYA] In order to
prevent our destruction,

00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:45.515 position:16% line:83% align:start
we desperately need the
power of the Dragon Cry.

00:37:45.548 --> 00:37:47.350 position:13% line:89% align:start
According to the legends,

00:37:47.383 --> 00:37:51.421 position:13% line:83% align:start
the Dragon Cry is capable
of extinguishing all light.

00:37:51.454 --> 00:37:53.222 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's a ceremony.

00:37:53.256 --> 00:37:55.258 position:24% line:83% align:start
The king plans to
perform it tomorrow night

00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:57.994 position:24% line:83% align:start
in a temple in the
northwest part of the city.

00:37:58.027 --> 00:38:00.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't that make
your kingdom suffer?

00:38:00.563 --> 00:38:03.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
But it's also the only way
that it can be saved.

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:08.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
Though it may mean we lose
every Stellanium crystal.

00:38:08.104 --> 00:38:09.305 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do you undertand?

00:38:09.338 --> 00:38:12.108 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's why we need the Dragon
Cry! We'll die without it!

00:38:12.141 --> 00:38:13.409 position:13% line:89% align:start
It belongs to our kingdom,

00:38:13.443 --> 00:38:16.145 position:19% line:83% align:start
and our mission is to
ensure its safe return.

00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:18.614 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SONYA] That may be true,
but right now,

00:38:18.648 --> 00:38:22.618 position:7% line:83% align:start
the power it holds is the only
hope for the future of Stella.

00:38:22.652 --> 00:38:26.255 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're dead wrong
about that, lady!

00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:29.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
The moment I touched it,
I could feel it.

00:38:29.625 --> 00:38:33.129 position:21% line:83% align:start
The dragons' anger.
Their suffering.

00:38:33.162 --> 00:38:36.499 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can't let that kind
of power be released.

00:38:36.532 --> 00:38:38.401 position:27% line:83% align:start
But our kingdom
will be destroyed.

00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:39.402 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't you have a heart?

00:38:39.435 --> 00:38:41.103 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
Of course I do!

00:38:41.137 --> 00:38:42.472 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:38:42.505 --> 00:38:44.641 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I'm willing to destroy
all the Stellanium

00:38:44.675 --> 00:38:46.108 position:16% line:89% align:start
on this island for you,

00:38:46.142 --> 00:38:49.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
but ya gotta give us the staff!

00:38:49.045 --> 00:38:52.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I can't do it. I'm so sorry.

00:38:56.553 --> 00:38:56.954 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thud]

00:38:56.986 --> 00:38:59.222 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ZASH choking]

00:38:59.255 --> 00:39:01.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought I made it
clear that Sonya

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.326 position:24% line:83% align:start
was not to be put
in harm's way.

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:05.696 position:27% line:83% align:start
And yet, in your
mindless impulsivity,

00:39:05.729 --> 00:39:08.097 position:21% line:83% align:start
you dared to use the
staff in her presence!

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ZASH] Please.
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

00:39:10.434 --> 00:39:13.637 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was a lapse of judgment!

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ZASH coughs]

00:39:14.738 --> 00:39:17.641 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS] The ceremony's to
be held tomorrow night.

00:39:17.674 --> 00:39:19.743 position:13% line:89% align:start
Surely they will be there.

00:39:19.776 --> 00:39:24.247 position:10% line:83% align:start
See that they don't survive.
Do you understand me?

00:39:29.653 --> 00:39:31.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ZASH] They won't live
to see the morning,

00:39:31.788 --> 00:39:34.056 position:19% line:89% align:start
and neither will you.

00:39:36.293 --> 00:39:38.629 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WENDY]
This forest is beautiful!

00:39:38.662 --> 00:39:41.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
That fruit is so sweet,
it's glowing.

00:39:41.331 --> 00:39:43.166 position:13% line:89% align:start
They're not for us to eat!

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.335 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll set up camp
here for the night.

00:39:45.369 --> 00:39:47.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just hope they
don't find us again.

00:39:47.671 --> 00:39:49.339 position:7% line:89% align:start
Then we gotta sleep in shifts.

00:39:49.373 --> 00:39:51.174 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah. That's a good idea.

00:39:51.208 --> 00:39:52.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can go first!

00:39:52.709 --> 00:39:54.511 position:35% line:89% align:start
Already?!

00:39:56.179 --> 00:39:57.648 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
So if I understand correctly,

00:39:57.681 --> 00:39:59.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
they plan on using
the Dragon Cry

00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:01.752 position:24% line:83% align:start
to extinguish all
of the Stellanium.

00:40:01.785 --> 00:40:04.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
But how do they know if
that's even possible?

00:40:04.454 --> 00:40:06.223 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GRAY]
Let's say it does work.

00:40:06.256 --> 00:40:08.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then the whole country
just goes bankrupt?

00:40:08.792 --> 00:40:10.327 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, no matter what,

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.664 position:10% line:83% align:start
we cannot allow them to use
the staff's magic power.

00:40:13.697 --> 00:40:14.665 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GRAY]
Right.

00:40:14.698 --> 00:40:18.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
She'd said there'd be a
ceremony tomorrow night.

00:40:18.368 --> 00:40:20.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
We only have till
then to get it back.

00:40:20.504 --> 00:40:22.372 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY]
I'll help ya steal it, Lucy.

00:40:22.406 --> 00:40:25.275 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought I told you we
weren't to eat the fruit!

00:40:36.688 --> 00:40:37.889 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's goin' on, Lucy?

00:40:37.922 --> 00:40:39.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are ya havin' trouble sleepin'?

00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:40.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not that.

00:40:40.925 --> 00:40:43.160 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's just my turn at guard duty.

00:40:43.193 --> 00:40:46.698 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NATSU] Seems like you
were spacin' out to me.

00:40:46.731 --> 00:40:48.700 position:33% line:89% align:start
[LUCY sighs]

00:40:48.733 --> 00:40:50.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
No, I--

00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:53.337 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was thinking about
why we were sent here.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:57.507 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we fulfill our mission, this
whole island could be destroyed.

00:40:59.711 --> 00:41:01.144 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
You should come up here.

00:41:01.178 --> 00:41:03.213 position:24% line:83% align:start
[LUCY] No, thanks.
Besides, I'm in a skirt.

00:41:03.246 --> 00:41:04.882 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
Who cares? Climb on up!

00:41:04.916 --> 00:41:07.552 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jeez. You are so pushy!

00:41:09.854 --> 00:41:12.857 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait! I'm not a monkey, ya know?

00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:17.495 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
Here. Take my hand.

00:41:27.772 --> 00:41:32.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUCY] Wow! I've never
seen anything like it.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.512 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful!

00:41:35.713 --> 00:41:38.416 position:21% line:83% align:start
You said you wanted
to see the stars.

00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:42.687 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.224 position:7% line:83% align:start
Chances like this are why you
have to keep your chin up!

00:41:47.458 --> 00:41:48.893 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're right!

00:42:00.238 --> 00:42:04.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Lily. What's the deal
with all of these soldiers?

00:42:04.375 --> 00:42:06.277 position:13% line:89% align:start
I wonder what's going on.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
And my Graydar is still
going into overdrive.

00:42:08.946 --> 00:42:10.815 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey! Ya see that emblem?

00:42:10.848 --> 00:42:13.651 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GUARD Q] There they are, men!
There goes Fairy Tail!

00:42:13.685 --> 00:42:14.786 position:30% line:83% align:start
[PANTHERLILY]
What?

00:42:14.819 --> 00:42:17.855 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GAJEEL] I dunno. We literally
haven't done anything.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:18.856 position:38% line:89% align:start
Careful.

00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:20.825 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't think they're
coming to welcome us.

00:42:20.859 --> 00:42:22.560 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, well.

00:42:22.593 --> 00:42:23.896 position:30% line:89% align:start
Capture them!

00:42:23.929 --> 00:42:26.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
'Cause if they've come
lookin' for a fight...

00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:28.633 position:10% line:89% align:start
...then we'll give' em one!

00:42:28.666 --> 00:42:31.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know my darling is near!

00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:35.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's some sort of
commotion ahead of us!

00:42:35.673 --> 00:42:37.241 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll check it out!

00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:38.877 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please be careful, Gray!

00:42:38.911 --> 00:42:41.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NATSU] Oh, here comes
the welcome wagon!

00:42:41.679 --> 00:42:43.281 position:27% line:89% align:start
[GUARDS yelling]

00:42:47.285 --> 00:42:49.487 position:21% line:83% align:start
Head to the temple!
I'll handle the guards!

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.521 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, okay!

00:42:50.555 --> 00:42:51.489 position:33% line:89% align:start
Keep goin'!

00:42:51.522 --> 00:42:52.691 position:30% line:89% align:start
Aye-aye, Sir!

00:42:52.725 --> 00:42:55.627 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh my god!
Why are you that color?!

00:42:55.661 --> 00:42:56.795 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY]
Huh?

00:42:56.829 --> 00:43:00.531 position:13% line:83% align:start

It's the leg fighter.

My Graydar has been

No. I'll explain it all later.

[NATSU] The moment I touched it,
I could feel it.

00:45:57.177 --> 00:46:00.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
The dragons' anger.
Their suffering.

Now's your chance to escape!

Hm?

It's kinda pathetic.

What? Beautiful.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.180 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I don't understand.

00:55:23.214 --> 00:55:26.150 position:19% line:83% align:start
My lovely kicks should
leave you mesmerized!

00:55:26.183 --> 00:55:27.384 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
While your kicks are lovely,

00:55:27.418 --> 00:55:30.454 position:21% line:83% align:start
something's lacking
in your execution!

00:55:30.488 --> 00:55:34.559 position:21% line:83% align:start
The seven stars will
judge you more harshly!

00:55:34.593 --> 00:55:37.027 position:30% line:89% align:start
Grand Chariot!

00:56:18.169 --> 00:56:20.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS] What're you
trying to prove, Sonya?

00:56:20.572 --> 00:56:24.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hand over the Dragon Cry
before I lose my patience.

00:56:24.743 --> 00:56:26.378 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SONYA]
I can't.

00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:27.646 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
Okay, give it up!

00:56:27.679 --> 00:56:29.214 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY]
Right now!

00:56:29.247 --> 00:56:30.482 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:56:32.117 --> 00:56:33.818 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY]
Sonya?

00:56:33.852 --> 00:56:36.454 position:27% line:89% align:start
[SONYA gasping]

00:56:36.488 --> 00:56:38.189 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SONYA]
Where did his Majesty go?

00:56:38.223 --> 00:56:40.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
What're you doing
with the Dragon Cry?

00:56:43.461 --> 00:56:46.298 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SONYA]
But King Animus was just here.

00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:47.832 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
I'll take it from ya!

00:56:47.866 --> 00:56:50.735 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, I can't-- I--

00:56:50.769 --> 00:56:53.772 position:27% line:83% align:start
You must not let
them take the staff!

00:56:56.841 --> 00:56:58.677 position:27% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS (SONYA)]
Sonya. There's not much time.

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:02.314 position:10% line:83% align:start
I need the Dragon Cry in my
hands. Bring it to me at once!

00:57:02.347 --> 00:57:03.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought I made it
clear that Sonya...

00:57:03.748 --> 00:57:06.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
...in your mindless
impulsivity, you dared...

00:57:06.318 --> 00:57:08.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
The ceremony's to be
held tomorrow night.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.256 position:13% line:89% align:start
Surely they will be there.

00:57:13.525 --> 00:57:18.296 position:10% line:83% align:start
See that they don't survive.
Do you understand me?

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:20.298 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SONYA gasps]

00:57:20.332 --> 00:57:23.736 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your Majesty, are we the same?

00:57:23.769 --> 00:57:26.739 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would've thought you'd realize
it much sooner than this.

00:57:26.772 --> 00:57:27.740 position:35% line:89% align:start
You're me.

00:57:27.773 --> 00:57:30.241 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's time you face the truth.

00:57:30.275 --> 00:57:33.244 position:24% line:83% align:start
That you and I are
one and the same.

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.382 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sonya, no!

00:57:43.856 --> 00:57:46.559 position:19% line:89% align:start
[NATSU, HAPPY scream]

00:57:50.529 --> 00:57:53.766 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wait, just who are you really?

00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:55.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:57:55.735 --> 00:57:59.405 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you must know, I'm Animus.

00:57:59.438 --> 00:58:02.541 position:10% line:89% align:start
And I am the Dragon Soul...

00:58:02.575 --> 00:58:05.344 position:10% line:89% align:start
...that lives within Sonya.

00:58:05.378 --> 00:58:06.445 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're a dragon?

00:58:06.479 --> 00:58:10.650 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:58:10.683 --> 00:58:12.818 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now tell us what
you're planning.

00:58:12.852 --> 00:58:15.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm guessin' you're not
actually gonna use the staff

00:58:15.321 --> 00:58:17.957 position:19% line:83% align:start
to stop the Stellanium
from blowin' up, are ya?

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:19.759 position:24% line:89% align:start
[ANIMUS chuckles]

00:58:19.792 --> 00:58:21.227 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS]
Poor Sonya.

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
To think she believed
such nonsense.

00:58:23.963 --> 00:58:27.266 position:19% line:89% align:start
How incredibly naive.

00:58:27.299 --> 00:58:30.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
All this time, my goal has
been to finally free myself

00:58:30.269 --> 00:58:33.572 position:7% line:83% align:start
from this pathetic human body
and live as I was intended!

00:58:33.606 --> 00:58:36.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
Igneel was able to pull
it off, so why can't you?

00:58:36.742 --> 00:58:41.213 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know him? The fearsome
king of the fire dragons?

00:58:41.247 --> 00:58:42.848 position:30% line:83% align:start
Igneel had the
luxury of entering

00:58:42.882 --> 00:58:45.251 position:21% line:83% align:start
the most compatible
type of human.

00:58:45.284 --> 00:58:49.922 position:16% line:83% align:start
He was allowed to choose
a Dragon Slayer.

00:58:49.955 --> 00:58:51.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
I, however, did not
have the time

00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:54.393 position:7% line:89% align:start
to carefully choose my vessel.

00:58:54.427 --> 00:58:57.329 position:13% line:83% align:start
I had to pick the nearest
living human at the time,

00:58:57.363 --> 00:59:00.433 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sonya, who lay on the
ground gravely wounded.

00:59:00.466 --> 00:59:01.500 position:27% line:89% align:start
Because of this,

00:59:01.534 --> 00:59:05.471 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've never been able to
leave her of my own will.

00:59:05.504 --> 00:59:09.275 position:16% line:83% align:start
But the Dragon Cry staff
changes everything!

00:59:13.013 --> 00:59:17.017 position:13% line:83% align:start
For its true purpose is to
amplify a dragon's power!

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:19.019 position:7% line:89% align:start
Freedom will be mine at last!

00:59:19.052 --> 00:59:21.888 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
No way in hell!

00:59:24.024 --> 00:59:28.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's you. You're the
one that Igneel chose?

00:59:30.563 --> 00:59:32.498 position:27% line:89% align:start
Natsu! Take it!

00:59:32.531 --> 00:59:33.232 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sonya?

00:59:33.265 --> 00:59:34.735 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SONYA]
Before it's too late!

00:59:34.768 --> 00:59:36.903 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS]
Stop this! Sonya!

00:59:36.937 --> 00:59:37.738 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SONYA gasps]

00:59:37.771 --> 00:59:40.006 position:41% line:89% align:start
Natsu!

00:59:43.677 --> 00:59:46.580 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Dragon Cry's power
will be mine to wield!

00:59:46.613 --> 00:59:49.816 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa! Big dog!

00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:51.383 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SONYA]
Sir Zash.

00:59:51.417 --> 00:59:56.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
Animus-- Or wait, is it
Sonya that's speaking?

00:59:56.056 --> 00:59:58.925 position:7% line:83% align:start
As the ruler of this kingdom,
you gave me orders,

00:59:58.959 --> 01:00:02.496 position:30% line:83% align:start
and as Sonya,
you followed my orders.

01:00:02.529 --> 01:00:03.730 position:21% line:89% align:start
To be quite honest,

01:00:03.764 --> 01:00:07.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've grown rather weary of your
bothersome identity crisis.

01:00:07.901 --> 01:00:11.605 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SONYA] I don't understand what
you plan to do with the staff.

01:00:11.638 --> 01:00:16.977 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm going to get my revenge
on the Fiore Kingdom!

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:21.381 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Dragon Cry is a highly
condensed form of ether-nano.

01:00:21.414 --> 01:00:22.682 position:16% line:89% align:start
Once it's been released,

01:00:22.716 --> 01:00:25.318 position:19% line:83% align:start
it will rain down more
destructive magic power

01:00:25.352 --> 01:00:27.521 position:7% line:89% align:start
than a dozen Etherion blasts!

01:00:27.554 --> 01:00:30.023 position:5% line:83% align:start
And as punishment for expelling
me from my homeland,

01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:33.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm going to wipe Fiore
off the map forever!

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.595 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll show them the dark arts!

01:00:35.629 --> 01:00:40.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, Red Knife. These scraps of
flesh are yours to feast upon.

01:00:40.867 --> 01:00:44.404 position:27% line:89% align:start
[ZASH laughing]

01:00:44.437 --> 01:00:45.772 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HAPPY]
Stop!

01:00:45.806 --> 01:00:46.873 position:30% line:89% align:start
[HAPPY yelps]

01:00:49.409 --> 01:00:52.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna let you
gobble 'em up like dog food.

01:00:52.846 --> 01:00:55.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
You don't wanna mess
with Red Happy, 'kay?

01:00:55.649 --> 01:00:58.919 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're gonna regret it,
ya hear me?

01:00:58.953 --> 01:01:02.023 position:38% line:89% align:start
[roars]

01:01:07.761 --> 01:01:10.965 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

01:01:16.703 --> 01:01:19.406 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whoa! That was
incredible, Happy!

01:01:19.439 --> 01:01:21.943 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Thanks, Lucy.

01:01:21.976 --> 01:01:23.376 position:35% line:89% align:start
You okay?

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:26.147 position:30% line:83% align:start
You'll die for
betraying me, Zash!

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.915 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sonya!

01:01:27.949 --> 01:01:29.684 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wait a sec, what's happening?

01:01:29.717 --> 01:01:31.986 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

01:01:48.836 --> 01:01:51.639 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS]
All of you will die!

01:01:51.672 --> 01:01:53.406 position:35% line:89% align:start
A dragon?

01:02:02.516 --> 01:02:05.419 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look after Happy
and Sonya, Lucy.

01:02:07.488 --> 01:02:08.589 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZASH]
Hm?

01:02:13.527 --> 01:02:15.463 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZASH]
Greetings, Your Majesty!

01:02:15.496 --> 01:02:17.999 position:13% line:83% align:start
It seems your current form
lacks the appreciation

01:02:18.032 --> 01:02:20.034 position:10% line:89% align:start
for our royal architecture.

01:02:20.067 --> 01:02:22.703 position:24% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS] Hand over
the Dragon Cry at once!

01:02:22.737 --> 01:02:25.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ZASH] You wanted this
transformation, did you not?

01:02:25.873 --> 01:02:28.609 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your goal has already
been achieved.

01:02:28.643 --> 01:02:31.012 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS]
That's not true!

01:02:31.045 --> 01:02:36.117 position:7% line:83% align:start
What I desire is the ultimate
freedom to do as I please!

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:38.753 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then allow me to
grant you that freedom.

01:02:38.786 --> 01:02:41.722 position:24% line:83% align:start
How very fortunate
to have my help!

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:47.628 position:38% line:89% align:start
[roars]

01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:54.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're free to rampage
as much as you want!

01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:56.570 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's all up to you!

01:02:56.604 --> 01:02:59.774 position:27% line:89% align:start
[NATSU yelling]

01:02:59.807 --> 01:03:00.808 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:03:08.816 --> 01:03:09.850 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:17.625 position:10% line:83% align:start
These meddlesome fairies are
hellbent on getting in my way.

01:03:17.658 --> 01:03:19.727 position:24% line:83% align:start
I knew this would
someday come to pass.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.899 position:19% line:83% align:start
Therefore it's time to
unveil my secret weapons.

01:03:23.932 --> 01:03:26.969 position:7% line:89% align:start
Come forth, Quartum Soldiers!

01:03:34.743 --> 01:03:35.877 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.555 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, this isn't
lookin' too good.

01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:48.957 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're surrounded.

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.626 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah! There must be
hundreds of 'em!

01:03:54.563 --> 01:03:55.697 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look out!

01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:01.603 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're really strong, too!

01:04:05.607 --> 01:04:06.908 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZASH]
Quartum Soldiers!

01:04:06.942 --> 01:04:09.811 position:13% line:83% align:start
Keep the fairies occupied
until they die!

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.947 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

01:04:17.319 --> 01:04:18.787 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LUCY]
Those are scary.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.722 position:13% line:89% align:start
They're Quartum Soldiers.

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
Zash's fourth generation
Dragon Slayers.

What? Fourth generation?

01:04:24.626 --> 01:04:26.862 position:21% line:83% align:start
He created an entire
army of soldiers

01:04:26.895 --> 01:04:29.231 position:7% line:89% align:start
using Dragon Slayer lacrimas.

[LUCY]
Open. Gate of the Archer!

01:04:36.905 --> 01:04:38.673 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come forth, Sagittarius!

[SAGITTARIUS]
Howdy do!

[LUCY]
Let's blow these creeps away!

We can do it in a jiffy, missy!

I beseech thee, Dragon Cry!

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:22.285 position:21% line:83% align:start
Unleash your divine
power onto this world!

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.995 position:21% line:83% align:start
Those magic circles,
what are they?

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.298 position:16% line:89% align:start
Must be the Dragon Cry.

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:39.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hisui! We must evacuate everyone
in Crocus immediately!

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.838 position:24% line:89% align:start
We have to hurry!

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:44.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
All of the dragons'
fury and hatred,

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.043 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's about to rain
down upon the city!

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.212 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's happening up there?

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:53.816 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think we're too late!

[ZASH]
The time is upon us!

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.854 position:16% line:89% align:start
O long departed dragons,

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:02.892 position:13% line:83% align:start
transform your anger into
weapons of almighty destruction!

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.265 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get away from me!

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:16.973 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks, buddy!

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.841 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sure beats climbin'
those stairs, huh?

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:19.876 position:33% line:89% align:start
Damn right!

[ZASH laughing]

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:29.919 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can feel it!

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:33.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
The entire continent is
covered by a magic circle!

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.858 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now you die, Fiore!

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:36.993 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:40.763 position:10% line:89% align:start

What is all that?

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:02.752 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think it's the Dragon Cry!

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.055 position:19% line:83% align:start
And it's going totally
nutso for some reason!

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:07.057 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're gonna have to stop it!

The staff is mine, human!

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.064 position:16% line:89% align:start
You shall not touch it!

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:15.831 position:33% line:89% align:start

are a Dragon Slayer!

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:44.328 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSU]
And what's it to you?

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.263 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS]
Because of vermin like you,

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:49.499 position:24% line:83% align:start
our mighty race of
dragons fell from power!

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:52.936 position:19% line:89% align:start
You stole our freedom!

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:54.905 position:16% line:89% align:start
You deserve punishment!

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:59.376 position:7% line:83% align:start
And now you shall feel the raw
ferocity of a dragon's fury!

[ANIMUS]
Dragon Cry!

01:09:00.271 --> 01:09:03.241 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let every dragon's
anger flow through me

01:09:03.274 --> 01:09:06.009 position:19% line:89% align:start
to destroy this world!

01:09:16.154 --> 01:09:20.391 position:5% line:83% align:start

No, I will not move!

You've done more
than enough harm

01:09:36.474 --> 01:09:39.477 position:7% line:89% align:start
to the good people of Stella!

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:43.247 position:16% line:83% align:start
Their souls are longing
to cry out in joy.

01:09:43.281 --> 01:09:45.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're yearning to shine
as brightly as the stars

01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:48.152 position:7% line:89% align:start
that illuminate the night sky.

01:09:48.186 --> 01:09:49.921 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your Majesty.

01:09:49.954 --> 01:09:54.992 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your soul used to shine,
but it fell to darkness

01:09:55.026 --> 01:09:58.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
and you're trapped
inside that chasm.

01:09:58.996 --> 01:10:01.933 position:7% line:89% align:start
You were once so kindhearted,

01:10:01.966 --> 01:10:05.002 position:10% line:89% align:start

Please.

You're wrong.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.290 position:7% line:89% align:start
I never lived to kill dragons.

01:11:31.323 --> 01:11:34.026 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've got a better
reason than that!

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
For my friends. To protect them.

01:11:39.598 --> 01:11:42.301 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's why I'm still alive.

01:11:42.334 --> 01:11:44.102 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's why I fight!

01:11:44.136 --> 01:11:47.272 position:10% line:89% align:start
And why I'm gonna stop you!

Neither human nor dragon.

Who cares?

It doesn't matter
what you call me,

01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:19.941 position:10% line:83% align:start
Although, in reality, I had
lost him a long time ago.

01:17:19.974 --> 01:17:22.377 position:21% line:83% align:start
He disappeared deep
into the darkness

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:24.579 position:7% line:89% align:start
of anger, fear, and deception.

01:17:24.612 --> 01:17:26.781 position:16% line:89% align:start
He caused so much pain.

01:17:28.416 --> 01:17:31.519 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SONYA]
His people suffered terribly.

01:17:32.987 --> 01:17:34.756 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe he was always evil.

01:17:34.789 --> 01:17:42.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
But for so long I thought of him
as my very own flesh and blood.

01:17:42.064 --> 01:17:46.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
He was using me this entire
time. I know that now.

01:17:46.467 --> 01:17:49.872 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it made me happy
to never feel alone.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.776 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wish that things would've
been different between us.

01:17:54.809 --> 01:17:55.710 position:21% line:89% align:start
That we'd cared for

01:17:55.743 --> 01:17:58.680 position:24% line:83% align:start
and supported each
other unconditionally.

01:17:58.713 --> 01:18:01.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wish that we'd
been truly close.

01:18:04.887 --> 01:18:07.555 position:27% line:83% align:start
That we would've
loved like you do.

[NATSU chuckling]

01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:14.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
We got lots of love!
We're like a family!

01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:16.531 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye!

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.001 position:38% line:89% align:start
We are!

01:18:19.034 --> 01:18:22.437 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ALL laugh]

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:11.195 position:7% line:89% align:start
Somebody help. Please save me!

[SONYA screams]

01:23:14.499 --> 01:23:17.335 position:35% line:83% align:start
[DRAGON A]
This turned out very nicely.

01:23:17.369 --> 01:23:22.340 position:10% line:83% align:start
The little girl wasn't going
to satisfy my appetite.

01:23:22.374 --> 01:23:24.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
I am Acnologia,
Slayer of Dragons,

01:23:24.808 --> 01:23:28.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
and I've come to this place
to wipe your unclean kind

01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
off the planet once and for all!

01:23:30.114 --> 01:23:33.285 position:24% line:89% align:start
[DRAGONS roaring]

01:23:46.764 --> 01:23:51.236 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry that I was
unable to protect you.

01:23:51.269 --> 01:23:55.773 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I will exterminate every
dragon that now draws breath.

01:23:57.976 --> 01:24:01.479 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ANIMUS]
Acnologia.

01:24:01.513 --> 01:24:08.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
No. I'm not ready
to die. Not yet.

01:24:08.987 --> 01:24:13.325 position:10% line:89% align:start
The girl. She's still alive.

01:24:13.358 --> 01:24:16.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please, tell me your name.

01:24:16.561 --> 01:24:24.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do so, and perhaps we can
survive... together, as one.

01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:27.072 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sonya.

01:24:32.544 --> 01:24:34.479 position:30% line:89% align:start
What nonsense.

01:24:39.851 --> 01:24:42.187 position:7% line:89% align:start
There goes Acnologia himself.

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.023 position:7% line:89% align:start
One day, we will destroy him.

01:24:47.092 --> 01:24:51.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
The battle is upon us,
Natsu. Ready?
