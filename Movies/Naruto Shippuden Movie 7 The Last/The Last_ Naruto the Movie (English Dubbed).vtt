Hamura?

00:55:13.479 --> 00:55:16.182 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hamura Otsutsuki. The founder
of the Shinobi of the Moon.

00:55:17.016 --> 00:55:21.921 position:5% line:77% align:start
Perhaps it's clearer to say he's

 <i>Founder of the Shinobi</i>

 <i>Hamura's blood.</i>

00:55:32.366 --> 00:55:36.671 position:13% line:5% align:start
 <i>The Sage of Six Paths, the</i>

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:44.078 position:7% line:5% align:start
 <i>He feared that the Ten Tails,</i>
 <i>with its massive chakra and</i>

 <i>calamity upon the world.</i>

00:55:44.979 --> 00:55:52.454 position:16% line:5% align:start
 <i>So the Sage of Six Paths</i>

 <i>The husk of the Ten Tails whose</i>

 <i>the Gedo Statue...</i>

00:55:58.893 --> 00:56:04.299 position:7% line:5% align:start
 <i>...was hidden away and sealed</i>

 <i>Tails would never be revived.</i>

00:56:04.933 --> 00:56:09.672 position:7% line:5% align:start
 <i>Hamura decided to live on the</i>

 <i>Statue.</i>

00:56:10.172 --> 00:56:14.277 position:5% line:5% align:start

 <i>Earth.</i>

00:56:14.778 --> 00:56:18.782 position:5% line:5% align:start
 <i>But Hamura was skeptical of the</i>
 <i>world that his elder brother</i>
 <i>was creating.</i>

00:56:19.048 --> 00:56:23.953 position:7% line:5% align:start
 <i>If the world fashioned by his</i>

 <i>as a weapon.</i>

00:56:39.336 --> 00:56:44.443 position:5% line:5% align:start
 <i>Ultimately, the Gedo Statue was</i>
 <i>stolen and the Ten Tails</i>
 <i>revived.</i>

00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:47.779 position:16% line:5% align:start
 <i>Our clan has reached the</i>
 <i>conclusion...</i>

00:56:49.514 --> 00:56:52.017 position:10% line:5% align:start
 <i>...that the Shinobi of Earth</i>
 <i>will destroy the world's</i>

00:56:53.518 --> 00:56:57.355 position:5% line:5% align:start

00:56:57.956 --> 00:57:00.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
And so now, per Hamura's
Celestial Decree...

00:57:01.427 --> 00:57:04.096 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>...I will destroy that world.</i>
