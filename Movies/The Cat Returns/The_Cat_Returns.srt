1
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:29,415
If you find yourself troubled by something mysterious

2
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:31,728
or a problem that's hard to solve,

3
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:34,947
there's a place you can go where you always find help.

4
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:37,759
You just need to look for it.

5
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,217
Not again.

6
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:00,232
Aren't you up yet?

7
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:01,193
I'm up. I'm up.

8
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:12,191
Whatever.

9
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:15,884
Hey, Mom.

10
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,791
Really, why do you bother setting an alarm clock?

11
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:21,369
Gotta go.

12
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:23,783
Too bad you don't have time to eat.

13
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:25,259
Mmm, mmm.

14
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:28,977
It's delicious.

15
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:31,165
That's just mean.

16
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:32,988
Have a nice day.

17
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:45,496
Oh!

18
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,410
Oh, my shoe.

19
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,069
Oh, excuse me?

20
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,079
Oh, come on.

21
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:14,814
The kingdom is gone, yet the mountains and rivers remain.

22
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:19,006
And the castle is draped in the vivid green of spring.

23
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:23,198
Haru, we can see you sneaking in,
so just get to your seat, please.

24
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:23,897
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:27,670
Busted.

26
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:54,700
Sorry.

27
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:05,223
It's not fair. First I have a bad morning,

28
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,324
and then everyone laughs at me in class.

29
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:09,895
Even Machida was laughing, wasn't he?

30
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:11,323
Yeah, pretty hard.

31
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:14,324
Why me? Why are all these bad things happening to me?

32
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,878
Hmm, maybe it's some kind of weird omen, Haru.

33
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,103
Like your life is gonna get a whole lot worse real soon.

34
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:24,334
Thanks. That helps a lot.

35
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,831
That's odd. Never seen him.

36
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,502
Why worry about what Machida thinks anyway?

37
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:41,708
I just think he's so darn cool.

38
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:42,713
You should tell him that.

39
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,815
What if he has a girlfriend? I'd look like a jerk.

40
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,814
He does have a girlfriend. A freshman. Really cute.

41
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,088
Then why are you telling me to flirt with him?

42
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,537
Cause I wanna to have a good laugh when he blows you off.

43
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:53,674
You are terrible.

44
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,089
Machida's not that cool.

45
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:57,228
My Tsuge is much cooler and...

46
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:57,914
Tsuge again?

47
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,515
Careful.

48
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,272
What the heck was that?

49
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,027
Cat burglar.

50
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:17,689
Where's he going?

51
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:21,099
Hey, dumb cat! You'll get killed!

52
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:26,971
Oh, well, it's just a cat.

53
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,299
This doesn't look so good.

54
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,061
Huh?

55
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,303
Ah! What is he doing?

56
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,722
Haru, don't!

57
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,235
So I should be there in... Oh!

58
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:49,186
No way. What a catch!

59
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,298
Oh! Ahhh!

60
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,324
Hey, you stupid jerk!

61
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,492
Oh, cat, that was close.

62
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:26,110
That was quite a brave act you performed
on my count. I am extremely grateful.

63
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,206
I hope you are not injured yourself.

64
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:35,392
Well then. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in a hurry.

65
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:37,279
I'll return later to thank you properly.

66
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,147
Uh, that's okay.

67
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:44,101
Haru!

68
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,806
Well, so much for your stick,

69
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,821
but at least you rescued that stupid cat.

70
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,142
It talked.

71
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:57,591
What?

72
00:05:58,478 --> 00:05:59,829
That cat spoke to me.

73
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,228
Hey, did you hit your head?

74
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:13,261
Mom, I'm home.

75
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,538
Watch it! Quilt on the floor.

76
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,499
Oh my, this pattern's a disaster.

77
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,858
Could you make dinner tonight?

78
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:24,944
Hey, Mom?

79
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:25,982
Mmm-hmm.

80
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,468
Do you think cats can talk?

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,326
Sure. Why not?

82
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:37,434
What?

83
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,561
You've asked me that question before you know.

84
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:41,233
Yeah?

85
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:43,650
When you were just a little girl.

86
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,998
You said, "Mommy, did you know I can talk to cats?"

87
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:47,764
I said that?

88
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,303
Yes. You don't remember?

89
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,475
Hmm.

90
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:10,647
Hmm?

91
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:14,748
Hey, what's wrong?

92
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,584
Oh, you're pretty hungry, huh?

93
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:21,178
Do you like fish?

94
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,662
They're really good. Here, try some.

95
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,678
You're really dirty, kitty.

96
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,811
Do you like the fish?

97
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:34,861
See. I told you.

98
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,307
You want some more?

99
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,596
Okay, you can have them all.

100
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,732
No, you don't need to do anything for me.

101
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:50,213
Haru.

102
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,077
Mommy!

103
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:54,603
What were you doing over there?

104
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,878
I was talking with the kitten.

105
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:01,619
So I asked you what the kitten said to you.

106
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:02,916
And do you know what you said?

107
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,018
You said the kitten told you that life is tough.

108
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:09,994
I thought it was so adorable.

109
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:19,129
So it looks like that actually happened.

110
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:24,692
Let's forget about it, go to sleep,
and get up in time for breakfast.

111
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:49,170
Huh?

112
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:20,195
Uh...

113
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:25,886
Uh, come over here.

114
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:30,143
Hmm?

115
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:32,530
Mmm-hmm. A bit closer.

116
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:44,597
Please allow me to present our
wise and incredibly magnificent ruler,

117
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:48,046
King of Cat Kingdom, the Cat King.

118
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,208
That's me, babe.

119
00:10:56,328 --> 00:11:02,149
Let it be known the cat whose life you saved today
was none other than the king's only son, Prince Lune.

120
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,313
Given the magnitude of the matter,

121
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:08,563
the king would like to express his
gratitude to you in his own words.

122
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:09,578
Oh.

123
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:17,504
Thanks a lot, babe.

124
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,352
A list of what you shall receive.

125
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:34,006
Starting tomorrow, that perfectly marvelous
array of gifts will be showered upon you.

126
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:38,361
Thank you.

127
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:39,650
Mmm.

128
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:42,040
Ciao, babe.

129
00:11:57,706 --> 00:11:58,277
Oh.

130
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,330
Just a dream.

131
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:26,261
No way. You don't know anything about this at all?

132
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,804
I have no idea. I just woke up.

133
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,014
Then where did these come from?

134
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,148
Haru, get down here!

135
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:44,306
Look at this. What has happened to our yard?

136
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,884
What? Those look like cat tails.

137
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,345
Okay. I must be working too hard. I'm going back to bed.

138
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:08,050
Leave me alone! Stupid cats!

139
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:09,110
Huh?

140
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:12,641
Hey, what do I do with all the lacrosse sticks?

141
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:13,617
Hi, guys. Gotta run.

142
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:19,684
What is that about?

143
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,798
Does she have catnip on her?

144
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,381
Catnip? What for?

145
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:24,617
Beats me.

146
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:29,191
Hey! No pets on school property, young lady.

147
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:30,577
No! They're not mine!

148
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:34,866
What's going on?

149
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:38,537
Huh?

150
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:05,733
So it wasn't a dream. Those cats
from last night must be behind this.

151
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,868
I'm starting to think it was
a big mistake to save that cat.

152
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:10,688
Huh?

153
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:17,170
Stick, cat tails, catnip, mice...

154
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:19,834
Haru?

155
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,500
What?

156
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,522
Did you get the catnip off you?

157
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:28,339
Oh, yes, someone stuck some
in my pockets but it's gone now.

158
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:29,920
Wow, that's weird.

159
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:34,845
Okay, I've got a big favor to ask you.

160
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,303
Can you take my turn for cleanup duty today?

161
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:41,602
Tsuge's got a big game and if I
don't leave after class, I'll miss it.

162
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:43,459
Please, please, please.

163
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:45,319
Oh, Tsuge.

164
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:47,428
Yeah, sure, I'll do it.

165
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:49,701
Thanks, Haru. You're a lifesaver.

166
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,382
Come on, Tsuge. Go!

167
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:04,159
Yeah!

168
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:07,268
Yes! He's so cool!

169
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:17,384
Huh?

170
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:31,124
Ahhh!

171
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:34,503
Careful. Watch your step.

172
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:36,112
Thanks.

173
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:39,237
Ah... That hurt.

174
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:43,557
Oh, look at the mess I made.

175
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,393
Oh, I missed.

176
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,390
Who do I think I'm fooling anyway?

177
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:04,221
There she is. Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

178
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:05,545
Hmm?

179
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:06,979
Hmm...

180
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:13,641
Hmm? Oh...

181
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:14,399
Ahhh!

182
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:17,133
You cats just never let up!

183
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:19,700
Well, we're so glad that you're pleased.

184
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:20,680
No, I'm not.

185
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,945
What? But how can that be?

186
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,547
The whole kingdom is working to make you happy.

187
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:28,141
And we all agreed that the gifts were fabulous.

188
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:30,672
Don't you cats know anything?

189
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:31,648
I hate mice. I don't eat them

190
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:34,617
I'm allergic to cat tails and catnip does nothing for me.

191
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:36,609
Oh, my, my, my, my, my.

192
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,430
I guess we made a little mistake.

193
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:41,719
Well, this is embarrassing.

194
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:45,414
The king will not be happy when he hears about this.

195
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,962
I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?

196
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,459
I overreacted, didn't I?

197
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:49,969
Mmm.

198
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:55,125
I've just been on edge recently.
Things have not been going well for me.

199
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:57,675
Oh? What kind of things?

200
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,703
I don't know. Everything, you name it.

201
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,625
I'm shocked to hear this.

202
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:06,891
But I suppose even pretty girls like
you have problems like everyone else.

203
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:10,521
What? Stop. That's enough.

204
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,297
It is nowhere near enough.

205
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,992
The Kingdom of Cats has vowed not to
rest until you are completely satisfied.

206
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:18,242
Don't tell me there's more?

207
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:19,508
Yes.

208
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:24,695
How would you like to have a private
tour of the spectacular Kingdom of Cats?

209
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,250
Are you serious?

210
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,890
I'm sure you'll love it there. It's a marvelous place.

211
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:35,460
Great food, fabulous scenery and the
entire Cat Kingdom is ready to welcome you.

212
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:36,164
Hmm.

213
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:41,242
And that's not all. Because the king is so taken with you,

214
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:44,945
he has awarded you the most
valuable gift in the Cat Kingdom.

215
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,992
You will become his daughter-in-law and marry Prince Lune.

216
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:49,744
Huh?

217
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:54,203
Oh no! Don't think about trying to pull that one on me.

218
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,364
There is no way I can marry a cat.

219
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,906
Don't be so hard on yourself.

220
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:01,609
The royal family thinks you're
good enough and the prince is so cool.

221
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:01,922
Hmm?

222
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:04,700
He's cool?

223
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:05,829
Mmm-hmm.

224
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,905
Who knows? Maybe I'd fit in better with a bunch of cats.

225
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:21,827
Ooh!

226
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:24,428
You get to lie around all day, don't you?

227
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:25,624
But of course.

228
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:27,132
The cat's life sounds great.

229
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,850
Eat all the food you want,

230
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,013
take naps in the sun, forget about all your problems.

231
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:37,358
But me getting married to some
cat prince, that's just ridiculous.

232
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:38,428
Right, cat?

233
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:42,224
Fantastic. We'll collect you tonight, then.

234
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:46,138
No, I didn't agree to that. Hey, wait!

235
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:46,889
Oh!

236
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:49,687
Ow!

237
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,929
Oh, that hurt.

238
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,556
Okay, think, Haru.

239
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,116
You gotta do something about this.

240
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,710
What can I do? Those cats are relentless.

241
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:02,007
They'll do whatever they set their mind to.

242
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:05,358
So you know they'll find a way to
kidnap me and I'll have to marry a cat.

243
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:10,397
I now pronounce you cat and wife. You may kiss the bride.

244
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,147
No, no, I don't want to marry a cat!

245
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,428
Haru. Haru.

246
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:20,238
What was that?

247
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:25,219
Haru, go to the Cat Bureau. You must find the Cat Bureau.

248
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:30,553
Hey, come on. Who's there? Who's messing with me now?

249
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:35,631
They will help you there. Look for
a large, white cat at the crossroads.

250
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,210
He will show you the way.

251
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,421
A cat at a crossroad?

252
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,904
Find the white cat and go to the Cat Bureau, Haru.

253
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:45,421
You'll need their help.

254
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:04,927
Find the Cat Bureau.

255
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:08,862
Never heard of a Cat Bureau.

256
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,448
Look for a large white cat...

257
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,697
At least it was a pleasant voice.
Maybe the white cat will be nice, too.

258
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:24,682
That was one long, weird day. I definitely need a break.

259
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:29,014
Oh! What in the heck was that?

260
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,401
Hey, you big fatso. You cats keep freaking me out.

261
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:38,159
Are you the big white cat? Are you?

262
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:42,603
Listen, cat. I need to know where the Cat Bureau is.

263
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:48,218
A voice told me to ask you.

264
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:53,580
Hmm.

265
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,791
Must have the wrong person. I
mean cat. I have the wrong cat.

266
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,579
Sorry I sat on you.

267
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,185
Wait. I'll show you.

268
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:04,305
It's him!

269
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:09,015
Wait a minute. Slow down.

270
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:35,702
Isn't there an easier way?

271
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,272
Hey. Hey, come on.

272
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:41,507
Guess I shouldn't have called him Fatso.

273
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:49,839
Huh?

274
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,844
Huh?

275
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:48,519
Oh...

276
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:06,500
Wow, this is one weird place.

277
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,287
Uh, excuse me, where's the Cat Bureau?

278
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,680
Um, hello? I need some help right now.

279
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,430
I'm gonna get dragged off to the Cat Kingdom.

280
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:01,823
Could this be it?

281
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,244
Enough, Baron. Turn it off.

282
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:27,088
No one's impressed with your cheesy light show, okay?

283
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,203
Good evening. Welcome to the Bureau.

284
00:24:55,924 --> 00:24:56,445
Uh...

285
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,093
Oh.

286
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,023
Wow, you're cool.

287
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:04,906
Thank you. In case you have noticed that you're
now in a world quite different from your own.

288
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,429
This is a refuge for creations.

289
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:11,249
Whenever someone creates
something with all of their heart,

290
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:13,437
then that creation is given a soul, you see?

291
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:16,375
Like me and Toto there.

292
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:29,726
That's... That's...

293
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:32,226
That is Toto. A stone statue with a soul.

294
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,065
I see you have a visitor today, Baron. How unusual.

295
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:38,742
Indeed. She's quite a fetching one, too.

296
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:40,281
Did he say Baron?

297
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:43,843
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

298
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,077
The artisan who created me gave me that title.

299
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:48,726
I'll just call you Baron.

300
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:53,867
So, let's get down to business. You say you're having
a bit of trouble with those cats from the Cat Kingdom.

301
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:55,961
Uh, yes. That's right.

302
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:59,039
Just yesterday I saved their
prince from getting hit by a truck,

303
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:01,631
and now the entire Cat Kingdom
won't stop trying to repay me.

304
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:02,515
I see.

305
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:06,825
Huh! Serves you right. Thought
you'd help the poor kitty, did you?

306
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,695
You should've minded your own business, lady.

307
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:14,976
Muta, what in the world is your problem?

308
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,718
This girl saved one of your own kind.

309
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,744
You should be grateful. You idiot.

310
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:22,179
Idiot? Now she's in trouble for it, isn't she?

311
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:24,664
So she was stupid, that's all I'm saying.

312
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,820
And where did you come across her, Muta?

313
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:32,414
At the crossroads. Somehow she knew about the Cat Bureau.

314
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:33,382
Hmm.

315
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:39,203
That's cause a voice told me about it.
I don't know whose voice it was, though.

316
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:40,078
A voice?

317
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:41,312
You're hearing voices?

318
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:44,367
Check yourself into a loony
bin. Don't bother us with... Ahhh!

319
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,078
Knock it off!

320
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:48,289
You knock it off. Quit being so catty.

321
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:50,304
Don't try that again. Ahhh!

322
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,078
You guys, I'll just leave. I
don't want to cause any trouble.

323
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:55,851
I didn't get your name.

324
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:58,586
Uh, Haru. It's Haru.

325
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:01,234
Well, Miss Haru, please step into the Bureau.

326
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:05,032
Come along now. Don't worry about them.

327
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:06,436
Try that again chicken wings!

328
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,791
Can't you tell the difference between chickens and crows?

329
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,836
Of course I can, I'm not the birdbrain here.

330
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:13,523
Well at least I don't look like a giant marshmallow.

331
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:16,359
Oh yeah? At least I don't have a bird brain.

332
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,954
You already said that you idiot.

333
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:20,891
I did all right things. Go fry yourself, you big chicken.

334
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:24,369
You already called me a chicken
too! You got a hair ball in your brain.

335
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:28,875
This looks close.

336
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:33,812
Wow, this place is beautiful.

337
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:36,367
Make yourself at home.

338
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:37,352
Thanks.

339
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,664
Milk with your tea, or lemon?

340
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:41,793
Milk, please.

341
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,039
Good choice.

342
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:44,243
Oh.

343
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:49,965
Ooh.

344
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,037
You have great taste, Baron.

345
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:54,885
Here you are.

346
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:55,924
Thank you.

347
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:00,173
How cute.

348
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:03,071
That's my own personal blend of tea.

349
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:06,603
It's a little different each
time, so I can't guarantee the taste.

350
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:12,032
Wow, that's the best tea I've ever tasted.

351
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,287
Then you're lucky.

352
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,371
Just tastes like boiled grass to me.

353
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:21,118
Tea is too refined for your crude taste buds.

354
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,712
At least I don't eat worms.

355
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:28,478
Muta, why don't you have a seat and kindly tell
us what you know about the Kingdom of Cats please.

356
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:30,822
It's a dangerous place.

357
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,290
You shouldn't set foot in there
if you don't believe in yourself.

358
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:35,759
That's a very good point.

359
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:38,470
They said not only will they kidnap me,

360
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:42,040
they're going to force me to marry Prince Lune.

361
00:28:42,212 --> 00:28:44,642
So, why don't you do it kid. You'll be set for life.

362
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:45,580
Are you crazy?

363
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:47,454
Why? It might not be all that bad.

364
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,060
That's ridiculous.

365
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:51,197
She won't know until she tries it.

366
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:51,793
Now, then...

367
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:58,439
I've always entertained the idea of
paying a visit to the Kingdom of Cats.

368
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,002
Sounds like now is the time.

369
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,694
Have a nice trip baron.

370
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,345
Hope you make it back some day.

371
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,916
You're coming with me.

372
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:08,165
Nah, I'll pass. But thanks for thinking of me.

373
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,994
Baron, you're not gonna take her there, are you?

374
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,048
We can't leave her unprotected.

375
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,134
But if Muta wants to stay here,
he can keep an eye on her. Hmm?

376
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,587
No way. You can't leave her here. I'm not babysitting.

377
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,439
Why? Are you busy at the moment?

378
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:24,298
Not really.

379
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:25,908
Listen, I'll just go home.

380
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:27,361
Hmm?

381
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:28,561
What?

382
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:31,767
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause you so much trouble.

383
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,915
Muta's right. It's my fault for getting
involved with those cats in the first place

384
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:39,259
I'll figure something out.

385
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:45,161
Well, then, so sorry the Cat
Bureau couldn't be of any help to you.

386
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:48,205
Ah...

387
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:50,257
All right, all right.

388
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:53,501
I'll watch the little baby.

389
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:54,759
Good kitty.

390
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:58,517
Then it's settled. You can stay here with Muta.

391
00:29:59,048 --> 00:29:59,642
You sure?

392
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:01,816
Oh, don't you worry about Muta.

393
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:05,057
He likes to complain a lot but
actually he has a heart of gold.

394
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:05,952
Hmph!

395
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,303
Hmm.

396
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:08,834
I see.

397
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:11,384
So he's just a big softie.

398
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,542
You could say that.

399
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:14,954
And this is the thanks I get.

400
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:18,173
Thank you for your help, Moo-ta.

401
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:21,556
What? "Moo"?

402
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,649
Are you saying that I'm a fat cow?

403
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:24,862
No, you're just fat.

404
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:26,673
I like this girl better every minute.

405
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:28,267
I'm outta here.

406
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,361
That's too bad. Because I was just going to get
out some Angel Food cake I'm having in the cabinet.

407
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,803
Where in the cabinet?

408
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:35,954
Uh, it's in the upper-right shelf.

409
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:37,861
Why didn't you say so?

410
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:41,400
I think our guest deserves a proper afternoon tea.

411
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:44,634
This calls for some of my special mulberries.

412
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,564
You're too much, Baron. A tea party and everything?

413
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,490
Anything I can do to help?

414
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:55,306
Hmm. Yes, there is something.

415
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:00,259
What I need you to is learn just
one thing. Always believe in yourself.

416
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,728
Do this, and no matter where you
are, you will have nothing to fear.

417
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:04,846
Mmm-hmm.

418
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:09,032
Baron, hey, give me a hand with this whipped cream.

419
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:10,517
You're going all out.

420
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:11,949
Better believe it.

421
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,846
Who knows? Maybe this is the world I belong in.

422
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:21,144
Hey, is that Toto?

423
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:29,048
It's time to go to our kingdom, Miss Haru.

424
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:34,208
You again! No! Hey! Get away from me!

425
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:35,433
Hmm?

426
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:39,621
Skip the tea.

427
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:44,944
Don't let them take me away, please!

428
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:48,971
Baron, a bunch of cats are headed this way.

429
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:49,835
Oh, no.

430
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,171
A little late, birdbrain.

431
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:52,992
Toto, give me a lift.

432
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:58,389
Ouch!

433
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:02,169
We had a hard time finding you.

434
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:02,991
Let me off.

435
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:03,421
What?

436
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:06,936
Careful, Miss Haru.

437
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:10,092
Stop these cats. You little
jerk. I want off this thing now.

438
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,905
Don't worry. You're just having
pre-wedding jitters, that's all.

439
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:16,038
No, I'm not!

440
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:23,468
She could've waited until after we had cake. Ow!

441
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,429
Quit that!

442
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,609
Let me go. Stop it. It hurts.

443
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:29,156
They're coming for me.

444
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,906
I said let me go.

445
00:32:30,944 --> 00:32:32,327
Okay, Toto. Now!

446
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,536
Wait. I take it back!

447
00:32:38,617 --> 00:32:41,218
Why did you let him fall? You cats are terrible.

448
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:43,119
You're gonna regret that.

449
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:44,750
Muta!

450
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:47,107
We're over the weight limit.

451
00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:51,242
Toto.

452
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,181
I see it.

453
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,317
Let me off this thing!

454
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,450
Ahhh!

455
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,966
Outmaneuvered.

456
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,013
Get above the trees.

457
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:24,667
Right.

458
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,271
Now what?

459
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:44,319
They're riding the wind. Follow the lights.

460
00:33:44,344 --> 00:33:44,890
Got it.

461
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:00,614
Oh, that hurt.

462
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:04,325
Where am I, anyway? I can't see a thing.

463
00:34:13,745 --> 00:34:16,596
Muta. What happened? You're enormous.

464
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,580
No, kiddo. You got smaller.

465
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:20,293
Hmm?

466
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:22,955
Why's that?

467
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:25,995
Because we're here, that's why.

468
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:38,974
That's the Kingdom of Cats?

469
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:58,181
That's it.

470
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,196
Wow, there are cats all over the place.

471
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:28,141
What did you expect? It is their kingdom.

472
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:29,430
Hey, you!

473
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:41,016
Ah, it's so relaxing here.

474
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:44,047
Hey, we have to find a way out of here fast, chickie.

475
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:45,219
Relax.

476
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:46,278
Listen, kid...

477
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:48,984
I've never felt so at home in my life.

478
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:52,070
Hurry. You've got to get out of here.

479
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:57,016
You must leave. You don't belong here.

480
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,226
Wow! You're beautiful.

481
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:02,695
Everything's better here. Even the cats.

482
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,375
Quickly. You don't have much time.
Please, Miss Haru, before it's too late.

483
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,492
Wait a minute. How do you know my name?

484
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:12,807
Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

485
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:13,987
Huh?

486
00:36:14,445 --> 00:36:15,961
Oh, not him again.

487
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:19,352
There you are. I finally found you.

488
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:23,953
We seemed to have accidentally dropped you upon entry.

489
00:36:24,203 --> 00:36:27,297
Your fat servant exceeded our weight limit I'm afraid.

490
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:29,266
Huh? Fat servant?

491
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:32,156
No, no, this is Muta. He's a friend.

492
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:36,723
That's nice. Come on. Everyone's
dying to meet their new princess.

493
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,377
Fat friend, you can come, too.

494
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:41,422
I don't know about this.

495
00:36:41,438 --> 00:36:42,312
Mustn't doubt it at all.

496
00:36:42,328 --> 00:36:43,891
The king is waiting in your castle.

497
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:44,805
My castle?

498
00:36:45,147 --> 00:36:46,919
The royal palace.

499
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,094
My castle?

500
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,430
Well, soon enough.

501
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:51,988
Hmm.

502
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:54,641
Hey, where do you think you're going?

503
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:58,391
The king's waiting for me. It's
kind of rude not even to say hi to him.

504
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,961
Have you completely lost your mind kid?

505
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:01,946
This way.

506
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:02,841
Wait a minute.

507
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,703
Can she come with us?

508
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,172
Who are you?

509
00:37:08,508 --> 00:37:11,055
I'm Yuki. I serve at the royal table.

510
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,719
Oh, so you're employed by the king then?

511
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:16,664
She works at the castle, miss Haru. You'll see her there.

512
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:17,273
Come.

513
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:18,930
See you soon, Yuki.

514
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,006
Ow, ow, ow! Hey!

515
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,070
Poor Haru.

516
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:57,510
Ugh, look at that. Creepy.

517
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:07,343
Mmm, looks good. My future daughter-in-law.

518
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:12,060
Hmm.

519
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,021
All right! Think I'll go and have a look in person.

520
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:23,084
Hmm. Why does that fatso seem so familiar?

521
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,442
You'll need to change before meeting the king.

522
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,043
I get new clothes?

523
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:42,778
Please wait here, sir.

524
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:43,927
I'm the babysitter.

525
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:45,333
Back off.

526
00:38:45,418 --> 00:38:46,676
What's your problem?

527
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,950
Fat friend, help yourself to refreshments while you wait.

528
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:51,880
Yeah, okay, I'll wait.

529
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,949
Oh...

530
00:38:59,652 --> 00:39:01,918
Hey, not bad.

531
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,394
Miss Haru, you're so lucky.

532
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:09,465
Every girl in the Cat Kingdom has a crush on Prince Lune.

533
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:12,457
I'm sure you'll be very happy together.

534
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:16,933
You think? No, wait. I don't think I wanna do this.

535
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:20,551
Wow, don't you look good.

536
00:39:20,855 --> 00:39:23,739
Welcome to the royal family, babe.

537
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:30,631
Hmm.

538
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:34,860
Mmm.

539
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,951
Tell me, who is that cat?

540
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,913
I believe his name is Muta.

541
00:39:49,326 --> 00:39:50,151
Muta?

542
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:53,499
Never heard that name.

543
00:39:57,118 --> 00:39:58,751
No match for my stomach.

544
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:02,356
Hmm...

545
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:09,415
So King, I'm really flattered by all
this but I don't want to get married.

546
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:13,562
You what? I was told you had already consented.

547
00:40:14,055 --> 00:40:15,977
She has consented. That's what I was told.

548
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:19,001
What does the prince say?

549
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,930
He is away on official business.

550
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:22,988
Mmm.

551
00:40:24,313 --> 00:40:29,266
Look, first of all, we don't really know
each other, and second of all, he's a cat, right?

552
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:31,993
And I'm not. So, clearly, I can't marry him.

553
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:33,501
Huh?

554
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:39,338
That has already been taken care of.

555
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,605
You're half cat already.

556
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:48,351
Oh...

557
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:50,789
See, Miss Haru?

558
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:56,680
Look at that. I'm a cat.

559
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:07,330
Muta!

560
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:12,798
Muta, what happened?

561
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,110
I'm afraid he had a weakness for catnip
jelly. He saw the bowl and dove right in.

562
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:23,020
Muta, you weren't supposed to die. It's all my fault.

563
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:26,907
Don't leave me like this, Muta.

564
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:29,798
Well then. Time for the celebration.

565
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:32,103
No, I won't leave him!

566
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,853
Then we'll bring him with us.

567
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,251
That's Prince Lune's bride.

568
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,634
She has lovely fur.

569
00:41:50,704 --> 00:41:52,774
And such delicate paws.

570
00:41:57,046 --> 00:41:59,358
I hear you don't care for mice,

571
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:03,124
but I bet you can't resist my juicy, raw fish, huh?

572
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:06,053
I'm not sure she's enjoying herself.

573
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:08,624
Sire, how about some entertainment?

574
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:09,960
Excellent suggestion.

575
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:40,849
Not entertaining enough.

576
00:42:40,898 --> 00:42:41,558
Yes, sire.

577
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:17,731
Next.

578
00:43:46,062 --> 00:43:49,064
Whoever's next better not stink. Got it?

579
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:04,620
Hmm?

580
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:11,186
Your Majesty, I promise that I
will make the young lady smile.

581
00:44:11,592 --> 00:44:12,303
Hmm.

582
00:44:13,374 --> 00:44:14,374
Shall we try him?

583
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:16,723
Sure. Why not?

584
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:20,899
Huh?

585
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,107
Excuse me. Would you care to dance?

586
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,155
Oh, no, I'm a meow-sy dancer.

587
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:31,498
No, now I'm being starting to talk like a cat.

588
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:34,683
Just trust me.

589
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:21,873
Well, she seems to be entertained now.

590
00:45:35,345 --> 00:45:36,481
What's happening to me?

591
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:40,126
I've never felt like this before.

592
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,407
Maybe life as a cat wouldn't be so bad.

593
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:49,251
Careful, Haru. Don't lose yourself.

594
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:50,322
Huh?

595
00:45:51,275 --> 00:45:53,009
Believe in who you are.

596
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,536
I said so before, didn't I?

597
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:05,293
Then you must be...

598
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:11,696
Stop right there, pal!

599
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:23,515
You're not from my kingdom, are you?

600
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:26,031
Exactly who are you?

601
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:31,046
How rude of me. I should have introduced myself.

602
00:46:33,398 --> 00:46:35,687
I am exactly who I appear to be.

603
00:46:38,556 --> 00:46:39,723
Oh...

604
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:46,414
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen and I have come for Haru.

605
00:46:46,782 --> 00:46:47,543
Baron!

606
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:49,492
He's so cool.

607
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:51,145
He is handsome.

608
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:53,602
He can't have her. Seize them!

609
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,545
I'm stuffed.

610
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,790
Muta? You're still alive!

611
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:16,298
Oh, no!

612
00:47:16,314 --> 00:47:18,823
Give me back my daughter-in-law.

613
00:47:19,525 --> 00:47:22,189
Quickly, get His Majesty to a safe place.

614
00:47:26,072 --> 00:47:30,415
Emergency exit for all guests right
here, please, thanks. Enjoy your day.

615
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:32,126
Ah!

616
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:40,302
Great technique, Muta.

617
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,076
I just lost my balance.

618
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:45,881
Over here.

619
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:49,748
Yuki, you're here.

620
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:53,802
I'm so thankful you were able to help Miss Haru, Baron.

621
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:55,084
Do we know each other?

622
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,896
Many of us here know of you and your bureau.

623
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:02,818
Yuki, I'm an idiot. I should've left
when you told me to. Now look at me.

624
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:06,888
Listen, if you leave here by dawn,
you can still turn back into a human.

625
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:07,873
I will?

626
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,709
This will get you outside the castle.

627
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:11,638
Perfect.

628
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:13,423
Wait. Where's Muta?

629
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:22,702
Hmm.

630
00:48:23,406 --> 00:48:25,449
He'll be fine. We just need to get you home.

631
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:37,777
The back of the castle.

632
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:40,949
The door to your world is at the top of that tower.

633
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,222
You've got to be kidding me.

634
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:47,034
And the only way to get to the
tower is through the king's maze.

635
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:48,594
Naturally.

636
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:53,034
Good luck. And, Baron, take good care of Haru.

637
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:54,269
Hey, wait.

638
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:58,519
She's already gone. I didn't have a chance to thank her.

639
00:48:58,947 --> 00:49:01,417
Haru, does her voice sound familiar to you?

640
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:05,308
Could it be possible that she is the one
who told you to seek help at the Cat Bureau?

641
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:10,472
Haru, go to the Cat Bureau. You must find the Cat Bureau.

642
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:13,105
You're right. That was her voice. I'm sure of it.

643
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:14,368
But why help me?

644
00:49:20,552 --> 00:49:22,271
Ah! Ah! Ah!

645
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:30,284
Whose idea was it to leave
without me? I nearly got killed.

646
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:32,455
This is no time for finger-pointing.

647
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:32,854
Mmm-hmm.

648
00:49:35,463 --> 00:49:37,029
You're leaving me again?

649
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:43,541
Are they going in?

650
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:45,743
Yes, they've just begun.

651
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:47,111
Purr-fect.

652
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:49,759
No one's ever come out alive, have they?

653
00:49:50,094 --> 00:49:52,578
We can watch them go nuts from over here.

654
00:49:56,408 --> 00:49:57,830
Hurry, we don't have much time.

655
00:49:58,314 --> 00:49:59,642
We'll make it. It's still noon.

656
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:01,157
It's always noon here.

657
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:02,720
What do you mean?

658
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,009
At home, it's already after midnight.

659
00:50:06,415 --> 00:50:08,196
What? We've got to go faster.

660
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:12,361
Where do we go?

661
00:50:15,615 --> 00:50:16,928
They're lost already.

662
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:19,904
They're doing worse than most of our victims.

663
00:50:19,956 --> 00:50:21,124
Pleased, Your Majesty?

664
00:50:22,685 --> 00:50:24,701
Feeling good, babe.

665
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:25,857
Where are the guards?

666
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:26,736
Right there.

667
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:29,909
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

668
00:50:29,934 --> 00:50:33,856
Let's start with this path. If we're
methodical about this, we're sure to find our way.

669
00:50:34,021 --> 00:50:37,313
Keep your eye on the tower. That
will allow us to stay orientated.

670
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:38,568
Good idea.

671
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:40,865
Muta, you're cheating.

672
00:50:41,256 --> 00:50:44,006
Gimme a break. You think I'm gonna get in trouble?

673
00:50:45,365 --> 00:50:46,982
He's cheating.

674
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:49,240
She's gonna rub this in my face, isn't she?

675
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:54,514
Let's get out of here while Muta keeps them occupied.

676
00:50:55,365 --> 00:50:57,385
Again, I'm tricked into being bait.

677
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,258
Stay behind me, Haru.

678
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:30,144
Wow.

679
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:32,654
Oh, how's your cane?

680
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:35,683
Bent, but it's about time for a new one, anyway.

681
00:51:36,151 --> 00:51:37,839
I never knew they were so useful.

682
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,187
Nice shot, sire.

683
00:51:52,353 --> 00:51:54,205
Oh no, you hit one of ours.

684
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:54,853
I did?

685
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:57,481
Good heaven your Majesty, how could you?

686
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:59,266
Let's keep that between us.

687
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:01,728
Excuse me, but I think there's a bit of a problem.

688
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,278
What?

689
00:52:02,923 --> 00:52:04,666
Our guards are scattered everywhere.

690
00:52:04,681 --> 00:52:06,673
Don't tell me they're lost, too?

691
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:08,142
Where's my princess?

692
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:11,876
She's already halfway through.

693
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,639
Hey!

694
00:52:14,728 --> 00:52:15,843
You found us.

695
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:17,150
What's that way like?

696
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:18,171
Just dead ends.

697
00:52:35,881 --> 00:52:37,779
Now this is more like it, babe.

698
00:52:39,184 --> 00:52:39,912
Hmm.

699
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,849
Another dead end. My, my, this is getting interesting.

700
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:46,388
Hmm. Two rights and a left...

701
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,623
Wait a minute, I know there wasn't a wall here.

702
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,592
Your brain's overheating.

703
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:54,052
No it's not. We just walked through here, Muta.

704
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,324
What do you think, walls have legs?

705
00:52:59,988 --> 00:53:00,793
Hmm.

706
00:53:01,163 --> 00:53:03,624
She's right, Muta. This wall is fake.

707
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:16,350
Told you.

708
00:53:16,649 --> 00:53:17,743
Good work, Haru.

709
00:53:17,836 --> 00:53:19,524
All right, fine, good work.

710
00:53:20,704 --> 00:53:24,211
How stupid do you have to be to line up like dominoes?

711
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:29,423
Princess!

712
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:31,625
Wait. It's not safe, Your Majesty.

713
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,593
Go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

714
00:53:45,312 --> 00:53:45,710
Oh!

715
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:49,291
What a show-off.

716
00:53:50,823 --> 00:53:51,932
I can walk.

717
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:52,784
Don't worry.

718
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:08,712
Hmm?

719
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:14,371
Your Majesty! Please, this is very dangerous.

720
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:16,043
I can't let them escape.

721
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:21,057
You'll never reach them in time. Besides,
we have guards station in the tower.

722
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:24,754
Why didn't you say so?

723
00:54:33,368 --> 00:54:34,386
Toast.

724
00:54:38,503 --> 00:54:39,199
Whoa'!

725
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:48,426
I'll have a word with the contractors.

726
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:50,731
It's too late for that.

727
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:54,285
We'll have to use the detonator.

728
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:57,306
Not that, I beg of you, sire.

729
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:59,996
Think of what it will do to your approval ratings.

730
00:55:00,184 --> 00:55:00,957
Button.

731
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:03,379
I don't have it. I must have left it in the castle.

732
00:55:03,395 --> 00:55:04,457
Look what I found.

733
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:07,668
No! No! Oh! No!

734
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:11,012
Hey, we made it to the top.

735
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:12,809
Not much further now.

736
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:17,103
Bye-bye, tower.

737
00:55:23,023 --> 00:55:23,633
Baron!

738
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:24,735
Brace yourselves.

739
00:55:40,952 --> 00:55:43,129
Excellent explosion, Your Majesty.

740
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:45,116
Let's go.

741
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:51,897
You've got to be kidding. We're back where we started.

742
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:54,858
Now what do we do? Just stand here?

743
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:56,624
Nothing else we can do.

744
00:55:56,842 --> 00:55:58,519
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

745
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:01,835
Quick, quick! Get 'em! Get 'em!

746
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,417
Baron, nice to see you again.

747
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:10,046
Princess, would you please
accompany me back to the castle?

748
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,911
And being a cat's not so bad.

749
00:56:14,274 --> 00:56:16,595
Do I have to learn to eat mice?

750
00:56:17,202 --> 00:56:19,874
Perhaps you shouldn't give up quite yet, Haru.

751
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:38,762
What in the world has Father done now?

752
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:40,308
Father!

753
00:56:42,637 --> 00:56:45,512
Lune? You're back already?

754
00:56:46,262 --> 00:56:48,058
The prince is here. Line up!

755
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,074
It's the prince?

756
00:56:55,722 --> 00:56:58,715
Yuki sent a message to me
saying it was urgent that I return.

757
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:00,582
Perhaps you'd like to tell me what's going on?

758
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:02,902
Miss Haru!

759
00:57:04,262 --> 00:57:05,473
Yuki, you're here.

760
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,988
I'm glad Lune made it in time.

761
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:09,715
I just wanted to repay the girl who rescued you.

762
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:16,043
And I thought, just maybe, you would be happy
to have a good-looking girl like Haru for a bride.

763
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:20,699
I have already chosen my bride.
I have decided to marry Yuki.

764
00:57:20,955 --> 00:57:21,582
Huh?

765
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:24,858
That thing?

766
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,848
Guess it was a surprise.

767
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:28,286
You know I like this prince.

768
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,221
This is for you. I traveled to your old home to get these.

769
00:57:44,385 --> 00:57:46,469
I haven't had these in years.

770
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:50,072
Wow. |I used to love those when I was a kid.

771
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:55,049
I know. You fed me a whole box
of these when I was just a stray.

772
00:57:56,572 --> 00:57:58,526
That filthy little kitten was you?

773
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:02,241
You're so beautiful now, I
never would have recognized you.

774
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:09,572
Yuki, will you accept these crackers as a symbol of my
love for you for as long as our nine lives shall last?

775
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:16,232
So these crackers mean that you
can marry the prince instead of me!

776
00:58:18,643 --> 00:58:20,358
I'm so happy for you.

777
00:58:21,643 --> 00:58:23,048
Thank you, Haru.

778
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:25,963
Thank you for feeding me when I was a kitten.

779
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:28,440
Without you I might not be alive today.

780
00:58:28,736 --> 00:58:31,635
So you're the girl with the
fish crackers Yuki told me about.

781
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:35,432
And you also the one who rescued me
when I nearly got myself killed by a truck.

782
00:58:35,924 --> 00:58:39,963
We both owe you our lives,
Haru. What can we do to repay you?

783
00:58:40,276 --> 00:58:43,823
You don't have to repay me. I'm
just glad things turned out so well.

784
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:46,176
I guess I did the right thing after all.

785
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:53,166
This is all very moving.

786
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:57,049
I had no idea you had a bride in mind already.

787
00:58:57,221 --> 00:58:58,440
You should've told me.

788
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:03,245
Poor Haru. You must feel like such a loser.

789
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:04,018
Not really.

790
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:05,495
No. I'm sure you do.

791
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:07,370
So, look. I have a great idea.

792
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:09,120
You should marry me instead.

793
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:15,221
I'll get you some fish, too, as a
symbol of my undying love and all that.

794
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,556
So?

795
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:20,088
That's very generous, but I just want to be myself again.

796
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:22,604
I'll change you back if you marry me.

797
00:59:23,178 --> 00:59:23,846
Hmm?

798
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:26,760
I've had just about enough of you.

799
00:59:28,862 --> 00:59:33,783
Nobody decides who I am but me, and
there's no way on Earth I'd ever marry you!

800
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:37,979
Was that a no?

801
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:43,995
So you're not ready to get hitched then, huh, kid?

802
00:59:45,604 --> 00:59:46,471
Not a chance.

803
00:59:46,591 --> 00:59:49,092
I respect a woman who stands up for herself.

804
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:53,153
Even if she does stick her
nose in other people's business.

805
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:56,096
So I, Renaldo Moon, will defend her.

806
00:59:56,156 --> 00:59:57,073
Renaldo?

807
00:59:57,088 --> 00:59:58,448
Renaldo Moon?

808
00:59:58,635 --> 01:00:00,128
The Renaldo Moon?

809
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:02,055
So that's who he is.

810
01:00:02,071 --> 01:00:02,425
Who?

811
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,377
How could you have forgotten?

812
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:08,385
He's such a notorious criminal,
his story is written on our walls.

813
01:00:08,711 --> 01:00:12,174
Years back, an enormous white
cat appeared out of no where,

814
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,135
devoured all the fish in the lake and then ran off.

815
01:00:15,151 --> 01:00:17,358
He called himself Renaldo Moon.

816
01:00:18,964 --> 01:00:21,409
Did you really do that, Muta? That's disgusting.

817
01:00:22,433 --> 01:00:25,862
And this time I'll eat the entire castle.

818
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:28,463
Hurry! Get His Majesty to safety, now!

819
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,307
Protect Haru from the king.

820
01:00:36,658 --> 01:00:38,995
Yes, sir. Cat guard, advance.

821
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,038
Oh, you traitor.

822
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:45,869
Please, sire, it's not safe.

823
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:49,897
Hurry. Take Miss Haru to the exit.
I'll hold back the king as long as I can.

824
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,916
How to exit? The tower collapsed.

825
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:54,368
It's all right, the exit is still there.

826
01:01:01,013 --> 01:01:01,703
The sky.

827
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,390
Oh, no, the sun's rising.

828
01:01:03,474 --> 01:01:04,933
I'll get her to the exit.

829
01:01:11,158 --> 01:01:11,955
Nice.

830
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,283
Run, Haru. Hurry.

831
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,861
Good luck, and thank you.

832
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:16,152
Mmm-hmm.

833
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,694
Goodbye, Yuki.

834
01:01:24,652 --> 01:01:26,176
I wasn't wrong to save a cat.

835
01:01:27,082 --> 01:01:29,481
No matter what happens, I believe in my decision.

836
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,168
I believe.

837
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:33,145
I believe.

838
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:39,301
I'll hold them off.

839
01:01:39,316 --> 01:01:40,184
Thanks, Muta.

840
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:42,215
Where's the king?

841
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:43,566
Up there.

842
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:47,393
Father, you'll hurt yourself. Get down.

843
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:48,996
Has he lost his mind?

844
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:50,426
I'll find a way to get him down.

845
01:02:05,507 --> 01:02:08,388
Fight like a cat, you chicken!

846
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:09,699
With pleasure.

847
01:02:10,128 --> 01:02:10,832
Need help?

848
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:12,176
Take care of Haru.

849
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:13,244
You got it.

850
01:03:00,346 --> 01:03:01,419
I win, King.

851
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,518
How embarrassing.

852
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:19,010
I heard rumors about a nosy cat figurine

853
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:21,568
who likes to help others with their problems.

854
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:25,574
I assumed you'd be just some a
kitschy knick-knack that collected dust.

855
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,084
Had I known you were this good,

856
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,606
I would have asked you to come and work for me.

857
01:03:33,302 --> 01:03:36,068
I prefer a life of sticking my nose in other's problems.

858
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:39,875
Where am I?

859
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:45,959
What have you done?

860
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,329
I didn't do anything.

861
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:53,767
The tower is hundreds of feet shorter now.

862
01:03:53,845 --> 01:03:57,351
I wouldn't be surprised if the
exit had moved as well, babe.

863
01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:58,766
Miss Haru.

864
01:04:04,196 --> 01:04:05,629
Oh, no, the exit moved!

865
01:04:05,644 --> 01:04:07,090
We should have foreseen this.

866
01:04:07,504 --> 01:04:10,114
But look. She is not a cat anymore.

867
01:04:19,138 --> 01:04:19,991
Help me!

868
01:04:21,951 --> 01:04:22,755
I'm going to fall.

869
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:25,732
I'm going!

870
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:29,036
Haru!

871
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,444
Muta, I hope I'm not too heavy.

872
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:48,185
From now on, you're not allowed
to make any more fat jokes.

873
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:01,496
I'm sorry, Muta.

874
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:06,857
Hold on!

875
01:05:11,977 --> 01:05:13,604
|I don't wanna die.

876
01:05:14,391 --> 01:05:16,821
You're not dead yet. Open your eyes.

877
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:17,579
Baron?

878
01:05:17,594 --> 01:05:20,207
Spread your arms and look down.

879
01:05:20,277 --> 01:05:22,497
I can't. I'm scared.

880
01:05:23,025 --> 01:05:24,415
Just trust me.

881
01:05:36,403 --> 01:05:38,199
Are you sure we're still alive?

882
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:40,293
Yes. For now.

883
01:05:52,523 --> 01:05:55,198
I think I could learn to like this.

884
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:09,262
What are all these chickens doing here?

885
01:06:11,785 --> 01:06:13,137
A flock of crows?

886
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:14,144
Perfect timing.

887
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:25,695
So, Muta, how does it feel to
be saved by a bunch of birdbrains?

888
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:26,436
Toto!

889
01:06:26,594 --> 01:06:28,209
It sure took you long enough.

890
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:29,859
Nice work, Toto.

891
01:06:30,662 --> 01:06:33,725
I'm just glad I had enough
friends hanging out in the area.

892
01:06:34,084 --> 01:06:35,584
Are you sure we're not too heavy?

893
01:06:36,834 --> 01:06:38,553
You're light as a feather, Haru.

894
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:39,418
Thanks.

895
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,858
I beg to differ.

896
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:42,381
Haru, look.

897
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:45,132
That's my school.

898
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,561
I don't believe it. I'm gonna make it home.

899
01:06:49,658 --> 01:06:51,045
Thank you, everyone.

900
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:00,805
Unbelievable.

901
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:04,165
We won't forget you, Miss Haru.

902
01:07:05,315 --> 01:07:06,547
Your Majesty?

903
01:07:12,923 --> 01:07:16,273
I've been thinking. It may be time for me to retire.

904
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,959
I think I shall accompany you, sire.

905
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:31,374
Thanks, Toto.

906
01:07:33,326 --> 01:07:36,475
Oh, boy, my heart is still pounding.

907
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,514
Scared, were you?

908
01:07:37,638 --> 01:07:39,937
Yes. But I had fun, too.

909
01:07:40,146 --> 01:07:41,342
Really? I didn't.

910
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:45,292
Well then, now that Haru's problem is solved,

911
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:48,435
we should let her go home and get some well earned rest.

912
01:07:49,146 --> 01:07:50,099
Catnap.

913
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:52,654
I guess this is goodbye?

914
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:55,084
One last chore to do.

915
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:12,514
Baron, just for the record, I think
I may have a little crush on you.

916
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:16,975
Just for the record, I admire a
young woman who speaks from the heart.

917
01:08:21,522 --> 01:08:24,889
If you ever need us, you will
always know how to find us again.

918
01:08:25,475 --> 01:08:29,014
And the Bureau's doors will be
open to you, be it day or night.

919
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,827
Until then, trust yourself.

920
01:08:39,093 --> 01:08:39,870
Goodbye.

921
01:08:47,908 --> 01:08:49,561
I'll miss you!

922
01:08:50,912 --> 01:08:51,717
Toto.

923
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:52,842
Baron.

924
01:08:53,248 --> 01:08:55,342
And Fatso!

925
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:57,537
Fatso? I heard that.

926
01:08:57,553 --> 01:08:59,029
She's only telling the truth.

927
01:08:59,045 --> 01:09:00,373
Shut up, birdbrain.

928
01:09:00,405 --> 01:09:03,678
Hey. Don't give me that birdbrain thing
again or I might accidentally drop you.

929
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:05,319
Shut up, you birdbrain.

930
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,919
Oh! I've got to get up.

931
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:46,745
Morning.

932
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:50,019
Haru? What are you doing up so early?

933
01:09:50,615 --> 01:09:52,027
It's not even a school day.

934
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:55,284
I'm going out with Hiromi. Don't want to waste the day.

935
01:09:55,593 --> 01:09:56,316
Huh?

936
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:57,519
So...

937
01:09:59,576 --> 01:10:01,541
I made some breakfast for both of us.

938
01:10:01,837 --> 01:10:02,331
What?

939
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:03,807
I'm done, so help yourself.

940
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,495
And I made some tea, too.

941
01:10:06,252 --> 01:10:06,987
Hmm.

942
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:07,573
Oh.

943
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:08,737
By the way...

944
01:10:09,895 --> 01:10:11,854
...that's my own special blend of tea.

945
01:10:12,147 --> 01:10:15,942
It's a bit different every time,
so I can't guarantee the flavor.

946
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:19,388
Oh, okay.

947
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:25,686
What do you know? Smells good.

948
01:10:26,576 --> 01:10:27,795
That's a great outfit.

949
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,701
So I got some big news you'll be excited about.

950
01:10:31,922 --> 01:10:33,326
Yeah? What is it?

951
01:10:34,545 --> 01:10:36,482
Machida broke up with his girlfriend.

952
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:43,478
Oh, that's too bad.

953
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:45,190
What? Are you kidding?

954
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:46,298
What do you mean?

955
01:10:46,524 --> 01:10:48,642
I thought you'd be ecstatic.

956
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:51,930
Not really. Doesn't matter anymore.

957
01:11:03,782 --> 01:11:05,244
Hey, are you okay?

958
01:11:05,259 --> 01:11:06,337
I'm fine.

959
01:11:06,368 --> 01:11:07,048
Liar.

960
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:08,759
What? I'm better than ever.

961
01:11:09,923 --> 01:11:11,228
What about you Hiromi?

962
01:11:11,244 --> 01:11:11,798
What?

963
01:11:11,829 --> 01:11:13,382
What's going on with you and Tsuge?

964
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:14,829
Nothing new.

965
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:15,673
Come on.

966
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:16,204
What?

967
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,462
Nothing's happening.

968
01:11:17,478 --> 01:11:20,133
Don't give me that. I wanna hear the whole story.
