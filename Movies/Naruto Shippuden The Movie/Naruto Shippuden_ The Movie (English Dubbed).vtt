the night, for which

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.905 position:27% line:83% align:start
our dark medical
ninjutsu was crafted.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:54.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
We shall awaken Moryo

this world, have I?

while, Lord Moryo.

-Have you forgotten?

00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:16.990 position:30% line:83% align:start

-The stars are aligning.

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:33.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
It is time for us to join
forces again and at last create

00:07:33.906 --> 00:07:35.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
the thousand-year kingdom.

MORYO: But where is
my physical self?

00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:44.816 position:10% line:83% align:start

I will scatter to the winds.

I'll take hold of your soul

our master's body is sealed.

00:09:19.272 --> 00:09:22.676 position:24% line:83% align:start
First there is an
enemy you must destroy.

00:09:27.614 --> 00:09:31.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
Seek out the priestess
of the Land of Ogres.

00:09:31.584 --> 00:09:34.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
She alone has the
power to undo me.

-Understood, my lord.

Once I have been
fully resurrected,

00:09:40.526 --> 00:09:43.962 position:24% line:83% align:start
I shall annihilate
the five great nations

How did you end up there?

-Sasuke.

00:13:26.073 --> 00:13:30.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade, you
shouldn't mention Sasuke.

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:33.813 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Are they still not over it yet?

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:34.481 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right.

00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:35.949 position:21% line:83% align:start
So why's Neji here?

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.450 position:30% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: He's
Kakashi's stand-in.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:38.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:41.721 position:16% line:83% align:start
-He and Guy have already
met up with our allies.

00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:43.823 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're headed for the
battle front right now.

00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:46.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
So Neji will serve as
Squad Seven's captain.

00:13:46.558 --> 00:13:48.160 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Why him, though?

00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:50.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Neji is a jonin.

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:53.832 position:10% line:83% align:start
And last time I checked, you
were still a genin, Naruto.

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:54.867 position:30% line:83% align:start
So suck it up.

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:00.973 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Look, just accept it.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:02.074 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Fine.

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:03.942 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm still gonna
go out there and pound

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:06.145 position:7% line:83% align:start
these jerks into dust for you.

00:14:06.177 --> 00:14:09.547 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I will not be sending
your team to the front.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.984 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is an escort
mission for a VIP.

-What, are you kidding me?

00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:17.055 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Quit your complaining and
the woman talk, you idiot!

00:14:17.088 --> 00:14:18.255 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Uh, sure.

00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:20.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
-The enemy's been
moving for several days

00:14:20.323 --> 00:14:24.629 position:7% line:83% align:start
now and leaving a steady trail
of destruction in its wake.

00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:26.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
We know that this
Ghost Army is based

in some sort of
puppet master jutsu.

just lifeless dolls

00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:34.805 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Correct.

00:14:34.838 --> 00:14:36.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Piece of cake.

00:14:36.173 --> 00:14:39.443 position:13% line:83% align:start
We just take down the guy
who's controlling them, then.

00:14:39.476 --> 00:14:42.244 position:19% line:83% align:start
-The one who's pulling
the strings isn't human.

00:14:42.278 --> 00:14:44.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
Moryo is a very powerful demon.

NARUTO: Ah, don't tell me that.

00:14:50.053 --> 00:14:53.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
What are you trying to do,
scare me half to death?

00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:55.458 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?

00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:56.926 position:30% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: There
was once a shinobi

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:00.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
who tried to conquer
this entire continent.

00:15:00.328 --> 00:15:04.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
He used Moryo's power to
raise an invulnerable army.

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:06.468 position:24% line:83% align:start
The demon's horde
descended on one country

00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:10.072 position:13% line:83% align:start
after another, devastating
everything in its path

00:15:10.106 --> 00:15:14.642 position:10% line:83% align:start
and bringing these lands to
the brink of destruction.

00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:18.813 position:7% line:83% align:start
That army is the very same one
we find threatening us now.

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:24.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
Back then, a priestess
from the Land of Ogres

00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:27.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
named Miroku used a
powerful ninjutsu.

00:15:27.654 --> 00:15:29.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
She sealed away Moryo's
soul in the Land

00:15:29.857 --> 00:15:32.926 position:19% line:83% align:start
of Ogres' underground
palace and his physical body

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.197 position:10% line:83% align:start
within a shrine in the Land
of Swamps, averting disaster.

00:15:37.231 --> 00:15:40.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
Newly resurrected, the
demon has once again

00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:43.269 position:13% line:83% align:start
taken command of his Ghost
Army and is making his way

00:15:43.302 --> 00:15:45.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the sealing shrine.

00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:49.109 position:16% line:83% align:start
If Moryo's body and soul
become one and his resurrection

00:15:49.143 --> 00:15:53.379 position:10% line:83% align:start
is completed, the situation
will be irreparable.

00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:54.847 position:27% line:83% align:start
-What'll happen?

00:15:54.881 --> 00:15:58.316 position:7% line:83% align:start
-The world will be destroyed.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
The priestess from
the Land of Ogres

00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:04.623 position:10% line:83% align:start
must be taken to the temple
where the body is sealed

00:16:04.656 --> 00:16:07.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
and seal Moryo's
soul away again.

00:16:07.692 --> 00:16:09.728 position:27% line:83% align:start
The fate of the
world depends on it.

00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:16.001 position:19% line:83% align:start
NEJI: Now listen, our
mission is to ensure

00:16:16.034 --> 00:16:17.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
this woman's survival.

00:16:17.669 --> 00:16:20.437 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sakura, you're to stay with
our charge at all times.

00:16:20.471 --> 00:16:21.006 position:33% line:83% align:start
Understood?

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:23.175 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Got it.

00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:25.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
-If anything should
happen to her,

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:27.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'll have need of
your medical expertise.

00:16:27.645 --> 00:16:29.180 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Absolutely.

00:16:29.214 --> 00:16:32.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Lee, your role is to
fend off the enemy.

00:16:32.049 --> 00:16:33.818 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Roger that.

00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:35.920 position:21% line:83% align:start
-We don't know what
we're up against yet,

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:39.522 position:10% line:83% align:start
so your taijutsu will be the
best defensive option since it

00:16:39.556 --> 00:16:41.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
doesn't depend on chakra.

00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:42.358 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Leave it to me then.

00:16:42.392 --> 00:16:45.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will protect you
with sheer will.

00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:46.462 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Then let's get going.

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:51.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hey, wait a minute!

00:16:51.267 --> 00:16:53.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
Isn't there anything
you want me to do?

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
-That's right, I almost forgot.

00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:58.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'll be running
defense, the same as Lee.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.374 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Got it.

00:16:59.408 --> 00:17:00.910 position:21% line:83% align:start
If any bad guys show
up, I'll put them

00:17:00.944 --> 00:17:02.312 position:24% line:83% align:start
through the school
of hard knocks

00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:05.380 position:5% line:83% align:start
and send them straight to hell!

00:17:05.414 --> 00:17:08.318 position:13% line:83% align:start
-You certainly might look
older, but you haven't really

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.185 position:5% line:83% align:start
changed all that much, have you?

00:17:10.219 --> 00:17:11.720 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:17:11.753 --> 00:17:13.088 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Funny.

00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:15.123 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd heard you'd gotten much
stronger under Master Jiraiya's

00:17:15.157 --> 00:17:16.191 position:35% line:83% align:start
tutelage.

00:17:16.225 --> 00:17:18.693 position:27% line:83% align:start
But clearly your
experience level

00:17:18.726 --> 00:17:22.496 position:7% line:83% align:start
as it pertains to teamwork is
ridiculous-- still genin level.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.736 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now look, we've been given
the role of bodyguards.

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:30.605 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't anyone forget that.

00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:33.040 position:27% line:83% align:start
We mustn't stray
from our charge.

00:17:33.074 --> 00:17:35.508 position:10% line:83% align:start
-He is team captain, Naruto.

00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:36.878 position:41% line:83% align:start
Right?

00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:39.280 position:21% line:83% align:start
-So come on, let us
do the Hidden Leave

00:17:39.313 --> 00:17:40.847 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:17:40.881 --> 00:17:42.883 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, yeah.

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:44.484 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:17:44.517 --> 00:17:45.353 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Ow, ow,ow!

00:17:52.926 --> 00:17:55.795 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Do you think he's gonna
be all right out there?

00:17:55.829 --> 00:17:58.131 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Neji's exceptional at
intelligence gathering

00:17:58.164 --> 00:18:00.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
thanks to his Byakugan.

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:01.500 position:21% line:83% align:start
Plus, he's a jonin.

00:18:01.533 --> 00:18:05.272 position:7% line:83% align:start
He has good judgment, and his
defensive skills are excellent.

00:18:05.305 --> 00:18:08.374 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's perfect for
guarding our VIP.

00:18:08.406 --> 00:18:10.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Well, it's not
Neji, Lee, or Sakura

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.011 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm worried about, my lady.

00:18:14.612 --> 00:18:15.747 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, huh?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
-He failed defensive
jutsu during his training.

00:18:19.018 --> 00:18:21.120 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know that he studied
with Master Jiraiya,

00:18:21.153 --> 00:18:25.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
but still-- that was to improve
his individual abilities.

00:18:25.623 --> 00:18:29.794 position:13% line:83% align:start
-There are some things you
can't learn from training.

00:18:29.827 --> 00:18:31.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
Naruto never gives up.

00:18:31.796 --> 00:18:34.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
His determination is formidable.

00:18:34.899 --> 00:18:36.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need that now.

00:18:36.401 --> 00:18:38.568 position:16% line:83% align:start
Failure isn't an option
for this mission.

00:30:35.247 --> 00:30:37.050 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please, people
don't have visions.

00:30:37.084 --> 00:30:38.751 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's just a bunch of trash!

00:30:38.784 --> 00:30:40.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna become Hokage!

00:30:40.786 --> 00:30:43.321 position:27% line:83% align:start
No way I'm dying
before that, all right?

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.168 position:21% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: Hidden Leaf
teams have attempted

00:30:57.202 --> 00:31:02.474 position:10% line:83% align:start
to ambush the Ghost Army and
take it out in a single stroke.

00:31:02.507 --> 00:31:04.876 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmm?

00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:07.779 position:16% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: But our efforts
have had no effect.

00:31:07.812 --> 00:31:11.950 position:19% line:83% align:start
They continue to march
toward the sealing shrine.

00:31:11.983 --> 00:31:14.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
As suspected, the only
one who can stop them

00:31:14.585 --> 00:31:18.822 position:5% line:83% align:start
is the Land of Ogres' priestess
with her sealing jutsu.

00:31:18.856 --> 00:31:22.358 position:10% line:83% align:start
TARUHO: Lady Shion is to be
escorted to the sealing shrine.

00:31:22.392 --> 00:31:24.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
Only those willing
to offer their lives

00:31:24.494 --> 00:31:26.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
should step forward.

00:31:26.429 --> 00:31:27.697 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is that clear?

00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:28.431 position:24% line:83% align:start
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:31:28.464 --> 00:31:30.833 position:33% line:83% align:start
We owe her.

00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:33.436 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's do it.

00:31:33.469 --> 00:31:35.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
NEJI: Ridiculous.

00:31:36.005 --> 00:31:38.574 position:10% line:83% align:start
ROCK LEE: How much more time
are we going to waste here?

00:31:38.608 --> 00:31:42.444 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Taruho insists on taking
more of their forces with us.

00:31:42.477 --> 00:31:44.914 position:21% line:83% align:start
We are to wait until
preparations are complete.

00:31:44.947 --> 00:31:47.516 position:13% line:83% align:start
-But we need every minute
we can spare right now.

00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:49.384 position:27% line:83% align:start
[pots rattling]

00:31:49.418 --> 00:31:51.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
-So, what do you think, huh?

00:31:51.353 --> 00:31:53.188 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't care how
sharp your spear is.

00:31:53.221 --> 00:31:55.590 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nobody's gonna run
through me now.

00:31:55.624 --> 00:31:56.925 position:30% line:83% align:start
NEJI: Pitiful.

00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:59.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
You don't honestly believe
the ramblings of a priestess,

00:31:59.161 --> 00:31:59.695 position:38% line:83% align:start
do you?

00:31:59.728 --> 00:32:00.327 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:32:00.361 --> 00:32:01.930 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course I don't.

00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:04.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-- I just figured that you guys
must be all worried and stuff

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
after that nut job told
me I was gonna die.

00:32:07.368 --> 00:32:11.205 position:7% line:83% align:start
I only put this on so that you
three would feel better, OK?

00:32:11.238 --> 00:32:13.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: The world is on
the verge of destruction.

00:32:13.307 --> 00:32:14.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
We don't have time
to worry about you.

00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:17.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, this girl is precious.

00:32:17.078 --> 00:32:20.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
It is a true honor to lay
down your life for someone.

00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:21.214 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sure.

00:32:21.247 --> 00:32:23.150 position:19% line:83% align:start
Chance of a lifetime.

00:32:23.184 --> 00:32:26.153 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that is why I'm gonna
flip this stupid prediction

00:32:26.187 --> 00:32:29.556 position:16% line:83% align:start
on its head and save the
world with this right here.

00:32:29.589 --> 00:32:31.591 position:27% line:83% align:start
SHION: You can't
change my prediction.

00:32:31.624 --> 00:32:32.959 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:32:32.992 --> 00:32:33.960 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah?

00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:37.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Here's another one
for you-- you're

00:32:37.329 --> 00:32:38.998 position:24% line:83% align:start
going to meet your
end by beheading.

00:32:39.032 --> 00:32:39.766 position:41% line:83% align:start
-I am?

00:32:44.703 --> 00:32:46.805 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, how about this?

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:49.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Can't escape death.

00:32:49.908 --> 00:32:51.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right, shinobi.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.811 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm ready now.

00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:53.445 position:35% line:83% align:start
Let's go.

00:32:53.479 --> 00:32:54.813 position:24% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Let's go.

00:32:54.847 --> 00:32:55.748 position:33% line:83% align:start
Can't move.

00:32:55.781 --> 00:32:56.682 position:27% line:83% align:start
Guys, come back.

00:32:56.715 --> 00:32:58.282 position:33% line:83% align:start
Little help?

00:32:58.316 --> 00:32:59.118 position:24% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: Honestly.

00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:00.284 position:7% line:83% align:start
ROCK LEE: Naruto, are you OK?

00:33:00.318 --> 00:33:03.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Ugh, I thought
I was gonna die.

00:33:03.788 --> 00:33:05.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, this is a dead end.

00:33:05.623 --> 00:33:08.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
SHION: This waterfall is
where I purify myself.

00:33:08.893 --> 00:33:12.130 position:7% line:83% align:start
It also hides an escape route.

00:33:12.163 --> 00:33:15.298 position:10% line:83% align:start
NEJI: Are you sure you wish
to leave without Taruho?

00:33:15.332 --> 00:33:17.769 position:27% line:83% align:start
SHION: I am the
priestess of this land.

00:33:17.802 --> 00:33:20.470 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I want to leave my
attendants behind, I will.

00:33:28.578 --> 00:33:30.313 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your back's uncomfortable.

00:33:30.347 --> 00:33:32.349 position:19% line:83% align:start
You should try to keep
your body more feminine.

00:33:32.382 --> 00:33:33.315 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Why, you!

00:33:37.486 --> 00:33:39.790 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Who the heck is out there?

00:33:39.823 --> 00:33:41.191 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?

00:33:41.224 --> 00:33:42.926 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, hey, Taruho.

00:33:42.959 --> 00:33:44.560 position:13% line:83% align:start
-What are you doing here?

00:33:44.593 --> 00:33:46.829 position:27% line:83% align:start
-No matter where
you go, it is always

00:33:46.862 --> 00:33:49.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
my duty to watch
over you, Lady Shion.

00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:51.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
-You're nothing
but a burden to me.

00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:52.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now go back to the village!

00:33:52.902 --> 00:33:53.602 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I will not.

00:33:53.636 --> 00:33:55.204 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Go back home!

00:33:55.237 --> 00:33:55.838 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I will not.

00:33:55.871 --> 00:33:56.337 position:35% line:83% align:start
SHION: Go!

00:33:56.371 --> 00:33:57.438 position:35% line:83% align:start
I mean it!

00:33:57.472 --> 00:33:58.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
TARUHO: I will not.

00:34:21.895 --> 00:34:23.497 position:21% line:83% align:start
NEJI (VOICEOVER): No
sign of the enemy.

00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:29.203 position:19% line:83% align:start
-We'll make camp here.

00:34:29.236 --> 00:34:30.404 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:34:30.437 --> 00:34:32.338 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I thought that we were
pressed for time here.

00:34:32.371 --> 00:34:34.041 position:27% line:83% align:start
-If it were just
us, we could keep

00:34:34.074 --> 00:34:35.341 position:10% line:83% align:start
going for several more days.

00:34:35.374 --> 00:34:36.409 position:41% line:83% align:start
But--

00:34:36.442 --> 00:34:37.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
-The other two have
reached their limit.

00:34:37.978 --> 00:34:39.445 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I told you I'm fine!

00:34:39.478 --> 00:34:43.349 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Lady Shion, the sealing
jutsu is very taxing.

00:34:43.382 --> 00:34:48.254 position:7% line:83% align:start
Please, you need to make sure
you get enough rest tonight.

00:34:48.287 --> 00:34:49.088 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I'm hungry.

00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:50.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
Make me some food.

00:34:50.957 --> 00:34:53.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Man, this girl is way too
picky for her own good.

00:34:53.826 --> 00:34:58.331 position:7% line:83% align:start
SHION: This soup is cold, and
I can't eat these or that.

00:34:58.363 --> 00:34:59.265 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Wow.

00:34:59.298 --> 00:35:01.633 position:7% line:83% align:start
I sort of like both of those.

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:02.834 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Me too.

00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:04.703 position:16% line:83% align:start
-My apologies, my lady.

00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:07.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Lighting a bonfire would alert
the enemy to our location.

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:08.907 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I'm going to bed.

[bell ringing]

00:35:35.832 --> 00:35:37.167 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Here.

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:39.002 position:10% line:83% align:start
Looks like we're going to be
running again all day tomorrow.

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:41.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your body will need the
food to keep you going.

00:35:41.104 --> 00:35:42.505 position:13% line:83% align:start
-That's very kind of you.

00:35:49.379 --> 00:35:55.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
-So, um, hey-- about
these predictions and all?

00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:57.387 position:24% line:83% align:start
-She can only see
someone's death

00:35:57.419 --> 00:36:00.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
if they're an attendant
or someone close.

00:36:00.189 --> 00:36:01.490 position:7% line:83% align:start
-And you can't ever avoid it?

00:36:01.523 --> 00:36:03.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even if you know
what's gonna happen?

00:36:03.792 --> 00:36:05.127 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.096 position:10% line:83% align:start
No matter what you do, death
cannot be cheated in the end.

00:36:11.632 --> 00:36:13.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although every vision
that she's ever had

00:36:13.701 --> 00:36:16.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
has centered on people who
were honored to die for her

00:36:16.871 --> 00:36:19.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
and did so without question.

00:36:19.308 --> 00:36:22.109 position:24% line:83% align:start
If they had defied
fate and tried to live,

00:36:22.143 --> 00:36:27.148 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm fairly positive Lady
Shion would have died herself.

00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:30.617 position:21% line:83% align:start
But lately, many of
the people in our land

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.321 position:24% line:83% align:start
have begun to fear
her foresight,

00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:36.890 position:24% line:83% align:start
going out of their
way to avoid her.

00:36:36.923 --> 00:36:40.361 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't say if her visions
will always come true.

00:36:40.394 --> 00:36:42.262 position:30% line:83% align:start
Perhaps it all
depends on the people

00:36:42.295 --> 00:36:43.463 position:13% line:83% align:start
who are revealed in them.

00:36:47.133 --> 00:36:47.867 position:38% line:83% align:start
-I see.

00:37:01.347 --> 00:37:03.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
She must be lonely.

00:37:03.615 --> 00:37:06.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess that's why she
acts so spoiled then.

00:37:06.418 --> 00:37:08.354 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Her story is a sad one.

00:37:08.387 --> 00:37:12.191 position:27% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: So what
about you, Taruho?

00:37:12.224 --> 00:37:14.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
What if she said
you were gonna die?

00:37:14.792 --> 00:37:17.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
TARUHO: My clan is deeply
indebted to Lady Shion's

00:37:17.929 --> 00:37:19.365 position:38% line:83% align:start
mother.

00:37:19.398 --> 00:37:23.401 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I could repay that kindness
by safeguarding her life,

00:37:23.434 --> 00:37:26.404 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I would gladly
give up my own.

00:37:26.437 --> 00:37:29.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nothing can change
one's destiny as long

00:37:29.474 --> 00:37:31.175 position:13% line:83% align:start
as the heart remains true.

00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:34.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
[music playing]

00:37:41.451 --> 00:37:42.686 position:24% line:83% align:start
-All right, then.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.245 position:35% line:83% align:start
He's dead.

00:56:21.279 --> 00:56:23.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
-But what happened to him?

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.949 position:27% line:83% align:start
-When we parted
ways with him, he

00:56:25.983 --> 00:56:29.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
said that he'd take a different
route to the shrine in case

00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:32.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
he could be of help
when we arrived there.

SAKURA: But who
could have imagined

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:34.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
this was what he meant?

00:56:49.738 --> 00:56:50.840 position:10% line:83% align:start
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Taruho.

00:57:12.561 --> 00:57:16.798 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I'm all done now, Sakura.

00:57:16.831 --> 00:57:19.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Taruho, what's going on?

00:57:19.501 --> 00:57:22.003 position:19% line:83% align:start
TARUHO: Shadow Mirror
Body Transfer Art,

00:57:22.036 --> 00:57:26.106 position:21% line:83% align:start
a jutsu passed down
in the Land of Ogres,

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:31.945 position:7% line:83% align:start
a kind of transformation with
no means of returning back.

00:57:31.979 --> 00:57:34.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: He was adamant
about taking her place.

00:57:34.781 --> 00:57:37.851 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nothing I said would sway him.

00:57:37.885 --> 00:57:42.256 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Why the hell didn't you force
him to go back home, Neji?

00:57:42.289 --> 00:57:43.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
-For the sake of the mission.

00:57:44.023 --> 00:57:47.693 position:10% line:83% align:start
Look, the fate of the world
is hanging in the balance.

00:57:47.727 --> 00:57:49.596 position:30% line:83% align:start
We have to do
whatever is necessary.

00:57:57.669 --> 00:57:59.505 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Don't worry, Taruho.

00:57:59.539 --> 00:58:03.074 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll make sure you
get a proper burial.

00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:04.109 position:13% line:83% align:start
SHION: Taruho was a fool.

00:58:07.112 --> 00:58:08.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
Death was his choice.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no need to
mourn the idiot.

00:58:11.816 --> 00:58:13.451 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Is that so?

00:58:13.485 --> 00:58:15.987 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, maybe you've forgotten
who he gave his life for!

00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:16.754 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Be quiet!

00:58:16.787 --> 00:58:19.024 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just leave me alone!

00:58:19.057 --> 00:58:19.524 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Wait up!

00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:28.766 position:33% line:83% align:start
I said wait!

00:58:28.799 --> 00:58:31.702 position:30% line:83% align:start
Taruho gave up
everything for your sake.

00:58:31.735 --> 00:58:35.906 position:24% line:83% align:start
He threw his life
away, all for you!

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:39.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you-- you can't even
shed a tear for him, huh?

00:58:39.742 --> 00:58:41.445 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you seriously
that cold-hearted?

00:58:45.248 --> 00:58:49.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you feel anything for him?

00:58:49.352 --> 00:58:54.224 position:7% line:83% align:start
-How can I not be heartbroken
when someone so close to me

00:58:54.257 --> 00:58:54.723 position:38% line:83% align:start
is gone?

00:58:57.527 --> 00:58:58.894 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:58:58.927 --> 00:59:00.663 position:38% line:83% align:start
You're--

00:59:00.697 --> 00:59:03.799 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I can't allow myself to cry.

00:59:03.832 --> 00:59:07.537 position:16% line:83% align:start
It would only desecrate
the memory of the many

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:11.707 position:30% line:83% align:start
who have given
their lives for me.

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:12.674 position:35% line:83% align:start
-But why?

00:59:15.344 --> 00:59:17.079 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Foresight is the
power that ensures

00:59:17.112 --> 00:59:19.248 position:13% line:83% align:start
the life of the priestess.

00:59:19.281 --> 00:59:23.719 position:13% line:83% align:start
When she perceives her own
death, the soul leaves the body

00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:28.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
and shows her past self
the image of their demise

00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:34.228 position:7% line:83% align:start
as well as the people who are
near in that final moment.

00:59:34.262 --> 00:59:36.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
The priestess then
reveals these visions

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.599 position:24% line:83% align:start
to her attendants,
who believe they

00:59:38.633 --> 00:59:43.136 position:19% line:83% align:start
must take her place in
order to prevent her death.

00:59:43.169 --> 00:59:48.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
That is how our foresight
works-- sacrificing others

00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:51.011 position:21% line:83% align:start
so that I may live.

00:59:51.044 --> 00:59:53.280 position:21% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: I'm not sure
I get it, really.

00:59:53.313 --> 00:59:56.149 position:5% line:83% align:start
But these visions are a warning
that the priestess's life

00:59:56.182 --> 00:59:58.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
is in danger?

00:59:58.784 --> 01:00:01.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
-So many times I've
thought to myself,

01:00:01.755 --> 01:00:04.923 position:16% line:83% align:start
I should just leave this
world and be done with it.

01:00:04.957 --> 01:00:06.792 position:33% line:83% align:start
But I can't.

01:00:06.825 --> 01:00:11.030 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I die, there will be no
one left to seal Moryo away

01:00:11.063 --> 01:00:13.465 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the world will be lost.

01:00:13.499 --> 01:00:17.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
No matter how much pain
or sadness I swallow,

01:00:17.336 --> 01:00:19.804 position:27% line:83% align:start
more will die so
that I can live.

01:00:19.837 --> 01:00:21.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
-But that's totally ridiculous.

01:00:22.006 --> 01:00:24.142 position:24% line:83% align:start
How come the Land
of Ogres people are

01:00:24.175 --> 01:00:26.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
the ones who have to sacrifice?

01:00:26.779 --> 01:00:28.980 position:7% line:83% align:start
-That's just how it is for us.

01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:33.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter how unjust, we endure.

01:00:33.084 --> 01:00:39.289 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's my people's fate and mine.

01:00:39.323 --> 01:00:42.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
-And you-- you're OK with that?

01:00:45.262 --> 01:00:48.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
Totally fine with it?

01:00:51.468 --> 01:00:54.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
KUSUNA: We lost Gitai, but
the Land of Ogres priestess

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:58.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
has been eliminated,
rest assured, Lord.

01:00:59.008 --> 01:01:01.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
YOMI: Wretched fool.

01:01:01.944 --> 01:01:05.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
Moryo's soul still
senses her presence.

01:01:05.715 --> 01:01:10.419 position:16% line:83% align:start
The priestess you three
disposed of was a mere impostor.

01:01:10.453 --> 01:01:15.291 position:13% line:83% align:start
The girl with the sealing
powers still lives.

01:01:15.324 --> 01:01:16.257 position:44% line:83% align:start
Go.

01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:18.226 position:21% line:83% align:start
And this time, make
sure it's done.

01:01:18.259 --> 01:01:19.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSUNA, SETSUNA, AND
SHUZUKU: Yes, Lord.

I will stay here and wait

01:01:38.312 --> 01:01:39.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
for the enemy.

01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:41.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want you to take
Lady Shion and keep

01:01:41.716 --> 01:01:43.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
heading for the sealing shrine.

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:45.786 position:27% line:83% align:start
-But-- you sure?

01:01:45.819 --> 01:01:48.021 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Neji, she saw Naruto's death.

01:01:48.055 --> 01:01:49.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is it safe for him?

01:01:49.757 --> 01:01:51.492 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Maybe one of us
should go instead.

01:01:51.525 --> 01:01:52.626 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

01:01:52.659 --> 01:01:55.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
That is precisely the
reason why he should go.

01:01:58.766 --> 01:01:59.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
-All right, then.

01:01:59.499 --> 01:02:00.701 position:33% line:83% align:start
You got it.

01:02:00.734 --> 01:02:03.403 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Set your sights on the
goal and do not look back.

01:02:03.436 --> 01:02:05.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
-The sealing shrine is close-by.

01:02:05.238 --> 01:02:06.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Now hurry, Naruto.

01:02:06.905 --> 01:02:07.840 position:44% line:83% align:start
-OK.

01:02:07.874 --> 01:02:08.841 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's go, Shion.

01:02:16.682 --> 01:02:17.149 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Byakugan!

NEJI (VOICEOVER): What
Lee saw during his battle

01:02:22.855 --> 01:02:24.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
must be the key.

01:02:24.556 --> 01:02:27.626 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Yes, then he drank
something and his chakra

01:02:27.659 --> 01:02:30.060 position:21% line:83% align:start
suddenly magnified.

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:32.531 position:13% line:83% align:start
-If they're using a jutsu
to replenish their chakra

01:02:32.564 --> 01:02:36.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
externally, they might be
able to absorb different types

01:02:36.902 --> 01:02:39.203 position:16% line:83% align:start
for short burst of time.

01:02:39.236 --> 01:02:43.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
But forcing entirely foreign
chakra into one's body

01:02:43.307 --> 01:02:46.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
comes at a great risk.

SHIZUNE: Could they
have retreated somehow?

01:02:53.383 --> 01:02:57.086 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe we're safe
from destruction.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.656 position:10% line:83% align:start
-No, it's just the opposite.

They'll have to replenish

01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:38.593 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's no use.

01:03:38.626 --> 01:03:41.395 position:24% line:83% align:start

it's up to you now.

01:05:37.138 --> 01:05:39.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Well, here we are, Lady Shion.

01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:41.076 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the entrance over there.

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:42.877 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Have you been
here before, then?

01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:46.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Nah, I just had a
premonition, that's all.

01:05:46.948 --> 01:05:49.985 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now come on, get in there
and seal this Moryo guy away

01:05:50.018 --> 01:05:52.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
so you can carve out
your own destiny.

01:05:55.155 --> 01:05:56.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You can't change your fate.

01:05:56.757 --> 01:05:58.157 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Ah, don't kid yourself.

01:05:58.191 --> 01:05:59.860 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let me show you how it's done.

01:06:10.603 --> 01:06:11.304 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's happening?

01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:17.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
SHION: The Terracotta soldiers.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:19.277 position:7% line:83% align:start
-What's a terrycloth soldier?

01:06:19.311 --> 01:06:21.914 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Terracotta.

01:06:21.948 --> 01:06:24.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
These things are on
the march right now.

01:06:24.117 --> 01:06:26.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
It means that Moryo is
already somewhere nearby.

01:06:28.754 --> 01:06:30.355 position:30% line:83% align:start
What do we do?

01:06:30.389 --> 01:06:31.590 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Charge straight through 'em!

01:06:31.623 --> 01:06:36.962 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tuck your legs in
and hold on tight!

01:06:36.995 --> 01:06:37.462 position:35% line:83% align:start
Maybe not.

[bell ringing]

01:06:58.115 --> 01:06:59.684 position:19% line:83% align:start
Will I be saved again?

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:14.097 position:16% line:83% align:start
But maybe if I die here,
Naruto and my people,

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
they won't have to
give their lives.

01:07:48.796 --> 01:07:51.132 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Oh, man.

01:07:51.165 --> 01:07:53.134 position:7% line:83% align:start
I had to back-flop, didn't I?

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:56.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
SHION: You shouldn't
have saved me.

01:07:56.537 --> 01:08:02.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you'd just let me go,
you wouldn't have to die.

01:08:02.043 --> 01:08:04.711 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, at least not
until Moryo gets around

01:08:04.745 --> 01:08:05.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
to destroying the world.

01:08:08.315 --> 01:08:08.782 position:38% line:83% align:start

[bells ringing]

01:08:21.627 --> 01:08:26.799 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I tell you
what-- I'm not dying.

01:08:29.668 --> 01:08:30.936 position:33% line:83% align:start
Count on it.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:32.238 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's useless.

01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:33.706 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's not useless!

01:08:33.739 --> 01:08:36.008 position:19% line:83% align:start
-That just means I'll
be the one to go.

01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:37.777 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I won't let you die, either!

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:39.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
-One of us will be dead!

01:08:39.178 --> 01:08:40.779 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's just a question of who.

01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:42.014 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Don't give me that!

01:08:42.047 --> 01:08:43.314 position:7% line:83% align:start
The future isn't written yet.

01:08:43.348 --> 01:08:44.616 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can still change it.

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:46.351 position:16% line:83% align:start
-For the hundredth time.

01:08:46.384 --> 01:08:47.219 position:33% line:83% align:start
You can't--

01:08:47.253 --> 01:08:49.387 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I'll protect you.

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.287 position:30% line:83% align:start
-How, though?

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.590 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's impossible.

01:08:52.624 --> 01:08:53.290 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Trust me.

01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.295 position:19% line:83% align:start

can't I look at him?

01:08:58.328 --> 01:08:59.763 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Trust you?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.767 position:27% line:83% align:start

01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:07.704 position:7% line:83% align:start
And it'll work this time, too.

NARUTO: Hmm?

01:09:31.727 --> 01:09:34.263 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Do you swear?

01:09:34.297 --> 01:09:35.765 position:24% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Of course.

01:09:35.798 --> 01:09:38.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
I swear on my ninja way.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.367 position:35% line:83% align:start
I promise.

Why didn't you just
blow them all away?

-Are you kidding?

Do you have any idea
how exhausting this is?

01:10:41.493 --> 01:10:42.461 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right.

01:10:42.494 --> 01:10:43.128 position:33% line:83% align:start

-What are you doing?

01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:02.113 position:44% line:83% align:start
Go!

01:11:02.146 --> 01:11:07.084 position:7% line:83% align:start

real you more distinguishable!

NARUTO: What, are
you kidding me?

Do I look like I
have time for that?

You look like Miroku.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:31.465 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come now, let us make the
young priestess feel welcome.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:43.309 position:27% line:83% align:start
My name is Yomi.

01:12:43.342 --> 01:12:47.046 position:30% line:83% align:start
Long ago, your
mother, Miroku, stood

01:12:47.079 --> 01:12:50.316 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the path of my ambition.

01:12:50.349 --> 01:12:54.185 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wonder, do you
remember that day ?

01:12:54.219 --> 01:12:58.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
We had resurrected Moryo,
assuring his return.

01:12:58.556 --> 01:13:02.093 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the Thousand Year
Kingdom was within our grasp.

01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:08.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
If only your mother had
not been there to ruin it.

01:13:16.206 --> 01:13:17.174 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Get back.

01:13:17.207 --> 01:13:18.675 position:35% line:83% align:start
Stay away!

01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:19.176 position:44% line:83% align:start
No!

01:13:26.783 --> 01:13:30.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
YOMI: Such shock upon your face.

01:13:30.487 --> 01:13:35.658 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is it possible you're unaware
of the power you possess?

01:13:35.691 --> 01:13:37.894 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is certainly surprising.

01:13:37.927 --> 01:13:43.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
As old as you are, have
you really learned nothing?

01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:46.469 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Every day I've prepared
for this moment.

01:13:46.502 --> 01:13:47.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've mastered--

01:13:47.569 --> 01:13:49.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
-The sealing jutsu.

01:13:49.704 --> 01:13:50.540 position:30% line:83% align:start
Have you now?

01:13:53.909 --> 01:14:01.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then by all means, hurry
over here and seal me away--

01:14:02.017 --> 01:14:03.452 position:33% line:83% align:start
if you can.

01:14:03.485 --> 01:14:04.985 position:21% line:83% align:start
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I'll protect you!

01:14:12.827 --> 01:14:15.196 position:10% line:83% align:start
SHION (VOICEOVER): You meant
it, didn't you, Naruto?

01:14:18.766 --> 01:14:19.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Damn it.

01:14:19.632 --> 01:14:21.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no end to these things.

01:14:31.044 --> 01:14:33.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
-There's something
you should now.

01:14:33.547 --> 01:14:37.383 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's actually impossible
for me to kill you.

01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:40.853 position:19% line:83% align:start
And by the same token,
you haven't the power

01:14:40.887 --> 01:14:43.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
to eliminate me.

01:14:43.256 --> 01:14:48.328 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because originally, you and I
were one and the same entity.

01:14:48.361 --> 01:14:49.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I don't believe you.

01:14:49.795 --> 01:14:52.164 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're just trying to
trick me with you lies!

01:14:52.197 --> 01:14:57.035 position:7% line:83% align:start
-What reason do I have to lie?

01:14:57.069 --> 01:14:58.703 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'm going to do it now.

01:14:58.736 --> 01:15:05.277 position:13% line:83% align:start
-The truth is, the seal's
sole purpose is to join you

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:07.645 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I as one.

01:15:07.678 --> 01:15:13.885 position:24% line:83% align:start
Miroku, your dear
mother, accepted that.

01:15:13.918 --> 01:15:14.785 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yes.

01:15:14.819 --> 01:15:16.753 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's right.

01:15:16.787 --> 01:15:20.324 position:7% line:83% align:start
Your mother exists within me.

01:15:23.093 --> 01:15:26.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
To prevent ourself from
abusing such enormous power,

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:32.569 position:10% line:83% align:start
we split into two entities,
to hearts, two beliefs.

01:15:32.602 --> 01:15:36.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
And thus we have
lived, forever at odds,

01:15:36.173 --> 01:15:39.242 position:16% line:83% align:start
staring each other down.

01:15:39.276 --> 01:15:44.847 position:10% line:83% align:start
Although somewhere down the
line one became the evil Moryo

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.050 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the other the
good priestess,

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:55.357 position:10% line:83% align:start
we cannot be bound by words
like light, dark, good, evil.

01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:14.676 position:35% line:83% align:start
A barrier.

-It's not useless!

01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:17.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll protect you, I
swear on my ninja way.

01:26:17.746 --> 01:26:18.447 position:35% line:83% align:start
I promise.

a terrible liar, Naruto.

01:26:36.731 --> 01:26:38.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
Snap out of it!

[music playing]

01:26:42.703 --> 01:26:45.873 position:10% line:83% align:start
Open your eyes and breathe!

Can you see?

01:26:46.874 --> 01:26:48.308 position:30% line:83% align:start
Can you hear?

01:26:48.341 --> 01:26:50.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is your heart telling you?

01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:54.648 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you wanna die
like this or what?

01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:58.552 position:13% line:83% align:start
You wanna just fade away?

01:26:58.585 --> 01:26:59.319 position:44% line:83% align:start
-I--

01:26:59.352 --> 01:27:00.887 position:13% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: I can't hear you!

01:27:00.921 --> 01:27:02.322 position:30% line:83% align:start
Say it, Shion!

01:27:02.355 --> 01:27:03.790 position:13% line:83% align:start
Say it in your own words!

01:27:03.824 --> 01:27:04.791 position:38% line:83% align:start
Come on!

01:27:04.825 --> 01:27:07.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let me hear it!

01:27:07.294 --> 01:27:10.697 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I want to live!

01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:12.199 position:24% line:83% align:start

Keep it coming.

More!

01:27:45.129 --> 01:27:46.598 position:13% line:83% align:start
Everything you're feeling?

01:27:46.631 --> 01:27:47.899 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just let it out!

Here!

I promised you, didn't I?

01:28:11.221 --> 01:28:13.290 position:21% line:83% align:start
I said that we would
change your destiny,

01:28:13.323 --> 01:28:15.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
and that's just
what we're gonna do!

-I'm with you, Mother.

01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:48.089 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmm?

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:49.357 position:30% line:83% align:start
What was that?

[music playing]

01:33:25.785 --> 01:33:29.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Well, it could have played out
a lot worse than this, I guess.

01:33:29.422 --> 01:33:31.958 position:16% line:83% align:start
-They ended up creating
a new volcano, huh?

01:33:31.991 --> 01:33:33.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
-That knucklehead.

01:33:33.593 --> 01:33:35.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's what you get
for leaving it to him.

01:33:40.333 --> 01:33:42.535 position:24% line:83% align:start
SHION: Naruto, you
can put me down.

01:33:46.138 --> 01:33:50.142 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Well, guess this means your
priestess days are over, huh?

01:33:50.175 --> 01:33:51.310 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

01:33:51.343 --> 01:33:54.379 position:24% line:83% align:start
There will always
be a need for one.

01:33:54.413 --> 01:33:57.049 position:7% line:83% align:start
I realized something in there.

01:33:57.082 --> 01:33:59.551 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's the evil that
lives in men's hearts

01:33:59.585 --> 01:34:01.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
that gave rise to Moryo.

01:34:01.752 --> 01:34:04.422 position:16% line:83% align:start
So who's to say that he
won't return to this world

01:34:04.456 --> 01:34:06.090 position:27% line:83% align:start
again and again?

01:34:06.123 --> 01:34:08.392 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I realized I
must be especially

01:34:08.426 --> 01:34:09.860 position:10% line:83% align:start
careful of a certain genin.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:11.629 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

01:34:11.662 --> 01:34:13.197 position:7% line:83% align:start
-But you don't have to worry.

01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:15.566 position:7% line:83% align:start
I won't curse my fate anymore.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.268 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm a priestess.

01:34:17.301 --> 01:34:19.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that's my mission.

01:34:19.736 --> 01:34:20.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
Isn't that right, Naruto?

01:34:25.141 --> 01:34:27.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then of course,
there's my power.

01:34:27.043 --> 01:34:30.981 position:13% line:83% align:start
It has to be passed on to
the next priestess, too.

01:34:31.014 --> 01:34:32.349 position:19% line:83% align:start
How 'bout it, Naruto?

01:34:32.382 --> 01:34:33.583 position:7% line:83% align:start
You want to help me with that?

01:34:36.752 --> 01:34:37.354 position:35% line:83% align:start
-You bet!

01:34:37.387 --> 01:34:38.153 position:33% line:83% align:start
You know me.

01:34:38.187 --> 01:34:40.823 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm always up for anything!
