1
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,000
Once upon a time,
there was a farmer.

2
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:00,500
The good farmer had been given
a keepsake by his grandmother.

3
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,750
But now, he could
not find it anywhere.

4
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,291
It was an old comb,
nothing more.

5
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,416
And he would leave
it lying around,

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,208
never paying
much attention to it.

7
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,208
But still, this comb was an

8
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,958
important memento
from his grandmother.

9
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,041
The farmer desperately
wanted to find the comb again.

10
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,541
Every day he would pray and

11
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,666
make offerings
to the god, Inari.

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,833
But the poor farmer could
not afford to offer money.

13
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:31,000
So, he would bring eggs
as an offering instead.

14
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,250
And then...

15
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,500
...on a clear, blue night...

16
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,750
It was the fox.

17
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,291
It brought the comb back to him.

18
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,166
And that's how it happened.

19
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,625
Once this news spread,

20
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,541
any villager who'd
lost something,

21
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,166
would bring eggs to
the shrine and pray.

22
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,083
Hoping for their
item to be returned.

23
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,166
But...

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,041
...in reality...

25
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,208
Get 'em all...
Get 'em all...

26
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,000
What you neglect, we collect.

27
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,750
Get 'em all...
Get 'em all...

28
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,666
What you neglect, we collect.

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,958
Get 'em all...
Get 'em all...

30
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,416
What you neglect, we collect.

31
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,500
People believed that the

32
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,458
foxes were loyal
servants of Lord Inari.

33
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,375
But when no one was looking,

34
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:33,250
they would take the things
people simply neglected.

35
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,541
Does that mean...
that foxes are thieves?

36
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,041
No, they're not thieves.

37
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,750
Sometimes people stop
caring for their things.

38
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,291
And that's when the foxes take
them to teach them a lesson.

39
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,416
They'll never hafta
do that to me.

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,208
That's cuz...

41
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,166
I take care of my things!

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,583
Then you're a good girl.

43
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,000
Ah, you don't
believe me, Mommy?!

44
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,500
I believe you.

45
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,375
It's really true!

46
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,041
Uh, okay.

47
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,250
I know what.

48
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,708
I show you how true it is.

49
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,208
Haruka...

50
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,791
...careful.

51
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,833
Lemme see...

52
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,416
Found it!

53
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,125
Ta-dah!

54
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,166
See!

55
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,833
It's the pretty
mirror you gave me.

56
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,625
And I always keep this with me!

57
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,625
You're right.

58
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,000
So Mommy...

59
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,583
I wanna know when you
can come back home again.

60
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,291
Hm.
I don't know.

61
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,250
Hey!

62
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,333
Why don't we ask Mr. Fox?!

63
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,833
Lord Inari...

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Can I please...

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,666
...have my Mommy back?

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Those guys are the worst.

67
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:36,750
Ew...

68
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,791
it's hot in here.

69
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,875
Hello.

70
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,500
Don't worry about it.
No one's here.

71
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,791
Come in.

72
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm tired of asking him
to clean up after himself.

73
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,250
He's a mess.

74
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,166
I wish I had your place, Miho.

75
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,500
Everyone's house is the same.

76
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm thirsty.

77
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,166
Hey, you want somethin'?

78
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,791
Yeah sure, that'd be great.

79
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,083
Tsch.
How's that new.

80
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,958
Wha...?

81
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,583
What again...?

82
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:30,625
What?

83
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,416
Oh, hi.

84
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,208
Haru?

85
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,041
You drank it.

86
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,083
Huh?

87
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,541
You drank my
ginger ale, didn't you?

88
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,708
Ohh.
Yeah, maybe.

89
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,000
What?!!!
Maybe you did?

90
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,750
Don't touch my stuff!

91
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,208
I bought that, y'know?

92
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,458
Pay me back!

93
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,375
Okay, I'm sorry.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,708
I can't believe you!

95
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,083
Listen.
Good news.

96
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,958
Looks like I won't
have to work tonight.

97
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,166
Any food there for dinner?

98
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,500
How would I know!

99
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,541
It's not like I'm your maid!

100
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,208
Uh.

101
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,250
Miho...

102
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,541
You ever have something
you really treasured as a kid...

103
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,916
...and now when you look for it,
it seems to have vanished?

104
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,291
What're you talking about?

105
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,833
Ta-dah!

106
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,875
See!

107
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,333
It's the pretty
mirror you gave me.

108
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,208
And I always keep this with me!

109
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,875
My mother gave me this old
hand-mirror when I was little.

110
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,791
And I didn't go
anywhere without it.

111
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,000
I totally treasured
that thing...

112
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,708
...and yet somehow,
I still lost it.

113
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

114
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,500
I got this doll set for
Christmas once, and I loved it.

115
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,458
But I've no idea
where it is now.

116
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,083
Where's that stuff go, I wonder.

117
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,666
It's gotta go somewhere.

118
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,750
I mean even the important stuff.

119
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,708
Maybe memories go there too.

120
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,250
Huh?

121
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,125
Okay!

122
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,583
I'm gonna go to my Grandma's.

123
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,291
What? Didn't your dad say
he was coming home early?

124
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,333
Time for a change of scenery.

125
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,416
Going out again?

126
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,208
There it is.

127
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,958
Lord Inari...

128
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,166
I know my mother is gone.

129
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,166
But if you could find that
hand mirror she gave me...

130
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,416
...and somehow bring it back...

131
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,833
Ready?

132
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,083
Here we go!!

133
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,375
Fly!!!

134
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,750
Wow, look at it!

135
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,000
It's really flying!!!

136
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,625
It was totally worth
the extra money.

137
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,500
Yeah, adding the rubber
band is amazing!

138
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,208
It's what makes it all work.

139
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,125
Look at it go!

140
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,625
Dad, again?

141
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,458
What?

142
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,750
Hey Haru.

143
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,083
It looks like I've gotta
work late after all.

144
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,708
So if you get hungry just...

145
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,708
Yeah, I'm really sorry, but...

146
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,666
I'm actually not home today.

147
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,583
Huh?

148
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,375
I said I'm not home.
Goodbye.

149
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,291
Where are you?

150
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,458
I don't wanna go back home...

151
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,041
Gotcha.

152
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,083
Was that...?

153
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,833
That can't be the wind.

154
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,125
What is that?

155
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,625
Huh?

156
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,416
Wait.

157
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,458
Where could he have gone?

158
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,750
Huh?

159
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,416
Why is this water warm?

160
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,291
I've...
...touched...

161
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,375
...a Human...

162
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,000
Y-You talk...

163
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,458
Huh?

164
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,083
Uh, that hurt...

165
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,583
What?

166
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,708
Oh no.

167
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,041
Oh no, no, no.

168
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,041
What're you doing?

169
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,125
Hey, wait, what're you...?!

170
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,125
I just got back from
getting more of the forgotten.

171
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,791
Well go on, deliver it.

172
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,125
Okay.

173
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,000
Excuse me.

174
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,625
Hi there.

175
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:29,375
Just 3 cans, 4 bottles and
5 lousy planks today.

176
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,708
Please go back to
the people place.

177
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,750
Just hold on a sec.

178
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,583
Gimme a minute!

179
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,708
I wanna ask you somethin' first.

180
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,458
All this stuff here...

181
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,708
it's things...

182
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,916
...that you guys have
stole from us, isn't it?

183
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,916
No!
We don't steal it!

184
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah?
Really?

185
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,958
...what about that?

186
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,791
It's all forgotten stuff.

187
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,875
Things you guys just neglected.

188
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,041
Huh?

189
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,416
Neglected...?

190
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,041
Get 'em all.
Get 'em all!

191
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,041
What you neglect, we collect!

192
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,000
So...

193
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,291
...if all this stuff was
just left lying around...

194
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,541
...then my mirror...

195
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,750
C'mon...

196
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,000
...what are you doing?

197
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,208
You've gotta go!

198
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,458
Please, just leave!

199
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,125
Stop pulling!

200
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,125
Hey...

201
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,625
...maybe you've seen it.

202
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,666
It's a hand-mirror
about this big?

203
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,041
Hand-Mir-ror?

204
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,208
Understand?

205
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,500
It was mine.

206
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,750
How would I know?

207
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,666
Would you look for it with me?

208
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,375
Why would I do that?

209
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,583
Give that back!

210
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,458
This is mine you know.

211
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,000
But if you help
me find that mirror...

212
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,750
...then I'll give these
to you to keep.

213
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,041
So what would happen
if someone found out,

214
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,666
that a human was here?

215
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,125
I don't know what
the punishment would be.

216
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,458
But whatever it is...

217
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,666
I'm sure it's terrifying.

218
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,625
They'd probably confiscate
all my stamp cards.

219
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,458
Just when I've
finished 3 whole cards

220
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,708
and I'm nearly done
with my fourth...

221
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,458
Um, I was asking what
would happen to me?

222
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,250
I dunno.

223
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,750
Hey...
So, what's up there'?

224
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,958
Where do you think?
It's the Island.

225
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,708
The Island?

226
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:09,833
Whoa.

227
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,750
We're moving!

228
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:34,083
Y'see, we can't make
stuff like you Humans can.

229
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,833
So instead, we pick up whatever

230
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,541
Humans just leave lying
around and use that.

231
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,875
And fortunately for us,

232
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,375
Humans forget about
their things pretty quickly.

233
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,333
No wonder stuff
is always getting lost.

234
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,083
But we don't steal anything.

235
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,166
We only go after
things that are left behind.

236
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,416
If we were to
steal from the humans,

237
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,958
then they would come
here and attack us.

238
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,916
Like you did.

239
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,416
Humans are scary.

240
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,250
Hey wake up!

241
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:14,583
Ow!

242
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,833
Listen...

243
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,875
...you and me never had
a proper introduction.

244
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,250
Proper introduction?

245
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,750
I'm Haruka.
I'm sixteen and a freshman.

246
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,458
Nice to meet ya'.

247
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,541
Teo...

248
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,875
Very-nice-to-meet-you!

249
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,916
Lemme go!

250
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,875
Wow...

251
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,833
it's amazing.

252
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,916
This was all made
from neglected stuff?

253
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,166
Hey.

254
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,250
You look ridiculous
in that mask here.

255
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:14,666
Well?

256
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,375
How's this?!

257
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:18,958
C'mon... let's go.

258
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,375
Sure.

259
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,750
'Scuse me.

260
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,166
I'm looking for a hand
mirror about this big.

261
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,708
Have you seen it?

262
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,250
No.

263
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,458
Nothing like that here.

264
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,458
A mirror?

265
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,208
Exactly.

266
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,125
Hmm...

267
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,458
What's it look like?

268
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,416
How do I describe it...

269
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,416
Well...

270
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,583
...um...

271
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,583
Oh...
may I borrow this?

272
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,791
Sure.

273
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:08,500
It's shaped like this...

274
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,791
...and then on the back...

275
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:17,916
Just like this.

276
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,625
Have you ever seen it?

277
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,916
Hmmmm.

278
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
Nope, never.

279
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,791
For pricey stuff like that...

280
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,958
you're better off goin'
to Mabarowa's store.

281
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:26,750
Ma...

282
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,750
Maba...

283
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,791
Mabarowa?

284
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:29,666
What?

285
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,166
You don't know who Mabarowa is?

286
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,750
Y-Yeah.
Course I do.

287
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,541
Right, Teo?]

288
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,541
Teo?

289
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,875
What's goin' on Teo?

290
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,291
What're you doin' here?

291
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,208
Skippin' out on work again?

292
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,041
You slacker.

293
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,041
The only stuff you
bring back are things

294
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,583
we got no use for.

295
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,333
I'm kicking your butt!

296
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,250
Shut up! You'll pay for that!

297
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:52,875
Watch out.

298
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,458
Teo's getting angry!

299
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:55,708
Oh no.

300
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,375
Put me down.

301
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,916
Leave me alone.

302
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,375
Now get your hands off him!

303
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,750
Huh?

304
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,833
And just who the hell are you?

305
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,250
Acting all high and mighty.

306
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,791
You got some nerve!

307
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,708
You really want
to fight with us?

308
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,250
Wait a sec...

309
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,750
Don't tell me...

310
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,291
Tell you what?

311
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,375
You're Teo's girlfriend!

312
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,166
Excuse me?

313
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,166
A girlfriend?!!

314
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,208
S-She's not!

315
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,708
Okay!

316
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:32,625
Los the freaky mask
and show us your face.

317
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:33,791
What?

318
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,125
No.

319
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:37,875
What makes you think I
have to show you my face?

320
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,041
Teo, we're leaving!

321
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,041
Hold up!
Slow down you.

322
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,291
No way!
Now paws off.

323
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,375
Hey!
Don't pull me!

324
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,583
Come on... let's go

325
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,958
Sure...

326
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,083
What was that...?ii

327
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,833
There's something
fishy going on there?

328
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,208
Whatchya mean boss?

329
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:02,375
Is Tail fishy?

330
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:05,916
I mean the other one.

331
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,083
Hey... are those the only
friends you got around here?

332
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,625
Those guys aren't my friends.

333
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,916
Do you have friends?

334
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,375
Leave me alone.

335
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,291
Oh... ok.

336
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,833
What?

337
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,750
Wow!

338
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,791
Who is <i>that</i> ?

339
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,333
Oh.

340
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,500
That's the Baron.

341
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,916
Always lording over
us from his castle.

342
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,166
Wowi

343
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,500
He's got some bad taste.

344
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,125
Yeah.

345
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,291
Welcome.

346
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,583
May I help you
youngsters with something?

347
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,083
What do you two want?

348
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,125
I'm busy here.

349
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,583
Spit it out already?

350
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,291
Well...

351
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,083
I'm trying to find
an old hand mirror.

352
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,500
A hand mirror?

353
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,666
Tsk.

354
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,875
Someone your age
can't afford such a thing.

355
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,666
That would cost you over
a thousand stamp cards.

356
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,541
Now go home and leave me alone.

357
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,625
But...
that mirror is mine.

358
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,166
I remember it perfectly.

359
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,083
Huh?

360
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,125
It looks like this.

361
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,208
This is...

362
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,583
I recall this mirror...

363
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,583
...it's the Barron's.

364
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:13,166
I've seen it once myself.

365
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,541
It is indeed a truly
exceptional mirror.

366
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:21,458
This mirror has been
imbued with divine powers!

367
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,500
Uh, actually, it's just
a normal hand mirror.

368
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,416
A god resides
within that mirror.

369
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,791
It is of rare and
exceptional beauty.

370
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,458
With tremendous magical powers.

371
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,041
It was one of the Baron's mosti

372
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,833
prize possessions and he
took excellent care of it.

373
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:39,708
But then...

374
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,458
...somebody stole it from him!

375
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,875
And now?

376
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,458
And now...

377
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,916
I'm afraid its whereabouts...

378
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,958
...remain a mystery.

379
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,625
But...

380
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,791
it's not like it's some
super valuable mirror.

381
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:57,166
It's just mine,
and I really want it back.

382
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah but he doesn't have it.

383
00:30:59,083 --> 00:30:59,875
Come on.

384
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,291
Thank you for all your help sir.

385
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,750
Hold it.

386
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,041
That's an unusual mask you have.

387
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:06,875
So...

388
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,416
...will you give it to me?

389
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,041
I'll give you another
hand mirror in exchange.

390
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,291
No.

391
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,833
I don't want another mirror.

392
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,666
Come on.

393
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,750
No, you can't--

394
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:16,541
She can't!

395
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,583
Because...

396
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,916
I gave this mask
to her as a present.

397
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,791
Okay, just go.

398
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:21,916
Hurry.

399
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,541
Thank you so much
for your time, sir!

400
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,750
This is Mabarowa...

401
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,000
Baron, sir.

402
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,041
We have an issue.

403
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,875
I'm afraid we have
a human in our midst.

404
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:44,291
And she appears to
be looking for the mirror.

405
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,125
So...

406
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,500
...time to give up and go home.

407
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,875
Thanks, I'm starving.

408
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,125
Huh?!

409
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,208
What is this?

410
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,458
It was caught fresh just now.

411
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,125
I can't take it!

412
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,958
She took off the mask!

413
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:26,875
I see her.
I see her.

414
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,541
I see her. I see her.

415
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:29,250
Human?

416
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,250
Human.

417
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,666
You sure?

418
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,041
Just as I suspected.

419
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,125
An interesting turn
of events, huh?

420
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,916
What we do, boss?

421
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,583
Teo messed up big.

422
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,458
We'll make sure
he pays for this!

423
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,416
I can't believe this.

424
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,666
Those guys again?

425
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,583
Ah, man...

426
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,041
We're just here to have a
little chat with your friend.

427
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,333
Now go on and
take that mask off.

428
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,416
Why?

429
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,125
Off.

430
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:16,916
No .

431
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,708
Take it off!

432
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:18,375
No way!!

433
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,333
Vikki...
...get it.

434
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,333
Decargot, you do it.

435
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,166
Okay!

436
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,083
Grab her!
Get Teo, too.

437
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,250
Get them!!!

438
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,416
Moron, they're over there!

439
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:20,875
Go fetch that
thing from the factory.

440
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,583
I'm gonna get you, Teo.

441
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,625
I swear it!

442
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,458
Wow.

443
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,583
An amusement park.

444
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,083
Hey...

445
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,916
Hmm...

446
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,875
Hey.
H-Hold on.

447
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,750
Will you...

448
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,708
Wow...

449
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:49,958
What is this place?

450
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,333
It's "Oblivion Theater."

451
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,375
It's where they project the

452
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:54,750
memories of the
neglected things.

453
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:03,458
Huh.

454
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,250
That was my...

455
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,791
Cotton?

456
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,500
Cotton?

457
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,875
It's me.

458
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,000
Do you remember?

459
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,166
It's Haruka.

460
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,333
What is she doing?

461
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,208
Aagghh...

462
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,333
That girl is ruining my show!

463
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:20,625
Wait a sec.

464
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,208
I think it's a human.

465
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,208
A Human?

466
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,708
I don't know
how she got in here.

467
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,541
But she's clearly
the owner of that toy!

468
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,208
Now this is good drama.

469
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,666
It's a tearful reunion.

470
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,500
Lovely.

471
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,416
Cue the music!

472
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,041
Haruka...?

473
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,458
It's me, your owner...

474
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,416
Haruka.

475
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,250
Don't you remember?

476
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:44,958
Haruka...

477
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,833
But what about my show?!

478
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,291
That's right...

479
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,833
Haruka...

480
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,791
I remember a girl
named Haruka...

481
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,416
She threw me away.

482
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,041
My Haruka abandoned me.

483
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,666
Cotton?

484
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:10,958
But I...

485
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,958
I hate Haruka.

486
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,291
I'm so sorry.

487
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,416
I really am.

488
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,250
Please forgive me.

489
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,250
I shouldn't have neglected
you all this time.

490
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,791
I'm sorry.

491
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,041
I don't believe you.

492
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:47,500
Huh?

493
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,708
There's nowhere
to run now, Teo!!

494
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,458
You'll get a spanking!

495
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,666
Ain't no escapin' this thing!!!

496
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,875
Here we go!!!

497
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,875
Get back! Go! Go on!

498
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:24,291
Hey you can't just
run away from this!

499
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,666
Haru! Run!

500
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,500
Heeeyyy!!!

501
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,166
And what about my performance?

502
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,916
That ending was perfect.
Brilliant!!!

503
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,000
Sorry!

504
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,583
This way!

505
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:53,791
Get ready, Teo.

506
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:57,125
'Cuz you're in for
some serious trouble now!

507
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,750
This way!

508
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,541
We got 'em now.

509
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:14,958
There's no way!

510
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:19,041
My legs can't go any faster!!!

511
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,416
How 'bout you, Cotton.

512
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,541
You okay.

513
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,041
That hurt.

514
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,291
I'm sorry.

515
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,041
I'm so sorry.

516
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,791
Please forgive me.

517
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,000
I'll never leave you again.

518
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,500
I promise.

519
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,958
That's the truth!

520
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,875
To be honest...

521
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:15,208
I really missed you...

522
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,041
Haruka.

523
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,916
Cotton...

524
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,750
Wow...

525
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:06,291
So you live in this?

526
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,333
It's not that bad.

527
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,166
All better.

528
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,916
Thank you.

529
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,416
So what's up with this place?

530
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,958
Why're there
airplanes everywhere?

531
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:27,875
Because one day...

532
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,416
I wanna build a real airplane.

533
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,250
Imagine...

534
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,583
...soaring through the sky
like birds and humans.

535
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:40,125
Nobody here has
actually flown a real plane.

536
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,750
There's just the
Baron with his airship.

537
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,916
Yeah... but even
with a propellor,

538
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,666
it won't fly without an engine

539
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,958
Huh?

540
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:50,166
En...
...gine?

541
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,333
You're really
clueless, aren't ya'?

542
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:55,791
Look at this one.

543
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,708
It's got a rubber
band connected.

544
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:00,583
And that's what
makes the propeller spin.

545
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,375
Rubber?

546
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:05,000
So the rubber band
is the engine!

547
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,000
Well...

548
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,375
...sort of...

549
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,708
But...

550
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:11,916
...how come Cotton
can move and talk?

551
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,291
Magic?

552
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,000
Someone must've sewn a
piece of a mirror into him.

553
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,958
Mirror?

554
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:21,125
Mirrors have some
kind of a divine power.

555
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,458
With just a
little shard,

556
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:25,583
you can breathe life into
anything, even dolls.

557
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,250
Mirrors...

558
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,208
Hey, Cotton.

559
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,250
Do you remember
everything that

560
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,666
happened up up til now?

561
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,250
Of course.

562
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,166
So... then maybe
you remember that

563
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,208
hand mirror Mom gave me, too?

564
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,708
I remember.

565
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:47,125
Both me and the mirror were
picked up at the same time.

566
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,833
It was the Baron.

567
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,208
Oh...
That guy in the airship?

568
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,375
We were with him for a while.

569
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,166
And then one night,
some thieves came

570
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,541
and stole us from
the Baron's castle.

571
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:01,166
Both you and the mirror?

572
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,291
When they stole us,

573
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,166
they took us somewhere
underground...

574
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,250
To the thieves'
secret scary palace.

575
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:14,833
So... I did my best to run away.

576
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,750
It's the Petit Loss.

577
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,125
The Petit Loss?

578
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:28,250
They're bandits that
live underground here.

579
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:35,958
Look.

580
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,083
That's the entrance
to their hideout.

581
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:40,916
All the Petit
Loss live there.

582
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,916
They're so scary,
no one goes near 'em.

583
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,625
So then...

584
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,166
...that's where
my mom's mirror is...

585
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,583
Huh?

586
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:52,750
No way.

587
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:54,000
Don't even think about it.

588
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:54,916
Please?

589
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,791
Forget it!

590
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,666
I'm begging you!

591
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,166
That's just way too scary.

592
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:03,916
Hey.

593
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,166
Stand up.

594
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,208
That thing.

595
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:07,916
It's not a chair.

596
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:16,750
See this guy...
goes here.

597
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,208
And then this...

598
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,291
My Grandma had one of these.

599
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,083
It's called a "gramophone."

600
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:36,000
Amazing...!

601
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,291
Where you going?

602
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,708
Just to get some water.

603
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,958
Come with us and be quiet.

604
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:37,458
Let me go!

605
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,916
Now, now.

606
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,416
There is no need for violence.

607
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,291
It's... It's the Baron?

608
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,958
Shut your trap!

609
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,875
I know what you've done Teo.

610
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:52,666
That you've smuggled
a human in here.

611
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,375
If news of that
were to get out...

612
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:59,583
the punishment that must
befall you would be horrible.

613
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,500
And all the cards you have so

614
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:04,458
diligently earned
would be taken away.

615
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:07,791
So, with that in mind,
I'm truly hoping

616
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:12,041
you'll allow me to help with
this little problem of yours.

617
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,375
I believe you're aware
that the human

618
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:18,125
is searching for
a particular hand-mirror.

619
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:22,000
I want you to go with the human
and help her find that mirror.

620
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,416
And once it's found...

621
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,125
I want you to quietly
bring it back to me.

622
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:27,000
You see...

623
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:29,291
...that mirror was once mine.

624
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,166
And it's very precious to me.

625
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,541
If you do this...

626
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:36,500
I will reward you by making
sure no one finds out

627
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:39,166
that you were the one who
brought the human here.

628
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,000
And...

629
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,250
In addition...

630
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:45,208
I will give you
10,000 stamp cards.

631
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,250
10,000?!!!

632
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:54,916
So go on,
unhand him now.

633
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:30,666
Can you drive a
little slower, please!!!

634
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:33,791
In there huh?

635
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:35,750
That's the place where
I can find my mom's mirror?

636
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:38,708
Yeah, but, just
slow down a little bit.

637
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,208
Hey...

638
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,000
...you're making me nervoust.

639
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,916
Maybe we should head back.

640
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:10,833
If were turn back...

641
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:14,166
...everything we've done up
'til now will be pointless.

642
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,916
I'm kinda okay with that.

643
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,416
There's no retreat now...

644
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,958
It's just a mirror,
it's no big deal.

645
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,541
Let it go!!!

646
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:27,708
Um...
Teo...

647
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,291
Oww!

648
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,291
It's the Petit Loss!

649
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,708
Haru!

650
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,791
Open your eyes.

651
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,250
Open your eyes
and drive this thing!

652
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,583
I can't look down!

653
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,916
Then don't look down,
just look in front of you.

654
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,958
In front of you.

655
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:19,458
Look in front you, Haru!

656
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,666
What is that?

657
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,916
Haruuuu!

658
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,708
Agh, what is this stuff.

659
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:51,750
It tastes like...

660
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,333
...syrup.

661
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,625
Stop.

662
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:58,708
Stay back. Stay back.

663
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,541
I said stay back!

664
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,125
Come on.
Put me down already!

665
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:19,875
Cotton!

666
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:33,625
I'm coming!

667
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,000
There you are...

668
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,375
...my mirror.

669
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,166
Wait!

670
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,375
Hi mom...

671
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,083
Thank you...

672
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,125
...for everything.

673
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,166
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this.

674
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,958
I know you didn't hafta do it.

675
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:16,958
I owe you big.

676
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,833
If only I had
some magic then...

677
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:25,250
...maybe I could've gotten rid
of that thing much easier.

678
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:28,458
But it was you who made that
plane move at the shrine.

679
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:29,708
I saw you.

680
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:31,208
That was magic, right?

681
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,666
That's beginner stuff.

682
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,041
But it's the best I can do.

683
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,291
And...

684
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,083
...it's why I spend my
life picking up junk.

685
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:41,416
I guess...

686
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,458
I'm neglected junk, too.

687
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:49,041
You know... I'm
also neglected junk.

688
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:53,000
There's not a single person
who's worried about me.

689
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,041
Not for ages.

690
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:09,875
Teo!

691
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,041
What is this thing?

692
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:19,250
I feel like I've seen it before.

693
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,916
Yeah, I feel that way, too.

694
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,541
But where did we see it?

695
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:26,083
Well it came from up there.

696
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,625
--I know what it is!
--I know what it is!

697
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,000
Those things you ate!

698
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,916
Yeah... freshly caught!

699
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,208
I guess they...

700
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:35,625
...use these as bait
to lure them out.

701
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,083
Teo!

702
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,208
Get in!

703
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:50,791
Grab tight!

704
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,250
We made it.

705
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,166
Teo!

706
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,375
Bravo, bravo.

707
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:16,333
You completed
your task dutifully.

708
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,375
Get out.

709
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:20,875
Don't touch me!

710
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,166
Hey...
That's mine!!!

711
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,041
Teo.

712
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,791
What's going on?

713
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,500
Young Teo here
used the Human...

714
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:35,166
...to bring my precious
hand-mirror back to me.

715
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:37,958
And now...

716
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:39,500
...to show my benevolence,

717
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:42,375
I will keep the promise
I made to him.

718
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,083
Ten thousand stamp cards.

719
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,666
All for you.

720
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,625
Teo?

721
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,458
What are you doing?!
Look at me Teo.

722
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:57,083
Go ahead... take them.

723
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,958
You let Haruka go!

724
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,875
And who do we have here.

725
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,208
Cotton!

726
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,250
Cotton!
Cotton!

727
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,208
Be still!

728
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,750
What's gonna happen to her?

729
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,875
Just send her back to
the Human World okay!

730
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,500
Just let her go?

731
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:15,125
Oh, I have no intention of that.

732
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:18,750
I've always fancied the idea
of having a human servant.

733
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,125
We had an arrangement, Teo.

734
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:23,541
And I never made any
promises about her, did I?

735
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:27,166
I'm sure there's no
need to worry.

736
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,208
We can never...

737
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:01,833
...make friends with a human.

738
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:07,333
That's just the
way it has to be.

739
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:28,750
It's mine!

740
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,333
That mirror was a special
gift given to me by mother!

741
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:32,833
Now give it back!

742
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:36,125
From what I understand you
left it lying around neglected.

743
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:37,333
But not to worry.

744
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,791
It's in good hands now.

745
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:40,708
I'll take very good care of it.

746
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:43,125
I'm sure this mirror is happy
to be in my possession.

747
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,416
Yeah, well I'm
not gonna leave it

748
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,666
lying around anymore.

749
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,791
Give it back!

750
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,875
It belongs to me!

751
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,833
With this, I can concentrate
the power of 10,000 mirrors.

752
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:13,333
I can control thousands of
robots with this kind of power.

753
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,500
They can fetch new
things from the human world.

754
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,250
Things that we've
never seen before.

755
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:22,708
No more of this
old forgotten gargbage.

756
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,708
Then I'll raze this
miserable junkyard.

757
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:27,375
And with the power
of my machines,

758
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,625
I'll build a shiny new island.

759
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:32,500
And finally I will be
better than the humans.

760
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,958
I will have more
beauty and grandeur

761
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,250
than they ever dreamed possible!

762
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,625
Now, let's talk about you, dear.

763
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,125
Yeah, you're gonna hafta swallow

764
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:45,041
an the oblivion
drop, little one.

765
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:48,000
Once you swallow one of those,
you won't remember anything.

766
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,166
And you'll be a happy servant.

767
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,416
With you as my tool,
I could steal

768
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,000
anything I wanted
from the human world.

769
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,208
I'm actually
doing you a favor.

770
01:00:58,291 --> 01:00:59,708
Without those
pesky memories

771
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:01,208
you'll feel much better.

772
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:01,958
No!

773
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:03,208
Don't you dare!

774
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,666
Stop it!

775
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,041
No!
Let me go!

776
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:16,583
Stop!

777
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:18,208
Behold!

778
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,541
Outta the way!

779
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,708
Move it!

780
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,833
--Teo!
--Hey, look... there he is.

781
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,583
C'mon.
He brought a human here.

782
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:51,375
He has to pay!

783
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:02,291
Everyone!

784
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:04,041
Please listen!

785
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,375
The Baron is planning on doing

786
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:08,500
something truly horrible to us.

787
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:09,833
He has the human.

788
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:11,458
He's gonna force
her to be his servant

789
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:12,958
and I've gotta go save her.

790
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:15,458
I knew you were
friends with that human!

791
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:17,250
You wanna save a human?

792
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,083
That's stupid!

793
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,583
Humans can be very nice.

794
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,708
They're not at all like
I thought they'd be.

795
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:23,125
They're not scary and evil.

796
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,791
They're good!

797
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,000
See... Look.

798
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,083
A human taught me
how to build this.

799
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:30,041
An airplane!

800
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:37,625
I've heard enough
of your babble.

801
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:38,916
Get him!

802
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,666
No!

803
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,250
I have to save her!

804
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:44,083
I need your help!

805
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:47,083
The Baron is gonna doing
something really bad!

806
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:49,375
We hafta stop him!

807
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,083
There's my stamp cards.

808
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:54,791
All 10,000...

809
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:58,166
Now stop standin'
there and build me a plane.

810
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,875
Turn it up.

811
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,333
Okay...

812
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,583
...we'll start by makin'
this thing bigger!

813
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:26,958
Ready.

814
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,250
There!

815
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:11,791
I don't know, Teo.

816
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:13,750
This things pretty heavy.

817
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,500
Do you really think
it's gonna fly?

818
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:18,208
I'm sure of it.

819
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,291
Don't...

820
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:34,166
...let...

821
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,500
...me...

822
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,666
...down!

823
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,250
So...

824
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,875
Stubborn, are ya'?

825
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:24,291
Giver her another drop then.

826
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,416
Swallow it... come on!

827
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:41,250
Teo is heading
straight for the castle!

828
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,708
C'mon.

829
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:51,250
Fly for me!!!

830
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:03,500
Oh no!

831
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:04,875
Gimme that.

832
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,250
I can do this!

833
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:17,083
Fly!!!

834
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,791
He's flying!

835
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,916
What happened?

836
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,125
What is this?

837
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,833
The Baron is the one
who's has your mirrors!

838
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,708
Charge!!!

839
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:10,833
Haruka...

840
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:18,250
It's the Petit Loss!

841
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:20,458
What the heck are
they doin' here?

842
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:22,708
Someone must've told them
we got all those mirrors here!

843
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:25,166
This is gonna be bad.

844
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,416
They're plastic.

845
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,500
Come on rubber band power!

846
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,625
Your Highness!

847
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:10,666
We've been attacked and
outnumbered by enemy forces.

848
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,875
And the Human escaped...

849
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,250
She what?

850
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:15,208
You worthless creatures!

851
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,000
Perhaps it's time...

852
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:19,166
...for a little trial run.

853
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:21,458
Watch this.

854
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:33,500
Haruka!

855
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,416
Now we got you now!

856
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,375
End of the line girlie!

857
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:12,541
Very well done.

858
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,625
You humans are so clever.

859
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,708
But it's over now.

860
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:19,666
Fire the net-gun!

861
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,583
Yes sir.

862
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,458
Uh, my bad.

863
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,500
Now that was a close call.

864
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,416
Be good and stay put.

865
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:05,958
You!

866
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,875
Give Haruka back!

867
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,583
Cotton?

868
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:18,166
Get off me!

869
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,958
Back to your posts, at once!

870
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:25,875
How dare you,
you dirty little fuzzball.

871
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:29,166
You annoying worthless,
forgotten piece of garbage!

872
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,000
That's enough!

873
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,791
Leave Cotton alone!

874
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,708
No don't!

875
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,833
Cotton! Cotton! No!

876
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,583
Cotton wait!

877
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:56,333
Oopsy... she fell.
Go get her.

878
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,833
I'm glad...

879
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:07,708
...that we got
one last chance...

880
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:08,958
...to talk.

881
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:10,375
Me too.

882
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:12,708
Me too, Cotton.

883
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:15,291
Really glad.

884
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:19,083
You made me happy.

885
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,125
Oh Cotton!

886
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:28,958
A flying machine?

887
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,333
Teo?!

888
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,500
Haru...

889
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:50,541
I wanted...

890
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,166
...to tell you I'm sorry.

891
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,708
Why that little...

892
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,625
Take 'em out!

893
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,208
Hang on!

894
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:21,833
Did we get them?

895
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,083
Fire the big one!

896
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,541
Wind the rubberband backwards.

897
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:32,166
Huh?

898
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,208
What for?

899
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:35,416
Just start peddling
the other way!

900
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,291
More more more...

901
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:43,208
Now let the pedals go!!!

902
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,458
Back up!
Back up!

903
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,250
Haru!

904
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:00,333
Haru?

905
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:02,166
Are you hurt?

906
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:03,833
Come on.

907
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:05,208
Haru!

908
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,791
Are you okay?

909
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:11,166
Are you hurt?

910
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,666
Teo...

911
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,250
Thank goodness.

912
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,541
I don't believe it...

913
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,541
...we're both all right.

914
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,708
Yeah, but we won't be for long.

915
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:24,583
The Baron will be
here any second, I'm sure.

916
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:26,833
We've gotta get out of here.

917
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:35,541
There it is.

918
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:40,791
There's what it?

919
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,291
The mirror...

920
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,666
Mom's mirror...

921
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:48,458
It's at the very
top of this thing.

922
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:53,250
Teo.

923
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:55,666
Please come.

924
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,291
Go with me.

925
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:01,333
Of course.

926
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:04,750
We'll take your
mirror back together.

927
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,208
Teo...

928
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:31,000
Ready... set...?

929
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,916
Look at that!

930
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,958
There it is.

931
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:27,333
Don't you touch it!

932
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:31,916
Don't you dare touch
my precious mirror!

933
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:44,083
Haru!

934
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:46,041
Quick!
Get the mirror!

935
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:52,541
Enough of this child's play.

936
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,333
Haru, go!
Grab it!

937
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:59,750
Get off of me, you little brat!

938
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:07,125
I won't let you have it!

939
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:21,125
Haru!

940
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,208
Teo...

941
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:36,208
--Wah!
--Ah...

942
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:05,666
Don't do that to me, Haruka...

943
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,458
...you scared me.

944
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:09,791
It's mom...

945
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:12,875
Can we do origami please...?

946
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:13,666
Sure.

947
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,708
But after dinner, okay?

948
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,291
I think...

949
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:21,541
...we're inside
the mirror's memory.

950
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,375
She's obviously
taking after me...

951
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:32,375
Let's just hope...

952
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,708
...she doesn't
have your messy side.

953
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:37,125
That's right.
Just my good sides.

954
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:40,541
Okay.
Right, left, right, left.

955
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:41,541
Look at...!

956
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:42,708
That's my girl!

957
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:44,125
She's getting kinda chubby.

958
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:46,458
That's 'cause you feed
her sweets all the time.

959
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:49,208
But she's so happy
when I give it to her.

960
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:51,750
You're gonna spoil
her, you know.

961
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,041
I wanna go...

962
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,666
I wanna see the fireworks!

963
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,708
Well... why don't
we go then?!

964
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:57,958
They're beautiful.

965
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,083
I think you'll like them.

966
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:00,083
They're really big!

967
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:01,208
And you can hear them go...

968
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,125
Boom!

969
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,291
--Boom! Like that.
--Really?

970
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,000
Boom!

971
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,458
Boom!

972
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:09,958
Boom!
Boom!

973
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:11,500
When I grow up mommy...

974
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,750
...can I be just like you too?

975
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,000
Of course you can.

976
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:17,583
Or you know...
you could be like your dad, too.

977
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:19,500
I'd rather be mommy.

978
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:22,791
Oh... now poor
Daddy's all sad.

979
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,666
You know Haru fell
down in the park today,

980
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,500
but she
didn't cry at all.

981
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:30,833
She's growing up.

982
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:34,166
Humans forget the
most amazing things.

983
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,541
Come on daddy, please stay.
Don't go.

984
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:39,083
You neglect...

985
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:41,708
...even your memories.

986
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:42,958
Hey, what're you...

987
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:43,791
Haru!

988
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:44,750
No...!

989
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,416
Here...
Happy birthday, Haruka.

990
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,291
Go on... open it.

991
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:56,125
It's so cute!
Thank you!

992
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58,916
This guy's name is Cotton.

993
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,416
Hello Cotton.

994
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,750
How old are you?

995
01:22:06,041 --> 01:22:06,958
You got it.

996
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:09,916
I'm happy to be your big sister!

997
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,875
Take good care of him.

998
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:15,333
Your big sister will
take good care of you!

999
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:16,708
So mommy...

1000
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:19,916
I want to know when you can
come back home again?

1001
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,041
Hm.

1002
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:22,541
I don't know.

1003
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:23,333
Hey!

1004
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:26,000
Why don't we ask Mr. Fox?!

1005
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:52,041
I can't just keep crying.

1006
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:55,666
These tears aren't
doing me any good.

1007
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,833
Oh... Haru.

1008
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:18,833
You're up early.

1009
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,375
Hey daddy...

1010
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:22,916
What're you doin' in here?

1011
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,875
Take a look.

1012
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,333
I made you lunch for you.

1013
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:28,583
It's hamburger patty today!

1014
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:31,958
I wanna eat it now!

1015
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:18,958
He followed us!

1016
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:21,708
I've gotcha now!

1017
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:25,291
Haru!

1018
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:26,708
We've gotta find
a way outta here!

1019
01:24:26,791 --> 01:24:27,791
Way out?

1020
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:29,000
They're all just
different reflections.

1021
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:30,916
There should be
one reflecting this place.

1022
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,750
But there're so many of them.

1023
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:34,375
They're everywhere!

1024
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,958
I don't know which one it is!

1025
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,791
Just where do you
think you're going!

1026
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:46,791
Wait.
There it is!

1027
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,291
Teo, it's behind the Baron!

1028
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:50,666
That's it!

1029
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,791
Okay, we've
gotta jump through it.

1030
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:13,041
Mom!!!

1031
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,500
You will not escape me!!

1032
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:17,041
Teo!

1033
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:24,250
Teoooo!

1034
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,666
My mirrors.

1035
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:36,375
Oh how I love all my mirrors.

1036
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:38,125
The Baron!

1037
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:51,125
Give her her mirror back!
Give it back!

1038
01:26:59,041 --> 01:27:01,416
Teoooooo!

1039
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,791
Hey bro...

1040
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,125
What happened, Boss...?

1041
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:39,083
I think Teo...

1042
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:41,916
...has done somethin' awesome.

1043
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,541
Mister Arch Bishop!

1044
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:56,708
Mister Arch Bishop!

1045
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:59,708
Arch Bishop, sir!

1046
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:02,333
Arch Bishop sir?!

1047
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:03,708
Ow ow ow!

1048
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:06,416
Your Benevolent Highness!

1049
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,375
We're looking for you.

1050
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:16,583
It's so cold...

1051
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,458
Your...

1052
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:21,375
your Highness...?

1053
01:28:21,458 --> 01:28:23,208
Huh?
Who's this?

1054
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:30,083
No... no... don't look at me!

1055
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:33,458
Please, wait for us sir!

1056
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:35,083
Wait!

1057
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:39,791
Teo!

1058
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:40,833
Teo!

1059
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:48,958
Teo!

1060
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:54,958
Teo?

1061
01:28:56,208 --> 01:28:59,416
Teo...
Come on wake up.

1062
01:29:02,666 --> 01:29:04,583
Haru...

1063
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,541
It didn't break.

1064
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,083
What?

1065
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:29,041
Look at you!

1066
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:54,833
Look!
There they are!

1067
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:56,958
They did it!

1068
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,541
Thanks again.

1069
01:30:34,541 --> 01:30:35,833
Teo...

1070
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:39,541
...you're far from
neglected junk.

1071
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:42,250
You too.

1072
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:45,291
Promise we'll meet again.

1073
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:46,875
I promise.

1074
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:48,833
As long as you don't forget me.

1075
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:51,625
Why would I ever neglect you?

1076
01:30:51,708 --> 01:30:55,208
You'll be a precious memory
for the rest of my life Teo.

1077
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:06,708
Goodbye.

1078
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:08,375
What?

1079
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:41,500
Oww...

1080
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:05,666
Weird...

1081
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:09,041
...no time has passed at all.

1082
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:16,875
Hey Dad...

1083
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,583
it's me, Haruka.

1084
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,791
Oh, hey Haru.

1085
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:22,583
About...

1086
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:24,583
...earlier...

1087
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:26,083
I'm sorry.

1088
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,541
I didn't mean it.

1089
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:29,833
Huh?

1090
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:31,958
When I got mad.

1091
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:33,958
Oh, okay.

1092
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:35,625
This is kinda
outta character for you.

1093
01:32:35,708 --> 01:32:36,500
You all right?

1094
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:38,000
What?
Yeah...

1095
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,041
I'm fine.

1096
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:40,916
Oh...

1097
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,875
...by the way...

1098
01:32:41,958 --> 01:32:42,875
...about dinner.

1099
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,416
You wanna go somewhere?

1100
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,541
Huh?

1101
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:47,000
Yeah, sure.

1102
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:50,041
It's been a while since just
the two of us had dinner.

1103
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:51,791
Is that what you want?

1104
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:54,625
Well then you pick the place.

1105
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:55,791
You don't care?

1106
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:57,083
No, your choice.

1107
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:58,958
Well, what I want...

1108
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:01,333
...is a hamburger patty!

1109
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:05,375
Man... I'm so hungry!

1110
