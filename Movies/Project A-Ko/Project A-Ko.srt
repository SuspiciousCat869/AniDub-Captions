- [Phil] All right,
let's get underway

4
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,688
with the hyperdrive checklist.

5
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,315
- [Mission Control] I
have the checklist ready.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,399
- [Phil] Okay.

7
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,734
- [Mission Control] Uh, lights?

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,943
- [Phil] Are okay.

Breaker check.

10
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:17,869
- [Phil] Breaker one is
okay, breaker two okay,

11
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,704
and breaker number three okay.

12

Ion drive engine check.

13
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,505

(thrusters whooshing)

- [Mission Control]
Clearance from mothership.

16
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,512
- [Phil] Mothership, mothership,

17
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,514
please confirm
permission to depart.

18
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,767
- [Mission Control] Roger,
permission from mothership

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,852
for clearance
okayed at this time.

24

- [Sevarest] Let's go, Phil.

25
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,032
- Okay.

26
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,535
- [Mission Control] This is an
order from John's mothership.

27
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,621
Something is approaching
rapidly from the north.

28
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,664
Please check out.

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,581
- [Phil] Roger.

30
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,291
Sevarest, is some kind of test

31
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,043
taking place near location 7402?

32

away at 10 o'clock.

- Roger.

34
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,802
- [Phil] It seems to be
changing moment by moment.

35
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,679
- Where is it now?

36
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,097
Oh, wait, I see it.

37
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,099
Uh, something's wrong.

38
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,600
(alarm blaring)
It's, uh,

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,853
it's coming right toward us.

40
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,855

637, what's wrong?

44
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,071
(Sevarest gagging)

45
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,990
Having trouble calling, uh,

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,534
come in, 637, what's
wrong up there?

47

(explosion booming)

48
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,704

- [Radio Host] Today on this
16th anniversary, we remember

77
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,946
the extraterrestrial object
which landed on Graviton City,

78
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,031
killing its population
of six million

79
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,450
and reducing it to
rubble in an instant.

80
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,494
The impact burned
out all vegetation

81
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,455
over a radius of 60 kilometers
and the pillar of smoke

82
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,041
could be seen 200
kilometers away.

83
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,876
A new Graviton City has grown

84
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,170
in the crater left by the impact

85
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,339
and remaining wreckage
of the meteor itself

86
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,258
is incorporated
into what has become

87
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,010
our Military Command Center,

88
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,388
which dominates the downtown
skyline of our great city.

89
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,267
It is also appropriate that
the rebuilt Graviton City,

90
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,853
a showcase of modern
technological achievement,

91
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,772
has been chosen as the center
to celebrate the launch

92
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,316
of the Constellation probe
(A-ko groaning)

93
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,943
from Space Station
L-3, a space project

94
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,571
specifically designed to
identify any threats similar

95
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,656
to the one that
struck 16 years ago

96
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,367
and to defuse it before
it can cause a repetition

97
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,370
of the devastation that
engulfed Graviton City then.

98
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,708
And now to more everyday things.

99
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,127
It's a beautiful day
here in Graviton City,

100
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,880
so all you kids on your
first day back at school

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,381
will have to give up the idea

102
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,258
of going for that
swim in the lake

103
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,261
and get down to some
serious work instead.

104
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,805
And the kids transferring
to new schools today,

105
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,266
let's hope you're happy,
make lots of new friends,

106
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,852
and get on well with
your new teachers.

107
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,313
Okay, the time's just
coming up to 8:15!

108
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,856
(alarm ringing)

109
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,858
- Ah, I'm late for school!

110
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,735
First day and late!

111
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,527

(doorbell ringing)

117
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,469
- A-ko, hey, hurry
up, you're late!

118
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,596
(window rattling)

119
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,015
Hey, hurry up, A-ko!

120
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,017
You know what time it is?

121
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,061
- Hi, yeah, I know!

122
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,940
I'm coming now, I'll
be right with ya!

123
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,108
Sorry I'm late!

124
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,359
- I swear you'd sleep
right through it

125
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,277
if another meteor
landed in town!

126
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,445
(both laughing)

127
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,949
(upbeat electronic music)

128
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,208
A-ko, will they put us together

129
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,668
in the same class, do you think?

130
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,462
- I expect they will because
they know we're friends.

131
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,923
- Yeah, well, they'd better
or I'll yell the place down!

132
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,383
- What?

133
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,260
- I only came to Graviton
High because you did!

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,011
(school bell chiming)

135
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,389
- Oh, God, the
time, hang on tight!

136
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,642
(C-ko yelping)

137
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,060
I still don't think
we'll make it in time

138
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,689
and that won't make a
very good impression!

139
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,649
There it is!

140
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,151
We'll take a shortcut, C-ko!

141
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,569
- If you say so!

142
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,155
(C-ko yelping)

143
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,074

(air whooshing)
(C-ko shuddering)

145
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,037
- Ah!
- Enjoy your meal!

146
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,540

(stranger breathing out)

149
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,265
- What a terrible dump.

150
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:58,060
(air whooshing)
(air whistling)

151
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,065
Huh?

152
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,568
- [A-Ko] Excuse me!

153
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,695
Excuse me!

154
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,368

(school bell chiming)

157
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,461
- [Miss Ayumi] Okay,
girls, a nice big welcome

158
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,671
for two new students
joining us this semester.

159
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,840
Like to introduce yourselves?

160
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,885
- Well, my name is A-ko and
I'm really happy to be here!

161
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,014
- Hi, everyone, it'll be great,

162
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,768
and when I say great I mean
great, making new friends here!

163
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,811
- That's very nice,
only what's your name?

164
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,980
- I'm called C-ko, don't
you think that's cute?

165
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,148
Do you think it suits me?

166
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,526
I do, it kinda expresses
my personality.

167
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,110
And I must say,
you're pretty as well!

168
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,362
The prettiest schoolteacher
- Oh jeez!

169
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,279
- [C-ko] I've met! (giggling)

170
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,447
- [A-Ko] C-ko, shut up!

171
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
- [Miss Ayumi] Thank you.

172
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,741
(C-ko giggling)

173
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,202
- [A-Ko] C-ko, shut up,
you're embarrassing me!

174
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,579
- [C-Ko] I don't care, let
it all hang out, I say!

175
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,706
I'm gonna love this
school, I know it!

176
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,958
It's so much fun! (giggling)

177
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,875
- [Miss Ayumi] There
there, dear, I think

178
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,960
that's quite enough.

179
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,965
- Oh, what a mouth I've got!

180
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,882
- C-ko!

181
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,301
- Now, where will you sit?

182
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,678
- [B-Ko] Excuse me, Miss.

183
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,846
- I'm getting a bit
impatient, what do you want?

184
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,348
- If they sit near me,

185
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,517
I might show them the ropes
the first couple of days.

186
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,269
- That's a good idea.

187
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,104
So, C-ko, you sit
on B-ko's right side

188
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,605
while A-ko takes the
place next to the window.

189
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,733
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, I wanna
sit by the window!

190
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,361
- Stop complaining, will ya?

191
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,488
Miss, let her sit
where she wants.

192
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,282
- Well, if you think
that'll settle her down.

193
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,325
I don't care as
long as you don't.

194
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,036
- Hurray, I get to
sit near the window!

195
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,997
And as long as
everybody's happy,

196
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,290
then that's all that counts!

197
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,791
(students whispering)
(students giggling)

198
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,625
Great!

199
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,339
- Thanks for offering to help.

200
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,425
So ignore me.

201
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,305
- [Miss Ayumi] Quiet,
everyone, and let's begin.

202
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,848
- [Students] Shh!

203
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,142
- C-ko, face the front and
pay attention, would you?

204
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,561
- [C-Ko] I'm bored!

205
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,937
- Well, if I can
persuade you to listen,

206
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,355
you might be less bored.

207
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,815
- Ah!

208
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,693
I'm sorry, teacher, I
promise I'll concentrate.

209
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,488
This place looks great.

210
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,656
(students laughing)

211
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,824
- [Girl] Over here, over here!

212
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,075
- Bring it forth towards me!

213
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,037
A bit further, line
it up with this one.

214
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,956
(machine clanking)

215
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,084
(rockets whooshing)
- Wow!

216
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,837
- Hey, can I fly as well?

217
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,756
I'd like to try a rocket too!

218
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,715
Ooh!
(blow thudding)

219
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,634
(C-ko groaning)

220
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,427
You hit me!

221
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,720
- And I'll probably do it again

222
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,847
if you don't pay a
bit of attention!

223
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,642
(C-ko whimpering)

224
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,522
(C-ko wailing)

225
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,691
Stop, stop it!

226
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,777
Stop crying, C-ko, please!

227
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,198
Oh, there's a good girl,
I didn't hurt you, did I?

228
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,742
Oh God, what have I done?

229
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,286
You won't report this to
the head teacher, will you?

230
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,414
(school bell chiming)

231
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,877
- [C-Ko] Surprise!

232
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,671
- That for me?

233
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,339
- Mm, just something I ran up

234
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,174
out of my Cordon Bleu
lunch book, try it!

235
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,261
- Mm, well, uh, remember
the last lunch you made?

236
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,263
- Oh, that was a long time ago.

237
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,557
Come on, mouthwatering, hm?

238
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,518
- Uh, gee, thanks.

239
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,103
- Doesn't it look delicious?

240
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,355
(playful music)

241
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,024
(A-ko groaning)

242
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,569
(A-ko gagging)

243
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,779
That's pretty
terrific, ain't it?

244
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,697
What about that?

245
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,864
(A-ko groaning)

246
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,032
Oh!

247
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey, you've gone all
blue in the face, A-ko!

248
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,120
What's the matter with her,

249
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,371
don't she appreciate
home cooking?

250
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,456
All anyone'll eat these
days is junk food.

251
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,712
(C-ko yelping)

252
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,047
Help, help, fire, fire!

253
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,675
(C-ko groaning)

254
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,097
(C-ko screaming)

255
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,267
I'm gonna blow up!

256
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,310
(C-ko screaming)

257
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,020
What did I put in it?

258
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,522
I don't wanna die!

259
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,607
I've poisoned us both!

260
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,025
(C-ko screaming)

261
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,027
I didn't mean it, I
swear it was an accident!

262
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,070
(Mari chuckling)

263
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,363
Oh, everything's going black!

264
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,573
(B-ko chuckling)

265
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,116
My life's flashing
before my eyes!

266
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,619
Tell them I died with my
cook's hat and apron on!

267
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,872
(C-ko yelping)

268
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,999
(B-ko chuckling)

269
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,292
(school bell chiming)

270
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,127
- Oh, there's the bell!

271
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,379
Time for afternoon class!

272
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,548
- When the poet says,
\"O, to substantialize

273
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,967
\"this suppositious
ontological quiddity,\"

274
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,261
he is expressing something
which I think you'll agree

275
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,555
is central to most
people's lives.

276
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,307
At the same time,
what does it tell us

277
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,435
about his absurdist
views of human existence?

278
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,270
A good question!

279
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,605
Then his obsession with

280
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,357
ecumenical transcendentalism
is revealing.

281
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,734
From here, it is but short--

282
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,277
- Great!
- Imaginative leap--

283
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,945
- Laid back after that
Cordon Bleu lunch of yours!

284
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,406
No surprise we're out there
with placards around our necks

285
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,201
described as a pair of
hostile, disruptive students

286
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,619
with no regard for the school.

287
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,078
That's some reputation!

288
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,498
Next time, you keep your
lunchbox to yourself.

289
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,999
(C-ko wailing)

290
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,292
- I thought we were good friends

291
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,753
so I wanted to give you
something! (wailing)

292
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,254
- For Pete's sake,
stop blubbing,

293
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,298
we'll get sent
home if you don't!

294
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,549
- Shut up, will you?

295
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,384
I've had just about
enough for one day,

296
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,887
in fact, I've had enough
to last me a lifetime!

297
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,015
I won't put up with this
kind of thing in my class!

298
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,684
(C-ko wailing)

299
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,019
C-ko, stop crying!

300
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,521
How old are you anyway?

301
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,439
A-ko, do something,
make her stop!

302
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,442
- Is the substance really
a phallic illusion?

303
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,902
- Oh, what an
interesting question!

304
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,863
We might get the answer
if you read a few lines.

305
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,490
- Right.

306
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,075
\"O, to substantialize this--\"

307
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,911
- So, let's put all this
behind us and do some work now.

308
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,038
- But if A-ko had
been a bit more--

309
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,289
- So it was all your fault!

310
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,124
Why are you making C-ko cry?

311
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,293
No more crying now,
wipe those tears away.

312
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,838
- You'll stay behind
when school's over

313
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,964
and clean the classroom up.

314
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,798
(A-ko groaning)

315
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,091
Oh?

316
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,468
B-ko, why have you
stopped reading?

317
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,636
- It's a short poem.

318
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,057
You don't keep us
busy, do you, Miss?

319
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,517
- What?

320
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,060
But you won't go complaining
to the headmaster, eh?

321
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,522
Oh, come on, girls, let's
see how hard we can work

322
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,023
for the rest of today's lesson!

323
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,275
(school bell chiming)

324
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,694
Ah, what a shame,
time to go home.

325
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,281
- Having really--
- So the lock

326
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,699
gets stuck on my bicycle.

327
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,410
- A-ko, look, I'm terribly
sorry you're being punished,

328
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,996
I know it's my fault, I'll
never let it happen anymore.

329
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,332
- Forget it, I've had
school detentions before.

330
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,543
You go home, this
could take a while.

331
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,045
- No way do I go alone,
I'll wait for you!

332
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,298
- There's lots to do, it
could take me quite a time.

333
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,259
- Still, I'll wait
for you outside, A-ko!

334
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,594
- Okay, if you like.

335
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,512
I'll get this done
as quick as I can,

336
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,180
then I'll pick you up
at the school gate.

337
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,682
- [C-Ko] Right, see you there!

338
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,477
- Yeah.
- I think we're going out.

339
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,771
- Shh!
- Wait 'til tomorrow!

340
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,316
- Oh, that.
- Oh, I'd love to, yeah!

341
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,984
- Come on!
- You think so?

342
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,653
(A-ko grunting)

343
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,701
(desk thudding)

344
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,622
- Let's go.

345
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,373
- Bye, see you tomorrow!
- See you tomorrow!

346
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,417
- Don't forget take this!
- Okay!

347
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,627
- [Student] Do you wanna
walk this way with me?

348
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,086
- Okay, cool, great!
- Are you gonna

349
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,838
pick me up in the morning?
- Yeah, do you want my number?

350
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,840
- No, my mom doesn't--
- Oh, that's too bad!

351
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,425
- See you tomorrow!
- C-ko!

352
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,593
- [C-ko] Hm?

353
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,844
- A-ko's still
working and she says

354
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,846
would you go see her
behind the gym block?

355
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,264
- Huh, really?
- And pink!

356
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,016
- What's she doing there?
- You're right!

357
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,726
I thought she had to
clean the classroom?

358
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,270
- [Asa] I don't know, maybe
she's emptying the trash there.

359
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,564
- Yeah, right, I'll
go and help her out!

360
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,732
That's the least I can do!

361
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,150
- Sound off!
- Three, four!

362
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,360
- Change count!
(Asa chuckling)

363
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
- [Runners] One,
two, three, four!

364
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,905
One two!
- Three four!

365
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,159
* La la la la

366
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,913
* La la la la la la

367
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,873
(knuckles cracking)

368
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,708
- [A-Ko] Whee!

369
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,919
(water splashing)

370
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,753
Whee!

371
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,256
* La la la la la la

372
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,008
- Asa, I don't
see A-ko anywhere!

373
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,802
- Just go a little
further along.

374
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,263
(C-ko yelping)

375
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:18,018
(ominous dramatic music)
(knuckles cracking)

376
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:18,852
- Hm?

377
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,315
(Mari chuckling)

378
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,693
Hi, hi, big boy!

379
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,152
- What?

380
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,696
I ain't no boy just
because I shave every day!

381
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,782
You gotta be initiated,
which you might find painful.

382
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,409
- Scissors, yeah!

383
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,285
Scissors, scissors cut paper!

384
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,328
- Huh?
(C-ko giggling)

385
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,496
- [C-Ko] Go again!

386
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,081
One, two, three!
(Mari growling)

387
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,290
Paper!

388
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,291
Paper wraps rock!
- Huh, what?

389
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,334
(C-ko giggling)

390
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,293
Huh?

391
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,379
- I won again! (giggling)

392
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,547
You aren't very good!

393
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,716
Let's do it again,
one, two, three!

394
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,343
(Mari yelling)

395
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,016
Aww, don't be a sore loser!

396
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,019
(birds chirping)

397
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,937
- [B-ko Voiceover] I got to
have that girl for myself

398
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,272
and I know how to get her.

399
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,900
First, I get A-ko
out of the way,

400
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,861
then I tell Mari
to frighten her.

401
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,529
(blows tapping)

402
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,947
I come to her rescue.

403
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,702
She'll fall in my lap
and A-ko's history!

404
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,456
- Ha!

405
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,374
(B-ko chuckling)

406
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,044
(Mari growling)

407
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,590
- Come on, what'll we play now?

408
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,841
(Asa gasping)

409
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,010
- Mari, calm down, wait
for B-ko to get here!

410
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,720
(gasping) Remember?

411
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,055
- Hi-yah!

412
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,889
Ee-yah!

413
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,349
(C-ko screaming)

414
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,268
- Mari, can't you
do anything right?

415
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,686
(C-ko screaming)

416
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,645
- C-ko!

417
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,897
(energetic electronic music)

418
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,691
(Asa screaming)

419
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,525
Hey!

420
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,905
(A-ko grunting)

421
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,033
(Mari growling)

422
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,660
(B-ko panting)

423
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:05,793
- It isn't too late as long
as A-ko isn't there yet.

424
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,378
(tires screeching)

425
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,380
(A-ko grunting)

426
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,133
(air whooshing)

427
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,593
- And now say your prayers!

428
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,303
(C-ko shuddering)

429
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,554
- What?

430
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,349
(Mari shrieking)

431
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh?

432
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,189
(Mari grunting)

433
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,401
Oh, A-ko!

434
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,903
- C-ko, are you okay?

435
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,862
- [C-Ko] Okay, A-ko!

436
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,282
(Mari grunting)

437
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,742
- What a bully!

438
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,328
- Crossed Fist of the
late Akuki School.

439
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,415
(Mari growling)

440
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,417
(Mari yelling)

441
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,212
(shirt crashing)

442
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,926
(magical chiming)

443
00:18:55,926 --> 00:19:00,764
(wall crashing)
(Mari screaming)

444
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,141
- Hey, you're terrific!

445
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,892
(A-ko laughing)
We showed 'em, didn't we?

446
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,686
- A minute more and
you'd have been hurt.

447
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,354
- [C-Ko] Mm-mm!

448
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,189
- [A-Ko] Had enough
excitement for one day?

449
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,607
- [C-Ko] Yeah, let's go home.

450
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,365
- Where are they?

451
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,700
Perhaps they took her away.

452
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,121
I'll find her.

453
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:24,955
(B-ko gasping)

454
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,457
(air whistling)

455
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,675
(stranger laughing)

456
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,021
(calm rhythmic music)

457
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,110
(water splashing)

458
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,281
* Looking in your eyes

459
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,616
* How I hope that you will

460
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,867
- [B-Ko Voiceover] C-ko.

461
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,285
God, she's beautiful!

462
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,914
My heart's been racing ever
since I laid eyes on her.

463
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,208
She's got such a great laugh,

464
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,044
and even when she
cries she's cute!

465
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,839
Her eyes, the way she moves!

466
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,385
C-ko, you've gotta be my friend!

467
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,137
(air whooshing)

468
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,891
So I've got to get A-ko out
of the way, that's for sure.

469
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,267
But how?

470
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,977
Even Mari was no match for her.

471
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,646
Then I'll take her on myself!

472
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:36,276
I'll beat her, even if I have
to reveal my true powers.

473
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,696
* To be next to you

474
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,325
* Shine your light on me

475
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,995
* Nothing else will do

476
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,790
* Deep inside my heart

477
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,378
* I believe that
you and I could be *

478
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,839
* Friends forever more

479
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,675
* Through eternity

480
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,553
- I could swear I've met
A-ko, I remember her.

481
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,515
I'll have what I want,
no matter what it costs!

482
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,691
(scope whirring)

483
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,027
(stranger sighing)

484
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,321
- Why assign me to this beat?

485
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,155
Hm.

486
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,908
(scope whirring)

487
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,996
(stranger chomping)

488
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:33,125
(air whooshing)
(air whistling)

489
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,378
(stranger yelping)
(stranger crashing)

490
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,587
- [A-Ko] Sorry!

491
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,923
- [C-Ko] Wouldn't it
make things simpler

492
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,467
if you got 10 minutes earlier?

493
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,262
(energetic music)

494
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,264
(tires screeching)

495
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,142
(B-ko moaning)

496
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:50,934
- Huh?

497
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,272
C-ko!

498
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,858
(air whooshing)

499
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,659
Huh?

500
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,832
- I thought I told you to
clean the room, not destroy it!

501
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,958
Look at it!

502
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,960
Desks smashed to
pieces, chairs in bits!

503
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,962
It looks as though a
typhoon has hit it!

504
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,257
Or some creature with the
strength of a superhuman!

505
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,425
(B-ko yelping)

506
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,843
You're going to repair
each and every piece

507
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,762
of furniture in the
place, no get on with it!

508
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,349
(hammer clanking)

509
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,934
(A-ko yelping)

510
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,646
- (yawning) Hungry!

511
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,315
- [C-ko] A-ko, A-ko!

512
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,653
- C-ko?

513
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,490
Is that you, C-ko?

514
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,535
- [C-Ko] Lunch time!

515
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,787
(A-ko yelping)

516
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,954
Hee!

517
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,498
(A-ko yelping)

518
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,458
(A-ko crashing)

519
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,126
Oh, you're sick?

520
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,961
- [A-ko] No, not yet at least.

521
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,051
- Well then, if you feel ill,
I suppose you shouldn't eat.

522
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,053
(sniffling) Not if you're sick.

523
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,431
Even so, it's a shame, my food
going to waste (sniffling).

524
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,103
Hey, I'll tell you what,
I got a terrific idea!

525
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,355
School's out for the
day so let's go downtown

526
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,065
and find a little adventure!

527
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,274
- Yeah.
- Okay?

528
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,442
- Yeah, anything!
- Great, that's great!

529
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,652
- Anything at all!
- That will soon set you

530
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,445
on your feet again!
- Only no lunch!

531
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,280
- [C-ko] Great, terrific!

532
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,866
We could take a look
at the Command Center

533
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,452
and even end up
going to a movie!

534
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,870
- [B-ko] Follow them.

535
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,165
(playful upbeat music)

536
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:44,256
* Your imagination is
all you really need *

537
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,969
* When you start believing

538
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,806
* Love is just a kiss away

539
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,016
* Life is what you make it

540
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:59,271
* There's no guarantee

541
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,565
* It's you who has the power

542
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,941
- Be sure to have
a nice day now!

543
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,528
* And love is just
a dance away *

544
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,697
* When you start believing

545
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:13,452
* You can do anything

546
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,537
* Let the magic fill you

547
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,875
* Take you above
the highest star *

548
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,043
* Dance away

549
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,295
* Your sorrow

550
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,255
* Dance away

551
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,256
- Wow!

552
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,048
Oh, gee!

553
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,927
(footsteps tapping)

554
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,057
- Shit!

555
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,185
(can clanking)

556
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,395
I ain't doin' his
dirty work no more!

557
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,440
Uh...

558
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,818
(metallic whooshing)

559
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,652
No!

560
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,531
(footsteps clanking)

561
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,365
No!

562
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,326
It's, it's

563
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,372
the Colonel!

564
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,959
(man yelping)

565
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,921
(A-ko yelping)

566
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,755
Keep away!

567
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,135
(man screaming)

568
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,345
(A-ko screaming)

569
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,013
(C-ko screaming)

570
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,806
* When the world around you

571
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,392
- Ah, great film, wasn't it?

572
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,602
- Mm!

573
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,646
I'm glad that you're better,

574
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,272
I got real worried
at lunch time.

575
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,857
- Do you mean to say
you were really worried?

576
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,359
That's a surprise!

577
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,362
You normally only get time to
worry about yourself, C-ko.

578
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,614
- That wasn't a nice thing
to say to a friend like me.

579
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,074
- Even though it's true?

580
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,825
- [Announcer] We interrupt
our scheduled program

581
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,452
for a newsflash.

582
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,163
Constellation Control has
just issued a statement--

583
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,498
- Okay, I forgive you,
- That all signal to the--

584
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,999
- Let's go!
- Science Academy's unmanned

585
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,169
deep space probe ceased
abruptly a few minutes ago.

586
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,507
Constellation, which departed
from Space Station L-3

587
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,468
last week, was in the
neighborhood of Iapetus

588
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,345
and was due to pass by Jupiter

589
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,472
before leaving the solar system.

590
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,350
A spokesman for Constellation
Control attributes

591
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,853
the communication loss to
a transmission failure.

592
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,273
(A-ko and C-ko laughing)

593
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,817
- A-ko, next time
we've got time off

594
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,069
I wanna go up the Seaside
Building and take a look

595
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,863
at the planets and stars
in their planetarium.

596
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,115
- Yes, all right, if you like.

597
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,285
* You might make
all your dreams *

598
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,913
- A-ko, do you mind if I
tell you how much I love you?

599
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,708
- I love you too, even
if you drive me insane.

600
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,042
Oh, my toe!

601
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,377
(A-ko groaning)

602
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,378
(cable creaking)

603
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,088
* Dancing into the light

604
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,506
(A-ko groaning)

605
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,758
(C-ko laughing)

606
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,926
(cable snapping)

607
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,969
(air whooshing)

608
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,096
(A-ko gasping)

609
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,347
- C-ko!

610
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,767
(beam crashing)
(C-ko yelping)

611
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,394
- Wow, that's amazing!
- Will you get a look at that?

612
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,063
- God, she must be strong!
- Are you hurt?

613
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,608
- Hey, that cable wasn't
supposed to break,

614
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,526
I wonder what happened!

615
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,279
Gee, what's keeping it up?

616
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,281
Can't be what I
think I'm seeing.

617
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,032
(crowd applauding)

618
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,325
- Wow!
- It's Superman!

619
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,284
- [Man] That's ain't
a man, she's a girl!

620
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,369
- Maybe, but this is some girl!

621
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,705
- Some kinda stunt girl!

622
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,998
- Hey, I'm not!

623
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,374
- [Woman] Well, it
sure is a mean stunt!

624
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,917
- [Boy] Can I have
your autograph?

625
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,002
- [Woman] What time's
the next performance?

626
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,086
I missed it this time around!

627
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,254
- [Girl] She's terrific!

628
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,340
- She's amazing!
- Did you see that?

629
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,258
- My arm, it's killing me!

630
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,844
(air rumbling)

631
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,982
- [Captain] Do you have a
status report on the collision?

632
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,317
- [First Officer] An
unidentified metal object

633
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,527
obstructed our passage
through hyperspace.

634
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,029
- [Captain] Damage report?

635
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,322
- [First Officer] A
small crack is visible

636
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,866
in the outer skin of section 21.

637
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,701
- [Captain] Initiate repairs.

638
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,203
(console beeping)

639
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,871
- [First Officer] Captain,
a signal from planet Earth.

640
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,873
- [Captain] One of our
operatives, put it through.

641
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:51,836
- [D] This is Operative
DC138621-S113, code name D.

642
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,712
- [Captain] Go ahead.

643
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,090
- Captain, I, ah, Captain,

644
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,550
I believe our long search
through the universe is over

645
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,095
and I have found the person
we're looking for at last.

646
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,429
- Oh, really?

647
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,514
You found her?

648
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,640
- [D] I believe so.

649
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,891
- [Captain] You're not certain?

650
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,852
- I cannot confirm with
complete 100% certainty,

651
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,397
but I estimate a
probability of 80%

652
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,273
at this moment in Earth time.

653
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,276
- Hm, report again
when it's 100%

654
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,111
- Right!

655
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,947
(console beeping)

656
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,576
(footsteps tapping)

657
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,164
- [Captain Voiceover] So
we've found her at last.

658
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,667
(dog barking)

659
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,341
(curtain rustling)

660
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,428
(film reel clicking)

661
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,892
(gentle music)

662
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,859
(door creaking)
- Huh?

663
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,026
- [Computer] The
background information disk

664
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,611
you requested is beside you.

665
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,612
- Thank you.

666
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,200
(machine whirring)

667
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,844
Huh?

668
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,850
Of course, that was it!

669
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,602
(B-ko laughing)

670
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,188
That was where our paths
first crossed each other.

671
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,196
(alarm ringing)

672
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,331
(A-ko grunting)

673
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,667
(muffled alarm ringing)

674
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,797
(A-ko grunting)

675
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,341
(doorbell ringing)

676
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,342
(A-ko yelping)

677
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,510
(objects clattering)

678
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,552
- [C-ko] Huh?

679
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,808
(footsteps thundering)

680
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,642
- [A-ko] Hi, C-ko!

681
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,228
(A-ko yelling)

682
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:19,567
(A-ko panting)
(air whooshing)

683
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,028
(D groaning)

684
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,535
- Let's see here.

685
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,749
The certainty
factor's gone up, 85%

686
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,709
(air whooshing)
(D screaming)

687
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,336
- Did we smash into someone?

688
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,879
- No, straight through him!

689
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,674
(energetic music)

690
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:50,473
(air whooshing)
(air whistling)

691
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,184
(A-ko gasping)

692
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,853
- I've been waiting
for you, A-ko.

693
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,399
- Well, that was
friendly of you, B-ko.

694
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,568
- You and me have got
some outstanding business

695
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,444
from a long time ago.

696
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,280
- What business are you
talking about, B-ko?

697
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,531
We two only just met!

698
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,034
- We didn't just
meet, you and I began

699
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,871
at the same kindergarten,
and C-ko was there too.

700
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,080
- [C-Ko] Huh?

701
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,165
- We all started at
the same kindergarten?

702
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,918
- I can't believe I didn't
recognize you at once.

703
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,045
You haven't changed
at all, you're still

704
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,590
the same self-righteous
little bitch you were then.

705
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,258
(air whooshing)

706
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,385
I remember the day
everything changed,

707
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,262
the day the wolf
escaped from the zoo

708
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,514
and almost killed C-ko.

709
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,726
(gentle chiming music)

710
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,858
You saved her, and
from that moment

711
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,360
C-ko was never the same again.

712
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,364
She'd been my friend,
but not anymore!

713
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,076
After that, you two
were always together

714
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,330
and you seemed to have so much
fun, it made me really mad.

715
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,668
Even when you had fights it
didn't stop you being friends,

716
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,629
and you still are!

717
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,841
A-ko, you haven't forgotten
the girl who swore

718
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,510
she'd get even with you for
taking C-ko away from her?

719
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,512
- What? Afraid so!

720
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,056
And I've got a
pretty good memory.

721
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,015
- [B-ko] Who challenged you?

722
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,892
- Sorry, but I don't remember.

723
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,893
Anymore clues?

724
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,645
- [B-ko] A fight to the finish?

725
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,521
(A-ko groaning)

726
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,648
- [A-ko] Yeah!

727
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
(A-ko groaning)

728
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,316
- A-ko?

729
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,198
- Yeah, now it's all come back!

730
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,616
- [C-ko] Oh, who was it, A-ko?

731
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,535
- Her piggy eyes, basin
haircut, and dumpy legs,

732
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,164
and she had that nasty superior
expression I used to detest!

733
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,958
- [C-ko] Oh!

734
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,459
- [A-ko] She thought
she could do anything

735
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,127
because her daddy was rich,

736
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,172
and she used to pick
on you all the time!

737
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,051
She used to put spiders
and frogs down your back.

738
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,427
- [C-ko] Yes, I remember!

739
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,680
But you saved me
from her every day!

740
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,518
- And then at last she said
she was going to fight me,

741
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,520
a fight to the finish she said,

742
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,814
but that was the very
day we moved house,

743
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,565
and so it never happened.

744
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,651
Her name was, wasn't
it something like,

745
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,696
I think it was,
Blinko, Burko, or--

746
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,990
- I made such a big
impression on you

747
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,866
you don't even remember my name.

748
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,701
Hmph!

749
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,704
- You!

750
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,497
- I was that girl
and my name's B-ko!

751
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,832
- B-ko, is it you?

752
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,708
It is you!

753
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,001
Yuck!

754
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,502
- I challenged you
to a fight, A-ko,

755
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,129
and you ran away like the
little coward you were!

756
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,799
I challenge you again, winner
take all and C-ko is all!

757
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,718
(dramatic clanging)

758
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,512
- (giggling) Oh, come
on, you're crazy!

759
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,640
She can't really mean she
wants to fight me again now!

760
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,559
- And anyway, I'm
not up for grabs!

761
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,893
- Well, I guess
it's time for class,

762
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,812
so I'll pass your
offer up, thanks.

763
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,647
- Wait a minute, you
don't rush me off!

764
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,859
I get what I want and
what I want is a fight!

765
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,945
- [A-ko] Cut it out, B-ko,
that was 10 years ago!

766
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,405
And you can't fight for C-ko

767
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,115
as though she's some
sort of a prize.

768
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,409
- Yes I can, yes
I can, yes I can!

769
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,495
We'll call it our
own Super Bowl.

770
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,872
(B-ko grunting)

771
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,292
(tense electronic music)

772
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,920
One last thing, just
to make the fight fair

773
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,381
I want you to meet someone.

774
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,718
(power suit whirring)

775
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,845
(giggling) My ally.

776
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,014
This is a power suit
I invented and built

777
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,849
as I know how strong
you were as a kid

778
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,018
and I'm sure you've
added a whole new battery

779
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,103
of fighting skills
in the meantime.

780
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,189
- [Ena] B-ko, are you really
sure this is a good idea?

781
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,106
- Shut up, Ena!

782
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,357
- [Ena] Sorry.

783
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,526
- Is this what you
call a fair fight?

784
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,028
- I don't!

785
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,030
- [Ena] It may not be fair,
but that's the way it is.

786
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,740
So why don't you give
in now so that I don't

787
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,367
have you on my conscience
for the rest of my life!

788
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,994
Please?

789
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,037
- Ena, kill.

790
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,040
(footsteps booming)

791
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,797
(B-ko chuckling)

792
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:55,802
(blow crashing)
(Ena screaming)

793
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,347
- Gosh, A-ko, the
power suit seems

794
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,932
to have lost some of its power!

795
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,183
(school bell chiming)

796
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,392
- Oh, gee, there's
the bell, hurry!

797
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,602
- [C-ko] We're going
to be late again!

798
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,896
- [A-ko] What'll
we tell Miss Ayumi?

799
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,272
- She beat me again!

800
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,024
I can't take it, I can't!

801
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,985
(welder crackling)

802
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,366
- [B-ko Voiceover] I must
have C-ko as my friend.

803
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,701
Tomorrow, tomorrow'll
be the day.

804
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,703
(B-ko chuckling)

805
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,082
And as for you, A-ko,
tomorrow's your last day!

806
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,835
(B-ko laughing)

807
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,255
(A-ko breathing heavily)

808
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,841
(A-ko sneezing)

809
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,930
(A-ko screaming)
(air whooshing)

810
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,891
- Gotta get that identification
percentage factor up.

811
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,146
I'll get it to 100%
for sure today.

812
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,273
(bodies crashing)
(D screaming)

813
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,066
(energetic music)

814
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,734
(D crashing)

815
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,027
- [A-Ko] Sorry!

816
00:35:56,445 --> 00:36:00,032
- Hey, wasn't he the same man
we almost killed yesterday?

817
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,869
- Well, he seems
to have survived!

818
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,829
Ah!

819
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,663
B-ko!

820
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,914
- Well well, so A-ko,

821
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,708
you didn't have the
sense to stay home.

822
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,835
- [A-Ko] I don't
give in to bullies!

823
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,628
I came to school to study!

824
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,839
- Oh, aren't we a
goody two-shoes!

825
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,842
Anyway, as you did come,
you deserve a nice welcome.

826
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,094
All right, let's have
her surprise now!

827
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:25,099
(grim dramatic music)
(machine whirring)

828
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,857
- Oh, a customized convertible!

829
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,442
Boy, isn't it great?

830
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,943
- [A-ko] Oh!

831
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,070
- (chuckling) Wait 'til I
demonstrate what it can do.

832
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,493
(machine whirring)

833
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,629
(electricity crackling)

834
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,506
(machine whirring)

835
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,515
(console whirring)

836
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,519
(robot stomping)

837
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,729
- [C-ko] Wow, it's cool!

838
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,105
- Thank you, C-ko,
it did take me

839
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,274
most of last night to build it.

840
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,276
The MAX-5000.

841
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,694
Standard features include:

842
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,279
the MAX Arm Crush,

843
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,448
these drills made
of nigninium alloy

844
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:26,744
go through five-meter thick
steel plates in 2.4 seconds;

845
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,289
the MAX Bomber Saw,
razor-sharp extending shredders

846
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,125
designed to reduce evidence
to absolute deniability;

847
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,672
the MAX Beam, this reaches
1,000 degrees centigrade

848
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,841
and vaporizes any
physical body instantly;

849
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,262
the Multiple MAX Facility,
a helix of holograms

850
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,514
which throws the enemy
into total confusion

851
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,724
as to what is real
and what is illusion.

852
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,727
All these MAX factors add up
to an irresistible weapon,

853
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,437
the Blue God of Death!

854
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,940
Let's forget the optional
extras, even without them

855
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,359
I think the MAX-5000
will cope with you!

856
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,030
- A-ko, it's pretty late,
perhaps I'd better go ahead.

857
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,699
I'll see you in class!

858
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,035
(birds chirping)

859
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,288
- And now, Uma, all systems go!

860
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,417
What's the matter, Uma?

861
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,294
Give her the benefit
of the whole works!

862
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,838
- [Uma] Yeah, but I
seem to have a problem.

863
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,381
- (groaning) What's
the matter with you?

864
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,841
Just do as you're told!

865
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,343
- There seems to be
a basic design flaw,

866
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,387
the start lever's
slightly out of reach.

867
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,472
I'm doing my best!

868
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:33,477
(Uma screaming)
(electricity crackling)

869
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,813
(kick crashing)

870
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,691
(air whooshing)

871
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:42,111
(MAX-5000 crashing)
(B-ko yelping)

872
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,572
- [A-ko] Hold on, C-ko,
I'll come with you!

873
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,699
- Oh, well I guess it's
back to the drawing board.

874
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,118
(school bell chiming)

875
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:54,123
(air whistling)
(curtains rustling)

876
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,210
You've humiliated me
once too often, A-ko!

877
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,046
Revenge is sweet, sweet, sweet

878
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,841
and you, A-ko, are
going to die, die, die!

879
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,675
(pencil snapping)

880
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,345
(B-ko laughing)

881
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,977
(birds chirping)

882
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,647
- Hey, whee, whee!
(C-ko yelping)

883
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,067
- You're in a pretty good
mood this morning, A-ko!

884
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,318
What's made you so happy?

885
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,986
- I feel good because
I got up earlier today!

886
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,780
We'll be in plenty of
time, and with luck

887
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,114
we won't have to fight with B-ko

888
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,200
because she won't
expect us so early!

889
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,576
- Whee!
(A-ko giggling)

890
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,869
- Woo!

891
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,287
Come on, go, run!

892
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,498
Whoa!

893
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,167
Whee!
(road crashing)

894
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,920
(birds chirping)

895
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,842
(pensive music)

896
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,057
(D chuckling)

897
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,892
- I made myself very vulnerable

898
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,185
in the middle of the roadway,

899
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,728
but here I've got
some protection.

900
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,397
Besides which, there's
my warning device.

901
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,399
(device beeping)
Uh-oh, here they come.

902
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,401
Huh?

903
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,693
(door crashing)
(D screaming)

904
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,945
- [A-ko] Sorry!

905
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,115
- Morning!
- Good morning!

906
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,408
- Good morning!

907
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,867
- Morning!

908
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,702
- I'm glad to see you're
on time this morning, A-ko.

909
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,539
- Excuse me, I'm in
a hurry, Miss Ayumi.

910
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,916
- She might do well in
the school 100 meters!

911
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,001
- Slow down, A-ko, we've got
plenty of time, haven't we?

912
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,421
- I don't want another argument
with B-ko if I can help it.

913
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,339
- Wow!
- It's really amazing!

914
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,468
- [Student] What's she
gonna do when she sees that?

915
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,761
- [Student] I don't know!

916
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,847
- This is scary!
- I know!

917
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,685
- [Student] Stay here,
don't go, don't go away.

918
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,894
- Look!

919
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,062
Here come A-ko now!

920
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,148
- [Student] Oh, the poor girl!

921
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,691
- Oh boy!

922
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,026
- Oh, I hope A-ko gets the
better of B-ko at last!

923
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:46,986
- [A-Ko] Huh?

924
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,697
(students cheering)

925
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,990
- [Student] Oh, it's
the most incredible

926
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,283
thing I've ever seen!

927
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,368
- What're they waiting here for?

928
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,995
- [B-ko] A-ko, look around you.

929
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,123
(grim dramatic music)

930
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,460
- You've been busy, huh?

931
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,669
- Oh my!

932
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,254
Even you couldn't beat them!

933
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,592
- I want you to meet
my Abashiyama Five,

934
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,511
though you may not
appreciate their friendship.

935
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,430
- Hey, I'm getting real
fed up with all this,

936
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,099
especially as I got outta bed
10 minutes earlier than usual

937
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,059
so I wouldn't be
late for school!

938
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,855
I don't wanna be late again
because of these wind-up toys!

939
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,773
Anyway, I'm too old
to play with them.

940
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,318
- A-ko, I'm gonna pay you back

941
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,528
for all the things
you've ever done to me!

942
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,031
Ruining my friendship with C-ko,

943
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,075
humiliating me again
by disposing of my
robot inventions!

944
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,204
(grunting) The time
for revenge has come!

945
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,207
You won't dispose
of these beauties,
they'll dispose of you!

946
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,960
- C-ko, what's she
flipped her lid about?

947
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,254
- Hey, ask B-ko, I've no idea!

948
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:50,257
(scooter engine rumbling)

949
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,800
- As you've got to
school early for once,

950
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,262
why not go straight in so
we can start work, okay?

951
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:59,016
(scooter engine revving)

952
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,435
You can always finish your
girl talk at lunchtime, B-ko.

953
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,603
- Right, yes, Miss.

954
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,812
- Do you hear?

955
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,272
So, come on, stop
gossiping now, girls!

956
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,357
- Okay.
- Are we done?

957
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,026
- I wanna stay and watch!

958
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,654
- What do you think we'd see
if we had to sit in class?

959
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,905
- It's not fair!
- I know!

960
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,615
- I guess if we don't
go she'll keep us in.

961
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,575
- Yeah, I guess,
better go in now.

962
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,370
- I'd like to see
B-ko get hers, though.

963
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,540
- Oh, C-ko's not so great.
- Oh yeah,

964
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,374
that's rich!
- Have you seen

965
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,543
her blonde curly hair?

966
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,044
(school bell chiming)

967
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,379
- [Blue-Haired Girl] Hey,
wait for me, you guys!

968
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,507
- Now we can get
down to business

969
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,843
without interference or
interruptions from any of them.

970
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:38,013
(dramatic whooshing)

971
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,515
- I managed to get
up in time today

972
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,308
and left home with
plenty to make it here

973
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,061
with a bit to spare, which will
probably never happen again,

974
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,691
but now I'm late anyway because
of you, and I feel real mad!

975
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,733
(B-ko yelping)

976
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,861
(A-ko screaming)
(blows crashing)

977
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,154
(robot crashing)

978
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:58,993
(energetic music)
(air whooshing)

979
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,452
(explosion booming)

980
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,537
Real mad!

981
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,289
(electricity zapping)

982
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,292
(blow crashing)

983
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,961
(robot whirring)

984
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,006
(robot crashing)

985
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,675
(A-ko grunting)

986
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,263
(air whooshing)

987
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,264
Strike one!

988
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,602
(explosion booming)

989
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,270
(B-ko shuddering)

990
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,062
- Wow!

991
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,740
She's got it!

992
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,574
- B-ko!

993
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,702
It's thanks to you
I'm late again,

994
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,495
don't you think
you've done enough?

995
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,707
- No, I haven't started!

996
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,002
I'm gonna get you,
you selfish creep!

997
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,338
- When will you learn you can
build all the robots you like

998
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,797
and it won't make
you feel any better,

999
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,257
all it does is make
us late for school!

1000
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,593
- Is that the only
thing you care about?

1001
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,055
Being a good girl,
charming the teachers?

1002
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,432
Well, naturally it's
never occurred to you

1003
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,267
that there are some
children who just

1004
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,353
aren't born with the same charm!

1005
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,396
But you don't care, you've
always been the heroine

1006
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,814
while I always
had to be the girl

1007
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,483
that everybody said was spoiled!

1008
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,277
Okay, if they say
I'm the bad girl,

1009
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,029
then that's what I'm gonna be!

1010
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,740
- Look, can't we
talk about this?

1011
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,408
- It's too late!

1012
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,535
(jacket whooshing)

1013
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,288
(B-ko yelling)

1014
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:30,292
(grim dramatic music)

1015
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,295
Now, now I'm dressed for action.

1016
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,256
This suit gives me the power
to match you in unarmed combat!

1017
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,885
(students laughing)

1018
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,303
- What does she look like?
- Oh!

1019
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,680
- And number one--
- I quite like her boots!

1020
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,848
- Oh, come on!
- So stupid!

1021
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,310
- Ain't it cold enough?

1022
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,144
- Oh, gee!

1023
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,188
(both laughing)

1024
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,564
- [B-ko] Laugh all you like!

1025
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,525
En garde!

1026
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,860
- I'd better go on
into class, A-ko.

1027
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,029
- Sure, and do something
for me, would ya?

1028
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,989
Answer for me at roll call.

1029
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,032
- Sure, bye now!

1030
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,117
- I'm ready!

1031
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,870
(energetic electronic music)

1032
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,337
Okay, B-ko, this is gonna
be our last meeting!

1033
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,464
- [B-ko] You took the
words outta my mouth!

1034
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,512
(air whistling sharply)

1035
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,265
(B-ko yelling)

1036
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,642
(A-ko yelling)

1037
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,686
(console beeping)
(technicians chattering)

1038
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,980
- Second two.
- Five.

1039
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,690
- What do you see, Bill?

1040
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,316
- Sorry, sir, it's disappeared.

1041
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,986
- [Technician]
Roger, I have you.

1042
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,654
Release.

1043
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,073
Continuing.

1044
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,700
- Are you saying that
Constellation's destruction

1045
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,910
was the result of
certain hostile actions?

1046
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,288
- Yes, the Central
Astro Agency think

1047
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,539
that's the likeliest scenario,

1048
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,499
though they can't be sure yet.

1049
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,959
- Any idea who did it?

1050
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,254
- There's no way that a
bomb could've gotten planted

1051
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,672
on the craft as it stood ready

1052
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,549
on the launchpad of
the satellite station,

1053
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,301
that's absolutely ruled out.

1054
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,844
- Which means it was them!

1055
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,679
- Possibly, Colonel,
however, I suggest

1056
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,265
you don't jump to
conclusions right now.

1057
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,933
But we could consider this:

1058
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,103
in 16 short years we have
progressed at a phenomenal rate

1059
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,855
in stellar defense
and it could just be

1060
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,149
an unknown galactic
power doesn't like it!

1061
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,113
(jets whooshing)

1062
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,997
(D chomping)

1063
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,375
(pensive rhythmic music)

1064
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,170
- That feels a lot better.

1065
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,345
(phone beeping)

1066
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,101
- [First Officer] Earth calling!

1067
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,269
- [Captain] Put it through.

1068
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,479
- [First Officer] Right!

1069
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,733
- Operative CD138621
et cetera, code name D.

1070
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,360
- [Captain] Yeah, yeah,
yeah, get on with it.

1071
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,279
You're in worse physical
shape each time you call.

1072
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,697
- It's a pretty
rough assignment,

1073
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,200
these earthlings play
serious hardball.

1074
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,117
- Hmm.

1075
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,536
Do you have a definite ID report

1076
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,912
or is this call a social one?

1077
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,413
- [D] It's a breakthrough!

1078
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,874
There's been danger, but
I've solved the case!

1079
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,293
- [First Officer]
Data coming in!

1080
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,545
- [Captain] Put
it on the monitor.

1081
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,921
- [First Officer]
Right, Captain.

1082
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,297
- [D] The technical
quality of these pictures

1083
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,049
may not be up to
my usual standard,

1084
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,677
but they were obtained in
extremely difficult conditions.

1085
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,470
The speed of the
subjects approach

1086
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,598
on each individual
sighting finally burned out

1087
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,725
the auto-control
and necessitated

1088
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,394
a switch to manual recording.

1089
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,064
- [Captain] Hey, that's
a second-generation

1090
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,274
Nagota class ship.

1091
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,692
Brilliant results, D!

1092
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,027
- Thanks, I set the shutter
at A for long distance

1093
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,155
and aperture was 14
millimeters in strong light.

1094
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,283
- No doubt about it,
that's the princess!

1095
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,287
I'll get the Pilot
Star for this!

1096
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,456
I'm heading for Earth sector
now, proceed to phase two!

1097
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,293
- Right, Captain, count of
me to get things organized!

1098
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,794
(console beeping)

1099
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,045
- [Captain] This calls
for a little celebration.

1100
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,006
For 16 long years we've
searched the universe

1101
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,008
and at last we can return home!

1102
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,012
Damn, you can never find
a drink when you want one!

1103
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,474
I don't ask for a lot, just
a little drink now and then!

1104
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,518
(air rumbling)

1105
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,187
(alarm wailing)

1106
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,319
(technicians chattering)

1107
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,070
- [Shireikan] What do we got?

1108
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,697
- An object which
we can't identify

1109
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,657
has penetrated our
absolute defense sphere

1110
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,117
and the course it's
now on will bring it

1111
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,369
into collision with this
station in 40 seconds.

1112
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,787
- What?

1113
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,289
- [Tactical Officer]
Unidentified object carrying

1114
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,541
intelligent life for an
estimated fighting power

1115
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,918
above level 300.

1116
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,836
- Sound action
stations, condition red!

1117
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,087

units ready for take off!

1125
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,003
- Roger, Strike One.

1126
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:25,796
Sir?

1127
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,507
- Strike units take off.

1128
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,758

Command Center to Strike
One, launch all units.

take up attack formation E.

1134
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,325
All units, take up
attack formation E.

1135
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,535
- [Tactical Officer]
Target maintaining speed

1136
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,037
and has now penetrated
Sector Yellow Two.

1137
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,497
No change in target's course,

1138
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,375
which is calculated to
take it into Earth orbit.

1139
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,711
All strike units
intercept and disable.

1140
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,045

surprise attack, Captain!

synclonic deflectors!

1146
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,901

The enemy is from the

1147
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,986
third planet, Captain!

1148
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,322
- That's where our lost
princess is being held.

1149
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,701
How appalling to have to endure
their unrefined appetites,

1150
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,494
but chin up, princess,
we'll rescue you,

1151
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,456
but first I could use
a couple of drinks.

1152
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,292
If we take any more Earth
missiles, strike back at them.

1153
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,252
Let the puny Earthlings
oppose our power

1154
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,087
and I'll show no mercy!

1155

(console beeping)

1172

- [First Officer]
Captain, we've targeted

1173
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,700
the enemy's space station.

1174
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,285
- We don't have
time to negotiate

1175
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,704
in a civilized way, destroy it!

1176
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:08,125

(B-ko exclaiming)

1189
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,385
- [B-Ko] While I'm
wearing this suit,

1190
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,095
my reflexes are twice
as fast as yours!

1191
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,681
Get ready, A-ko, it's
curtains for you!

1192
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,391
(B-ko yelling)

1200
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,114
- [Teacher] Don't you
take the time to knock?

1201
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,657
- What the?

(A-ko crashing)
(A-ko grunting)

1214
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,520
Traditionally followed

(A-ko crashing)

1219

(explosion booming)

1222
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,042

(B-ko grunting)

1226
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,591
Hey, that's
tickling, cut it out!

1227
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,842
Overhead Throw!

1228
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,594
(A-ko yelping)

1229
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:29,182
(A-ko crashing)
(A-ko grunting)

1230
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,101
So, had enough yet
or would you enjoy

1231
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,811
a little bit more of the same?

1232
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,020
Okay, have it your way,

1233
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,397
this'll hurt you more
than it hurts me!

1234
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,024
(B-ko yelling)

1235
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,027

(both grunting)
(blows thudding)

1237
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,865
(A-ko screaming)
And now

1238
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,701
my Black Jacovini Lash!

1239
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,286
(A-ko grunting)

1240
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,162

1241
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,831
(A-ko yelping)

1242
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,707
Down, girl!

1243
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,666
(A-ko grunting)

1244
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,710
Down, I said!
(A-ko screaming)

1245
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,462
And again!
(A-ko screaming)

1246
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,672
(A-ko grunting)

1247
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,967
(blows thudding)
(B-ko grunting)

1248
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,971
(air whooshing)

1249
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,347
(A-ko yelling)

1250
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,515
(B-ko yelping)
(A-ko crashing)

1251
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,101
Fire!
(missiles whooshing)

1252
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,520
(explosions booming)

1253
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,272
(missiles whooshing)

1254
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,525
(explosions booming)

1255
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,027
(explosions booming)

1256
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,153
- [A-ko Voiceover] I've gotta
get her away from the school

1257
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,696
before it gets smashed up!

1258
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,949
- [B-Ko] (laughing) Surely
you're not running away, A-ko?

1259
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,284
- [Miss Ayumi] And so
the story concludes

1260
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,036
with the purple-backed
black piping shrike

1261
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,537
talking to the little red
idol in the temple at--

1262
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,498
- [C-Ko Voiceover] Oh,
where's A-ko got to?

1263
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,000
I covered for her at roll call,

1264
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,293
but if she doesn't
get here soon--

1265
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,419
- C-ko!
- What?

1266
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,712
I don't know where she is!

1267
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,880
- You weren't paying
attention again,

1268
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,757
which I'm beginning to
realize is quite normal,

1269
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,008
and as for A-ko and B-ko,

1270
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,052
they're gossiping
outside I imagine!

1271
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,262
(C-ko moaning)

1272
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,513
(A-ko screaming)
(loud crashing)

1273
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,515
- [C-ko] A-ko!

1274
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,267
- C-ko, stop, you silly girl!

1275
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,185
C-ko, come back!

1276
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,355
(C-ko panting)

1277
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,106
What's happened to
old-fashioned discipline?

1278
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,484
If you ask me, it's
parents who are to blame!

1279
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,860
(students groaning)

1280
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,111
(Miss Ayumi yelping)

1281
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,321
Girls, what's happened to you?

1282
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,739
Why are you wearing bandages?

1283
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,115
Come back here at once
(girls screaming)

1284
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,283
and tell me what's going--
(Mari crashing)

1285
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,661
(Mari yelling)
(Miss Ayumi yelping)

1286
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,704
- A-ko, A-ko!

1287
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,208
Hey!

1288
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,167
Are you still fighting?

1289
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,752
What's happened to you?

1290
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,880
(helicopter whirring)

1291
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,633
- Hi, C-ko!

1292
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,967
- [C-ko] Huh?

1293
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,178
- If you're looking
for A-ko, climb up here

1294
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,014
and you can get yourself
a bird's-eye view!

1295
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,099
- [C-ko] Well, I...

1296
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,768
(Mari grunting)

1297
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,979
- [Mari] Well?

1298
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,440
- [Asa] Are you
coming or aren't you?

1299
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,400
- [C-ko] Mm!

1300
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,734
(helicopter whirring)

1301

(explosions booming)

1302
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,032
- Hey, smoke!

1303
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,283
I'll bet that's the two of them

1304
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,284
still fighting it
out with each other!

1305
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,912
(explosion booming)

1306
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,913

(B-ko yelping)

1311
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,464
Akagiyama missiles!

1312
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,507
- [A-ko] Oh no, not again!

1313

(B-ko growling)

1317
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,187
- [Technician] Position
of delta two, tango six.

1318
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,355
- The alien craft still on

1319
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,773
the same course
towards Earth, sir.

1320
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,692
- Six minutes 'til
our interceptor units

1321
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,610
are in firing range.

1322
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,612

1323
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,282
(jets rumbling)

1324
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,702
- Alpha One to Command HQ,

1325
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,289
still no visual contact,
but I've got 'em on radar.

1326
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,918
Alpha One to all units:
10 degrees port 80,000

1327
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,004
and let's get a look at 'em, go!

1328
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,715
(jets whooshing)

1329
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:50,967

(grim electronic music)

1332
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,814
- Look at the sky!
- Wow!

1333
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,401
- Look at that!
- It's huge!

1334
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,862
- How big you think it is, eh?

1335
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,781
- I'd estimate it's
gotta be four miles long

1336
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,407
from bow through to stern.

1337

(tank crashing)

1374
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,871
- Why haven't you
been evacuated?

1375
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,706
We told everyone
to get out of town.

1376
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,041
That's the way to
safety, now get out!

1377
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,044
- A-ko, you can run

- No sign of her anywhere!

1386
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,272
- Those two oughta be down
in the city somewhere,

1387
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,358
judging by the chaos.

1388
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,651

is something strange

1389
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,152
going on down on the streets.

1390
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,196

tanks and stuff everywhere,

1391
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,864
but there ain't a whole
lotta people around.

1392
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,033
- Hey, I think I
see them over there,

1393
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,034
a couple of blocks down!

1394
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,285
- [C-ko] Where, where are they?

1395
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,538
- [Asa] Mari, pedal a
bit harder, can you?

- B-ko!
- A-ko!

1412
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,028
Hey, A-ko--
- Can you hear me?

1413
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,864
- Have you two settled
your argument yet or not?

1414
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,657
- Hey, C-ko, what are you up to?

1415
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,159
Come down!

1416
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,494
- I just thought you must be
exhausted after your fighting

1417
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,288
so I brought you something!

1418
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,706
Lunch!

1419
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,875
I made it myself, naturally,
especially for you!

1420
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:34,876
(A-ko groaning)

1421
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,377
- Anything but that!

1422
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:41,132
(ominous music)
(ship whooshing)

1423
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,717
Hey, look out!

1424
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:43,718
(Asa yelping)

1425
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,552
- Oh?

1426
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,847
(ship thudding)

1427
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:51,017
Ah, your lunch, A-ko,
it'll be ruined!

1428
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,604
(ship whooshing)

1429
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,438

1433
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,744
- [B-ko] A-ko, we
haven't finished yet!

1434
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:10,703
- What's wrong with you?

1435
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,622
You saw what happened up there!

1436
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,332
We can finish your
stupid fight later,

1437
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,375
right now we have more
important things to do.

1438
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,127
- [B-ko] Well, if
you put it like that.

1439
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,963
- We gotta rescue C-ko first
and then I'll deal with you.

1440
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,508
(fire crackling)

1441
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,843
- Well, just once,
I'll be the hero.

1442
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:26,677
Wait for me!

1443
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,598
(ship whooshing)

1444
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,725
- [C-ko] Take me back,

1445
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:33,976
let me outta here
you lousy kidnapper!

1446
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,270
- Don't be upset, you
won't come to harm!

1447
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,523
(C-ko wailing)

1448
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,732
Stop crying, Your Highness,

1449
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,943
we'll get you home
in two light-years.

1450
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,194
(C-ko wailing)
(D yelping)

1451
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,779
- I don't like this,
you're kidnappers!

1452
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,281
Take this old crate back
down to the ground right now!

1453
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,699
I'm gonna get shot, strangled--

1454
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,284
- Really, I'm not
that sort of person!

1455
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,328
All right, then,
here's the ship.

1456
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,622
- I'm too young to die!

1457
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,456
(C-ko wailing)

1458
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:58,042
(air rumbling)

1459
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:04,257

(B-ko whooshing)

1463
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,689
(energetic music)

1464
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,983
- [B-ko] I want to make it
clear this truce only lasts

1465
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,403
'til we get C-ko back,
is that understood?

1466
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:29,448
(jets and ships whooshing)

1467
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,534

(A-ko screaming)

1469
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,289
- A-ko!

1470
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,292
I wanted the pleasure of
finishing you off myself.

1471
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,962
Oh well, can't have everything!

1472
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,423
(A-ko screaming)

1473
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,883

(jets whooshing)

1476
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,264
- A little to the
side, I can't see!

1477
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,724
(A-ko yelping)

1478
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,310

(explosion booming)
(A-ko grunting)

1482
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,409
- Hold tight, I'll get you down!

1483
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,827
(explosion booming)
(pilot yelping)

1484

(A-ko grunting)

1485
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:17,788

(A-ko grunting)
(missiles whooshing)

(B-ko gasping)

1491
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,903
- Boy, that is big!

1492
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,697
Well, someone appreciates
that size does matter.

1493
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,867
(mothership whirring)

1494

(peaceful music)

1497
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,139
- Your Highness?

1498
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,768
Why aren't you pleased
that we searched

1499
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,561
16 years to find
you, Your Highness?

1500
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:24,855
Talk to us.

1501
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,281
- [First Officer] Captain?

1502
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,825
- Why do you interrupt me?

1503
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,201
- [First Officer] Sorry,
Captain, but you're wanted

1504
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,995
on the bridge immediately!

1505
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,079
- [Captain] On my way.

1506
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:48,004
(air rumbling)

1507
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,424

01:06:57,638 --> 01:07:00,641

1511
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:05,104
(lasers zapping)
(A-ko screaming)

1512
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,439
(A-ko grunting)

1513
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,734
- Drop Kick!
(soldiers yelping)

1514
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,361
(A-ko panting)

1515
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,863
Death ray machine!

1516
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,698
(A-ko yelping)
(lasers zapping)

1517

01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,000
(lasers thundering)

1521
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,669
(A-ko grunting)

1522
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,547
- [Captain] What is it, Spy-D?

1523
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,049
I was with the princess!

1524
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,010
- Forgive me, Captain, we
have rats on board the ship.

1525
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:36,886
- [Captain] Rats?

1526
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,429
Not rats!

1527
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,347
- [D] Yes, Captain, these
rats are Earthling friends

1528
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:42,850
of Her Highness who
found their way aboard.

1529
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,518
- [Captain] Exterminate them!

1530
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,020
- Count on me, Captain.

1531
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,190
With all the experience I had
on Earth, this'll be easy.

1532
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,567
(B-ko whooshing)
(lasers whooshing)

1533
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,277
(explosion booming)

1534
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,487
(lasers whooshing)
(B-ko yelping)

1535
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,698
(explosion booming)

1536
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:59,742
- What's that down there?

1537
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,537
(peaceful music)

1538
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:06,749
Why are her beautiful eyes
staring into space like that?

1539
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,502
(glass thudding)

1540
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,506
(glass thudding)

1541
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:27,019
(shots thundering)

1542
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,980
(glass shattering)

1543
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,566
C-ko?

1544
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,818
My God, she's dead!

1545
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,402
No, hypnotized!

1546
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,654
No, drugged!

1547
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,781
That's all right, then,
she'll come out of it.

1548
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,283
(C-ko moaning)

1549
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,034
Huh?

1550
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,622
- Oh dear, B-ko, I think
I've been in shock!

1551
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,457
- [B-ko] Oh, C-ko, did they use

1552
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,501
some terrible alien drug on you?

1553
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,379
- No, I tired myself
out whining and crying.

1554
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,089
- Ah.
(C-ko giggling)

1555
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,341
You poor thing, but now
let's get out of here.

1556
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,135
- Mm, is A-ko here?

1557
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,678
- She's somewhere
around, I guess,

1558
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,429
but she couldn't rescue
you, it took me to do it.

1559
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:04,265
(C-ko wailing)

1560
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,142
- I want A-ko!

1561
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,935
- Don't cry, C-ko, come on!

1562
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,688
- [B-ko Voiceover] How
are we gonna escape?

1563
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:14,275
I'd never make it the way I
came, poor C-ko'd be terrified.

1564
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,818
Maybe I can steal a plane?

1565
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:21,365
(door crashing)
(A-ko grunting)

1566
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:22,199
- Mm?

1567
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:29,456
(A-ko grunting)

1568
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:33,586
(blows thudding)
(A-ko grunting)

1569
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,629
(A-ko grunting)
(door thudding)

1570
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,257
(A-ko yelping)
(door crashing)

1571
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,843
(A-ko groaning)

1572
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,053
Mm?

1573
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,390
Yuck, I'm gonna be sick!

1574
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,269
This must be the ship's laundry!

1575
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:54,982
Wait a minute, they all
seem to be women things.

1576
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,192
(door chiming)

1577
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,528
(air whooshing)
(A-ko groaning)

1578
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,197
(A-ko panting)

1579
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,909
(A-ko yelping)
(elevator whirring)

1580
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,076
Some elevator!

1581
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:09,246
(electronic warbling)

1582
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:13,626
Huh?

1583
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:19,298
(A-ko gasping)
(sword whooshing)

1584
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:22,468
(A-ko screaming)

1585
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,845
- [D] Ah, you avoided
that with some skill!

1586
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,139
- Ha, that was dirty,
coming from behind!

1587
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,726
(pensive electronic music)

1588
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,270
- This is as far as you go,

1589
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,482
and the only way you
go a step further

1590
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,067
is across D's dead body.

1591
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:40,903
(D yelling)

1592
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:44,657
(D grunting)
(A-ko grunting)

1593
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,159
You really are a rat
scurrying around like that!

1594
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,161
Well, this is how
I deal with rats!

1595
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,412
(D grunting)

1596
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,123
- Some rats are
hard to deal with!

1597
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:57,586
My cheek!

1598
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,672
(D laughing)

1599
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:00,506
It's cut!

1600
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:05,177
(A-ko growling)

1601
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,387
How dare you!

1602
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:11,392
(A-ko yelling)
(D grunting)

1603
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:13,852
(D groaning)

1604
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,527
I'm not as easy to beat
as you seem to think.

1605
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,904
(D groaning)

1606
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,283
(D yelling)

1607
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,620
- I haven't got enough
breath left, B-ko!

1608
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,163
Unless we rest, I
might start whining,

1609
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,040
I've got enough
breath left for that!

1610
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,501
- Look, it's her!

1611
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,837
(B-ko grunting)
(C-ko yelping)

1612
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:43,966
(B-ko grunting)
(blows thudding)

1613
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,260
- [B-ko] Okay, we've
gotta find a way out!

1614
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,803
These tunnels are endless.

1615
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,138
(A-ko yelling)
(swords clanging)

1616
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,515
(D growling)

1617
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:59,648
(both grunting)
(swords clashing)

1618
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,527
(both groaning)

1619
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:12,036
(swords clashing)
(A-ko yelling)

1620
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,457
(A-ko yelping)

1621
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:21,462
(D grunting)

(swords clanging)

1623
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:27,843
(sword shattering)
(shield shattering)

1624
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,303
(A-ko panting)

1625
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,679
(shield clattering)

1626
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,513
- [D] Oh.

1627
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:35,934
(D growling)

1628
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,145
(D grunting)

1629
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,731
(A-ko yelling)

1630
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,692
(door crashing)
(D yelping)

1631
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:44,860
- Holy mother!

1632
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,362
- You've got my friend!

1633
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,947
Tell your men to bring
her up here quick smart!

1634
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:49,865
- [Captain] What men?

1635
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,201
And did you say your friend?

1636
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,703
That child is the fourth
princess of the fifth queen

1637
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,289
of the Lepton Kingdom
of Alpha Cygni!

1638
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,707
- I do believe
that you're drunk!

1639
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:01,001
Listen, I've had enough
bull from you guys.

1640
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,753
- Obviously there's
no point in trying

1641
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,922
to negotiate with you
in a civilized way.

1642
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,257
(Captain screaming)

1643
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:08,717
- What's wrong?

1644
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,344
- [Captain] On the console,
quickly, gotta have a drink!

1645
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,762
- Huh?

1646
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,347
(growling) Look, I'm
starting to feel real mad!

1647
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,516
(Captain groaning)

1648
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,352
- If I don't get a
drink soon, I'll go mad!

1649
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,479
- [B-ko] Oh hell, this
doesn't look like the way out!

1650
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,856
- No, hey, A-ko!

1651
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:23,816
- C-ko, are you all right?

1652
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,734
- (yelping) Your Highness!

1653
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,445
- He's drunk, how repulsive!

1654
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:29,822
- A-ko!

1655
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,031
(C-ko yelping)

1656
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,658
- As for you, A-ko,
now I've rescued C-ko,

1657
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,828
I consider our truce at an end
and it's business as usual.

1658
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:36,787
(missiles whooshing)
(Captain yelping)

1659
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,581
(explosions booming)

1660
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,707
- That's dangerous!

1661
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:44,169
(intense music)

1662
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:45,671
- [A-ko] Let her go, B-ko!

1663
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,673
- Ah, A-ko, I'm so
pleased to see you!

1664
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,007
(D growling)

1665
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,008
- I'll kill her!

1666
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,468
(gun firing)

1667
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,846
- Stop firing, you fool,
or you'll hit Her Highness!

1668
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,890
(console booming)
(all screaming)

1669
01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:00,519
- Cut it out, stop I say,
you'll hurt somebody!

1670
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,521
And you, stay away
from those controls!

1671
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,856
(Captain screaming)

1672
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,400
D, calm down and
control yourself!

1673
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,944
Look, I'm sure we can
talk this through!

1674
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,362
D, anger's no use!

1675
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,613
(Captain sobbing)
(D growling)

1676
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,115
- [B-Ko] Okay, buster!

1677
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,825
(missiles whooshing)

1678
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:19,830
(explosions booming)
(Captain and D screaming)

1679
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,707
- All right!

1680
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,713
(minigun blasts thundering)

1681
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:28,630
- [Soldier] Not us!

1682
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,257
(explosion booming)

1683
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,550
- Oh!

1684
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,885
Oh boy, my head!

1685
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:36,513
Ah, take that, you dirty rat!

1686
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,850
(Captain laughing)
(minigun blasts thundering)

1687
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,561
(energy whooshing)

1688
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,272
Ah, ah, gotta get a drink!

1689
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,275
(explosion booming)

1690
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,696
(explosions booming)

1691
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:57,117
(alarm blaring)
- Wowee, we're out of control!

1692
01:14:57,117 --> 01:15:02,122
(energetic dramatic music)
(explosions booming)

1693
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,463
(explosion booming)

1694
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,177
- Nobody leaves here
unless the booze

1695
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,179
has been taken safely
off the ship first!

1696
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:20,349
(mothership rumbling)

1697
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,398
(technicians screaming)

1698
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:31,527
- Let us out!
- Everybody run!

1699
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,362
- Let me out!
- Let us outta here!

1700
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,615
(mothership rumbling)

1701
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,799
(soldiers screaming)

1702
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,843
(explosions booming)

(explosions booming)

1706
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:45,892
- \"Not only weeps the crow,
but also weeps the popinjay.\"

1707
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:50,272
(loud crashing)
(students screaming)

1708
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,859
(Miss Ayumi panting)

1709
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,193
(Miss Ayumi yelping)

1710
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,404
(A-ko laughing)

1711
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,156
- Sorry we're late again!

1712
01:16:59,156 --> 01:16:59,990
- Hi, Miss!

1713
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,284
We've got back!

1714
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,538
What happened was that these
women from outer space,

1715
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,665
who look like men, said
I was their princess

1716
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:10,542
and they kidnapped me
and they were going

1717
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,294
to take me back to their planet!

1718
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,087
But before they could get away,

1719
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,756
A-ko got onto the
ship to rescue me!

1720
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:18,550
And the Captain was drunk,
which wasn't very nice,

1721
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,719
and that's probably
why the ship crashed!

1722
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,180
And I cried a bit, which
drove everyone nuts!

1723
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,473
But luckily, they weren't...

1724
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,976
(gentle electronic music)

1725
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:38,904
(alarm ringing)

1726
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:43,700
(A-ko groaning)

1727
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,036
- Just another five minutes!

1728
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,748
(A-ko thudding)
(A-ko yelping)

1729
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,334
(A-ko yawning)

1730
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,756
(A-ko groaning)

1731
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,685
(A-ko chomping)

1732
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,311
I'm ready for a change!

1733
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,479
(doorbell ringing)

1734
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,648
- [C-ko] A-ko, time to go!

1735
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,612
(footsteps thundering)

1736
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:22,197
- Bye!

1737
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,573
Hiya, C-ko!
- Ready to go?

1738
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:25,200
- [A-ko] Naturally!

1739
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:31,289
(C-ko giggling)

1740
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:32,124
- Whee!

1741
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:37,963
Mm!

1742
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,467
(upbeat electronic music)

1743
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:47,597
(debris clattering)

1744
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:00,861
- [Captain] Habit to support.

1745
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,070
- [D] Help, homeless alien.

1746
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,780
- [Captain] Expensive
habit to support.

1747
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,115
- [D] Help, homeless alien.

1748
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,408
- [Captain] Expensive
habit to support.

1749
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,702
* There's a vision
in your heart *

1750
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:12,122
* Only you can achieve

1751
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,292
* You can climb the
highest mountains *

1752
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,879
* If you only believe

1753
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,840
* If you try to do your best

1754
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,093
* Nothing stands in your way

1755
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,388
* So don't put off

deepest ocean *

1775
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:24,694

1776
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:27,697
* Now's the time
to shoot the moon *

1777
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:31,326

* You can be anything
you want to *

1779
