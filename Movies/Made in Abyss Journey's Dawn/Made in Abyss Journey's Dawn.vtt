[Narrator] <i>1,900 Years ago,</i>

00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:58.870
<i>a massive pit was discovered</i>
<i>on a remote island</i>

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.043
<i>in the southern</i>
<i>sea of Beoluska.</i>

00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:07.454
[dramatic orchestral music]

00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:11.962
<i>This mysterious formation</i>
<i>had a captivating power to it.</i>

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:19.678
<i>It is home to dangerous, yet</i>
<i>valuable primeval creatures,</i>

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.822
<i>and mysterious relics that</i>
<i>are beyond comprehension.</i>

00:01:26.992 --> 00:01:29.731
<i>These relics have</i>
<i>enticed adventurers</i>

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:31.836
<i>looking to strike it rich.</i>

00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.257
[dramatic orchestral music]

00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:49.238
<i>In time, it gave rise to</i>
<i>the giant city of Orth,</i>

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.744
<i>but to this day,</i>

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:56.385
<i>no one has ever</i>
<i>seen the bottom.</i>

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.293
<i>Over the span of many years,</i>

00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:03.032
<i>with a spirit of</i>
<i>adventure for the unknown,</i>

00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:05.737
<i>and with legends</i>
<i>luring them in,</i>

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:08.743
<i>many people have come</i>
<i>to meet their fate,</i>

00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:12.651
<i>swallowed up by the</i>
<i>chasm's beckoning call,</i>

00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.258

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:35.029
[birds calling]

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:45.917
[man] Did that belong to
those people from yesterday?

00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:49.558
[woman] Yeah, from that
foreign cave raider squad.

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:50.927
And you know, some of
those ruffians

00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:52.864
didn't even have whistles.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.403
It's all very exciting.

00:02:55.503 --> 00:02:58.109
Here you go,
in moderation please.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.943
Hm.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.982
[heavy footsteps]

00:03:05.223 --> 00:03:06.058
Ah!

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:07.894
Oh, certainly.

00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:11.402
[distant voice]
Unmovable Sovereign!

00:03:11.502 --> 00:03:13.239
Come take a look at this!

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.685
I guess it wasn't to her
liking then.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:21.689
-[woman] Uh, no.
-Huh?

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.059
[woman] I'd say by
the look on her face,

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.695
she wanted another helping.

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:25.730
[man] You can see that?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.267
[woman] Sure can.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.013
Torka, your cooking
is absolutely the best.

00:03:35.283 --> 00:03:36.986
[Torka] Our
destination is beyond

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:39.591
the garden of the flowers
of fortitude, right?

00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:43.132
[woman] Yes, it is truly
beautiful there.

00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:45.770
I really want you to see it.

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:48.342
And also,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.749
I want you to see it too.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.926
Well,

00:03:57.027 --> 00:04:02.037
maybe you'll be eager enough
to see it with your own eyes.

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:06.312
[dramatic orchestral music]

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:14.928
[birds cawing]

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:16.498
[Riko] Come on, Nat!

00:04:16.598 --> 00:04:18.035
Why are you following me?

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:19.571
[Nat] Whatever, Riko.

00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:20.640
You know I'm responsible

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.344
for the area above yours.

00:04:22.444 --> 00:04:23.512
Oh, yeah.

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:25.383
I keep forgetting.

00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:32.330
Well, you can at least help me
carry the relics back, then.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.699
Why should I?

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:35.803
'Cause it's important.

00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:38.109
I need my haul to receive
the highest valuation out

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:39.745
of all the red whistles today.

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:41.815
Doubt that's going to happen.

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.254
[Nat] This area's already
been searched.

00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:47.127
There's not going to be
anything of value left to find.

00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:49.498
That's why it's going
to come down to quantity.

00:04:49.598 --> 00:04:51.502
And you're okay with that?

00:04:51.602 --> 00:04:53.439
Mm-hmm.
[giggle]

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.045
How about fudging the
numbers with that thing

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:57.747
you swiped the other day?

00:04:57.847 --> 00:04:58.716
The Star Compass?

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:00.186
I can't do that.

00:05:00.286 --> 00:05:02.557
I mean, it's whole purpose
is to guide its user

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:04.127
towards the truth of the Abyss.

00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:06.799
Besides, if they find
out I was hiding it

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.504
I'll get it worse than
being strung up naked.

00:05:09.604 --> 00:05:10.740
[crying]

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.911
Do you realize how
traumatizing that is?

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:14.781
We'll just have to be careful.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:17.921
[metal clanging]

00:05:19.224 --> 00:05:22.397
I'm really going to go all
out on my excavating today.

00:05:22.497 --> 00:05:23.833
[grunting]

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:25.303
I'll get so much stuff,

00:05:25.403 --> 00:05:29.478
Leader will be at
a loss for words!

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.652
[panting] All right.

00:05:33.753 --> 00:05:36.358
Let's do this.
I'll get first assessment.

00:05:39.064 --> 00:05:42.337
[grunting] There's one!

00:05:42.837 --> 00:05:44.441
Oh. [giggle]

00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:45.610
And two!

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:47.881
[hollow echo]

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:51.221
-[screeching]
-And three.

00:05:51.722 --> 00:05:53.359
And four.

00:05:54.428 --> 00:05:57.267
I can do it if I
just try really hard.

00:05:58.302 --> 00:05:59.871
At this rate, it's
only a matter of time

00:05:59.971 --> 00:06:02.377
until I'm bumped up to
the 600-meter group.

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:04.881
[grunting]

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.257
Hey, Nat, help me out, will you?

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.697
[grunting] So heavy.

00:06:12.797 --> 00:06:15.001
Where'd he run off to?

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.109
Dangit, Nat.

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:20.747
[grunting] [gasp]

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:23.052

00:06:24.554 --> 00:06:26.892
Crimson splitjaw?

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:29.364
What's it doing this far up?

00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:32.237
[growling]

00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:34.775
Oh, no.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.781
Is that-- is that blood?

00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:40.620
[gasp] What should I do?

00:06:40.987 --> 00:06:42.157
No.

00:06:42.257 --> 00:06:44.261
Nat's going to be eaten alive.

00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.530
[roaring]

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.634

00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:53.345
Huh? Ah!

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.420
[grunting]

00:06:59.424 --> 00:07:00.760

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.530
[thud]

00:07:04.768 --> 00:07:07.005
My arm. Is it broken?

00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:08.108
It's fine?

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:10.546
-[growling]
-[whimpering]

00:07:11.415 --> 00:07:13.017

-Ah!

[screaming]

00:07:33.058 --> 00:07:34.027
Ah!

00:07:34.127 --> 00:07:36.698
[panting] Ah!

00:07:45.283 --> 00:07:47.453
-[roaring]
-[screaming]

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:51.028

00:08:04.988 --> 00:08:07.126
[distant roaring]

00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:13.405
[grunting]

00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:19.718
Whoa.

00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:21.622
The petrified trees are melted.

00:08:21.722 --> 00:08:26.098
I think somebody may
have just saved me.

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:32.510
Uh.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.416
Ah! That's so beautiful!

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:36.585
Ah?

00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:41.295
[panting]

00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:53.886
[powering down]

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:55.990
[grunting]

00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:58.395
Uh, excuse me, there.

00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.570
He's-- he's not breathing!
He needs some help!

00:09:03.138 --> 00:09:06.478
[grunting] Huh?

00:09:12.022 --> 00:09:12.790
[squishy sounds]

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.160
Ah!

00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:16.765
He feels really weird.

00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:18.969
Huh?

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.108
How cool! He's not human!

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:22.777
A machine?

00:09:22.877 --> 00:09:25.216
Ah! This is kind of huge!

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:26.652
I've never seen this.

00:09:26.752 --> 00:09:28.689
He still feels warm.

00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:30.726
He must have just
stopped moving.

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:32.730
[wind blowing]

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:44.154
But I have to wonder where
did this boy come from?

00:10:01.488 --> 00:10:04.469
[birds tweeting, wood creaking]

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:09.172
[bell chiming]

00:10:09.273 --> 00:10:10.976
Good work out there yesterday.

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:13.247
You didn't manage to
excavate all that much.

00:10:13.348 --> 00:10:16.554
But for most of you, it was
the first time working solo.

00:10:16.654 --> 00:10:18.291
So that's to be expected.

00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:20.160
For next week,
I'll have you set up

00:10:20.262 --> 00:10:23.468
at the same site 100 meters
down to continue your work.

00:10:23.568 --> 00:10:25.572
Those who have lost
their equipment

00:10:25.672 --> 00:10:27.276
can file with General Affairs.

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:28.778
That should be it.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.180
Huh?

00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:33.388
And now, class, a word
from the director.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.094
There is just one thing
I would like to say.

00:10:37.194 --> 00:10:39.700
It's important that you realize
your possession of a whistle

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.606
is based on being a
student of the orphanage.

00:10:42.706 --> 00:10:45.312
You must strive to work
hard so as not to shame

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:47.516
your parents who fell so nobly.

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:49.085
Ah, and one more thing.

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:51.324
-[Shiggy] <i>That's two things.</i>
-[Nat] <i>That's two things.</i>

00:10:51.424 --> 00:10:55.298
Keeping any found relics
for yourself is forbidden.

00:10:55.398 --> 00:10:58.404
[whimpering]

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:00.842
<i>Is she looking at me?</i>

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:04.048
Relics provide valuable
income to the orphanage.

00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:07.254
So selfishly holding on to
any of them is inexcusable.

00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:08.658
[whimpering]

00:11:08.758 --> 00:11:10.562
I don't want to hear any
complaints about this.

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:12.499
<i>She totally knows it was me.</i>

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:15.438
Next time, punishment will
be far more than severe.

00:11:15.538 --> 00:11:17.108
Do keep that in mind.

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:18.076
That is all.

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:19.680
[Leader] Dismissed.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.116
<i>She doesn't know.</i>

00:11:21.216 --> 00:11:23.020
<i>I'm safe for now.</i>

00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:25.392
[Riko] Okay, how's that?

00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:26.394
[Shiggy] I think he moved.

00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:27.663
Really?

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:29.198
[boy] <i>What is that?</i>
<i>Is someone there?</i>

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.769
[electrical noise]

00:11:30.869 --> 00:11:32.272
Maybe we should try turning
up the power a little bit.

00:11:32.372 --> 00:11:33.608
<i>Are those children's voices?</i>

00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:35.478
Yeah, very good.
Set the dial to 2.

00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:37.014
I'm on it.

00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:39.286
<i>No matter.</i>

00:11:39.386 --> 00:11:41.056
<i>I'll sleep a bit longer.</i>

00:11:41.156 --> 00:11:42.426
Done here!

00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:45.465
[Riko] Shiggy, can
I press it now?

00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:48.738
-Riko, you set it to 20.
-Huh?

00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:51.477
[screaming]

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:56.219
[gasping]

00:11:59.626 --> 00:12:00.996
He's awake!

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.233
[cheering]

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.239
Oh, yeah.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.776
You see? I was right.

00:12:07.876 --> 00:12:09.413
I told you that electricity
would do the trick.

00:12:09.513 --> 00:12:11.884
Says the one feeding
him hot coals earlier.

00:12:11.984 --> 00:12:12.552
[cough]

00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:14.055
Hey, Robot Boy.

00:12:14.155 --> 00:12:15.492
Do you recognize me?

00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:17.028
You saved my life the other day.

00:12:17.128 --> 00:12:20.034
How'd you attack that
splitjaw from so far away?

00:12:20.134 --> 00:12:22.539
Oh, but first tell
me what your name is.

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.476
[Nat] Whoa. Slow down, Riko.

00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:26.079
You're going to freak him out.

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:28.150
Ah, yeah. Right. I'm sorry.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.720
My name is Riko.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.261
Excuse me for replying to a
question with a question, but--

00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:35.732
Ah! He's talking to us!

00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:36.834
Cute!

00:12:36.934 --> 00:12:38.638
There's something I must ask.

00:12:38.738 --> 00:12:41.277
Huh? Sure.
Whatever. Anything.

00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:43.381
Tell me-- where are we?

00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:44.983
Oh, yeah.

00:12:45.084 --> 00:12:48.256
This is my very own private
room in Belchero Orphanage.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.299
[Reg] So what do you do in here?

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:53.868
[Riko] Huh?

00:12:53.968 --> 00:12:56.005
[Nat] Riko's room is actually
an old torture chamber.

00:12:56.106 --> 00:12:58.243
They moved her here 'cause
she's always up to no good.

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:01.951
We're training here at the
orphanage to be cave raiders.

00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:04.723
Well, we're still just
apprentices called Red Whistles.

00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:08.464
Hey, Robot Boy,
what do we call you?

00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:10.234
What kind of stuff can you do?

00:13:10.335 --> 00:13:12.138
And who made you anyway, huh?

00:13:12.238 --> 00:13:13.641
Oh.

00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:18.284
That question has been
on my mind for some time.

00:13:18.384 --> 00:13:19.420
Yeah?

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.559
You say that I'm a robot?

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:24.930
Huh? You're totally a robot!

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.869
Electricity made you move,
you, like, withstood fire,

00:13:27.969 --> 00:13:30.408
and there's not a
single scratch on you!

00:13:30.508 --> 00:13:31.811
Huh.

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:34.950
So you don't even remember
that you're a robot?

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.389
Maybe the shock earlier
messed with his brain.

00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:39.293
Hey! This is really bad,
you guys.

00:13:39.393 --> 00:13:42.299
All of the lights went out in
the whole entire orphanage.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:43.734
[surprised exclamations]

00:13:43.835 --> 00:13:46.340
I think we might have
overdone it by going up to 20.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.843
We got to hide him quick.

00:13:47.943 --> 00:13:49.713
Leader is going to be
heading straight over here.

00:13:49.813 --> 00:13:51.417
How does he know it was us?

00:13:51.517 --> 00:13:53.186
Probably 'cause it's always us.

00:13:53.287 --> 00:13:54.756
Can you stand?

00:13:54.857 --> 00:13:57.027
Suppose we've got
to get that off you.

00:13:57.662 --> 00:13:58.931
Here, Riko.

00:13:59.031 --> 00:14:01.169
[grunting]

00:14:02.104 --> 00:14:03.841
Try to distract him
as best you can.

00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:05.945
[Shiggy] I've got a bad
feeling about this.

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:08.351
[whimpering]

00:14:12.793 --> 00:14:14.128
Don't come out of there, okay?

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.300
We'll be in big
trouble if you do.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.502
-[Leader] Hey, Riko.
-[knocking]

00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:20.140
-Open up!
-Ah! Okay!

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.075
Coming!

00:14:21.176 --> 00:14:22.077
[clatter]

00:14:22.178 --> 00:14:23.013
[whimpering]

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.083
[panting]

00:14:28.858 --> 00:14:29.893
All right.

00:14:29.993 --> 00:14:31.597
What did you do this time?

00:14:31.697 --> 00:14:33.267
Huh? Nothing.

00:14:33.367 --> 00:14:34.837
What do you mean?

00:14:34.937 --> 00:14:37.208
But more importantly...

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:39.446
I just banged my foot.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.216
Caught it at a bad angle.

00:14:41.317 --> 00:14:42.452
It hurts really bad.

00:14:42.552 --> 00:14:43.821
I think it may be broken.

00:14:43.921 --> 00:14:45.391
Could you look at it for me?

00:14:45.492 --> 00:14:46.760
[whimpering]

00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:50.067
[screaming]

00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:52.672
Huh?

00:14:52.772 --> 00:14:54.643
So this must be
Shiggy's handiwork, huh?

00:14:54.743 --> 00:14:56.814
Let me guess, you have no idea.

00:14:57.749 --> 00:15:00.421
Riko, do you have
anything to tell me?

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.259
Please forgive me.

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:03.594
I won't do it again.

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.465
I know you're feeling
frustrated right now,

00:15:05.565 --> 00:15:07.402
given your last raid
was a failure.

00:15:07.502 --> 00:15:08.971
But that being said,

00:15:09.071 --> 00:15:11.277
there's simply
no sense in causing a blackout.

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.814
I mean, what's that
going to prove?

00:15:13.915 --> 00:15:16.487
Riko, you listening to me?

00:15:16.587 --> 00:15:18.291
Riko.

00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:20.093
[gasping]

00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:23.935
Before I hear your
blubbering explanation,

00:15:24.035 --> 00:15:26.105
I think I'll have you clean
up the entire orphanage

00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:28.076
and then write an
apology to everyone.

00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:29.746
[whimpering]

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:33.354
I-- I'm sorry!

00:15:33.454 --> 00:15:34.957
[door closes]

00:15:36.493 --> 00:15:37.963
I understand.

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:41.337
If I were to be found, then
it would cause some problems.

00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:47.782
<i>Okay. So I've got</i>
<i>an extendable arm.</i>

00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:51.790
<i>It's metal, and it's heavy.</i>

00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:54.329
<i>And I've got this helmet.</i>

00:15:55.197 --> 00:15:56.934
<i>That's kind of suspicious.</i>

00:15:57.034 --> 00:15:58.271
Hm.

00:16:00.408 --> 00:16:02.279
<i>What exactly am I?</i>

00:16:03.414 --> 00:16:04.816
<i>Hm.</i>

00:16:04.917 --> 00:16:08.424
<i>Is a robot really in</i>
<i>need of a belly button?</i>

00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:11.330
<i>Huh? And what's this thing for?</i>

00:16:12.164 --> 00:16:13.467
[screaming]

00:16:13.568 --> 00:16:15.137
Shh.

00:16:15.237 --> 00:16:18.578
[giggle] I snuck away
while Shiggy and the others

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:20.213
were getting busted.

00:16:20.315 --> 00:16:21.617
So what now?

00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:23.354
You getting dressed up
in front of the mirror?

00:16:23.454 --> 00:16:25.291
Oh, no. Not really.

00:16:25.391 --> 00:16:26.527
[Leader] Riko!

00:16:26.627 --> 00:16:27.729
Ah!

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:28.898
-Riko!
-Ah!

00:16:28.998 --> 00:16:30.602
-Oh, crud!
-Where'd you go?

00:16:30.702 --> 00:16:31.770
Oh, man.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.543
We need to get out
of here right now.

00:16:34.643 --> 00:16:36.280
Grab on to me. Come on.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.916
Quickly!

00:16:40.855 --> 00:16:43.361
[screaming]

00:16:44.596 --> 00:16:46.900
[laughter]

00:16:50.107 --> 00:16:53.246
Awesome! Well wasn't that handy?

00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:54.650
Aw, yeah!

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.420
So cool.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.023
[Leader]
Riko, where are you?

00:16:58.123 --> 00:16:59.493
[boy] Doesn't look like
things are going

00:16:59.593 --> 00:17:01.162
to calm down any time soon.

00:17:01.263 --> 00:17:02.432
Oh, right.

00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:04.469
There's something that
I'd like to show you, Reg.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:05.538
Who's Reg?

00:17:05.638 --> 00:17:06.840
That's your new name.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.678
Not having one is inconvenient.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:09.846
So that's what I'm calling you.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:10.848
You like it?

00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:12.419
I guess I don't mind.

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:13.788
How'd you come up with it?

00:17:13.888 --> 00:17:16.593
It was the name of a dog I had.

00:17:16.694 --> 00:17:18.229
<i>A dog?</i>

00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:19.366
[sigh]

00:17:19.466 --> 00:17:21.135
Come on, Reg. Hurry it up!

00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:22.772
Hmm.

00:17:22.872 --> 00:17:25.845
[music playing]

00:17:27.615 --> 00:17:30.521
[wood creaking]

00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:34.863
[sigh] We're here.

00:17:34.963 --> 00:17:37.034
[panting]

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:40.508
Well, it's just about time, Reg.

00:17:44.248 --> 00:17:46.854
[bright orchestral music]

00:18:02.652 --> 00:18:03.921
You see?

00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:06.059
This here is the city
where all of us live.

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:08.264
At the mouth of the great pit.

00:18:08.364 --> 00:18:10.601
I welcome you to
the city of Orth.

00:18:10.702 --> 00:18:12.237
Cool, huh?

00:18:12.338 --> 00:18:13.841
Whoa.

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:17.247
[music continues]

00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.963
The pit's huge.

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.869
Reg, have you really
forgotten all about the Abyss?

00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:29.539
The Abyss?

00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:31.075
This pit is called the Abyss.

00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:32.812
And that's exactly
where I found you.

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:34.783
You were down in
the great Abyss.

00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:37.054
Wait, what?

00:18:37.154 --> 00:18:39.058
Well I thought that maybe--

00:18:39.158 --> 00:18:40.762
maybe you might have
been from somewhere

00:18:40.862 --> 00:18:42.866
at the bottom, or something.

00:18:42.966 --> 00:18:44.269
I mean, that is,

00:18:44.369 --> 00:18:46.974
I've never seen any kind
of robot like you before.

00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:48.310
So that's go to be it, right?

00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:50.147
You came from the
bottom of the Abyss,

00:18:50.247 --> 00:18:52.385
which no one has ever seen.

00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:56.225
The Abyss.

00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:00.868
[Shiggy] When cave raiding
in the Abyss,

00:19:00.968 --> 00:19:03.173
it's the return that
presents a problem.

00:19:03.274 --> 00:19:05.445
The deeper you go, the
greater the physical toll

00:19:05.545 --> 00:19:08.384
becomes whenever you
try to head back home.

00:19:08.484 --> 00:19:12.325
At the first depth, you
experience mild dizziness.

00:19:12.425 --> 00:19:14.896
The second layer,
nausea, headaches,

00:19:14.996 --> 00:19:17.034
and numbness of the extremities.

00:19:17.134 --> 00:19:18.471
Jump to the fourth layer.

00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:21.577
Intense pain and bleeding
throughout the body.

00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:23.981
The sixth layer and below,
you start to experience

00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:27.322
the loss of your humanity,
or even death.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:32.532
And so, this
phenomenon, which is

00:19:32.632 --> 00:19:35.438
totally unavoidable for
any human cave raider,

00:19:35.538 --> 00:19:37.642
is known to us as the
Curse Of The Abyss.

00:19:37.742 --> 00:19:42.117
So, that means a robot should
be unaffected by the curse.

00:19:42.217 --> 00:19:46.125
Reg, must have come up from the
bottom of the Abyss, you know?

00:19:46.225 --> 00:19:48.297
If that's true, then
what did I come up

00:19:48.397 --> 00:19:50.133
here to try and accomplish?

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:52.572
That's what I wanted to
discuss with you all tonight.

00:19:52.672 --> 00:19:53.874
Oh, wow!

00:19:53.974 --> 00:19:55.678
Is that the Compilation
of Recorded Relics?

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:57.382
Recorded Relics?

00:19:57.482 --> 00:19:59.185
[Shiggy] It's a field guide
of all the major relics

00:19:59.286 --> 00:20:01.088
that have been found so far.

00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:03.260
Cool. It's the Unheard Bell!

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.665
A special-grade relic
that stops time.

00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:07.234
You see that, Reg?

00:20:07.335 --> 00:20:09.506
My mom is the one who actually
discovered that relic.

00:20:09.606 --> 00:20:11.042
<i>She's so close.</i>

00:20:11.142 --> 00:20:13.547
I have searched everywhere
inside this record of relics,

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:16.386
but there's nothing in it
that's anything like Reg here.

00:20:16.487 --> 00:20:18.858
So, Riko, fill us in
on what you've learned

00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:20.761
so far about Reg's features.

00:20:20.862 --> 00:20:22.332
Sure thing.

00:20:22.432 --> 00:20:25.136
Let's see, he seems
to be able to run

00:20:25.237 --> 00:20:27.475
on either food or electricity.

00:20:27.575 --> 00:20:30.681
He has the power to melt
petrified trees in an instant.

00:20:30.781 --> 00:20:33.954
He has smooth skin, despite
it being able to stop a blade.

00:20:34.054 --> 00:20:35.791
And fire wasn't able
to even burn his hair.

00:20:35.892 --> 00:20:37.060
<i>Fire?</i>

00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:39.266
Seems his vision and
hearing are perfect.

00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:41.803
And his arm can extend
to about 40 meters.

00:20:41.904 --> 00:20:43.139
Then there's
his metal parts.

00:20:43.239 --> 00:20:44.543
They're a sort
of flexible material,

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.078
which I couldn't even
pierce with a drill.

00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:47.515
<i>A drill?</i>

00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:49.519
He has a belly button,
but I couldn't really

00:20:49.619 --> 00:20:50.855
see inside his butt.

00:20:50.955 --> 00:20:53.727
I tried probing him with a
stick, but it broke off inside.

00:20:53.827 --> 00:20:55.163
[screams]

00:20:55.264 --> 00:20:57.067
And his penis doesn't
appear to be mechanical,

00:20:57.167 --> 00:20:58.437
it's more like a real one.

00:20:58.537 --> 00:21:01.843
Eh, okay, Riko,
that'll be enough.

00:21:01.944 --> 00:21:03.179
-[Reg whimpers]
-Yeah, sorry.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.451
We probably should have
stopped her sooner.

00:21:05.551 --> 00:21:07.221
[Shiggy] Aside from the second
half of the report,

00:21:07.322 --> 00:21:10.227
none of those features are
listed within the relic record.

00:21:10.328 --> 00:21:12.197
Though, they'd be above Grade 1.

00:21:12.298 --> 00:21:13.868
What do you mean?

00:21:13.968 --> 00:21:17.308
Reg's body is kind of like a
bundle of special-grade relics.

00:21:17.408 --> 00:21:20.146
In the history of the Abyss,
he might be the most valuable

00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:24.656
Yet, an Aubade, a supreme
treasure of the netherworld.

00:21:26.526 --> 00:21:28.096
Wow! So cool!

00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:30.434
Not even my mother was able
to find something like that.

00:21:30.534 --> 00:21:34.141
And if that's right, Reg
will certainly be taken away

00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:36.245
and his existence concealed.

00:21:36.346 --> 00:21:37.949
He might be dismantled.

00:21:38.049 --> 00:21:40.288
[Riko stutters] Uh, uh, uh.

00:21:40.388 --> 00:21:42.292
No!

00:21:42.392 --> 00:21:44.996
And to make matters worse,
our usual schedule

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:46.867
of classes and jobs
start up tomorrow.

00:21:46.967 --> 00:21:48.236
We're not going
to have the chance

00:21:48.337 --> 00:21:50.240
to be able to stay with
him during the day.

00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:52.177
Oh, that's not good.

00:21:52.278 --> 00:21:53.981
I'm just going to have
to try and keep him hidden

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:55.518
in my room all day.

00:21:55.618 --> 00:21:58.089
[Nat] Good luck with that,
even your dog was found out.

00:21:58.189 --> 00:22:00.995
In that case, I have an idea
I think just might work.

00:22:01.095 --> 00:22:02.966
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

00:22:03.066 --> 00:22:04.903
[music playing]

00:22:05.003 --> 00:22:09.312
I call it, the "Bring Together
Leader and Reg Strategy."

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:12.184
So, you want to be
a cave raider, huh?

00:22:12.285 --> 00:22:13.954
Where's all your family?

00:22:14.054 --> 00:22:15.256
I have no family.

00:22:15.358 --> 00:22:17.362
My big sister died,
so I came here.

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:20.200
I heard that if I work
here I can eventually

00:22:20.301 --> 00:22:21.837
become a cave raider.

00:22:21.937 --> 00:22:24.943
[Leader] You don't look like
you were born here in Orth.

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:26.947
My sister found me
about a year ago.

00:22:27.047 --> 00:22:30.621
I remember nothing before
that, due to an accident.

00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:34.194
After that, I began rag-picking
with her in the wharf quarter.

00:22:34.296 --> 00:22:36.466
That's in the Southern District.

00:22:36.566 --> 00:22:38.737
[Shiggy] Do you think
that backstory will work?

00:22:38.837 --> 00:22:40.240
Sounds good enough to me.

00:22:40.341 --> 00:22:43.046
I doubt that Leader's ever
been to the slums before.

00:22:43.146 --> 00:22:45.150
What's wrong with your hand?

00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:49.091
Oh, no!

00:22:49.191 --> 00:22:52.365
It's been like this for
as long as I can remember.

00:22:52.465 --> 00:22:55.671
An old man at the wharf said
it's foreign technology.

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:00.281
[Leader] Clench it for me.

00:23:01.683 --> 00:23:03.252
Hmm.

00:23:03.354 --> 00:23:05.624
Seems your grip
is strong enough.

00:23:05.725 --> 00:23:08.229
All right then, so
what's your name, kid?

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.033
Reg. It's Reg.

00:23:10.133 --> 00:23:11.903
-Yeah!
-He pulled it off.

00:23:12.004 --> 00:23:13.440
He really is an Aubade!

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.813
Oh, by the way, Reg, don't
suppose you know anything

00:23:16.913 --> 00:23:19.118
about the incident at the Edge
of the Abyss the other day...

00:23:19.218 --> 00:23:20.888
-...do you?
-[gasps]

00:23:20.988 --> 00:23:22.825
What incident do you mean?

00:23:23.594 --> 00:23:26.299
Oh, well, never mind then.

00:23:26.833 --> 00:23:28.370
Right, come on.

00:23:29.038 --> 00:23:30.775
[sighs in relief]

00:23:30.875 --> 00:23:32.845
All right, let's go.

00:23:32.945 --> 00:23:34.816
Hey, it went well, right?

00:23:34.916 --> 00:23:36.987
Woo-hoo!

00:23:37.087 --> 00:23:38.357
<i>[Reg] And just like that,</i>

00:23:38.457 --> 00:23:41.296
<i>I became a student</i>
<i>at Belchero Orphanage,</i>

00:23:41.396 --> 00:23:45.136
<i>setting my sights on</i>
<i>becoming a cave raider.</i>

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:47.575
[cheerful music playing]

00:23:59.332 --> 00:24:03.440
[music continues]

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.160
[Reg] <i>Two months went by</i>
<i>before I knew it.</i>

00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:33.500
<i>I'm surprised by how</i>
<i>well I'm fitting in here.</i>

00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:36.339
It's three days
until I go raiding

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.448
for the first time, which means
saying goodbye to this bell.

00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:42.819
You're lucky.

00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:46.259
Don't you worry, I probably
won't be getting any bigger,

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:48.096
but you'll keep on
growing and growing.

00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:49.399
I sure hope so.

00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:52.170
[running and panting]
Ah, there you are.

00:24:52.271 --> 00:24:53.907
-Welcome back.
-Hey, Riko.

00:24:54.007 --> 00:24:56.178
Word is that Habo's squad
is about to return home.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:58.617
Let's go and greet
them at the grand pier.

00:24:58.717 --> 00:25:00.855
Kiyui, it's dangerous there,
so you stay here.

00:25:00.955 --> 00:25:01.823
Yeah, okay.

00:25:01.923 --> 00:25:04.696
[chatter]

00:25:08.002 --> 00:25:09.004
[giggles]

00:25:09.104 --> 00:25:10.106
[panting and grunting]

00:25:10.206 --> 00:25:13.514
[crowd gasps and exclaims]

00:25:15.684 --> 00:25:17.722
[man] They're finally home!

00:25:22.197 --> 00:25:23.600
-Look, they're coming!
-[cheering]

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.404
-Here they are!
-Here they are!

00:25:25.504 --> 00:25:27.140
Ah! It's Habo!

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.144
Welcome back, Habo!

00:25:29.244 --> 00:25:30.948
[inaudible]

00:25:31.048 --> 00:25:32.718
[Riko] What's he doing?

00:25:32.819 --> 00:25:34.054
Is that a relic?

00:25:35.123 --> 00:25:36.225
[Reg] It's a whistle.

00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:37.728
A white whistle.

00:25:37.829 --> 00:25:39.299
Huh? A white whistle?

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:42.103
Hey, I know whose
white whistle that is.

00:25:42.204 --> 00:25:43.507
It's Lyza's!

00:25:43.607 --> 00:25:45.009
Lyza "The Annihilator!"

00:25:45.109 --> 00:25:46.111
Wait, for real?

00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:47.147
It's really hers?

00:25:47.247 --> 00:25:48.484
No way! Are you sure?

00:25:48.584 --> 00:25:51.656
Annihilator, what an
unsettling name to have.

00:25:51.756 --> 00:25:54.027
So, why's he just
have her whistle?

00:25:54.127 --> 00:25:56.399
What's that about, huh?

00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:58.904
Riko?

00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:02.478
But Lyza...

00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:05.851
That's my mother's name.

00:26:10.995 --> 00:26:15.003
It is the world's only remaining
unexplored chasm, the Abyss.

00:26:15.103 --> 00:26:18.744
And we, the cave raiders,
dare confront her depths.

00:26:18.844 --> 00:26:22.285
The apprentice Red Whistles,
the proficient Blue Whistles,

00:26:22.385 --> 00:26:24.322
Assistant Instructor
Moon Whistles,

00:26:24.422 --> 00:26:26.493
and expert Black Whistles.

00:26:26.593 --> 00:26:28.530
And, of course, there
are the masters,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.670
who have surpassed all
of our human limitations,

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.674
and challenged the Abyss.

00:26:33.774 --> 00:26:36.479
I give you the heroic
White Whistles!

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.915
[cheering]

00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:40.186
And now, the soul of the
greatest White Whistle

00:26:40.287 --> 00:26:45.063
of all time has at last returned
home, after more than 10 years!

00:26:55.718 --> 00:26:57.455
[uncomfortable sigh]

00:26:57.555 --> 00:27:00.361
Is it really okay for
me to keep this?

00:27:00.461 --> 00:27:01.730
Of course it is.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.634
Unlike other whistles,
that one can only

00:27:03.734 --> 00:27:05.838
be used by its original owner.

00:27:05.938 --> 00:27:08.944
Besides that, Lyza was carrying
a sealed document with her.

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:10.347
Huh?

00:27:10.447 --> 00:27:12.285
We received both it
and her white whistle

00:27:12.385 --> 00:27:14.322
from one of the sentries
at the Seeker Camp.

00:27:14.422 --> 00:27:16.526
However, right now
it's being examined.

00:27:16.626 --> 00:27:19.164
It might take some time
before it gets to you, Riko.

00:27:19.265 --> 00:27:23.205
Are you saying that, uh,
it's a letter from my mother?

00:27:23.307 --> 00:27:24.909
Oh.

00:27:25.009 --> 00:27:27.281
[laughter]

00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:28.317
Well, is it?

00:27:28.417 --> 00:27:30.688
Yeah, I suppose it is.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.395
It's a letter written
directly to you.

00:27:36.165 --> 00:27:37.668
[Leader] What are you doing
hiding back here?

00:27:37.768 --> 00:27:39.739
[startled screams]

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:40.908
Uh, hey.

00:27:41.008 --> 00:27:43.614
Look, this festival today
is meant to show just

00:27:43.714 --> 00:27:45.216
how great your mother was.

00:27:45.317 --> 00:27:47.220
And it's an important
day for you, too.

00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:48.824
You need to take it all in.

00:27:48.924 --> 00:27:51.463
And besides, Lyza
loved festivals.

00:27:51.563 --> 00:27:52.865
And, in a way, this
is her final one.

00:27:52.965 --> 00:27:57.040
So, uh, Jiruo, my mother
was once your instructor

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.410
at the Orphanage, wasn't she?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.485
Can you tell me what
kind of person she was?

00:28:02.585 --> 00:28:05.023
Other than her being one
of the White Whistles,

00:28:05.123 --> 00:28:07.728
I'm afraid I can't
even remember her face.

00:28:07.828 --> 00:28:11.703
Though, I'm not exactly sad
right this moment, I still--

00:28:11.803 --> 00:28:13.840
I still feel like
someone I aspire

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.045
to be has suddenly disappeared.

00:28:18.383 --> 00:28:21.389
When your mother left to go on
her last cave raiding descent,

00:28:21.489 --> 00:28:23.627
you were still just
barely a two-year-old, okay?

00:28:23.727 --> 00:28:25.731
I know you've heard
that as a cave raider

00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:27.969
she was every bit
the renowned White Whistle

00:28:28.069 --> 00:28:29.605
as all the legends say.

00:28:29.706 --> 00:28:31.776
But that being said,
personally I never

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:34.147
actually got the chance to
do any cave raiding with her.

00:28:34.247 --> 00:28:37.588
What I know of her is from
her time here on the surface.

00:28:37.688 --> 00:28:39.993
She was a heavy drinker and
got into a lot of fights.

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:42.965
And you could never really
tell how honest she was being.

00:28:44.602 --> 00:28:47.742
That mother of yours was
a real mess sometimes.

00:28:49.612 --> 00:28:51.048
How have your eyes been doing?

00:28:51.148 --> 00:28:52.017
Huh?

00:28:52.117 --> 00:28:53.687
Uh, they're just fine.

00:28:53.787 --> 00:28:55.256
As long as I'm
wearing my glasses,

00:28:55.357 --> 00:28:57.328
I don't get the headaches.

00:28:57.428 --> 00:28:59.966
You do understand
your eyesight is

00:29:00.066 --> 00:29:02.137
different than other
people's, right?

00:29:02.938 --> 00:29:04.676
Your vision itself is just fine.

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:06.346
There's nothing really wrong.

00:29:06.446 --> 00:29:07.682
And yet, you suffer
headaches when

00:29:07.782 --> 00:29:09.352
not looking through
crystal lenses,

00:29:09.452 --> 00:29:10.988
that's not a normal thing.

00:29:11.088 --> 00:29:15.229
The symptoms may be mysterious,
but their cause is quite clear.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.100
It's the Curse of the Abyss.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.570
[gasp]

00:29:19.037 --> 00:29:20.474
Huh?

00:29:20.574 --> 00:29:22.745
My bad eyesight isn't
from staying up late?

00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:24.716
Yeah, sorry, that was
just something we made up

00:29:24.816 --> 00:29:26.386
to get you to go to bed.

00:29:26.486 --> 00:29:28.557
Has it been 12 years?

00:29:28.657 --> 00:29:31.930
No. I think it was even
before that, wasn't it?

00:29:33.633 --> 00:29:35.871
Your mother had just
become pregnant with you.

00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.209
She was instructed to go
down to the fourth layer

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.545
with the survey team.

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:42.551
Uh, really? Why?

00:29:42.651 --> 00:29:45.156
She was ordered on
a mission, a mission

00:29:45.256 --> 00:29:49.332
to retrieve the Unheard Bell,
a special-grade relic

00:29:49.432 --> 00:29:51.636
discovered down in the deep.

00:29:51.736 --> 00:29:54.040
Their journey proved
difficult and it stretched on

00:29:54.141 --> 00:29:56.011
for over 10 months.

00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:58.583
They had repeated run-ins with
raiders from another country,

00:29:58.683 --> 00:30:01.322
nearly wiping out
the entire team.

00:30:01.423 --> 00:30:05.431
It was at that time your father,
a Black Whistle named Torka,

00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:06.933
lost his life.

00:30:08.035 --> 00:30:11.476
And in the midst of it all,
you were born.

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:14.114
Uh, oh, yeah?

00:30:14.214 --> 00:30:15.584
Yes.

00:30:15.684 --> 00:30:18.557
It is from within the far
reaches of the Abyss, Riko,

00:30:18.657 --> 00:30:19.892
that you were born.

00:30:19.992 --> 00:30:21.996
[gasp]

00:30:22.097 --> 00:30:25.971
So, um, does that mean
what I think it means?

00:30:26.071 --> 00:30:28.643
That I'm strong against
the Curse of the Abyss?

00:30:28.743 --> 00:30:30.514
Of course not, you idiot!

00:30:30.614 --> 00:30:32.150
Did you forget how
much you threw up

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.920
during your first cave raid?

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.123
Uh...

00:30:35.223 --> 00:30:37.628
Trying to make an ascent
up from the fourth layer

00:30:37.728 --> 00:30:39.866
is something unbearable,
even for adults.

00:30:39.966 --> 00:30:44.241
But then, if that's the case,
how did I make it back up alive?

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.980
Because of the
Curse-Repelling Vessel,

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.984
Lyza it took it along
with her on the journey.

00:30:49.084 --> 00:30:52.992
However, it was a dreadfully
heavy thing to carry.

00:30:53.092 --> 00:30:55.196
And the then-decimated
team no longer

00:30:55.297 --> 00:30:58.336
had the strength, nor hope,
to bring it home.

00:30:58.436 --> 00:30:59.705
[Riko] I still don't understand.

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:01.810
How did I get here then?

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:05.818
Lyza had no choice, she had
to abandon the Unheard Bell.

00:31:05.918 --> 00:31:08.690
Leaving behind the
corpses of her comrades,

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:12.130
she carried you, with the
help of one last squad member.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.335
Bringing home just one
special-grade relic

00:31:14.435 --> 00:31:18.276
is enough to enrich the city
and ensure a squad's future.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.054
And yet she didn't,
because she chose you.

00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:28.062
Prestige and riches, her
comrades and their trust,

00:31:28.162 --> 00:31:33.205
all of it, she was willing
to give it all up for you.

00:31:33.306 --> 00:31:36.913
You meant everything to her.

00:31:37.013 --> 00:31:39.919
Although, she did make use of
a relic, the Curse of the Abyss

00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:42.658
still could not be
warded off entirely.

00:31:42.758 --> 00:31:44.862
Your mother lamented
the fact she was

00:31:44.962 --> 00:31:46.733
unable to protect your eyes.

00:31:46.833 --> 00:31:49.672
Besides that, you grew
up extremely healthy.

00:31:49.772 --> 00:31:52.811
And in the face of having
a mother of such prominence,

00:31:52.912 --> 00:31:55.082
you still try to forge
your very own path.

00:31:55.183 --> 00:31:58.623
And thus, the one she
risked her life to protect

00:31:58.723 --> 00:32:00.961
is still going
strong to this day.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.967
Question is, with this life
you've been given,

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:07.240
the life that the
Legendary Lyza gave you,

00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:08.977
how will you use it?

00:32:12.918 --> 00:32:16.024
Thank you so much
for talking with me!

00:32:17.695 --> 00:32:19.932
[Leader] <i>It didn't take long</i>
<i>for Lyza to settle the score</i>

00:32:20.032 --> 00:32:21.903
<i>with the country that</i>
<i>caused her trouble.</i>

00:32:22.003 --> 00:32:24.842
<i>Then, she went back</i>
<i>and recovered the Bell.</i>

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:27.948
Yeah, some tales are
better left untold.

00:32:28.783 --> 00:32:31.623
[bells ringing]

00:32:31.723 --> 00:32:33.058
It's just up ahead.

00:32:33.158 --> 00:32:35.731
I shall accompany
you as an observer.

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.080
[door creaking closed]

00:32:53.032 --> 00:32:55.470
Please refrain from
touching anything.

00:32:56.773 --> 00:32:58.343
<i>What is all this?</i>

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:01.482
<i>I know my mother went</i>
<i>down there 10 years ago.</i>

00:33:01.583 --> 00:33:04.655
<i>Yet, none of these findings</i>
<i>are listed in the Field Guide.</i>

00:33:04.755 --> 00:33:07.928
<i>I've never seen any</i>
<i>of these before.</i>

00:33:12.003 --> 00:33:15.176
What's the matter, Riko?
Is it the letter?

00:33:17.982 --> 00:33:20.921
-That looks like--
-Yeah.

00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:24.662
Some parts are different
here and there, but this is--

00:33:24.762 --> 00:33:28.803
Riko, there's a piece of paper
here with just writing on it.

00:33:28.903 --> 00:33:32.010
[Riko] If it's a letter,
it's a pretty short one.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.715
Hey, uh, shine a
light on it for me.

00:33:34.815 --> 00:33:38.188
Oh, um, all right then.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.725
Let's see here.

00:33:39.825 --> 00:33:44.100
"At the netherworld's...
the bottom...

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.914
waiting..."

00:33:52.451 --> 00:33:55.122
[Shiggy] "At the netherworld's
bottom, I'll be waiting."

00:33:55.222 --> 00:33:57.193
What made you decide
to swipe this, Riko?

00:33:57.294 --> 00:33:59.765
Because it's a letter that
my own mother wrote to me, so

00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:02.136
I think that gives me
permission to swipe it.

00:34:02.236 --> 00:34:04.308
[Nat] So you're serious
about going, then?

00:34:04.408 --> 00:34:05.544
Mhm.

00:34:05.644 --> 00:34:07.146
And I'm going to
need all your help.

00:34:07.246 --> 00:34:09.352
My mother is waiting for me.

00:34:09.452 --> 00:34:12.090
[Shiggy] What's your plan once
you get past the Seeker camp?

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.660
I'll head for the
bottom of the Abyss

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.330
where my mom will
be waiting, duh.

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.200
I'll find the route
along the way.

00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:19.070
[grunt]

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.874
What's the matter with you, Nat?

00:34:20.974 --> 00:34:22.678
I'm totally against this.

00:34:22.778 --> 00:34:24.247
The bottom of the Abyss?

00:34:24.348 --> 00:34:27.588
You talk about it like it's no
big deal, but if you go there,

00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:29.592
you can never come back!

00:34:29.692 --> 00:34:31.161
What's this all of a sudden?

00:34:31.262 --> 00:34:33.533
You know I've always wanted
to be a White Whistle,

00:34:33.633 --> 00:34:35.437
so I've already
prepared for that.

00:34:35.537 --> 00:34:37.274
No. You don't get it, Riko!

00:34:37.374 --> 00:34:39.879
You'll never be able to come
up here and see any of us

00:34:39.979 --> 00:34:40.814
ever again.

00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:42.451
[groaning]

00:34:42.551 --> 00:34:44.054
Yeah, that's right!

00:34:44.154 --> 00:34:46.492
[Nat] You won't get to hang
out at Auntie's or attend

00:34:46.592 --> 00:34:49.699
Jiruo's lessons or play with
any of us out in the yard.

00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:51.969
-It'll all be over.
-I know that!

00:34:53.105 --> 00:34:56.913
Like I said, I already
know all of that, okay?

00:34:57.013 --> 00:34:59.819
What-- what are
you crying about?

00:34:59.919 --> 00:35:02.658
Well, you're crying
too, you dummy!

00:35:02.758 --> 00:35:05.630
[Shiggy] Can we just call it a
night and get some rest please?

00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:09.305
Since tomorrow is Reg's first
cave raid and everything?

00:35:09.405 --> 00:35:11.943
-Ready to go.
-[fighting continues]

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:13.446
[Riko] Shut up, already!

00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:17.354
[Reg] <i>At the nether world's</i>
<i>bottom, I'll be waiting.</i>

00:35:17.454 --> 00:35:19.057
[Nat] Hey, Reg?

00:35:19.157 --> 00:35:20.460
Reg!

00:35:21.061 --> 00:35:22.096
What is it?

00:35:22.196 --> 00:35:23.600
If you keep digging up
the grass,

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.437
all you're going
to find are bugs.

00:35:25.537 --> 00:35:29.110
If you're set on digging, try
that flat spot over there.

00:35:31.382 --> 00:35:32.384
This?

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.592
Whoa.

00:35:36.692 --> 00:35:37.961
Huh?

00:35:38.062 --> 00:35:39.932
Looks like there's
something under here.

00:35:40.032 --> 00:35:40.967
Hey, uh, Nat?

00:35:41.068 --> 00:35:42.638
What's this thing?

00:35:42.738 --> 00:35:44.575
It's all round and
feels real squishy.

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:48.983
Oh, uh, that thing's also
a relic of the Abyss.

00:35:49.084 --> 00:35:51.254
Not sure exactly what, though.

00:35:51.355 --> 00:35:53.993
It has amazing force
holding it together.

00:35:54.094 --> 00:35:57.367
Could it be that this is
possibly a special-grade relic?

00:35:57.468 --> 00:35:58.837
No, man.

00:35:58.937 --> 00:36:00.807
You're not going to find
anything but just junk

00:36:00.907 --> 00:36:01.909
around here.

00:36:02.009 --> 00:36:03.279
-[slam]
-Huh?

00:36:03.379 --> 00:36:06.118
To say that this is
junk is irredeemable.

00:36:06.218 --> 00:36:08.389
But wait a second, if
this is considered junk,

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.861
does that mean
it's okay to keep it?

00:36:10.961 --> 00:36:12.096
No, don't do that.

00:36:12.196 --> 00:36:14.000
They'll string you up.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.704
Even junk can sell
for good money

00:36:15.804 --> 00:36:17.908
over in the foreign countries.

00:36:18.008 --> 00:36:19.712
Being an apprentice
is pretty tough, huh?

00:36:19.812 --> 00:36:20.647
Hmm.

00:36:20.747 --> 00:36:21.816
Oh, look.

00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:24.187
I think I see
something back there.

00:36:27.995 --> 00:36:29.565
This is incredible.

00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:31.702
There's no way to these
little squishy things.

00:36:31.803 --> 00:36:33.071
Oh, yeah?

00:36:33.172 --> 00:36:35.042
Well, then you just
leave the rest to me.

00:36:35.142 --> 00:36:36.412
There's still more in here.

00:36:36.512 --> 00:36:37.848
Oh?

00:36:37.948 --> 00:36:39.451
[loud crash]

00:36:39.552 --> 00:36:41.154
Ah!

00:36:41.254 --> 00:36:44.160
Oh my god, there's
something else in there!

00:36:45.297 --> 00:36:48.736
Oh, that's the skeleton
of someone in prayer.

00:36:48.837 --> 00:36:51.041
Those remains are
2,000 years old,

00:36:51.141 --> 00:36:53.379
and all are posed the same way.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.281
Oh.

00:36:54.381 --> 00:36:55.784
I wouldn't think
you'd freak out,

00:36:55.884 --> 00:36:58.623
seeing as how you're
a robot and all.

00:36:58.723 --> 00:37:00.260
Say, that reminds me.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.399
Have you ever heard about
the birthday disease?

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.173
Children who have been eagerly
awaiting their birthdays,

00:37:07.274 --> 00:37:11.114
they are suspiciously dying
whenever the day arrives.

00:37:11.214 --> 00:37:13.520
The causes of their
death can vary,

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.059
but nonetheless, all of them
have still just dropped dead.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.130
The story goes if you look
at a mirror

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.467
the morning of your birthday,

00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:22.971
your reflection
will have a twisted neck.

00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:25.777
And once you get a glimpse
of your twisted neck...

00:37:25.877 --> 00:37:28.449
I don't believe in
that kind of stuff!

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.921
You're so spooked that you're
totally dripping with sweat!

00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:31.889
[Nat laughs]

00:37:31.989 --> 00:37:33.359
Okay.

00:37:33.459 --> 00:37:35.864
Well, there is still one
thing I want to believe in.

00:37:35.964 --> 00:37:37.534
Huh?

00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:43.880
That answers are at the
bottom of the nether world.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.216
That's what I believe.

00:37:45.317 --> 00:37:47.253
The true nature of
these relics,

00:37:47.354 --> 00:37:49.458
the cause of the
Curse of the Abyss,

00:37:49.558 --> 00:37:52.664
perhaps even the meaning
behind my creation,

00:37:52.764 --> 00:37:54.568
or the reason I came here.

00:37:55.637 --> 00:37:56.906
It's possible, right?

00:37:57.006 --> 00:37:58.643
That I'll find some
answers if I just

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.881
reach the bottom of the Abyss?

00:38:00.981 --> 00:38:03.085
Well, that's the feeling I get.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.490
What, you too?

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.059
You're both crazy.

00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:11.402
Like I said before, I'm
against you going, okay?

00:38:11.502 --> 00:38:12.771
It's ridiculous!

00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:16.312
I mean, you're both just Red
Whistles, and she's only 12!

00:38:16.412 --> 00:38:18.850
I know, but Nat--

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:20.252
Forget it.

00:38:20.353 --> 00:38:22.391
You know how I feel.

00:38:28.068 --> 00:38:31.776
So then have you decided which
day you're going to set off?

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:34.949
I'm going to be heading out
tomorrow just before daybreak.

00:38:35.049 --> 00:38:36.251
Huh?

00:38:36.352 --> 00:38:38.255
I've already packed
up my things.

00:38:38.356 --> 00:38:40.427
[Shiggy] You aren't
wasting any time.

00:38:40.527 --> 00:38:44.268
Okay, so how exactly do you plan
on slipping into the Abyss?

00:38:44.368 --> 00:38:46.539
They have guards keeping
watch all the time.

00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:48.041
Not sure yet.

00:38:48.141 --> 00:38:49.912
[Reg] I'll use my arms
to lower you down.

00:38:50.012 --> 00:38:51.382
[others] Huh?

00:38:51.482 --> 00:38:52.584
Riko.

00:38:52.684 --> 00:38:55.222
I am going down with you,
down to the netherworld.

00:38:55.323 --> 00:38:58.529
Ah! Really?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.734
I thought for sure you would
be one of the people trying

00:39:00.834 --> 00:39:02.304
to stop her.

00:39:02.404 --> 00:39:05.277
I bet Riko somehow convinced
you into going, didn't she?

00:39:05.377 --> 00:39:06.279
What?

00:39:06.379 --> 00:39:07.814
Riko didn't say a
single thing to try

00:39:07.914 --> 00:39:09.183
to get me to go with her.

00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:10.687
I decided myself.

00:39:10.787 --> 00:39:13.693
I want to go down there to
find out what I am, all right?

00:39:14.862 --> 00:39:16.666
Oh, Reg.

00:39:16.766 --> 00:39:18.536
Thank you!

00:39:18.636 --> 00:39:21.409
I couldn't bring myself
to actually say anything!

00:39:21.509 --> 00:39:24.448
I'm going to meet my mom so
I didn't think hogging you

00:39:24.548 --> 00:39:26.585
all to myself would be right.

00:39:26.686 --> 00:39:29.725
[Reg] Weren't you the one who
found me in the first place?

00:39:30.927 --> 00:39:33.967
I mean, I've already climbed
the Abyss once now, right?

00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:35.470
Even if my memory
doesn't return,

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.341
I still have this sturdy body.

00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:39.378
I'll protect you all the
way down to the bottom.

00:39:39.478 --> 00:39:41.014
[affirmative grunts]

00:39:41.114 --> 00:39:43.386
There's no stopping you now.

00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:44.288
Sorry.

00:39:44.388 --> 00:39:45.957
I'll be sad to leave you guys,

00:39:46.057 --> 00:39:48.496
but my curiosity
has the better of me.

00:39:48.596 --> 00:39:49.798
It's okay.

00:39:49.898 --> 00:39:50.934
Even if we tried to stop her,

00:39:51.034 --> 00:39:52.236
she'd still find a way to go.

00:39:52.337 --> 00:39:53.773
[Riko] Mm-hmm.

00:39:53.873 --> 00:39:56.312
[Shiggy] By the way,
do you have any idea what

00:39:56.412 --> 00:39:58.683
lies in your path on the way
to the netherworld's bottom?

00:39:58.783 --> 00:40:01.154
Well, like I know
there are a bunch

00:40:01.254 --> 00:40:02.958
of random dangerous creatures.

00:40:03.058 --> 00:40:04.595
Don't tell me.

00:40:04.695 --> 00:40:06.999
You believe that you'll be able
to reach the bottom by using

00:40:07.099 --> 00:40:10.407
your extended arms to descend
both of you little by little.

00:40:10.507 --> 00:40:12.076
Is that more or less your plan?

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:13.946
I'm sure there
will be obstacles.

00:40:14.047 --> 00:40:14.915
But yeah, that's kind of it.

00:40:15.015 --> 00:40:16.385
Oh my god!

00:40:16.485 --> 00:40:18.423
You are going to need a
lot more than that, pal!

00:40:18.523 --> 00:40:19.692
Hmm?

00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:22.063
The Abyss is teeming with
dangers far beyond anything

00:40:22.163 --> 00:40:23.399
you can possibly imagine.

00:40:23.499 --> 00:40:24.968
It's crazy down there!

00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:27.574
What are you holding, Shiggy?

00:40:27.674 --> 00:40:29.812
It's the latest Rough Map
of the nether world.

00:40:29.912 --> 00:40:31.282
[Riko] That's awesome, Shiggy!

00:40:31.382 --> 00:40:32.951
Did you sneak in
there and take it?

00:40:33.051 --> 00:40:36.191
Um, Riko, you are about to
challenge the Abyss head on.

00:40:36.292 --> 00:40:37.561
So sneaking into the
Director's office

00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:39.465
is nothing compared to that.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.840
As of now, this is the
current state of the Abyss.

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:48.416
The first layer is at about
1,350 meters down,

00:40:48.516 --> 00:40:50.320
the Edge of the Abyss.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.891
The creatures and environment
here don't really change,

00:40:52.991 --> 00:40:55.430
but beasts from the second
layer come up to feed,

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.401
so keep your eyes open.

00:40:57.501 --> 00:40:59.237
Starting here is
the second layer,

00:40:59.338 --> 00:41:00.974
the Forest of Temptation.

00:41:01.074 --> 00:41:03.980
The strain of ascending is said
to become more severe here.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.253
If a Red Whistle descends down
that far, no help will be sent.

00:41:07.354 --> 00:41:08.756
-Hmm?
-That's because

00:41:08.856 --> 00:41:11.796
both heading there and returning
become too difficult.

00:41:11.896 --> 00:41:13.766
It's treated as a suicide.

00:41:15.503 --> 00:41:17.507
The forest will take the
shape of a rat guard,

00:41:17.607 --> 00:41:19.745
meaning you entered
The Inverted Forest.

00:41:19.845 --> 00:41:22.216
The air currents are
super unstable here,

00:41:22.317 --> 00:41:24.988
and savage predators
fill the sky.

00:41:25.089 --> 00:41:27.327
The third layer is called
the Great Fault.

00:41:27.427 --> 00:41:29.531
Here you'll find
a vertical cliff base

00:41:29.631 --> 00:41:32.504
over 4,000 meters
standing in your way.

00:41:32.604 --> 00:41:36.044
The fourth layer, only Black
Whistles and above can go here.

00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:38.282
The depth is about 7,000 meters.

00:41:38.382 --> 00:41:41.989
They call it
The Goblets of Giants.

00:41:42.089 --> 00:41:43.359
Look, Riko,

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:45.129
sorry to bring this up
when you're so excited--

00:41:45.229 --> 00:41:47.567
Whatever it is you say,
I'm still going to go!

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:50.440
My mother is waiting for me!

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.477
Have you even been
paying attention at all?

00:41:52.577 --> 00:41:54.147
You think anyone
could live somewhere

00:41:54.247 --> 00:41:55.950
like that for 10 years?

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.621
-What are you?
-Think about it.

00:41:57.721 --> 00:41:59.491
Why did her whistle
make it back up here?

00:41:59.591 --> 00:42:00.426
Face it.

00:42:00.527 --> 00:42:02.163
Your mother died
a long time ago!

00:42:02.264 --> 00:42:03.699
Oh.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.670
[whimpering]

00:42:06.772 --> 00:42:09.110
[crying]

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.949
Oh, I didn't-- uh.

00:42:14.187 --> 00:42:15.990
[Riko cries]

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.427
Riko!

00:42:19.598 --> 00:42:21.836
There, there.
It'll be okay.

00:42:23.339 --> 00:42:24.875
[sigh]

00:42:37.634 --> 00:42:39.538
I've lowered the luggage
and our spare clothes.

00:42:39.638 --> 00:42:41.542
Great. Thank you, Reg.

00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:44.748
So do you think they'll know
who I am if I'm wearing this?

00:42:44.848 --> 00:42:46.318
Probably not.

00:42:47.186 --> 00:42:48.389
Where did Nat run off to?

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:50.960
[Shiggy chuckle]
About that.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.096
Nat's probably just stopped--

00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:53.633
Look, I don't care
what he's doing!

00:42:53.733 --> 00:42:56.037
He's so worried about you he
ended up crossing the line.

00:42:56.137 --> 00:42:57.741
Hmph! So?

00:42:57.841 --> 00:43:01.615
Riko, you might never get
the chance to see him again.

00:43:01.715 --> 00:43:04.621
Come on, you really
want to leave like this?

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.561
Because I don't.

00:43:11.201 --> 00:43:13.472
I don't really want
to either, Reg.

00:43:13.573 --> 00:43:15.310
But look, he's
totally against us

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.181
going and said some mean stuff.

00:43:18.282 --> 00:43:20.787
So, Reg, what do
you want me to do?

00:43:20.887 --> 00:43:24.026
Riko, if Nat apologizes,
will you forgive him?

00:43:24.126 --> 00:43:25.330
Um, yeah.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.500
But he can be quite
stubborn when he wants to.

00:43:27.601 --> 00:43:30.038
[Reg] Don't worry.
Nat regretted what he did.

00:43:30.138 --> 00:43:32.310
-Really?
-Really.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:33.913
All right then, you two.

00:43:34.013 --> 00:43:35.984
If you don't move it,
you'll run out of time.

00:43:36.084 --> 00:43:37.854
So that we don't draw
too much attention,

00:43:37.954 --> 00:43:40.960
we'll leave one by
one every 10 minutes.

00:43:56.224 --> 00:43:59.063
Kiyui. Kiyui.

00:43:59.163 --> 00:44:00.433
Huh?

00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:01.602
What is it?

00:44:01.702 --> 00:44:02.704
I came to tell you goodbye.

00:44:02.804 --> 00:44:04.741
-[coughing]
-Hey.

00:44:04.841 --> 00:44:06.712
Are you not feeling very well?

00:44:06.812 --> 00:44:09.384
Come to think of it, I
guess you always seem tired.

00:44:09.484 --> 00:44:11.889
In two days it's my birthday.

00:44:11.989 --> 00:44:12.924
Oh, really?

00:44:13.024 --> 00:44:15.162
I hope you're better
before your big day.

00:44:15.263 --> 00:44:17.634
And grow up strong.

00:44:17.734 --> 00:44:21.174
Oh, and, Kiyui, on the
morning of your birthday,

00:44:21.275 --> 00:44:22.978
do not look into the mirror.

00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:24.146
Why not?

00:44:24.246 --> 00:44:25.984
Just don't, okay?

00:44:26.084 --> 00:44:27.454
If you say so.

00:44:27.554 --> 00:44:29.458
See you later.

00:44:31.996 --> 00:44:34.568
Farewell, friend.

00:44:34.668 --> 00:44:36.505
<i>That took longer</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

00:44:36.605 --> 00:44:38.409
<i>I better hurry.</i>

00:44:39.778 --> 00:44:41.482
-[Leader clears throat]
-Oh!

00:44:41.582 --> 00:44:43.653
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:44:43.753 --> 00:44:45.423
There aren't any
toilets in that room.

00:44:45.523 --> 00:44:48.362
I was still half asleep.

00:44:48.462 --> 00:44:50.600
What are you doing up in
the middle of the night?

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.706
I'm on patrol,
you little pipsqueak.

00:44:53.806 --> 00:44:55.743
You know where Riko is?

00:44:55.843 --> 00:44:57.212
I didn't see her in her bed.

00:44:57.314 --> 00:44:59.551
Oh, yeah.
She went to take a dump.

00:44:59.651 --> 00:45:01.288
She went in the
middle of the night?

00:45:01.388 --> 00:45:03.326
Yeah. She has an
upset stomach.

00:45:03.426 --> 00:45:05.228
Is she scavenging food again?

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.166
Girl just doesn't quit,
does she?

00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:12.944
I take it you're on the
way to the bathroom, right?

00:45:13.044 --> 00:45:15.015
Make sure she's okay.

00:45:15.115 --> 00:45:16.952
Um, roger that.

00:45:26.204 --> 00:45:28.074
Oh, there he is.

00:45:30.178 --> 00:45:31.749
[Reg] Sorry I took so long.

00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:34.921
[Riko] Shiggy, we're headed off
to the Wharf Quarter now, right?

00:45:35.022 --> 00:45:36.925
[Shiggy] Yeah. The usual
gate to the netherworld

00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:38.763
is too closely
guarded all the time.

00:45:38.863 --> 00:45:40.767
I heard that the Wharf
Quarter in the slums

00:45:40.867 --> 00:45:42.370
has a spot where
you can lower down.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.541
-You heard?
-Yeah.

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:47.212
You've never actually been
to the Wharf Quarter before,

00:45:47.313 --> 00:45:49.651
so I called someone
to help us out.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.561
We're in your hands.

00:45:55.663 --> 00:45:56.765
<i>Who's this?</i>

00:45:56.865 --> 00:45:59.604
Really, Nat?
What are you doing here?

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.887
Well, I...

00:46:08.622 --> 00:46:10.192
Sorry.

00:46:10.293 --> 00:46:11.595
That was wrong, what I did.

00:46:11.695 --> 00:46:14.267
-You're forgiven!
-Huh?

00:46:15.603 --> 00:46:18.943
Uh, so, um, even though
I said terrible things?

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:20.145
It's fine.

00:46:20.245 --> 00:46:21.582
I want us to make up.

00:46:21.682 --> 00:46:23.919
Cause today we say farewell.

00:46:24.019 --> 00:46:25.222
[gasp]

00:46:28.729 --> 00:46:31.502
You don't know your way to
the Wharf Quarter, do you?

00:46:31.602 --> 00:46:33.506
Follow me.

00:46:33.606 --> 00:46:34.841
[Riko] Hey, Nat.

00:46:34.941 --> 00:46:36.244
You're helping us
out because you're okay

00:46:36.345 --> 00:46:37.881
with us going now, right?

00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:41.655
-I'm still against it.
-Huh? Seriously?

00:46:41.755 --> 00:46:43.793
[Reg] Is this still
part of Orth?

00:46:43.893 --> 00:46:45.797
[Shiggy] The Wharf District
was founded by people who

00:46:45.897 --> 00:46:47.934
were cave raiding illegally.

00:46:48.034 --> 00:46:50.105
Buildings kept being
added as the quarter grew,

00:46:50.205 --> 00:46:53.479
and now half of it is
encroaching into the Abyss.

00:46:53.579 --> 00:46:55.583
[Riko] Nat, have you
been here before?

00:46:55.683 --> 00:46:57.954
Of course.
This is where I was born.

00:46:58.054 --> 00:46:59.190
You were?

00:46:59.291 --> 00:47:01.795
I was rag picking my whole life.

00:47:01.895 --> 00:47:04.468
My big sister died and
left me without a family,

00:47:04.568 --> 00:47:06.104
so I was taken in
by the orphanage.

00:47:06.204 --> 00:47:09.277
<i>That's the story I told the</i>
<i>leader Jiruo when I first</i>

00:47:09.377 --> 00:47:11.381
<i>entered the orphanage.</i>

00:47:11.482 --> 00:47:14.621
[Nat] You know, if I can become
a Moon Whistle like Jiruo,

00:47:14.721 --> 00:47:16.725
I'd like to open up
an orphanage here.

00:47:16.825 --> 00:47:18.696
[Riko] Of all people,
you can do it.

00:47:18.796 --> 00:47:20.266
You're almost as good
at cave raiding as me,

00:47:20.366 --> 00:47:21.969
and you like kids.

00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:25.810
You honestly can't come up with
a better compliment than that?

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.246
Oh?

00:47:29.417 --> 00:47:30.853
[Nat] <i>Really?</i>

00:47:31.822 --> 00:47:33.926
<i>We're already here?</i>

00:47:36.498 --> 00:47:38.369
[electrical noise]

00:47:38.469 --> 00:47:39.738
Huh.

00:47:39.838 --> 00:47:42.410
<i>So this thing really</i>
<i>does fit me to a T.</i>

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.581
<i>Where did I put that whistle?</i>

00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:46.083
Huh?

00:47:46.852 --> 00:47:48.221
What's this?

00:47:51.227 --> 00:47:52.864
Oh.

00:47:52.964 --> 00:47:54.701
I think there's a real
possibility, you know.

00:47:54.801 --> 00:47:56.271
You have an Aubade with you,

00:47:56.371 --> 00:47:58.843
so I'll definitely be a believer
if one of your mail balloons

00:47:58.943 --> 00:48:00.613
makes it up here.

00:48:01.013 --> 00:48:02.149
[laughing]

00:48:02.249 --> 00:48:04.086
I'll have to make sure to
include a souvenir, then.

00:48:04.186 --> 00:48:07.427
[Shiggy] You better,
and make it a good one.

00:48:07.527 --> 00:48:09.129
-I'll keep on reading...
-Riko.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:10.933
...as long as it takes.

00:48:11.033 --> 00:48:11.869
Riko.

00:48:11.969 --> 00:48:13.272
Mm?

00:48:13.372 --> 00:48:14.774
What is it, Nat?

00:48:16.411 --> 00:48:17.614
Thanks for getting us here.

00:48:17.714 --> 00:48:19.451
I didn't think we'd
make it without running

00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:21.421
into at least a little trouble.

00:48:21.522 --> 00:48:23.292
Oh, yeah.

00:48:23.392 --> 00:48:25.228
You are the best, you know that?

00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:26.999
[whimper]

00:48:29.304 --> 00:48:31.708
So, um, Riko?

00:48:32.377 --> 00:48:33.913
Hm?

00:48:34.013 --> 00:48:35.048
I--

00:48:35.148 --> 00:48:36.318
<i>Come on, Nat.</i>

00:48:36.418 --> 00:48:38.422
<i>So much to say.</i>

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.793
Listen, I, uh...

00:48:40.893 --> 00:48:42.363
<i>I've been dreading this moment.</i>

00:48:42.463 --> 00:48:43.999
[Riko] It's all right.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.674
[gasp]

00:48:47.774 --> 00:48:52.049
Even if we-- we never
see each other again,

00:48:52.149 --> 00:48:55.656
we'll still be
connected by the Abyss.

00:48:55.756 --> 00:48:58.262
Be it on the surface
or in the far reaches

00:48:58.362 --> 00:48:59.998
of the cursed netherworld,

00:49:00.098 --> 00:49:03.372
the two of us
will always be connected.

00:49:03.472 --> 00:49:07.513
I'll never forget about the time
I spent up here with you, okay?

00:49:07.614 --> 00:49:10.018
It's all gonna be all right!

00:49:12.222 --> 00:49:13.492
Hm.

00:49:13.592 --> 00:49:14.861
What is it now?

00:49:14.961 --> 00:49:17.132
Looks like you're
at it again, Riko.

00:49:17.232 --> 00:49:18.702
[sniffling]

00:49:20.706 --> 00:49:21.909
That's right!

00:49:22.009 --> 00:49:24.347
I am at it again!

00:49:24.447 --> 00:49:25.816
[resident 1] Shut up!

00:49:26.818 --> 00:49:27.954
Oh, crap, we're waking them up.

00:49:28.054 --> 00:49:28.923
[resident 2] Go home, you brats!

00:49:29.023 --> 00:49:30.760
Let's get going, Reg.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.197
[wind howling]

00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:37.072
You better send some
letters up here.

00:49:37.172 --> 00:49:38.776
I'll make sure
to find them, okay?

00:49:38.876 --> 00:49:40.145
Be careful, you guys.

00:49:40.245 --> 00:49:42.684
And it's totally fine if
you decide to come back.

00:49:42.784 --> 00:49:44.554
[Nat] I'm counting on you
to take care of Riko.

00:49:44.654 --> 00:49:45.756
I understand.

00:49:45.856 --> 00:49:47.360
You guys take care
of yourselves, too.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.729
Thanks to both of you.

00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:50.833
Keep an eye out for
all my good news.

00:49:50.933 --> 00:49:54.307
Well then, I guess
we're off now.

00:49:56.511 --> 00:49:59.049
[Narrator] <i>And so the two</i>
<i>head off into the chasm</i>

00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:02.757
<i>from which even darkness</i>
<i>cannot escape.</i>

00:50:02.857 --> 00:50:05.228
<i>The Abyss is said</i>
<i>to provide all...</i>

00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:09.604
<i>Life and death,</i>
<i>curses and blessings.</i>

00:50:09.704 --> 00:50:11.308
<i>As their journey moves forward,</i>

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.612
<i>they will be faced with many</i>
<i>choices,</i>

00:50:13.712 --> 00:50:16.918
<i>and the outcome is just</i>
<i>as likely to be determined</i>

00:50:17.019 --> 00:50:19.924
<i>by the great Abyss</i>
<i>itself as it is</i>

00:50:20.025 --> 00:50:22.864
<i>by those who dare challenge it.</i>

00:50:26.938 --> 00:50:29.277
[birds chirping]

00:50:34.888 --> 00:50:36.391
Huh?

00:50:38.529 --> 00:50:42.270
-[snoring]
-Hey, Reg. Time to get up.

00:50:49.417 --> 00:50:50.586
[screaming]

00:50:50.686 --> 00:50:52.457
-Whoa!
-Someone's here!

00:50:52.557 --> 00:50:54.361
[panting]

00:50:54.461 --> 00:50:55.997
It's me.

00:50:56.531 --> 00:50:57.667
Oh...

00:50:57.767 --> 00:51:00.373
[sigh]

00:51:00.473 --> 00:51:03.979
I'm not even really sure
when I drifted off to sleep.

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:05.616
I guess I couldn't help myself.

00:51:05.716 --> 00:51:07.687
Your belly was just
so warm and soft.

00:51:07.787 --> 00:51:08.922
It's understandable.

00:51:09.023 --> 00:51:11.895
We hardly ever got
to stay up that late.

00:51:12.497 --> 00:51:13.732
Here.

00:51:13.832 --> 00:51:15.403
Thank you.

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:24.119
Hey, Reg, you have
any idea where we are?

00:51:24.219 --> 00:51:26.792
We dropped directly down
from the wharf district,

00:51:26.892 --> 00:51:28.696
but I couldn't really
say where that puts us.

00:51:28.796 --> 00:51:32.169
Though the depth gauge
is indicating 820 meters.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.572
Hmm.

00:51:34.908 --> 00:51:36.845
Riko, what is it?

00:51:38.582 --> 00:51:40.853
[panting]

00:51:44.794 --> 00:51:46.230
Whoa!

00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:55.148
[Riko] It's beautiful.

00:51:55.248 --> 00:51:58.522
[Reg] It seems so much brighter
here than up on the surface.

00:51:58.622 --> 00:51:59.858
Ah, over there.

00:51:59.958 --> 00:52:01.328
It's the Rock Ark.

00:52:01.428 --> 00:52:02.797
That's at 600 meters.

00:52:02.897 --> 00:52:05.001
Look how far above us it is.

00:52:05.101 --> 00:52:08.575
Not long ago, I was aiming
for a depth of 400 meters,

00:52:08.675 --> 00:52:11.113
and now we can't even see it.

00:52:11.415 --> 00:52:12.450
Oh.

00:52:13.217 --> 00:52:14.153
Hm?

00:52:14.253 --> 00:52:15.990
[squeal]

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.560
This is great!

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.031
At this pace, we'll make it to
the bottom in no time at all,

00:52:20.131 --> 00:52:22.336
but, of course, we cannot let
our guard down, you know.

00:52:22.437 --> 00:52:24.474
Well, that's good
to hear, I guess.

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:27.814
-So, Riko, uh--
-[stomach growls]

00:52:27.914 --> 00:52:29.918
Uh...

00:52:31.588 --> 00:52:34.126
Let's have some breakfast.

00:52:45.983 --> 00:52:47.620
[Riko] <i>Take out the</i>
<i>demon fish innards,</i>

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.691
<i>making sure not to damage them.</i>

00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:52.095
<i>Then smoke them to keep</i>
<i>them preserved for later.</i>

00:52:52.195 --> 00:52:54.901
<i>As for the meat, put a</i>
<i>hardy helping in the pot,</i>

00:52:55.001 --> 00:52:57.573
and sprinkle a bit of
Eternal Fortunes on top.

00:52:57.673 --> 00:53:00.312
<i>Mix in some stick miso,</i>
<i>and then once you</i>

00:53:00.412 --> 00:53:03.184
<i>throw in a bunch of diced</i>
<i>sainona greens...</i>

00:53:03.285 --> 00:53:04.219
Ta-da!

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.958
My special Riko soup
is ready to enjoy.

00:53:07.058 --> 00:53:09.196
<i>Irredeemable...</i>

00:53:09.864 --> 00:53:11.368
Eat it.

00:53:11.835 --> 00:53:13.906
[slurps]

00:53:14.006 --> 00:53:17.380
<i>Oh, it tastes better</i>
<i>than Riko Bombs.</i>

00:53:26.865 --> 00:53:29.838
Oh, Riko, what's that
you're playing with?

00:53:29.938 --> 00:53:31.475
This here is my Star Compass.

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:34.481
Oh, that helps you
tell up from down?

00:53:35.616 --> 00:53:37.753
Nope, it always points
directly to the bottom

00:53:37.854 --> 00:53:38.922
of the netherworld.

00:53:39.022 --> 00:53:40.493
Let me take a look.

00:53:42.363 --> 00:53:44.567
It doesn't seem
magnetic or weighted.

00:53:44.667 --> 00:53:46.271
How very strange.

00:53:46.371 --> 00:53:48.809
Even if you shake it, the
direction of the needle

00:53:48.909 --> 00:53:50.111
doesn't move a bit.

00:53:50.211 --> 00:53:52.517
Wait, really? Give it here.

00:53:53.452 --> 00:53:55.489
<i>Another relic</i>
<i>of the Abyss, huh?</i>

00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:57.994
<i>I get the feeling there's</i>
<i>some incomprehensible</i>

00:53:58.094 --> 00:53:59.764
<i>principle at work.</i>

00:53:59.864 --> 00:54:01.401
[gasp]

00:54:02.904 --> 00:54:04.374
Ah!

00:54:09.149 --> 00:54:11.688
[Riko screams]

00:54:13.325 --> 00:54:15.362
It's fine. Really, it is.

00:54:15.462 --> 00:54:18.302
There's an old saying: "All
that is taken from the Abyss

00:54:18.402 --> 00:54:20.506
will someday be returned to it.

00:54:20.606 --> 00:54:22.175
Oh, I see then.

00:54:22.276 --> 00:54:25.114
The teachings of cave raiders
can be quite humbling.

00:54:25.215 --> 00:54:28.388
Yeah, well, Leader
taught me that one.

00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:32.095
Oh, that's right.

00:54:32.195 --> 00:54:35.034
We were rushing around so
much I forgot about this.

00:54:36.136 --> 00:54:37.940
What is it?

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.377
An envelope?

00:54:39.477 --> 00:54:42.082
Well, go on, take a look inside.

00:54:48.227 --> 00:54:52.336
Oh, wait, this is my
mother's sealed letter.

00:54:52.436 --> 00:54:54.540
Reg, did you make off with this?

00:54:54.641 --> 00:54:56.278
No, take a closer look.

00:54:56.378 --> 00:54:59.384
The pages we saw last time
were all tattered here.

00:54:59.484 --> 00:55:01.621
This is probably just a copy.

00:55:01.721 --> 00:55:03.024
Yeah, you're right.

00:55:03.124 --> 00:55:05.161
Back when we left the
orphanage, I actually

00:55:05.262 --> 00:55:07.433
-bumped into Jiruo in the hall.
-Huh?

00:55:07.533 --> 00:55:10.573
At the time, I thought I really
had him fooled, but perhaps not.

00:55:10.673 --> 00:55:13.579
Because, well, I
suddenly realized that thing

00:55:13.679 --> 00:55:15.516
was in my back pocket.

00:55:15.616 --> 00:55:17.052
Oh, yeah?

00:55:17.152 --> 00:55:19.624
I wonder if he's cheering
us on from the sidelines.

00:55:20.693 --> 00:55:23.465
There's a page that's
different than the others.

00:55:25.836 --> 00:55:27.640
Oh.

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.744
[concerned whimper]

00:55:30.679 --> 00:55:31.815
Huh?

00:55:33.852 --> 00:55:37.426
[Reg] "I'll depart at dawn
to come capture you"?

00:55:37.526 --> 00:55:38.996
We've got to hurry
up and get going!

00:55:39.096 --> 00:55:41.835
Okay, Reg, go put
out the campfire.

00:55:41.935 --> 00:55:44.106
-I'm on it.
-Oh God, what do we do?

00:55:44.206 --> 00:55:46.411
I'll make sure we're
not leaving anything!

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.288
[Reg] Why would Leader
do something so

00:55:51.388 --> 00:55:52.290
out of the ordinary?

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:55.296
He must be testing us.

00:55:55.396 --> 00:55:58.000
Maybe this is our final
lesson or something.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.937
Like if he's able
to catch us,

00:56:00.038 --> 00:56:04.347
then we never had a chance of
making it to the bottom anyway.

00:56:04.447 --> 00:56:06.083
[Reg] It would seem
our pursuers still

00:56:06.183 --> 00:56:07.720
haven't caught up
with us yet.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.191
[Riko] We've strayed
from the usual route,

00:56:10.292 --> 00:56:13.932
so even if they come after us,
they won't find us easily.

00:56:14.032 --> 00:56:15.369
Besides, the search
parties always

00:56:15.469 --> 00:56:17.540
move in groups of at
least three people,

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.477
so we should see them
coming way before--

00:56:19.577 --> 00:56:20.779
Huh?

00:56:22.984 --> 00:56:24.654
What's the matter, Riko?

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:27.760
Look at that, Reg!

00:56:28.595 --> 00:56:31.066
See the break in
the clouds there?

00:56:31.166 --> 00:56:34.172
It's the second layer,
the Forest of Temptation.

00:56:35.041 --> 00:56:37.145
<i>So this is the second layer?</i>

00:56:37.245 --> 00:56:39.082
<i>If a Red Whistle</i>
<i>ever goes down there,</i>

00:56:39.182 --> 00:56:40.886
<i>it's treated as a suicide.</i>

00:56:40.986 --> 00:56:42.790
[voice] <i>Where?</i>

00:56:44.727 --> 00:56:46.398
<i>What was that?</i>

00:56:47.466 --> 00:56:49.470
<i>Was that my own voice?</i>

00:56:50.806 --> 00:56:52.242
[sigh]

00:56:53.278 --> 00:56:55.516
Are you okay?

00:56:55.616 --> 00:56:57.953
It's so pretty,
I got light-headed.

00:56:58.054 --> 00:57:00.592
Riko, let's take a break.

00:57:00.693 --> 00:57:03.298
Riko, I was just thinking
about the delusion

00:57:03.398 --> 00:57:05.369
you seem to have about
the letter we found.

00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:07.473
About it being
our final lesson?

00:57:07.573 --> 00:57:09.944
It's not a delusion, okay?

00:57:10.044 --> 00:57:14.520
I was thinking you just might
not be mistaken in that.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.460
Leader told me that it's
necessary for him to patrol

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.100
every night, and let's just say
he was able to see through us.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:24.039
Perhaps he uncovered our nightly
plot and was able to figure out

00:57:24.139 --> 00:57:25.642
I'm a robot.

00:57:25.743 --> 00:57:28.682
He then made it a point to
place that letter in my pocket.

00:57:28.782 --> 00:57:31.488
We must escape and prove
we're up to the task.

00:57:32.623 --> 00:57:34.293
Yeah!

00:57:34.861 --> 00:57:36.364
[Riko giggles]

00:57:37.967 --> 00:57:38.835
[distant clang]

00:57:38.935 --> 00:57:40.472
[gasp]

00:57:45.248 --> 00:57:48.822
<i>They've caught us, but</i>
<i>it's just one person.</i>

00:57:48.922 --> 00:57:50.459
<i>Can we slip away?</i>

00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:53.365
[man] I'd expect nothing less
from Lyza's daughter.

00:57:55.602 --> 00:57:58.207
Y'all are pretty fast,
aren't you now?

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.777
Uncle Habo?

00:57:59.877 --> 00:58:01.213
Why are you here?

00:58:01.314 --> 00:58:02.650
How about that?

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:04.954
Looks like I might have
some skills of my own, huh?

00:58:05.054 --> 00:58:06.056
[Reg] <i>What should I do?</i>

00:58:06.156 --> 00:58:09.263
<i>Maybe I can let Riko escape.</i>

00:58:09.363 --> 00:58:11.434
That being said, look at you.

00:58:11.534 --> 00:58:14.273
Never would've thought, you
being a supreme treasure

00:58:14.373 --> 00:58:15.776
of the netherworld and all.

00:58:15.876 --> 00:58:17.580
[laughs]

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.721
Is your skin
considered a relic, too?

00:58:21.821 --> 00:58:23.758
You can't really tell
just by looking at it.

00:58:23.859 --> 00:58:26.230
[Reg screams]

00:58:28.468 --> 00:58:30.873
Well, now, looks like
there's nothing mechanical

00:58:30.973 --> 00:58:32.343
about your jumblies.

00:58:32.443 --> 00:58:34.514
Stop it! Let me go!

00:58:36.183 --> 00:58:37.920
[Habo] Hey, stop kicking!

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.423
Huh?

00:58:39.524 --> 00:58:41.461
[Habo] Taking into account
the weight of your backpack,

00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:44.534
you're pretty darn light.

00:58:44.634 --> 00:58:47.873
[Riko] <i>I guess he still hasn't</i>
<i>learned the hand signals yet.</i>

00:58:49.075 --> 00:58:51.281
[laughs]

00:58:52.081 --> 00:58:53.285
Sorry, kids.

00:58:53.385 --> 00:58:55.355
I still haven't told
you why I'm here.

00:58:55.455 --> 00:58:56.791
Don't you worry.

00:58:56.891 --> 00:58:59.597
I didn't come out here to
try and haul you two back.

00:58:59.697 --> 00:59:00.899
Huh?

00:59:01.634 --> 00:59:02.937
Please, we're begging you.

00:59:03.037 --> 00:59:05.509
You don't need to get them
to the Seeker Camp,

00:59:05.609 --> 00:59:08.415
just maybe help them get
down to the second layer.

00:59:08.515 --> 00:59:10.819
Besides, this is
your last chance

00:59:10.919 --> 00:59:13.090
to see the actual true form
of a real supreme treasure.

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:17.198
So, uh, you're saying Reg
is an honest to goodness

00:59:17.299 --> 00:59:18.835
treasure of the netherworld?

00:59:18.935 --> 00:59:20.037
[Shiggy] Y-yeah.

00:59:20.137 --> 00:59:23.010
[laughs] Then I'll go.

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:24.514
So you see,

00:59:24.614 --> 00:59:27.185
I came to pay my respects
to this fancy relic here.

00:59:27.286 --> 00:59:30.191
I wish you would have kept it
to just paying your respects.

00:59:30.292 --> 00:59:31.694
[laughs]

00:59:31.794 --> 00:59:34.199
By the way, kiddo,
the search party

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:36.538
was looking for you
by the twisting crag.

00:59:36.638 --> 00:59:38.608
I suspect it'll
take them awhile.

00:59:39.176 --> 00:59:40.612
[laughs]

00:59:40.712 --> 00:59:44.019
Well, all right, you two,
I've had my look

00:59:44.119 --> 00:59:45.989
at the treasure of
the nether world.

00:59:46.089 --> 00:59:47.359
-Let's get to hoofing.
-Hm?

00:59:47.459 --> 00:59:49.931
And I'll come with you
to the Seeker Camp.

00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:52.570
It's reassuring to have
a Black Whistle with us.

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:54.607
Don't you think, Riko?

00:59:56.444 --> 01:00:00.452
Uncle Habo, so maybe...

01:00:01.086 --> 01:00:02.389
I'm so sorry!

01:00:02.489 --> 01:00:04.627
I cannot allow that of you!

01:00:04.727 --> 01:00:08.468
Well, the thing is...
this is our final lesson.

01:00:08.969 --> 01:00:10.806
[birds chirping]

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.347
Oh, I see then.

01:00:14.447 --> 01:00:15.816
Pretty clever of him really.

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:18.321
Well, if this is
your final lesson,

01:00:18.421 --> 01:00:20.726
I won't get in your way,
but he should have come

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.097
to see you off one last time.

01:00:23.197 --> 01:00:24.634
I'm sorry, Habo.

01:00:24.734 --> 01:00:26.804
I know you came all
the way down here.

01:00:26.905 --> 01:00:28.608
Not a problem, kid.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.981
Actually, I have some other
business down here anyway.

01:00:32.917 --> 01:00:34.119
Here.

01:00:36.324 --> 01:00:37.459
What is this thing?

01:00:37.559 --> 01:00:39.095
It's a vaccine for
the second layer

01:00:39.195 --> 01:00:40.999
that blue whistles
and up take.

01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:44.907
It should spare you from picking
up the main illness down there.

01:00:45.007 --> 01:00:48.882
Lastly, but also the most
important thing to know,

01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:51.554
since I won't be
accompanying you any further,

01:00:51.654 --> 01:00:53.592
I should tell you this now.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:56.731
That Seeker Camp monitoring
base that you're heading to,

01:00:56.831 --> 01:00:59.437
the guardian there can
be a bit of a nut-job.

01:00:59.537 --> 01:01:02.376
You mean the person who
found my mom's sealed letter?

01:01:02.476 --> 01:01:03.678
That's right.

01:01:03.778 --> 01:01:06.784
Unmovable Sovereign,
Ozen the Immovable...

01:01:06.884 --> 01:01:09.390
a White Whistle
who is still active.

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:10.826
A White Whistle?

01:01:10.926 --> 01:01:13.265
And the very one who
helped save my life?

01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:15.201
That's awesome!

01:01:15.302 --> 01:01:17.138
I don't get it, Habolg.

01:01:17.238 --> 01:01:18.508
That doesn't seem
like anything we

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:20.111
need to be too worried about.

01:01:21.547 --> 01:01:23.852
Please just try and
be wary of Ozen, okay?

01:01:23.952 --> 01:01:26.824
I can't really go
into the details,

01:01:26.924 --> 01:01:30.465
but, Riko, you might encounter
some distressing things.

01:01:30.565 --> 01:01:32.369
Just be prepared.

01:01:32.469 --> 01:01:33.972
I'll be fine, uncle.

01:01:34.072 --> 01:01:35.742
I would like to meet a
white whistle anyway.

01:01:35.842 --> 01:01:38.348
I want to ask her about my mom
and about the time when she

01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:39.817
found my mom's sealed letter.

01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:42.155
And besides, I'm super tough.

01:01:46.998 --> 01:01:49.235
[Habo] You're right,
you'll be fine.

01:01:49.337 --> 01:01:53.378
You've got a good partner
with you, after all.

01:01:53.478 --> 01:01:57.218
And, Reg, take care
of her, you hear me?

01:01:58.355 --> 01:01:59.957
Understood.

01:02:00.057 --> 01:02:01.728
Leave it to me.

01:02:07.973 --> 01:02:11.280
-Oh, look, Reg, you see that?
-Huh?

01:02:11.381 --> 01:02:13.183
It's a wind-riding windmill.

01:02:13.284 --> 01:02:16.958
Apparently a long time ago, they
used those to capture updrafts.

01:02:17.058 --> 01:02:19.730
I hear they've been around
for more than 4,000 years.

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:21.834
The fact that we've
passed by them,

01:02:21.934 --> 01:02:24.005
well, you know what that means.

01:02:37.399 --> 01:02:38.668
Whoa.

01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:48.922
<i>This is the depth's</i>
<i>second layer.</i>

01:02:49.022 --> 01:02:49.690
[laughs]

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:51.728
We really did it, Reg!

01:02:51.828 --> 01:02:55.369
We actually survived Leader's
big lesson in the Abyss!

01:02:55.469 --> 01:02:56.604
You hear that?

01:02:56.704 --> 01:02:58.575
We managed to pull
it off, Leader!

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:00.579
I guess it really
hasn't hit me yet.

01:03:00.679 --> 01:03:03.250
Did we actually just get away
from all the cave raiders?

01:03:03.351 --> 01:03:04.720
Totally!

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.591
We don't have to worry about
anyone chasing us anymore.

01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:07.659
[roaring]

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.630
[both gasp]

01:03:11.133 --> 01:03:13.972
<i>If we descend any further,</i>
<i>no help will be sent.</i>

01:03:14.072 --> 01:03:15.675
<i>Because heading down and</i>
<i>returning</i>

01:03:15.776 --> 01:03:17.011
<i>becomes too difficult.</i>

01:03:17.111 --> 01:03:20.050
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>that's what Shiggy said.</i>

01:03:20.151 --> 01:03:22.923
<i>So in other words, down here,</i>
<i>even the search party</i>

01:03:23.023 --> 01:03:25.662
<i>would find itself</i>
<i>in harm's way.</i>

01:03:25.762 --> 01:03:27.299
We should get moving, Reg.

01:03:27.399 --> 01:03:29.069
It might be calling
its buddies over.

01:03:29.169 --> 01:03:30.872
Yeah, good idea.

01:03:30.972 --> 01:03:32.910
<i>It's not that we've</i>
<i>actually escaped,</i>

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.315
<i>but rather, now we're</i>
<i>free to be pursued</i>

01:03:35.415 --> 01:03:41.226
<i>by all kinds of things that</i>
<i>exist outside the realm of man.</i>

01:03:41.327 --> 01:03:42.729
Okay, let's see now.

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:45.936
We're supposed to go
down from around here.

01:03:46.036 --> 01:03:48.842
We should head to
the Seeker Camp.

01:03:48.942 --> 01:03:51.280
[distant shouting] Help me!

01:03:52.148 --> 01:03:53.952
<i>I hear a voice.</i>

01:03:54.052 --> 01:03:56.390
Hmm? What's the matter?

01:03:56.491 --> 01:03:58.495
Shh! Someone's calling out.

01:03:58.595 --> 01:04:00.532
[distant shouting] Help me!

01:04:00.632 --> 01:04:01.834
Let's go!

01:04:01.934 --> 01:04:03.404
Somebody needs our help.

01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:04.440
Huh? Really?

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.911
[panting]

01:04:08.548 --> 01:04:10.652
Help me!

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:15.662
[animal grunting]

01:04:15.762 --> 01:04:18.000
[distorted] Help!

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.503
[growling]

01:04:19.603 --> 01:04:21.774
That's a cave raider
laying down on the ground.

01:04:21.874 --> 01:04:23.845
Maybe I can lure it away.

01:04:23.945 --> 01:04:25.147
Help me!

01:04:25.247 --> 01:04:26.350
[growling]

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:29.356
[distorted] Help... me...

01:04:29.456 --> 01:04:30.692
Help!

01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:32.296
Wait! Hold on, Reg.

01:04:32.396 --> 01:04:33.965
This whole thing
could be a trap.

01:04:34.065 --> 01:04:34.967
A trap?

01:04:35.067 --> 01:04:38.040
I think that thing
is a corpse-weeper.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.977
They mimic their
prey's cries for help

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:42.349
to lure others to
their colonies.

01:04:43.718 --> 01:04:47.626
Which means that...
that man is dead.

01:04:47.726 --> 01:04:49.964
[growling]

01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:52.101
Oh!

01:04:52.201 --> 01:04:53.538
[growling]

01:04:53.638 --> 01:04:55.040
Oh!

01:04:57.312 --> 01:04:58.548
Reg, get down!

01:04:58.648 --> 01:05:00.919
Ah!

01:05:01.019 --> 01:05:01.921
Riko!

01:05:02.021 --> 01:05:04.527
<i>Another one?</i>
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

01:05:04.627 --> 01:05:07.332
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>It's still in range.</i>

01:05:07.432 --> 01:05:08.768
<i>Just calm down.</i>

01:05:08.868 --> 01:05:10.705
<i>I cannot miss this.</i>

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.880
[Riko screams]

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.249
[gasp]

01:05:19.155 --> 01:05:20.292
Oh!

01:05:22.596 --> 01:05:24.098
Reg!

01:05:24.199 --> 01:05:25.268
<i>This is bad.</i>

01:05:25.368 --> 01:05:27.372
<i>Is this what it's</i>
<i>always like down here?</i>

01:05:27.472 --> 01:05:29.743
-Ah!
-Reg!

01:05:32.181 --> 01:05:33.618
[whimpering]

01:05:33.718 --> 01:05:35.154
[grunting]

01:05:35.254 --> 01:05:36.724
Riko!

01:05:37.426 --> 01:05:38.795
<i>Too far.</i>

01:05:38.895 --> 01:05:41.400
<i>Oh, she's being</i>
<i>fed to the chicks?</i>

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.205
Riko, no!

01:05:44.306 --> 01:05:45.342
Leave her alone!

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.245
No!

01:05:48.648 --> 01:05:50.285
Riko?

01:05:51.253 --> 01:05:52.389
<i>What?</i>

01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:55.194
<i>What can I do?</i>

01:05:55.295 --> 01:05:56.129
[gasp]

01:05:56.229 --> 01:05:59.803
[voice] <i>Where-- where am I?</i>

01:06:02.943 --> 01:06:04.446
<i>[voice] Go!</i>

01:06:05.615 --> 01:06:06.984
<i>Wait.</i>

01:06:07.084 --> 01:06:11.994
<i>This-- this feeling--</i>
<i>my body remembers this.</i>

01:06:12.563 --> 01:06:13.698
<i>It's familiar.</i>

01:06:13.798 --> 01:06:15.802
<i>I did something</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

01:06:16.504 --> 01:06:18.708
-[clanking]
-[charging up]

01:06:23.318 --> 01:06:25.722
[explosion]

01:06:25.822 --> 01:06:27.392
[screeching]

01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:42.254
[panting]

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:01.026
[Riko moaning]

01:07:04.232 --> 01:07:05.969
[sigh]

01:07:18.126 --> 01:07:22.068
I could have-- it could
have hit Riko by mistake.

01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:25.475
[heavy breathing]

01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:30.585
<i>I don't understand.</i>

01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:32.389
<i>What is this?</i>

01:07:33.524 --> 01:07:35.160
<i>What am I?</i>

01:07:44.346 --> 01:07:48.321
Oh, she doesn't really
seem to be injured.

01:07:51.427 --> 01:07:52.529
Reg?

01:07:52.629 --> 01:07:54.065
Ah! Hey!

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:55.902
Riko.

01:07:56.002 --> 01:07:57.606
You wouldn't wake up earlier.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.410
I got really worried.

01:08:01.179 --> 01:08:04.987
Uh... But you should
stay lying down.

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:10.298
You were taking so long to wake
up that I thought you were hurt

01:08:10.398 --> 01:08:14.873
and well your clothes were all
covered with vomit and stuff.

01:08:15.608 --> 01:08:16.977
Seriously, Reg.

01:08:17.078 --> 01:08:20.117
You don't really need to act
so embarrassed around me.

01:08:20.217 --> 01:08:22.422
Besides, you're the one
who swooped in and saved me

01:08:22.522 --> 01:08:23.658
from certain death.

01:08:23.758 --> 01:08:26.464
Reg, should we, uh...

01:08:28.434 --> 01:08:29.937
Huh?

01:08:33.478 --> 01:08:34.546
Huh?

01:08:34.646 --> 01:08:38.253
Did you-- did you do this, Reg?

01:08:39.122 --> 01:08:41.827
I lost myself in the moment.

01:08:41.927 --> 01:08:44.466
I can't believe I ended
up doing all this.

01:08:46.404 --> 01:08:47.472
Holy cow!

01:08:47.572 --> 01:08:50.043
It must've come out of
this thingy on your hand!

01:08:50.144 --> 01:08:52.114
We should totally
give it a name.

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:55.087
Like the "Incinerator."

01:08:55.187 --> 01:08:57.325
I think we should call it that.

01:08:57.426 --> 01:09:00.932
Riko, I'm not in the
mood for this right now.

01:09:01.032 --> 01:09:02.736
If I'd been just a
little off target

01:09:02.836 --> 01:09:05.007
I could have blown you away.

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:07.846
If that happened,
I would have lost it.

01:09:07.946 --> 01:09:09.516
Reg, it's all right.

01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:11.320
-Huh?
-Let's think.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:15.261
So it was around this
big or so, yeah?

01:09:15.361 --> 01:09:17.098
What are you talking about?

01:09:17.198 --> 01:09:19.403
The size of the blast
from your Incinerator.

01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:20.638
Reg, don't you get it?

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:22.876
You saved me the first time.

01:09:22.976 --> 01:09:25.915
That was from like
200 meters away.

01:09:26.015 --> 01:09:27.352
This is a good thing.

01:09:27.452 --> 01:09:30.725
Remember, you're able
to control that power.

01:09:30.825 --> 01:09:32.362
I can help you train.

01:09:32.462 --> 01:09:37.439
This great power you have here
is something you can master.

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:40.612
Riko.

01:09:40.712 --> 01:09:42.949
[eerie music playing]

01:09:43.718 --> 01:09:45.220
Oh.

01:09:46.022 --> 01:09:48.026
[moaning]

01:09:48.126 --> 01:09:49.663
What's wrong?

01:09:51.367 --> 01:09:52.569
Oh.

01:09:53.271 --> 01:09:54.740
Are you all right?

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.310
Hey, Reg?

01:09:58.414 --> 01:09:59.416
Hey, Reg!

01:09:59.516 --> 01:10:00.785
[thud]

01:10:00.885 --> 01:10:03.324
[chewing sounds]

01:10:04.827 --> 01:10:07.599
[Riko] Somebody help me.

01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:15.949
It's gone.
It's nowhere.

01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:19.590
Gone for good.

01:10:20.558 --> 01:10:21.560
Ah!

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.698
[Riko] It's gone!

01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:25.502
Huh?

01:10:26.704 --> 01:10:28.341
-Riko?
-Huh?

01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:30.311
Oh, Reg, you're finally awake.

01:10:30.411 --> 01:10:32.315
So, um, are you
feeling all right now?

01:10:32.415 --> 01:10:35.120
You fell asleep and I couldn't
get you wake up no matter what.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.059
Did firing that
thing wear you out?

01:10:38.159 --> 01:10:41.199
I don't really know,
but I'm fine now.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.203
That's great.
Good to hear.

01:10:43.304 --> 01:10:46.544
Anyway, so what were you
talking about just now.

01:10:46.644 --> 01:10:48.347
Oh... oh, yeah.

01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:51.252
I can't find my cave raiding
notebook anywhere.

01:10:51.353 --> 01:10:52.589
Hmm.

01:10:53.691 --> 01:10:56.330
The book you're always
drawing pictures in, right?

01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:57.332
Yeah.

01:10:57.432 --> 01:10:59.035
I guess I must have
dropped it when

01:10:59.135 --> 01:11:02.007
that corpse-weeper snatched
me up and tried to eat me.

01:11:02.642 --> 01:11:04.479
If that's the case.

01:11:09.423 --> 01:11:10.992
Well, there's nothing we can do.

01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:12.963
-Is that okay?
-Mm-hmm.

01:11:13.063 --> 01:11:14.633
But if I had to lose it,
I would have

01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:17.739
preferred to have gotten to the
bottom of the netherworld first.

01:11:17.839 --> 01:11:20.645
Because I mean, when it's found
a long time from now

01:11:20.745 --> 01:11:22.248
it'll only contain my writings

01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:24.686
up until this point,
so my righteous legend

01:11:24.786 --> 01:11:25.822
won't spread as far.

01:11:25.922 --> 01:11:27.258
[Reg] Hmm?

01:11:27.359 --> 01:11:30.030
Oh, I didn't even get
to add your Incinerator.

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:32.569
That would've been awesome
to add to your bio-page.

01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:34.573
That's my only real
regret of losing it.

01:11:34.673 --> 01:11:37.177
<i>Yeah, well I bet she</i>
<i>wrote something in there</i>

01:11:37.279 --> 01:11:39.883
<i>about my penis,</i>
<i>and that stick.</i>

01:11:39.983 --> 01:11:42.822
<i>I hope that stupid book</i>
<i>stays hidden in the darkness</i>

01:11:42.923 --> 01:11:44.359
<i>for all eternity.</i>

01:11:44.459 --> 01:11:45.962
We can always make a new book.

01:11:46.062 --> 01:11:47.299
Guh!

01:11:49.168 --> 01:11:50.738
[cheerful music]

01:12:32.589 --> 01:12:35.895
This is the real thing.
Over there.

01:12:35.995 --> 01:12:38.301
The waterfalls are
flowing upward.

01:12:40.338 --> 01:12:42.141
[wind howls]

01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:43.377
That's a problem.

01:12:43.477 --> 01:12:45.247
Not sure if you can
shoot straight.

01:12:45.348 --> 01:12:47.852
The wind down here is
blowing like crazy.

01:12:47.952 --> 01:12:51.293
I guess we can't keep taking
shortcuts like we have been.

01:12:52.094 --> 01:12:53.564
[shiver]

01:12:53.664 --> 01:12:54.800
You okay, Riko?

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.037
It feels a little colder here.

01:12:57.137 --> 01:12:58.407
Will you be okay?

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:01.347
Should I get the
cold weather gear?

01:13:01.447 --> 01:13:02.349
Mm-mm.

01:13:02.449 --> 01:13:03.951
We can't spread our
supplies out here.

01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:05.288
I'll be fine.

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:12.335
Riko, hold this for a second.

01:13:21.052 --> 01:13:22.288
This is nice!

01:13:22.389 --> 01:13:23.791
It's so warm.

01:13:23.891 --> 01:13:26.263
Try to make do with that
until we're settled down.

01:13:26.363 --> 01:13:28.267
Are you not cold at all, Reg?

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:30.538
I can feel the wind.
But no, I'm fine.

01:13:30.638 --> 01:13:32.041
Figured as much.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:35.381
Well, then I'll be
borrowing this.

01:13:37.217 --> 01:13:39.723
[voice] Master! Master!

01:13:39.823 --> 01:13:41.860
Someone's approaching.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.531
Looks like two people.

01:13:43.631 --> 01:13:48.006
One of them is a Red Whistle
and, well, the other one...

01:13:48.106 --> 01:13:51.212
the other one doesn't even
seem to be a cave raider.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:54.218
Shall I prepare the Gondola?

01:13:57.157 --> 01:13:58.561
Master?

01:14:00.063 --> 01:14:01.165
Feels better here.

01:14:01.266 --> 01:14:02.736
The winds calm down.

01:14:02.836 --> 01:14:05.742
It might be because we've left
the central part of the Abyss.

01:14:05.842 --> 01:14:07.010
Come to think of it,

01:14:07.111 --> 01:14:09.048
the creatures
are more peaceful here too.

01:14:09.148 --> 01:14:10.852
[Reg] So that's how it works?

01:14:10.952 --> 01:14:13.223
[Riko] The force field
carries light and nutrients

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:14.860
so there are more
creatures the closer you

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.463
get to the central shaft.

01:14:16.563 --> 01:14:19.101
I've also heard that when you
get farther away from the Curse

01:14:19.201 --> 01:14:20.938
it becomes a bit more bearable.

01:14:21.038 --> 01:14:22.174
[Reg] So this is it.

01:14:22.275 --> 01:14:24.546
This is the Seeker Camp.

01:14:24.646 --> 01:14:27.251
It really is quite
high up there, isn't it?

01:14:27.352 --> 01:14:29.689
Sure is.
Speaking of that...

01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:30.958
What's the matter?

01:14:31.058 --> 01:14:32.695
Well, it's just that...

01:14:32.796 --> 01:14:35.200
I always thought that the camp
was supposed to have

01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:37.071
some sort of lookout on duty.

01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:39.276
So when someone
starts approaching

01:14:39.376 --> 01:14:40.578
they're ready to
lower the Gondola

01:14:40.678 --> 01:14:42.348
and bring the cave raider up.

01:14:42.449 --> 01:14:45.488
Reg, you think you could
get a grip up that high?

01:14:45.588 --> 01:14:47.959
Maybe with both arms I can.

01:14:48.059 --> 01:14:49.329
I'll try it.

01:14:52.167 --> 01:14:53.904
[Riko] Whoa!

01:14:54.004 --> 01:14:55.908
I think I managed to--

01:14:56.008 --> 01:14:57.512
Ugh!

01:14:58.314 --> 01:15:00.117
Is there a problem, Reg?

01:15:00.217 --> 01:15:03.056
Something has grabbed on...

01:15:03.156 --> 01:15:04.726
onto my arms.

01:15:04.826 --> 01:15:05.394
Huh?

01:15:05.495 --> 01:15:07.265
[ominous music]

01:15:07.365 --> 01:15:12.342
So it seems she's alive.
That little imp.

01:15:25.868 --> 01:15:27.806
[cranking]

01:15:30.878 --> 01:15:32.749
[groaning]

01:15:39.429 --> 01:15:41.065
Riko, you all right?

01:15:41.165 --> 01:15:45.508
[woman] Well, well, nicely
done enduring the ascent.

01:15:47.412 --> 01:15:49.114
Although it's known
that the strain is

01:15:49.215 --> 01:15:51.052
somewhat lighter around here,

01:15:51.152 --> 01:15:53.924
it's still difficult on
children, as you can see.

01:16:00.136 --> 01:16:03.377
-Um, allow me to--
-Hmm?

01:16:03.477 --> 01:16:05.348
My name is Riko.

01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:10.324
[vomiting]

01:16:10.424 --> 01:16:11.693
Riko!

01:16:12.929 --> 01:16:14.231
I know who you are.

01:16:14.332 --> 01:16:16.002
You're Lyza's child, yes?

01:16:16.102 --> 01:16:17.906
-[gasp]
-[Ozen laughs]

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.876
How filthy.

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:24.486
Well, I see the boy is
having no troubles here.

01:16:24.586 --> 01:16:27.725
<i>[Reg] Now that I see her</i>
<i>up close, she's enormous.</i>

01:16:27.825 --> 01:16:30.698
<i>I'd say she's over two</i>
<i>meters tall, for sure.</i>

01:16:30.798 --> 01:16:32.502
<i>And her hair,</i>

01:16:32.602 --> 01:16:34.839
<i>how does she smooth it down</i>
<i>to look like that?</i>

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.213
<i>And then there's</i>
<i>her White Whistle.</i>

01:16:38.314 --> 01:16:40.484
<i>I can guess who she is.</i>

01:16:40.585 --> 01:16:44.459
<i>She must be Ozen,</i>
<i>Ozen the Immovable.</i>

01:16:45.361 --> 01:16:47.197
[Ozen] This whistle,

01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:49.703
I never thought I'd
ever see it again.

01:16:49.803 --> 01:16:51.740
[scraping sound]

01:16:54.779 --> 01:16:57.785
So I take it you're
Ozen the Immovable.

01:16:57.886 --> 01:16:58.988
You are, aren't you?

01:16:59.088 --> 01:17:02.295
I heard that you're the
one who found the whistle.

01:17:02.395 --> 01:17:04.131
Yes, you are correct.

01:17:04.231 --> 01:17:06.770
I am known as Ozen
the Immovable.

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:11.045
Oh, well, then I must thank
you for saving my life!

01:17:11.145 --> 01:17:12.815
[Riko groans]

01:17:13.951 --> 01:17:16.523
I heard all about
it from our leader.

01:17:16.623 --> 01:17:18.794
He said that whenever I
was born in the Abyss,

01:17:18.894 --> 01:17:20.965
I was put in a curse
repelling vessel.

01:17:21.065 --> 01:17:22.969
And then, together
you and my mother

01:17:23.069 --> 01:17:25.775
carried me all the
way to the surface.

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:26.510
I see.

01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:27.979
So you know.

01:17:28.079 --> 01:17:30.618
That contraption was
awfully cumbersome.

01:17:30.718 --> 01:17:33.490
I considered abandoning
you many times.

01:17:34.593 --> 01:17:36.263
Takes me back.

01:17:36.363 --> 01:17:39.034
We had to leave behind
that precious bell.

01:17:39.134 --> 01:17:41.807
Things could have
been so very different

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:44.946
because if I'd left you,
that kid would have ended up

01:17:45.046 --> 01:17:46.483
coming with me.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.988
Such a pity I did what I did.

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:52.194
[laughs]

01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:55.066
Master, uh...

01:17:57.104 --> 01:17:59.776
You are a Red Whistle
if I'm not mistaken.

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:04.051
You should know better, coming
down to a place like this.

01:18:06.356 --> 01:18:07.592
I had to.

01:18:07.692 --> 01:18:10.063
I was summoned to come
here by my mother.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.202
You see there?

01:18:13.304 --> 01:18:15.841
That's why we're going to the
bottom of the netherworld.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.779
So bear with me.

01:18:17.879 --> 01:18:19.616
As soon as I ask a few
things about my mother,

01:18:19.716 --> 01:18:21.252
we'll be gone
before you know it.

01:18:21.353 --> 01:18:23.490
Um, please.

01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:26.430
Ah, so that's it then?

01:18:26.763 --> 01:18:27.632
Yes.

01:18:27.732 --> 01:18:29.134
And let me guess.

01:18:29.234 --> 01:18:31.640
You reason that makes it
okay for you to come here

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.510
of your own accord.

01:18:34.312 --> 01:18:36.450
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:18:37.618 --> 01:18:39.856
With that being said,
I'm interested in how

01:18:39.956 --> 01:18:42.528
a Red Whistle even managed
to make it this far.

01:18:42.628 --> 01:18:45.200
Seems you had a
little help with that.

01:18:45.301 --> 01:18:46.570
Come, Marulk.

01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:48.106
Right. Yes, Master.

01:18:48.206 --> 01:18:52.080
Listen to what these
kids have to tell you.

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.817
You want me to do that?

01:18:55.888 --> 01:18:59.161
Should be easier for children
to talk to a fellow child.

01:18:59.262 --> 01:19:01.165
Uh... Uh...

01:19:01.266 --> 01:19:05.841
If you'll excuse me, I still
have some things to attend to.

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.914
I'll be here to see you
out tomorrow morning.

01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:13.056
Here, these are for you.
Please take one.

01:19:13.156 --> 01:19:14.459
[gasp]

01:19:14.559 --> 01:19:16.028
[Riko] Blue Whistles?

01:19:16.128 --> 01:19:18.500
[Ozen] Just while you're
here at the camp.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.471
It is only temporary, of course.

01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:22.408
It would be far
too awkward to keep

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.744
explaining to the
other cave raiders

01:19:23.844 --> 01:19:26.015
why a couple of Red
Whistles are here.

01:19:26.115 --> 01:19:29.689
As a bit of insurance,
I'll be holding on to this.

01:19:29.789 --> 01:19:33.096
I'll exchange it for those
Blue Whistles when you leave.

01:19:33.196 --> 01:19:36.168
Please stay within the
Seeker Camp for the night,

01:19:36.269 --> 01:19:39.074
and make sure you really
give yourselves a good scrub.

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:43.082
You reek of vomit.
It's revolting.

01:19:43.182 --> 01:19:44.953
[groaning]

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:51.767
Oh, first of all, allow
me to show you around.

01:19:57.645 --> 01:20:00.751
Okay, here you go.
You may use this room.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.160
-[water flowing]
-[both] Whoa!

01:20:06.997 --> 01:20:10.136
Oh, and the bath's over there.

01:20:10.236 --> 01:20:12.742
It's actually used for
washing relics, but...

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:15.180
You mind if I go first?

01:20:15.281 --> 01:20:17.150
I can't wait to get cleaned up.

01:20:18.954 --> 01:20:20.156
Huh?

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.330
[Reg] Flowers of Fortitude,

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:25.601
they're also called
Eternal Fortunes.

01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:28.072
They really are everywhere
down here, aren't they?

01:20:28.172 --> 01:20:30.243
I know you're a robot
and all, but there's

01:20:30.344 --> 01:20:31.913
something peculiar about you.

01:20:32.013 --> 01:20:34.251
Until Riko told me, I would
have sworn that you were just

01:20:34.352 --> 01:20:35.754
a regular kid.

01:20:35.855 --> 01:20:38.293
So I was a bit surprised when
I saw that your arms could

01:20:38.393 --> 01:20:39.763
extend out like they do.

01:20:39.863 --> 01:20:42.869
I am, but to tell the truth,
I don't think of myself

01:20:42.969 --> 01:20:44.037
as a robot.

01:20:44.138 --> 01:20:46.610
I don't even know
what I am really.

01:20:49.883 --> 01:20:51.118
Is there something wrong, Reg?

01:20:51.218 --> 01:20:54.091
Is it okay if
I call you Marulk?

01:20:54.191 --> 01:20:55.160
Of course.

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.565
Well, then, Marulk,
I also have something

01:20:57.665 --> 01:20:59.569
I find strange about you.

01:20:59.669 --> 01:21:01.105
And what is that?

01:21:01.205 --> 01:21:04.011
Ask whatever you want, and
I'll answer you if I can.

01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:07.485
So, like, um,
are you a boy or a girl?

01:21:07.585 --> 01:21:09.121
[gasp]

01:21:13.196 --> 01:21:15.968
[Marulk] A while back, I had
an accident and collapsed,

01:21:16.068 --> 01:21:17.905
but Master found
me and took me in.

01:21:18.005 --> 01:21:21.212
And I've been here at the
Seeker Camp ever since.

01:21:21.313 --> 01:21:24.251
[Riko] Huh? You've got no plan
to return to the surface?

01:21:24.352 --> 01:21:26.790
I'm a little too sensitive
to sunlight nowadays,

01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:29.629
so I really can't
go back up there.

01:21:30.364 --> 01:21:31.833
Oh, yeah, is that so?

01:21:31.933 --> 01:21:33.770
Yep. Now let's eat.

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:37.879
Thanks for the food.

01:21:42.321 --> 01:21:45.828
And well, ever since
Master first took me in,

01:21:45.928 --> 01:21:47.798
whenever she's gone up,
she's hired sentries

01:21:47.899 --> 01:21:49.269
to look after me.

01:21:50.236 --> 01:21:51.873
I was told I wouldn't
make it so that I

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:54.946
would no longer have to keep
returning to the surface.

01:21:55.046 --> 01:21:56.550
Of course, it's
probably something

01:21:56.650 --> 01:21:59.556
that she wanted deep down,
but I must say,

01:21:59.656 --> 01:22:02.027
I truly have been treated well.

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:04.566
She seems kind of scary,
to tell you the truth,

01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:06.603
but she's a good master,
isn't she?

01:22:06.703 --> 01:22:08.407
Oh!

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:11.145
Oh, yes, she's
definitely that.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.680
I need to go pee.

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:54.097
Uh, Miss Ozen?

01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:01.846
-[clattering]
-Huh?

01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:10.798
Is anybody in there?

01:23:10.898 --> 01:23:12.368
[slimy sound]

01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:22.053
[gasp]

01:23:26.563 --> 01:23:27.965
[screams]

01:23:34.011 --> 01:23:35.914
There, there, Riko.

01:23:36.015 --> 01:23:38.754
I used to do that, too, until
just a couple of years ago.

01:23:38.854 --> 01:23:41.526
But, Riko, how did
you end up wetting

01:23:41.626 --> 01:23:43.964
my bed instead of yours?

01:23:44.064 --> 01:23:48.139
I really did my best to
try and find a toilet,

01:23:48.239 --> 01:23:51.613
but then whenever I got
up to go and look for it,

01:23:51.713 --> 01:23:54.017
I saw something creepy.

01:23:54.117 --> 01:23:56.088
Hmm?

01:23:57.425 --> 01:24:00.331
It didn't seem to
be from this world.

01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:04.037
So I got really scared,
and I kinda ran away.

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:07.411
I was so terrified that
I dove into Reg's bed,

01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:08.580
and that's when--

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.453
[laughs] Not from this world?

01:24:11.553 --> 01:24:15.193
We've never had any reports of
ghosts or specters here before.

01:24:15.294 --> 01:24:16.696
But I... I...

01:24:16.796 --> 01:24:18.333
[Marulk] Ah, Master.

01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:20.203
Sounds like you
children are having

01:24:20.304 --> 01:24:23.109
an interesting conversation.

01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:26.416
This is... I mean
to say, I'm sorry.

01:24:27.183 --> 01:24:28.887
Oh, I understand now.

01:24:28.987 --> 01:24:32.193
It's not a matter of
you not noticing it.

01:24:32.294 --> 01:24:34.866
It's neither that
kid nor Habolg ever

01:24:34.966 --> 01:24:37.405
told you anything
about it, did they?

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.413
Um, what are you talking about?

01:24:44.117 --> 01:24:45.721
Do you really want to know?

01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:47.758
Huh?

01:24:47.858 --> 01:24:49.161
Yes, I do.

01:24:49.262 --> 01:24:53.235
In that case, you'll
need to follow me.

01:24:55.607 --> 01:24:58.112
This morning, I have
been speaking with Marulk

01:24:58.212 --> 01:25:00.183
to learn more about you two.

01:25:01.653 --> 01:25:03.356
Just to confirm what I was told,

01:25:03.457 --> 01:25:07.398
you're trying to follow your
mother Lyza's trail, correct?

01:25:07.498 --> 01:25:09.402
That's right!

01:25:09.502 --> 01:25:12.341
Of course, you're aware
this reached the surface.

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:14.746
That means Lyza is dead.

01:25:14.846 --> 01:25:17.885
This journey you're on
to meet your mother,

01:25:17.985 --> 01:25:19.789
it ends right here and now.

01:25:19.889 --> 01:25:21.393
Huh?

01:25:22.762 --> 01:25:24.532
[Riko] Please.

01:25:24.632 --> 01:25:27.905
Where exactly did you find that
whistle and the sealed letter?

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.310
At a grave, dear.

01:25:30.411 --> 01:25:32.147
What?

01:25:32.247 --> 01:25:35.888
How long has it been
since the fourth layer?

01:25:35.988 --> 01:25:39.495
In the far reaches of
the Goblets of Giants,

01:25:39.595 --> 01:25:42.133
there grows a cluster
of Eternal Fortunes,

01:25:42.233 --> 01:25:46.041
and lying there among the
petals was a lonely grave.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.411
I guess it's fitting.

01:25:47.511 --> 01:25:50.350
Lyza was always quite
fond of that place.

01:25:51.352 --> 01:25:52.220
It's not over.

01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:55.427
My mother is calling for me.

01:25:55.527 --> 01:25:56.596
[Ozen] You're wrong.

01:25:56.696 --> 01:25:58.500
That is not Lyza's handwriting.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:25:59.902
Huh?

01:26:01.071 --> 01:26:02.908
Lyza wouldn't write
something like that,

01:26:03.008 --> 01:26:04.645
not even as a sick joke.

01:26:04.745 --> 01:26:06.416
[whimpering]

01:26:06.516 --> 01:26:10.189
Tell me, what was your reason
for aiming for the bottom

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.826
of the netherworld again?

01:26:11.926 --> 01:26:13.530
Do you even know?

01:26:14.465 --> 01:26:17.671
Because I want to
see for myself.

01:26:17.772 --> 01:26:19.809
Well, isn't that a fine idea.

01:26:19.909 --> 01:26:22.515
Are you planning to
dig up her grave?

01:26:22.615 --> 01:26:24.217
I just want to find the--

01:26:24.318 --> 01:26:26.289
to find the
connection between Reg

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:28.960
and the figure
mentioned in the letter.

01:26:29.428 --> 01:26:31.131
[laughs]

01:26:31.231 --> 01:26:33.970
Is that what this is all about?

01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:46.296
Where is it you're taking us?

01:26:46.963 --> 01:26:49.402
My private chamber.

01:26:49.502 --> 01:26:53.977
You've followed me here because
you want to know the truth, yes?

01:26:56.382 --> 01:27:00.056
Then please, come inside.

01:27:07.203 --> 01:27:08.707
[nervous sighs]

01:27:18.894 --> 01:27:21.432
[Reg] What's--
What's this cube thing?

01:27:21.533 --> 01:27:24.805
[Riko] This pattern is
incredibly intricate.

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:26.910
It's at least a grade-two relic.

01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:29.982
How come in the guide
that records relics--

01:27:30.082 --> 01:27:32.488
That's right, it's not listed.

01:27:32.588 --> 01:27:34.224
It's something Lyza
personally bought

01:27:34.325 --> 01:27:36.228
before it could
be auctioned off.

01:27:36.696 --> 01:27:37.698
Huh?

01:27:37.798 --> 01:27:39.067
So then is this?

01:27:39.167 --> 01:27:41.138
Is this the
Curse-Repelling Vessel?

01:27:41.238 --> 01:27:43.543
Well, you're half right.

01:27:44.211 --> 01:27:46.683
[deep resonating tone]

01:27:48.853 --> 01:27:51.492
[Riko gasps]

01:27:51.593 --> 01:27:55.868
The Curse-Repelling Vessel,
from the deep up to the surface,

01:27:55.968 --> 01:27:57.872
creatures unable to
make the trip were

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.709
placed inside
and carried up,

01:27:59.809 --> 01:28:02.180
leaving them unaffected by
the strain of ascent,

01:28:02.281 --> 01:28:04.285
which is where it got its name.

01:28:04.385 --> 01:28:07.190
But that ended up not
being exactly the case.

01:28:07.291 --> 01:28:10.664
In fact, whatever is
placed inside is still

01:28:10.764 --> 01:28:12.301
affected by the curse.

01:28:12.401 --> 01:28:15.774
Dead or alive, it
will begin to move.

01:28:17.278 --> 01:28:19.382
[screeching]

01:28:19.482 --> 01:28:23.723
And it was all thanks to you
that I came to realize that.

01:28:23.823 --> 01:28:27.264
Did you know that at your
birth, you were stillborn?

01:28:27.364 --> 01:28:31.439
When Lyza delivered you in the
depths, you were already dead.

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:35.212
Basically, that made
you a bit of a nuisance,

01:28:35.314 --> 01:28:36.983
so I shoved you inside,

01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:39.789
but you somehow started
to come back to life.

01:28:41.359 --> 01:28:44.130
It got me feeling
nostalgic last night,

01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:46.034
so I tried putting
some of the meat

01:28:46.134 --> 01:28:49.508
that I cooked for
dinner in there.

01:28:49.609 --> 01:28:52.615
Unfortunately, it got loose
and started to roam around.

01:28:52.715 --> 01:28:55.787
After a while, much of
it eventually stopped,

01:28:55.887 --> 01:28:59.194
but half of it continued
to lurk about the camp.

01:28:59.829 --> 01:29:01.332
You know...

01:29:01.432 --> 01:29:06.074
I wonder how long you will last
down in the deepest depths.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:09.014
What's unusual is
back then, after you

01:29:09.114 --> 01:29:12.588
started to move
as well as my meat dish,

01:29:12.688 --> 01:29:16.396
both of you attempted to head
toward the center of the Abyss.

01:29:16.496 --> 01:29:18.767
Why do you think that is?

01:29:18.867 --> 01:29:21.372
You, of all people, might
have some thoughts on that.

01:29:21.472 --> 01:29:25.447
You're essentially the same as
that festering piece of meat.

01:29:25.547 --> 01:29:28.720
Please, Master,
don't tell her that.

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:32.093
Why would you say that to me?

01:29:32.193 --> 01:29:35.667
It's about time you
understand the full picture.

01:29:35.767 --> 01:29:39.342
I despise you and your
rotten half dead soul.

01:29:41.211 --> 01:29:42.381
What is it now?

01:29:42.481 --> 01:29:44.719
You want something,
Aubade child?

01:29:44.819 --> 01:29:47.624
Your story sounds quite
interesting to say the least,

01:29:47.725 --> 01:29:50.597
but I won't allow you
to hurt Riko anymore.

01:29:50.697 --> 01:29:53.002
You are being very
vindictive and mean

01:29:53.102 --> 01:29:54.338
like an immature child!

01:29:54.438 --> 01:29:57.411
Ah, yes, I used to
hear that a lot.

01:29:57.878 --> 01:29:58.913
Tell me, boy,

01:29:59.014 --> 01:30:00.650
do you have any
conception of God?

01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:02.120
[ominous music]

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.224
What's that have to
do with anything?

01:30:04.325 --> 01:30:06.663
All of those who decide
to stay down here,

01:30:06.763 --> 01:30:09.034
they don't believe in any
sort of almighty deity.

01:30:09.134 --> 01:30:10.704
[grunting]

01:30:10.804 --> 01:30:14.210
Instead, they have something
else to believe in, the truth.

01:30:14.311 --> 01:30:18.853
It's stronger than God
because it is the Abyss itself.

01:30:18.953 --> 01:30:23.363
And since its end is unknown,
that fear garners it the power

01:30:23.463 --> 01:30:25.400
to become their almighty.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.205
If it was a simple task to
head down and return home

01:30:28.306 --> 01:30:31.111
whenever anyone pleases,
the value of the relics

01:30:31.211 --> 01:30:34.285
and the faith in the
Abyss would be shaken.

01:30:36.956 --> 01:30:39.227
There's a reason
the Aubades aren't listed

01:30:39.328 --> 01:30:40.597
in any of the guides.

01:30:40.697 --> 01:30:43.168
Not because they
haven't been discovered,

01:30:43.269 --> 01:30:46.509
but because they
simply should not exist.

01:30:48.413 --> 01:30:51.753
<i>What the-- She has</i>
<i>incredible strength.</i>

01:30:51.853 --> 01:30:54.759
<i>My arm, it's creaking.</i>

01:30:54.859 --> 01:30:58.700
Boy, did I hear that you
lost all your memories?

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.806
Well, that makes my
job a little easier.

01:31:01.906 --> 01:31:04.745
I need to dispose of you before
anything comes back to you.

01:31:04.845 --> 01:31:08.853
I-- I'll just go and check
on the telescope now.

01:31:08.953 --> 01:31:11.959
Marulk, stay right there.

01:31:15.867 --> 01:31:17.771
You cannot be serious!

01:31:17.871 --> 01:31:21.144
As if I'd let things end
in a place like this!

01:31:21.244 --> 01:31:23.950
I'm going to make you let us go!

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:28.760
[Ozen] Oh, I'll let you both go
after you have ceased to move.

01:31:29.628 --> 01:31:31.432
This isn't doing
much to stop her.

01:31:31.532 --> 01:31:33.369
What in the heck is she, anyway?

01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:35.974
Your construction
appears quite remarkable.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:40.517
It's a series of strands that
have all been woven together.

01:31:41.352 --> 01:31:44.023
Well, whatever, have it back.

01:31:49.134 --> 01:31:50.604
[Reg screams]

01:31:50.704 --> 01:31:53.510
Interesting, you're much
lighter than I expected.

01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:56.114
So your sturdiness must
be your big appeal.

01:31:56.214 --> 01:31:57.985
Let's test that out.

01:32:02.059 --> 01:32:02.928
[pained grunts]

01:32:03.028 --> 01:32:04.398
[gasp]

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.675
[gasp]

01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:13.650
Well, you're stronger
than the floor anyway.

01:32:14.150 --> 01:32:15.620
Ow, that hurts.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.991
That is it.
You did it now.

01:32:18.091 --> 01:32:21.933
Hmph. You do have a fighting
spirit, I'll give you that.

01:32:22.033 --> 01:32:25.407
It makes me wonder how
much more you can take.

01:32:26.074 --> 01:32:27.076
[Riko] Stop it!

01:32:27.176 --> 01:32:28.813
No, just stop it please!

01:32:28.913 --> 01:32:29.982
You're going to crush him!

01:32:30.082 --> 01:32:31.051
Stay out of my way.

01:32:31.151 --> 01:32:32.821
[Riko screams]

01:32:37.096 --> 01:32:38.131
[whimper]

01:32:38.232 --> 01:32:39.635
Hmm?

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:44.879
Riko? Riko?

01:32:45.981 --> 01:32:47.851
<i>There's so much blood.</i>

01:32:50.357 --> 01:32:52.026
<i>Sorry for this, Marulk.</i>

01:32:52.126 --> 01:32:54.832
<i>This isn't an opponent</i>
<i>I can hold back on.</i>

01:32:54.932 --> 01:32:58.406
<i>If I don't get serious,</i>
<i>I'm done for.</i>

01:33:00.744 --> 01:33:03.850
Do you have a little
something you wish to show me?

01:33:07.089 --> 01:33:11.164
<i>If I just let it rip, the whole</i>
<i>Seeker Camp could burn down.</i>

01:33:11.265 --> 01:33:12.935
<i>Stay calm.</i>

01:33:13.035 --> 01:33:14.471
<i>Refine it.</i>

01:33:14.572 --> 01:33:16.442
<i>Thinner, sharper.</i>

01:33:16.542 --> 01:33:17.878
[footsteps]

01:33:19.348 --> 01:33:22.854
You know, since you breathe and
blink even though you are just

01:33:22.955 --> 01:33:25.727
a mechanical doll,
that means you too

01:33:25.827 --> 01:33:27.965
will be hunted by the beasts.

01:33:28.065 --> 01:33:31.539
Now what happens when your
toy here hits something?

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.977
How about we find out?

01:33:34.077 --> 01:33:35.413
Huh?

01:33:38.319 --> 01:33:39.922
[explosion]

01:33:43.663 --> 01:33:46.234
Well, isn't that impressive?

01:33:46.335 --> 01:33:48.740
It went straight through.

01:33:49.308 --> 01:33:51.512
Irredeemable!

01:33:51.612 --> 01:33:53.081
You must be put down!

01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:55.720
[slam]

01:34:02.434 --> 01:34:03.836
Huh?

01:34:08.479 --> 01:34:11.852
What the-- What's
going on with your arm?

01:34:11.953 --> 01:34:13.590
Oh, this here?

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.161
These are called
Thousand-Men Wedges.

01:34:16.261 --> 01:34:19.133
I inserted 120
points over my body.

01:34:19.233 --> 01:34:22.741
They're the secret
to all my vigor.

01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:24.812
Well, as much as you
analyze my construction,

01:34:24.912 --> 01:34:28.987
I'd say you're quite superhuman
yourself, right, Ozen?

01:34:32.059 --> 01:34:35.099
I tend to fuss over
a lot of things.

01:34:35.199 --> 01:34:38.473
I am rather old, after all.

01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:41.111
[chuckle]

01:34:41.879 --> 01:34:43.750
[whimper]

01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:45.520
[slam]

01:34:47.123 --> 01:34:48.860
[groaning]

01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:55.640
[gasp]

01:34:56.275 --> 01:34:57.844
Reg!

01:34:57.944 --> 01:35:00.082
[screaming]

01:35:00.182 --> 01:35:02.354
You're so noisy.

01:35:02.454 --> 01:35:03.956
If you think he's
so precious,

01:35:04.057 --> 01:35:06.629
you should have kept him
locked away from everyone.

01:35:06.729 --> 01:35:10.102
For some reason, he just
went limp all of a sudden,

01:35:10.202 --> 01:35:11.839
but it's no matter.

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:16.147
Sooner or later, you'll revert
back to a piece of meat anyway.

01:35:17.784 --> 01:35:20.657
Look, I didn't go into
the Abyss because I

01:35:20.757 --> 01:35:22.661
hoped to live a long life.

01:35:23.963 --> 01:35:25.232
Hmm?

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:27.404
Just a bit longer is fine,

01:35:27.504 --> 01:35:29.708
but I can never... without Reg.

01:35:29.808 --> 01:35:33.181
If Reg's not by
my side, I can't!

01:35:33.282 --> 01:35:35.085
You listen to me, Reg!

01:35:35.185 --> 01:35:37.591
Don't you lose to her!

01:35:39.461 --> 01:35:41.599
[pained groans]

01:35:43.536 --> 01:35:45.607
That will not do.

01:35:45.707 --> 01:35:48.513
Both of you are unfit for this.

01:35:50.984 --> 01:35:54.958
[hammering]

01:35:58.499 --> 01:35:59.968
Ah!

01:36:01.372 --> 01:36:03.576
[Ozen] Ah, it fit
right in there.

01:36:04.678 --> 01:36:07.249
-He's awake now.
-And he's still alive.

01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:09.020
[scream]

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.191
[crying]

01:36:11.292 --> 01:36:12.861
Riko?

01:36:12.961 --> 01:36:16.268
Reg, don't you ever
leave me like that!

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:23.215
<i>Did I just collapse again</i>
<i>and leave Riko alone?</i>

01:36:23.316 --> 01:36:25.453
Reg, watch Riko.

01:36:25.553 --> 01:36:27.824
Take care of her, you hear me?

01:36:27.924 --> 01:36:29.060
[whimpering]

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.062
<i>No.</i>

01:36:30.162 --> 01:36:32.300
[both crying]

01:36:32.401 --> 01:36:34.036
[Yerme] Now that
one's crying, too.

01:36:34.137 --> 01:36:37.544
[Zabo] Yep, looks like Ozen has
been working her magic again.

01:36:37.644 --> 01:36:39.515
[Simred] Poor little things.

01:36:39.615 --> 01:36:42.354
Who the heck are you guys?

01:36:42.454 --> 01:36:45.527
And what is it you want with us?

01:36:45.627 --> 01:36:48.466
Oh, just some cave raiders.

01:36:48.566 --> 01:36:50.537
We're Ozen's
Subterranean Bandits.

01:36:50.637 --> 01:36:52.607
They're a bunch of good
for nothings with nowhere

01:36:52.707 --> 01:36:54.845
to call home up on the surface.

01:36:54.945 --> 01:36:57.617
They were told to stay out of my
business, but Marulk over there

01:36:57.717 --> 01:36:59.388
decided to call them in.

01:36:59.488 --> 01:37:02.761
Oh, I'm sorry, Master.

01:37:02.861 --> 01:37:04.832
[Ozen] Along with a brat
who can't do anything

01:37:04.932 --> 01:37:07.838
but cry and snot all over the
place and a mechanical boy who

01:37:07.938 --> 01:37:10.209
fires his weapon
without even thinking

01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:12.213
and uncontrollably passes out.

01:37:12.314 --> 01:37:13.616
While those two over there

01:37:13.716 --> 01:37:15.987
have yet to make a
single correct decision.

01:37:16.087 --> 01:37:17.991
You acted in the most
appropriate manner

01:37:18.091 --> 01:37:20.396
to try and save
your new friends.

01:37:20.497 --> 01:37:22.734
Of course, that's my
apprentice for you,

01:37:22.834 --> 01:37:24.772
though you did disobey me.

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:27.711
Expect to be
strung up later.

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:30.149
[sigh]

01:37:31.919 --> 01:37:34.725
Ozen told us we needed to
keep hidden while the two

01:37:34.825 --> 01:37:37.096
youngsters were staying with
us here at the Seeker Camp,

01:37:37.196 --> 01:37:39.268
but with the explosions
and everything.

01:37:39.368 --> 01:37:43.576
This kid came rushing over
to us crying and screaming.

01:37:43.676 --> 01:37:45.145
Is that true, Marulk?

01:37:45.245 --> 01:37:46.816
I am so sorry.

01:37:46.916 --> 01:37:48.286
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:37:48.386 --> 01:37:51.392
I know you said you wanted
to test Lyza's kid and all,

01:37:51.492 --> 01:37:53.329
but you kind of overdid it.

01:37:53.429 --> 01:37:55.600
Wait, what do you mean by that?

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.004
It's exactly what
it sounds like, boy.

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:00.477
Are you saying that was--

01:38:00.577 --> 01:38:02.681
that was just all some sick act?

01:38:02.781 --> 01:38:05.653
You had to be tested,
and if I don't go all out,

01:38:05.753 --> 01:38:07.189
I won't get the point across.

01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:10.864
You must know that I absolutely
hate childish tricks.

01:38:10.964 --> 01:38:14.170
Then the part about
disposing of the Aubade--

01:38:14.271 --> 01:38:16.775
I never had any
intention of doing that.

01:38:16.876 --> 01:38:19.781
It's just you're too
sturdy to play with.

01:38:19.882 --> 01:38:22.521
No matter how many times I
hit you, you wouldn't break.

01:38:22.621 --> 01:38:25.259
So I got more and more
into trying to do it.

01:38:28.031 --> 01:38:30.904
The creatures that inhabit
the deeper parts of the Abyss,

01:38:31.004 --> 01:38:34.378
they are going to be far more
cunning and harsh than I am.

01:38:34.478 --> 01:38:36.982
At your current level, you
won't be able to protect her.

01:38:37.082 --> 01:38:40.623
Marulk, see that you
attend to the boy please.

01:38:40.723 --> 01:38:43.228
If he's able to fill his
belly with human food,

01:38:43.329 --> 01:38:46.100
then human medicine
should work as well.

01:38:46.201 --> 01:38:47.304
Oh, okay.

01:38:47.404 --> 01:38:49.875
If you continue pushing
on in your current state,

01:38:49.975 --> 01:38:52.112
you're going to end up as
some poor creature's meal

01:38:52.213 --> 01:38:54.150
or little seedbeds
for the Abyss,

01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:56.288
or you'll just end up a
bloody stain

01:38:56.388 --> 01:38:57.424
on the ground somewhere.

01:38:57.524 --> 01:38:59.394
That said, there's
no guarantee you

01:38:59.494 --> 01:39:02.701
won't end up the same while
I try to beat you into shape.

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:06.107
Oh, that's right.

01:39:06.207 --> 01:39:09.615
There is one thing I
was deceiving you about.

01:39:09.715 --> 01:39:12.654
That grave
I spoke of earlier...

01:39:12.754 --> 01:39:14.223
there's no one buried there.

01:39:14.324 --> 01:39:15.259
Huh?

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.729
I tell the truth.

01:39:16.829 --> 01:39:19.468
Did you think I wouldn't dig
it up and see for myself?

01:39:19.568 --> 01:39:21.772
Lyza is waiting
for you down there,

01:39:21.872 --> 01:39:24.243
and you at least need
to give it a shot.

01:39:30.423 --> 01:39:31.859
Riko?

01:39:37.437 --> 01:39:39.274
[clanking]

01:39:44.016 --> 01:39:45.887
[Ozen] How are
you feeling today?

01:39:45.987 --> 01:39:47.958
I feel all right now.

01:39:48.058 --> 01:39:49.928
[Ozen] The next group
of cave raiders

01:39:50.028 --> 01:39:51.899
will arrive in three weeks.

01:39:51.999 --> 01:39:54.236
I'll only be able to beat
you into shape until then.

01:39:54.338 --> 01:39:58.011
Whether or not it proves
successful is another story.

01:39:58.111 --> 01:40:00.082
Can you tell us
where we're headed?

01:40:00.182 --> 01:40:02.721
Somewhere even further
than the Seeker Camp.

01:40:02.821 --> 01:40:04.992
[creatures howling]

01:40:07.631 --> 01:40:10.503
[Ozen] Here, most of the
creatures are quite docile,

01:40:10.603 --> 01:40:12.774
perhaps because the force
field's light doesn't make it

01:40:12.874 --> 01:40:14.311
all the way down.

01:40:14.411 --> 01:40:17.249
Even so, creatures at this
level can see in the dark,

01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:19.288
so you'll want to
keep your guard up.

01:40:19.388 --> 01:40:21.859
Spend ten days here with
what you've got.

01:40:21.959 --> 01:40:23.963
Show me you're able to survive.

01:40:24.063 --> 01:40:28.138
But be sure not to go beyond
that Pillar Tree over there.

01:40:28.238 --> 01:40:32.314
I will consider that as
an attempt to escape.

01:40:32.414 --> 01:40:35.486
-Now then, I'm heading back.
-[both] Huh?

01:40:35.586 --> 01:40:38.559
Do your best to protect this
girl so that she doesn't end up

01:40:38.659 --> 01:40:40.430
a corpse again.

01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:44.871
In addition, you cannot use
that thing for ten days either.

01:40:46.007 --> 01:40:47.911
My Incinerator?

01:40:48.011 --> 01:40:51.184
Well, you may use it if you
wish to get Riko killed.

01:40:51.285 --> 01:40:52.119
What do you mean?

01:40:52.219 --> 01:40:53.956
Once you fire that
thing, no matter

01:40:54.056 --> 01:40:57.029
how much you push yourself,
you always faint afterwards,

01:40:57.129 --> 01:41:00.102
and then it's a full two hours
before you wake up again.

01:41:00.202 --> 01:41:03.376
During that time, even when
I punched you, slammed you

01:41:03.476 --> 01:41:06.214
to the floor, stepped on your
ribs, or dunked you in water,

01:41:06.315 --> 01:41:08.586
you were unable to get back up.

01:41:08.686 --> 01:41:11.925
What do you think will happen
to her all alone for two hours

01:41:12.026 --> 01:41:13.329
in the second layer?

01:41:13.429 --> 01:41:16.802
She will surely be torn
to shreds and eaten.

01:41:16.902 --> 01:41:19.274
Still, if you really do
have to use that thing,

01:41:19.374 --> 01:41:22.480
be sure whatever it is, it
isn't able to come after you

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.816
in the future.

01:41:23.916 --> 01:41:25.453
No matter your
opponent or whatever

01:41:25.553 --> 01:41:27.457
lies in the vicinity,
when the time comes,

01:41:27.557 --> 01:41:30.463
do not hesitate
or show any mercy.

01:41:30.563 --> 01:41:33.703
Otherwise, your grand
adventure in the Abyss

01:41:33.803 --> 01:41:36.308
will be over before it begins.

01:41:36.408 --> 01:41:38.178
Have fun.

01:41:47.229 --> 01:41:49.267
[determined grunts]

01:42:01.658 --> 01:42:03.696
[laughing]

01:42:03.796 --> 01:42:05.867
[Ozen] How's it looking?

01:42:07.102 --> 01:42:10.008
Well, that Riko certainly
seems to be plucky enough.

01:42:10.108 --> 01:42:12.146
Unfortunately, her
body can't keep up

01:42:12.246 --> 01:42:14.351
with what she wants to do.

01:42:14.451 --> 01:42:18.526
And as for her partner,
although he is extraordinarily

01:42:18.626 --> 01:42:22.333
resilient, he's constantly
losing his nerve...

01:42:22.434 --> 01:42:23.803
[screams]

01:42:23.903 --> 01:42:25.807
...which makes him
slow to react...

01:42:25.907 --> 01:42:28.612
-[Reg screams]
-[slam]

01:42:28.712 --> 01:42:31.418
...despite the fact
he's mechanical.

01:42:31.852 --> 01:42:33.289
I see.

01:42:33.389 --> 01:42:35.626
You're not going
out there to help?

01:42:35.726 --> 01:42:37.931
If they die during
training, it just

01:42:38.031 --> 01:42:40.903
means they don't have what
it takes to go any further.

01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:45.880
You're incredibly strong, Reg,
but you don't weigh very much.

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:47.182
We'll have to come
up with a plan

01:42:47.283 --> 01:42:49.354
if we want
to catch that hippo.

01:42:49.454 --> 01:42:51.992
Okay then, maybe I
could extend my arms

01:42:52.092 --> 01:42:54.397
to tie it to a
tree or something.

01:42:54.498 --> 01:42:55.800
I like it.

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:57.470
We'll have to lead
it over there.

01:42:57.570 --> 01:42:59.240
Okay, but how?

01:43:00.543 --> 01:43:01.678
Ta-da!

01:43:01.779 --> 01:43:02.680
[disgusted gasp]

01:43:02.781 --> 01:43:03.983
We'll use this.

01:43:04.083 --> 01:43:06.053
What the heck is it?
It stinks.

01:43:06.154 --> 01:43:08.526
A mix of female dung
and tree bark.

01:43:08.626 --> 01:43:11.230
I tore off a big piece
that's covered in pheromones.

01:43:11.331 --> 01:43:12.967
We'll use this to lure it in,

01:43:13.067 --> 01:43:14.304
and when it starts
to get close to us,

01:43:14.404 --> 01:43:16.240
we'll blind it
with our glow-stones.

01:43:16.341 --> 01:43:18.879
-Good?
-Uh, sure.

01:43:18.979 --> 01:43:20.115
You think this plan
is going to work?

01:43:20.215 --> 01:43:22.754
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Trust me!

01:43:22.854 --> 01:43:24.291
[fire crackling]

01:43:26.929 --> 01:43:28.432
[roaring]

01:43:39.754 --> 01:43:41.558
Reg, go! Right now!

01:43:44.331 --> 01:43:46.234
[roar]

01:43:48.238 --> 01:43:51.278
[Zabo] Be it an immature
body or weak psyche,

01:43:51.378 --> 01:43:54.384
they won't be showing
changes there anytime soon,

01:43:54.484 --> 01:43:58.057
but just as you predicted, they
are making enormous progress

01:43:58.157 --> 01:44:00.363
in the things in
which they excel.

01:44:00.463 --> 01:44:03.536
Plus, there are two
of them after all,

01:44:03.636 --> 01:44:06.140
so it's best that they learn
to depend on one another

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.977
during these times.

01:44:08.746 --> 01:44:10.750
Depend on one another, you say?

01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:12.687
Huh.

01:44:12.787 --> 01:44:15.125
[girl] <i>Ozen? Ozen?</i>

01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:19.267
Ozen, what's up with your hair?

01:44:19.367 --> 01:44:21.070
It's like some sort of helmet.

01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:23.309
Oh, great.
It's you again.

01:44:23.409 --> 01:44:26.113
I've already kicked you twice,
but you keep coming back.

01:44:26.214 --> 01:44:28.552
So what's up
with it anyway?

01:44:29.554 --> 01:44:30.456
You want to know?

01:44:30.556 --> 01:44:33.395
My hair covers up
all my battle scars.

01:44:33.495 --> 01:44:36.401
As your mind comes under attack
in the depths of the Abyss,

01:44:36.501 --> 01:44:39.507
gradually the effects
show up physically.

01:44:39.608 --> 01:44:42.814
They don't manifest immediately
like the sixth layers Curse,

01:44:42.914 --> 01:44:45.586
but if you tread the boundaries
of sanity as well as life

01:44:45.686 --> 01:44:49.661
and death, the skin on your
head eventually gets twisted.

01:44:49.761 --> 01:44:51.732
That's pretty awesome.

01:44:51.832 --> 01:44:53.067
If you can't keep
your mouth shut,

01:44:53.167 --> 01:44:54.804
I'll be forced to
kick you again.

01:44:54.905 --> 01:44:56.975
It's true, though.
It's awesome.

01:44:57.075 --> 01:44:58.712
Even as the netherworld
tries to break you,

01:44:58.812 --> 01:45:02.052
those scars are proof of your
fortitude in challenging it.

01:45:02.152 --> 01:45:05.893
Ozen the Immovable, the
genuine White Whistle,

01:45:05.993 --> 01:45:09.801
I would be most honored if you
would be my mentor in training.

01:45:11.037 --> 01:45:12.172
Who did this?

01:45:12.273 --> 01:45:13.342
Just you wait.

01:45:13.442 --> 01:45:16.213
I'll find them and
annihilate them.

01:45:16.315 --> 01:45:18.151
What's the matter, Ozen?

01:45:18.251 --> 01:45:20.221
You giving up already?

01:45:20.323 --> 01:45:25.198
This is beautiful, a whole
field of Flowers of Fortitude.

01:45:25.299 --> 01:45:27.102
It doesn't even feel
like we're in the middle

01:45:27.202 --> 01:45:28.939
of the netherworld.

01:45:29.039 --> 01:45:31.077
I'd like you to meet
Torka from my squad.

01:45:31.177 --> 01:45:32.880
We just got married!

01:45:32.981 --> 01:45:34.784
[echoing thud]

01:45:36.922 --> 01:45:39.694
[music playing]

01:45:41.932 --> 01:45:43.502
I'm sorry, Ozen.

01:45:43.602 --> 01:45:48.279
Do you mind just giving
me a little time alone?

01:45:49.347 --> 01:45:51.852
[Ozen] This is
unbelievable, maddening.

01:45:51.952 --> 01:45:55.793
First, Torka takes it
upon himself to pass away.

01:45:57.330 --> 01:46:00.269
Then their baby makes its way
into this world stillborn.

01:46:00.369 --> 01:46:02.974
And of course, you
would have the audacity

01:46:03.074 --> 01:46:05.346
to leave its delivery
all up to me.

01:46:05.446 --> 01:46:08.519
Why did you and Dumb Face
have to come along anyway?

01:46:08.619 --> 01:46:11.525
Lyza had finally just
started to find herself,

01:46:11.625 --> 01:46:13.696
and now she gets
treated like this.

01:46:14.397 --> 01:46:16.167
Truly heartbreaking.

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:20.509
[Ozen] I never wanted to
see her in such a state.

01:46:20.609 --> 01:46:22.547
I haven't much strength left.

01:46:22.647 --> 01:46:25.018
Perhaps I could leave this
thing behind and just carry up

01:46:25.118 --> 01:46:27.290
Lyza and the Bell instead.

01:46:28.892 --> 01:46:30.028
[muffled cries]

01:46:30.128 --> 01:46:31.097
[gasp]

01:46:31.197 --> 01:46:33.702
[crying continues]

01:46:38.278 --> 01:46:40.549
You can't be serious.

01:46:40.649 --> 01:46:43.455
It appears I have taken
on yet another burden.

01:46:44.223 --> 01:46:46.027
You can relax, child.

01:46:46.127 --> 01:46:49.367
I am cursed with a
strong sense of duty.

01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:59.387
Oh?

01:47:04.664 --> 01:47:06.935
[sighing]

01:47:12.079 --> 01:47:13.181
[sigh]

01:47:13.282 --> 01:47:14.617
[laughs]

01:47:14.718 --> 01:47:17.055
Um, are you doing
all right, Riko?

01:47:17.155 --> 01:47:18.625
Yeah...

01:47:18.726 --> 01:47:22.500
For some reason, it feels like
ages since we were last here.

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.205
You've been gone
exactly ten days.

01:47:25.306 --> 01:47:27.109
Good work out there, Reg.

01:47:27.209 --> 01:47:29.547
Both of you are some
bona fide cave raiders.

01:47:29.647 --> 01:47:30.649
Hmm?

01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:33.154
On my trip, I was
crying right away.

01:47:33.254 --> 01:47:34.791
When you get further
out than the camp,

01:47:34.891 --> 01:47:36.595
it's almost completely dark.

01:47:36.695 --> 01:47:39.801
So when Master left me,
I had no idea where I was.

01:47:44.577 --> 01:47:48.452
I must confess, at one point
along the way near the end

01:47:48.552 --> 01:47:50.523
when I got separated
from Riko,

01:47:50.623 --> 01:47:52.427
I started to feel
pretty hopeless.

01:47:52.527 --> 01:47:54.664
Really? Is that true?

01:47:54.764 --> 01:47:55.933
Absolutely, I did.

01:47:56.033 --> 01:47:58.137
[Marulk] So you can
get scared, too?

01:47:58.237 --> 01:48:00.910
-Mm-hmm.
-That makes me feel better.

01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:02.313
Are you hungry at all?

01:48:02.413 --> 01:48:04.517
I'll bring you guys some food.

01:48:07.557 --> 01:48:10.629
So we've been gone
ten days, huh?

01:48:12.467 --> 01:48:14.236
Now that I think
about it, the pain

01:48:14.337 --> 01:48:17.877
from all of Ozen's
thrashing is gone.

01:48:17.977 --> 01:48:19.179
[electrical noise]

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:22.487
Yes, restoration complete.

01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:26.962
The pattern, is it
always like that?

01:48:27.062 --> 01:48:28.298
Well, that's weird.

01:48:28.398 --> 01:48:30.336
I wonder what it could mean.

01:48:30.436 --> 01:48:31.938
I guess that settles it.

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:35.011
I'm never going to be
able to put on any muscle.

01:48:35.111 --> 01:48:36.213
Reg! Riko!

01:48:36.314 --> 01:48:37.617
Master says now
that you're back,

01:48:37.717 --> 01:48:39.687
we should all sit down
and have a meal together.

01:48:39.788 --> 01:48:40.990
Food!

01:48:42.994 --> 01:48:46.935
So how was it out there having
to spend ten days on your own?

01:48:47.035 --> 01:48:49.641
It was really nerve wracking,
wouldn't you say?

01:48:49.741 --> 01:48:51.010
Yeah, totally.

01:48:51.110 --> 01:48:53.615
Looking back, though, it feels
like it was over really fast.

01:48:53.715 --> 01:48:55.719
It's said, don't stay
in the deep layers

01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:58.024
if you don't want to kill
those who are waiting for you.

01:48:58.124 --> 01:49:01.565
That old saying has been passed
down for a long, long time.

01:49:01.665 --> 01:49:03.535
[Reg] What does
that even mean?

01:49:03.635 --> 01:49:06.006
It can be particularly
twisted down

01:49:06.106 --> 01:49:07.777
in the depths of
the fifth layer.

01:49:07.877 --> 01:49:10.583
I intended to stay down there
but for a few weeks,

01:49:10.683 --> 01:49:12.453
only when I finally returned
to the surface,

01:49:12.553 --> 01:49:14.290
a few months had passed by.

01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:17.296
Such episodes can
be quite common.

01:49:17.396 --> 01:49:21.170
So that rumor is
actually true then?

01:49:21.271 --> 01:49:23.140
It's no rumor, child.

01:49:23.241 --> 01:49:25.044
I'm telling you flat out.

01:49:26.348 --> 01:49:29.253
You see, only those
with enigmatic desires,

01:49:29.354 --> 01:49:30.856
such as the White Whistles,

01:49:30.956 --> 01:49:33.562
would ever make a home in the
deep layers of the netherworld.

01:49:33.662 --> 01:49:35.666
You probably think
it has nothing really

01:49:35.766 --> 01:49:38.872
to do with you since you plan on
making a journey of no return,

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:40.976
but the problem is
that we can't even

01:49:41.076 --> 01:49:43.749
estimate the extent to which
this aberration manifests

01:49:43.849 --> 01:49:46.788
in the depths of the
sixth and seventh layers.

01:49:46.888 --> 01:49:49.460
I have a feeling that
perhaps not as much time

01:49:49.561 --> 01:49:52.667
has actually passed for
Lyza as we might think.

01:49:54.203 --> 01:49:56.508
It's been ten years
on the surface,

01:49:56.608 --> 01:49:58.712
but if we assume only a
fraction of that has actually

01:49:58.812 --> 01:50:00.883
passed at the bottom
of the netherworld,

01:50:00.983 --> 01:50:02.787
then don't you get the
feeling there's

01:50:02.887 --> 01:50:06.494
a chance that your mother is
still very much alive and well?

01:50:06.595 --> 01:50:08.599
I do. Yes, I do.

01:50:08.699 --> 01:50:10.669
[laughs] Thank you, Ozen!

01:50:10.769 --> 01:50:12.373
-[smack]
-[whimpering]

01:50:12.473 --> 01:50:14.544
Well, even so, you
should do your best

01:50:14.644 --> 01:50:16.948
not to stay in the
fifth layer too long.

01:50:17.048 --> 01:50:18.552
And why is that exactly?

01:50:18.652 --> 01:50:20.956
So that you don't
accidentally bump into any

01:50:21.056 --> 01:50:22.627
of the other White Whistles.

01:50:22.727 --> 01:50:25.266
The netherworld's fifth layer
is called the Sea of Corpses.

01:50:25.366 --> 01:50:28.505
It's as deep as humans can
go and still return alive.

01:50:28.605 --> 01:50:29.674
[bones cracking]

01:50:29.774 --> 01:50:31.143
So you can be
certain some of them

01:50:31.243 --> 01:50:32.947
are going to be down there.

01:50:33.047 --> 01:50:34.249
Bondrewd in particular

01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:37.055
is an out and out
reckless scoundrel.

01:50:37.155 --> 01:50:38.725
He's not nearly as kind as I am.

01:50:38.825 --> 01:50:40.396
So you should try to be careful.

01:50:40.496 --> 01:50:41.565
Seriously?

01:50:41.665 --> 01:50:43.268
Is that some kind of joke?

01:50:43.368 --> 01:50:44.938
[smack]

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:46.975
Are you okay, Reg?

01:50:47.075 --> 01:50:48.612
Ah, that's right.

01:50:48.712 --> 01:50:51.518
On the subject of
your dear mother,

01:50:51.618 --> 01:50:53.956
In the letter it said,
"At the netherworld's bottom,

01:50:54.056 --> 01:50:55.726
I'll be waiting."

01:50:55.826 --> 01:50:58.030
I would like to know
who actually wrote that.

01:50:58.130 --> 01:50:59.767
Huh?

01:50:59.867 --> 01:51:02.673
Using old nether glyphs without
any of the simplified forms.

01:51:02.773 --> 01:51:05.178
And not just that, but
the paper it's written on

01:51:05.279 --> 01:51:06.246
isn't even paper.

01:51:06.348 --> 01:51:08.250
It's some form of relic.

01:51:08.352 --> 01:51:10.356
It looks worn out,
but its durability

01:51:10.456 --> 01:51:12.225
is rather astonishing.

01:51:12.326 --> 01:51:15.866
Not even with my strength
can it be torn apart.

01:51:16.835 --> 01:51:18.505
Just what in the
world is waiting

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:21.411
at the bottom of the
netherworld with your mother?

01:51:21.511 --> 01:51:23.682
One way to find out.

01:51:25.051 --> 01:51:28.859
Well, then both
of you, follow me.

01:51:33.969 --> 01:51:35.572
This is for you.

01:51:38.345 --> 01:51:39.647
What is it?

01:51:39.747 --> 01:51:43.087
This is the Blaze Reap,
Everlasting Pickaxe.

01:51:43.187 --> 01:51:44.724
You are correct.

01:51:46.026 --> 01:51:48.999
Remember the grave marker in
the cluster of Eternal Fortunes

01:51:49.099 --> 01:51:50.201
I spoke of?

01:51:50.302 --> 01:51:52.005
Well, this is it.

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:53.909
This belonged to my mother.

01:51:54.009 --> 01:51:55.713
Riko?

01:51:55.813 --> 01:51:58.552
The everlasting gunpowder
inside it is fine,

01:51:58.652 --> 01:52:00.889
but the casing is
in poor condition.

01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:04.196
It can be used a few
more times at best.

01:52:04.297 --> 01:52:06.468
As far as Lyza is concerned,
I'm sure she's already

01:52:06.568 --> 01:52:09.206
found herself a new
weapon at this point.

01:52:11.711 --> 01:52:13.915
If you like, I will
teach you how to use it.

01:52:14.016 --> 01:52:17.490
It'll be an alternative to
that Incinerator of yours.

01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:19.159
You really mean that?

01:52:19.259 --> 01:52:21.665
I can't thank you enough!

01:52:23.468 --> 01:52:25.004
[Yerme] So you're already
heading out, huh?

01:52:25.104 --> 01:52:27.743
[Zabo] It's going to be
lonely around here.

01:52:27.843 --> 01:52:29.046
Sorry.

01:52:29.146 --> 01:52:31.584
I know it's kind of cold
Ozen not to come see you off.

01:52:31.685 --> 01:52:33.622
No, no, it's all right.

01:52:34.957 --> 01:52:37.363
She's already given
us so much, really.

01:52:37.463 --> 01:52:39.500
She's taught us so
many things here.

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:42.105
I mean, it wouldn't be right
to ask any more of her.

01:52:42.205 --> 01:52:43.475
Well, well.

01:52:43.575 --> 01:52:45.312
Despite all appearances,
you're quite humble.

01:52:45.412 --> 01:52:46.414
Hey, leave her alone.

01:52:46.514 --> 01:52:48.084
[whimper]

01:52:48.184 --> 01:52:49.320
[Riko] Marulk...

01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:50.656
Huh?

01:52:50.756 --> 01:52:52.960
Well, you take care, okay?

01:53:04.116 --> 01:53:05.719
[gentle music plays]

01:53:05.819 --> 01:53:10.329
[Marulk] I... I find it hard
to say this, but if you guys

01:53:10.429 --> 01:53:11.931
come back and say
that it's impossible

01:53:12.031 --> 01:53:14.704
and you're not going, it's okay.

01:53:15.639 --> 01:53:17.242
Oh, Marulk.

01:53:17.343 --> 01:53:18.278
[crying]

01:53:18.378 --> 01:53:19.747
Yeah, I know.

01:53:19.847 --> 01:53:21.751
It's just that I've watched
so many people leave us

01:53:21.851 --> 01:53:23.822
and never come back again,

01:53:23.922 --> 01:53:28.064
and now today is the saddest
that I've ever felt.

01:53:28.164 --> 01:53:29.700
[crying]

01:53:39.387 --> 01:53:40.823
[Ozen] Well, there it is.

01:53:40.923 --> 01:53:42.993
As expected, Reg
and the girl were

01:53:43.094 --> 01:53:46.066
quick to pick up on the
cave raiding techniques.

01:53:46.166 --> 01:53:48.672
Although I didn't want to
let them go until a few more

01:53:48.772 --> 01:53:50.909
memories came back to me.

01:53:51.009 --> 01:53:55.853
Well, nothing I can do about it,
right, my dear Lyza?

01:53:57.055 --> 01:53:59.660
That baby of yours
crawled toward the Abyss

01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:02.031
the moment she was let out
of the vessel,

01:54:02.132 --> 01:54:04.771
which always seemed
just a bit disturbing.

01:54:04.871 --> 01:54:07.810
[Lyza] Thanks to you,
she's incredibly energetic.

01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:10.649
My apprentice is
already fed up with her.

01:54:10.749 --> 01:54:12.853
Well, isn't that splendid?

01:54:12.953 --> 01:54:15.926
Wait, so you have your
own apprentice now?

01:54:16.026 --> 01:54:18.865
His name's Jiruo.
You've met him before.

01:54:18.965 --> 01:54:22.439
Oh, that rash, shameless
boy who had the audacity

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.477
to turn down my invitation?

01:54:24.577 --> 01:54:27.850
The fact that she hasn't dropped
dead or been killed by now

01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:29.954
means you're doing a
good job of keeping

01:54:30.054 --> 01:54:32.493
that runt of yours
hidden away, but suppose

01:54:32.593 --> 01:54:34.330
it came to light who she is.

01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:36.868
If you're lucky, she'd be
kidnapped and held hostage,

01:54:36.968 --> 01:54:39.206
but if you're not lucky,
you know exactly what

01:54:39.307 --> 01:54:40.576
would happen to her.

01:54:40.676 --> 01:54:42.780
[laughs] It'll be all right.

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:45.652
My apprentice is a
top-notch caretaker.

01:54:46.521 --> 01:54:48.023
Be that as it may,

01:54:48.123 --> 01:54:52.533
my daughter Riko
is incredibly precious to me.

01:54:52.633 --> 01:54:56.474
No matter the relic or whatever
else I could offer as payment,

01:54:56.574 --> 01:54:57.910
it's not enough.

01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:00.449
Thanks to a myriad
of priceless things,

01:55:00.549 --> 01:55:02.386
that girl is alive right now.

01:55:02.486 --> 01:55:04.557
If I continue to
stay with her,

01:55:04.657 --> 01:55:06.628
I'm liable to take away
her right to set off

01:55:06.728 --> 01:55:08.498
on adventures of her own.

01:55:08.598 --> 01:55:10.869
Plus, I myself
would likely give up

01:55:10.969 --> 01:55:13.140
trying to reach for the Abyss.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.111
So before that happens,

01:55:15.211 --> 01:55:18.485
I am going to head out so
my girl's free to choose

01:55:18.585 --> 01:55:20.054
the path she wishes.

01:55:20.154 --> 01:55:21.791
[Ozen laughs]

01:55:23.762 --> 01:55:26.668
I suppose that's one
way of putting it.

01:55:26.768 --> 01:55:30.342
It's more likely simply
your urge to see the bottom.

01:55:30.442 --> 01:55:35.017
Hey, Ozen, if Riko sets
out to reach the bottom

01:55:35.117 --> 01:55:38.825
and ends up standing before you,
I'd like you to tell her.

01:55:38.925 --> 01:55:41.931
You mean tell her about how
she's actually a living corpse?

01:55:42.031 --> 01:55:44.035
Yes, that's right.

01:55:44.537 --> 01:55:45.539
[chuckle]

01:55:45.639 --> 01:55:47.443
[wind picks up]

01:55:50.147 --> 01:55:54.357
And tell her what a miracle it
is she is alive in this world

01:55:54.457 --> 01:55:57.228
and how to tackle the
magnificent obstacles she'll

01:55:57.329 --> 01:55:59.767
find along the way.

01:56:01.738 --> 01:56:03.575
Yeah, I don't know about that.

01:56:03.675 --> 01:56:05.479
You can do it yourself.

01:56:05.579 --> 01:56:09.252
But if we're just talking about
sending her down to you,

01:56:09.353 --> 01:56:11.424
that I can do, Lyza.

01:56:17.201 --> 01:56:20.676
Oh, Lyza, you're irredeemable.

01:56:20.776 --> 01:56:24.215
So very irredeemable.

01:56:35.672 --> 01:56:40.382
[Reg] The Inverted Forest...
it's so far above us.

01:56:40.716 --> 01:56:42.018
Reg?

01:56:42.118 --> 01:56:43.187
Huh?

01:56:47.663 --> 01:56:49.267
Are you ready to do this?

01:56:49.367 --> 01:56:51.103
Yes, of course.

01:56:53.308 --> 01:56:56.914

01:56:59.587 --> 01:57:05.599

01:57:17.489 --> 01:57:22.131
