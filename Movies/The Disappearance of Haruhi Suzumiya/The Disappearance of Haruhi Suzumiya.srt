940
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,167
The morning of December sixteen.

941
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:15,573
It was so cold, and I mean cold,

2141
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,534
that if you took an ice pick, plunged it into the ground,

1731
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,261
you'd shatter the earth into a million pieces.

189
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,550
Shut up...

670
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,160
It's cold... cold, cold...

190
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,630
Hey, Kyon!

256
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,573
Wakey wakey!

2076
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:09,630
Mom told me to tell you to make sure you eat breakfast.

1315
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,120
And you'd better eat yours too, Shami!

1383
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:17,490
Shami! Shami! Breakfast time for Shami!

432
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:22,105
Cold... So cold...

96
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:31,399
Stand.

17
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:34,312
Bow!

641
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,930
Thank you for the lesson!

519
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,581
That's all for today.

2049
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,756
It was nice and warm up until the School Art Festival.

548
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,860
But when December hit,

1134
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,284
the temperature dropped super fast,

1861
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,990
like it was making up for lost time or something.

2142
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:54,500
It felt like Japan just decided to skip Fall this year...

1257
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:57,626
Or better yet, maybe the guy upstairs

1258
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,316
confused the prayer for more business

1812
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,769
with a spell to change the weather or something.

485
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,370
Siberian air mass...

2175
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,730
Seriously, I know you have to stick to your route and all,

1316
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:08,930
but you could skip us once in a while.

1979
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,823
It's like the seasons are out of whack or something.

1862
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh, great. Now I'm worried about the environment.

879
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,847
Yeah, well, I might be worried,

992
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:20,276
but it's not like I'm gonna do
anything about it, too much work.

276
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,651
Hey, Koizumi.

372
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,058
Oh, hello there.

373
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Class duty, huh?

277
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:27,206
That's right.

1
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,780
Hm?

993
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:34,315
You've got that worried look
on your face again. What's wrong?

1589
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,820
Haruhi's sort of been hyped up all morning.

746
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:42,036
Oh? About the you-know-what?

257
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,050
You know it.

614
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,270
Come on, Koizumi. Hurry!

322
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,210
Right, coming.

191
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,700
Pardon me.

109
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,980
See ya.

571
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,331
The you-know-what, huh?

323
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,050
Oh, brother...

671
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,745
Man, everyday's been cold.

402
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,011
Tell me about it.

2077
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,612
With all the exercise we're getting climbing this hill,

1813
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,823
who needs gym class? They should just cancel it.

520
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:10,339
That will be the day.

1590
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:12,847
You guys sound like a couple of old fogies.

1317
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,448
Look at this, see? Not even a sweater!

2176
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,870
Winter's perfect for me. I'll let the suckers have summer.

1061
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,150
Where do you get your energy from?

1443
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:23,542
Sprinkle some on me some time, would ya?

2
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,605
Hm?

1814
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:28,698
Do either of you guys know what day it is today?

747
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,456
It's December the sixteenth.

324
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:31,490
What about it?

994
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,466
What do you mean "What about it"?

995
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,236
There's a week left before the
one day that's guaranteed to make

1062
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,308
any person's heart dance with joy!

1135
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,144
Oh, you mean the year-end assembly.

2110
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to winter vacation.

1815
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,410
No, no, no, not that! Come on, try and remember.

1546
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,690
Eight days from now... An important day...

672
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,770
Hearts dancing with joy...

1136
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:54,980
You know what day I'm talking
about just do the math. Eight days.

615
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,167
Humph, of course I know.

821
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,606
Ah, hey, Kyon! How's it going?

258
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,776
Hello there.

1444
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,231
Miss Asahina, Miss Tsuruya, how are you?

2111
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:08,503
What's up with your face today? You look all bummed out.

880
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,589
Young man, you'd better turn
that frown upside down, nyoron!

486
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,315
See you later, Kyon!

192
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,761
Sure. Bye.

1318
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,417
I'll be there in a bit. I have to
take care of a couple of things first.

167
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,847
Oh, okay.

1259
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,050
Do I know what's happening next week?

2050
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,386
This so-called event that's making everyone freak out.

353
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,739
Of course I do.

1900
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,683
It's easy when the person in the seat behind me
makes it her mission to keep track of such things.

1260
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,565
She's the general manager of all the
trouble I've gotten into since April.

1591
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,839
She's the root of all evil in the universe,

1772
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,636
the person behind every threat to my existence.

325
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,510
Yeah... Her...

1901
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,190
What am I doing? Miss Asahina isn't even in there.

403
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:20,987
Just you, Nagato?

996
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,776
Come on, heater, do your thing...

748
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,456
Kept you waiting, didn't I?!

226
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,698
Not at all.

1980
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,636
Does any one have plans next week for Christmas Eve?

455
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,805
I freaking knew it.

2143
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:39,448
I'm pretty sure you've got nothing going on, right, Kyon?

1863
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,560
We all know you don't have much of a social life.

1261
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,730
And I'm only asking because I
didn't want you to feel like a loser.

1644
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,886
Yeah, what if I did have something going on?

1137
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,409
Tell me what you're planning first!

572
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,784
You're free, I knew it.

573
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:51,080
How about you, Koizumi?

1864
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:53,495
I bet you got a date with a girlfriend, don't ya?

1941
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,878
It would be wonderful if that were indeed the case.

714
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,380
However, believe it or not,

1445
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,000
my schedule prior to Christmas Eve is
completely open and flexible at present.

1865
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,416
To tell the truth, I was getting a little worried

1384
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,089
about how I was going to pass the time.

1902
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,240
Liar! You made yourself free on purpose! Admit it!

1645
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,326
Well, now, you don't have to worry about it!

997
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,170
Besides, this will be way better.

549
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,340
How about you, Mikuru?

822
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,996
You've probably got plans too,

1319
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,306
like maybe someone ask you to go watch

2112
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,040
the moment that rain turns to snow in the dead of night!

1138
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,855
Suddenly, she's from the Showa era.

1903
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,612
Actually, I don't have anything planned next week.

326
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:27,623
Dead of night?

1385
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,909
You could go out with me, Miss Asahina.

54
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:30,396
Yuki?

139
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,776
Nothing.

140
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,136
Awesome!

18
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,222
Wow!

616
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,440
Okay then, it's settled!

1262
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:45,660
Since nobody has plans for next week,

1866
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:48,550
we're gonna throw an SOS Brigade Christmas Party!

1263
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,894
As usual, if there're any objections,

1063
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,406
you can file them after the event,

1646
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,784
I promise I'll take them into consideration.

1687
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,573
And as usual, she's doing whatever she wants.

1501
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,920
She did ask if everyone had plans though.

1386
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,020
I guess she's making a little progress.

1647
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,862
Um, what are we going to do with this party?

1732
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,940
That's exactly what we're going to figure out!

574
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,510
Today is the sixteenth,

1446
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,586
so that gives us eight days to get ready

1547
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,745
for the plan all the fun we're gonna have!

1733
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:15,326
Anyway, I went ahead and picked up some stuff.

278
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,089
Check it out!

2015
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,376
This will help everyone get into the Christmas spirit

2051
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,120
and make this party the coolest thing we've ever done!

782
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,167
Oh, great, more knick-knacks!

1198
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Where did she find that junk anyway?

823
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:26,446
This will help brighten up our

1447
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,011
drab little club room like never before!

1773
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,823
Didn't you used to do this when you were a kid?

1264
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,089
Yeah, well, I never really wanted to,

1139
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,634
but every year I was forced to help

1774
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,886
my little sister get her room all Christmas-up.

1199
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,586
Even though she is eleven years old,

1064
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,253
she still believes in Santa Claus.

2113
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,670
And it looks I'll have to do it again for her this year.

1548
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,144
You know, you could learn a lot from
your kid sister's pure and innocent heart.

1320
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,370
You have to believe in a dream if
you wanna have one in the first place.

942
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,839
If you don't believe, even the
dreams that can come true won't!

550
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,815
You're wearing it now?

1065
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,530
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

1321
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,815
When it's Christmas, it's only logical
that we follow the rules of Christmas!

1448
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,980
Getting into the vibe is gonna be easy,
'cause everybody likes birthday parties.

1322
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,836
And I know for a fact, when Mr. Christ
looks down and sees us all having fun,

783
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,901
it's gonna make him so happy!

55
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,370
Uh...

824
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,644
And who's gonna clean that up?

404
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,612
Me, that's who...

168
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,940
Uh-huh...

97
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,253
Sweet!

1323
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,722
Not that I care, but if you look at
that from the outside, it's backwards.

374
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,972
I almost forgot!

1904
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,882
I bought Mikuru a kind of early Christmas present.

881
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,565
Really? How you shouldn't have!

56
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,886
Tada!

715
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,116
Miss Suzumiya, please wait!

716
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,558
Whatever, come take it off!

749
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,390
I-I can do it myself, Don't…

825
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,016
I feel bad for Miss Asahina...

1867
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:17,589
But as long as she lets Miss Suzumiya have a way,

2016
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:20,214
I don't have to worry about anything worse happening.

1449
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,722
Closed Space and Shinjin, is that right?

1981
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:30,347
Those are the two things myself and the
organization fear more than anything else, for real.

1265
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:33,417
Since the spring, the number of
occurrences has dropped considerably.

826
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,362
But we're still on high alert.

1734
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,761
So they're still happening every now and then?

1648
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,862
Of course. However, the phenomena now take
place exclusively between midnight and dawn.

943
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,105
One theory is that when she's
dreaming if she has a nightmare,

1450
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:49,948
she creates Closed Space subconsciously.

2177
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:53,595
Man, she's trouble when she's awake and when she's asleep.

354
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,925
No, not at all!

1775
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:59,659
Ever since she started high school, it's been
my job to observe Miss Suzumiya's every action.

1942
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:04,659
And at the beginning, I never would have imagined
I'd see her smiling and having fun like she is now.

1200
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:06,796
The fact is, ever since she met you,

1502
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,180
Miss Suzumiya's mental state has been
more stable than ever was in junior high.

227
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,482
Yeah, sure.

2178
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,823
There's no doubt in my mind that Miss Suzumiya is changing

1066
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,980
changing in a good way, of course.

1266
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,933
And it's obvious that everyone around
her is also changing for the better.

1735
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,792
I'm talking about you and me and Miss Asahina.

827
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:29,433
And probably Miss Nagato, too.

828
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,136
He picked up on that too, huh.

1503
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:36,355
I'm surprised he noticed the little ways
in which Nagato's been changing recently.

327
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,522
Okay, come in!

3
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:39,933
Ow!

944
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,198
What're you doing, you pervert?!

829
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,640
I've dived and gone to heaven!

1649
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,620
Oh, Goddess Asahina, shine your grace on me!

1943
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:51,940
How dare you peep at Mikuru's panties like a creep!

2078
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:54,261
I never thought in a million years you dare to do that!

1067
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,198
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

998
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,020
Would you knock it off? I didn't
see anything. It was an accident!

1387
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,472
Oh, okay then. I'm sorry I overreacted.

617
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,433
Wow, that's some outfit.

2079
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,730
I hope that you don't think I'm being too forward here,

1905
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,964
but I have to admit that costume suits you to a T.

57
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:12,440
Yeah.

1776
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,386
You hear that! You're crazy cute, so stand
up straight and carry yourself with confidence.

1504
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:22,720
Now you're the official Santa Poster-girl
for the SOS Brigade's Christmas Party!

1906
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,042
It's an honor to be a sex symbol, don't you think?

279
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,740
I guess so...

2017
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,331
Holy beings! This is way sexier than the maid outfit!

1140
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:37,081
Well, there you have it. That's
how I spent December the sixteenth.

1688
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:45,362
It's the morning of December the seventeenth.

575
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,058
A Christmas Party, huh?

2018
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:57,987
Definitely sounds like something Suzumiya would pull.

521
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,630
And in the club room.

1982
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:02,370
Just make sure the teachers don't find out about it.

1141
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,769
Or you'll just cause trouble again.

1324
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:09,589
So you're gonna come hang out or what?

717
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,355
Haha! You gotta be kidding!

1689
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:16,628
Super sorry, Kyon, but I don't have got time
for one of your chintzy little get-togethers.

1267
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,970
What's up with the creepy laugh, man?

1068
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,542
Believe it or not, I've got plans.

1388
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,237
Hanging out with your freaky
friends at the school on Christmas Eve.

718
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,570
Man, that's what losers do.

1142
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,339
And I hate to break it to you
buddy, but I'm not a loser anymore.

882
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,196
Are you telling me you got a...

1201
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,886
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

1202
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:38,855
Christmas Eve, December twenty four.

999
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:40,704
If you happen to see my calendar,

1777
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,520
I've got a big red heart drawn around it, baby!

750
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,796
Sorry, I can't make it, bro!

487
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,355
Totally sorry, yeah.

719
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,820
So, who's the unlucky girl?

1268
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:54,160
She's a freshman at Kouyouen Academy.

1203
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,946
Yeah, but I still have to figure out

1690
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,362
where we're gonna go and what we're gonna do.

522
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,500
Decisions, decisions!

58
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:04,905
Kyon!

4
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:05,742
Hm?

1069
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:10,839
Anyway, since we didn't have
anything better to do after school

1983
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,433
we were corralled into helping with the decorations.

98
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,120
Humph!

1269
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:20,500
I totally forgot about it this time,
but next year, we should put together

1691
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,933
birthday parties for Buddha and Mohammad too.

1451
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,068
We've gotta keep things fair and square.

1452
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,909
It's sort of insincere throwing birthday
parties for folks you don't believe in.

2114
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:33,995
Hey, what should we do about the food? Hotpot? Sukiyaki?

642
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:35,686
As long as it's not crab.

1944
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,323
Getting the meat out of the shell is such a hassle.

945
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,690
Honestly I think every crab
should have a shell you can eat.

784
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,770
I mean it's called evolution.

1868
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:46,331
And that would be the next logical step for them.

883
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:49,620
Why do you think they evolved
with shells in the first place.

1650
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:55,160
News flash, natural selection isn't about
accommodating the appetizer of human beings.

1984
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:59,855
Hey, Haruhi. I just noticed we're all out of tinsel.

830
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,106
Then go out and buy some more.

110
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,797
Who me?

169
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:02,970
Yes, you.

673
00:16:03,956 --> 00:16:05,440
Whatever we decide to eat,

1000
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,261
we should make a reservation with
a restaurant as soon as possible.

1816
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:10,925
We might not get a table if we wait much longer.

1592
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,636
Oh, don't worry about that! We'll eat here!

19
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:14,670
Huh?

720
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,167
In the club room? A hotpot?

1325
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:19,300
Why not? We've got everything we need,

946
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:20,737
all that's left are ingredients!

576
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,815
But no alcohol allowed!

2144
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,465
I swore I'll go my whole life without touching the stuff!

141
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,550
Hold it!

1651
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,065
No open flames are allowed in this building.

1945
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,253
So then we'll cook it in secret, it'll be more fun!

1778
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,370
If any teachers or the student council come by,

947
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:38,933
I'll wow them with my incredible
awesome hotpot cooking skills!

1692
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:42,886
And when they taste it, they'll be so
emotionally overwhelmed by the deliciousness.

1652
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:46,525
They are bound to give us special
permission to cook in here whenever we want.

1946
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,933
Nothing could possibly go wrong. My plan's perfect!

1001
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,745
Okay, people, let's get cracking!

1549
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,120
Decorating will help get us in the spirit!

1550
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,894
We're gonna make this party the best ever!

1736
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,831
For a prologue, that was way too long, I know.

948
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:21,090
But you really can't call it
anything else. Trust me on that.

193
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,958
Hey, Kyon.

1985
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,710
This story starts here. Actually it starts tomorrow.

1947
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:29,530
Maybe it started that night. Wait, maybe it started

228
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,130
whatever...

1070
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,874
The next day, December eighteenth,

1551
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,946
the wind blew down hard from the mountains

1986
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,788
like it was trying to freeze everything in its path.

831
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:42,290
Something happened that pushed
me down into a sea of despair,

1737
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,540
right down into the very pit of hell itself...

721
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:47,999
Just giving you a heads-up,

1002
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,577
there's nothing funny about
what was gonna happen to me next.

577
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,241
Hey, Kyon! Wakey wakey!

1204
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:13,951
Shami! Shami! It's breakfast time...

328
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,483
Yo, Taniguchi.

194
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:51,742
Hey, Kyon.

20
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:52,530
Huh?

488
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,230
Wow, you catch cold?

722
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,550
Yeah. I wanted to stay home

1593
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,795
but my old man bitched me out of the house.

2115
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:03,865
Must have hit you fast. You were all fired up yesterday.

1948
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,139
I felt like crap yesterday too. Don't you remember?

1003
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:13,756
I remember you going off about
your hot plans for Christmas Eve.

1205
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,389
Well, make sure you get better fast.

832
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:18,206
You might not get another date
with that girl if you cancel…

375
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,576
Wait. What date?

1453
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't got any plans for Christmas Eve.

1071
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,014
What about that girl from Kouyouen
academy you'll have a date with?

2179
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,420
Don't tell me she broke up with you before your big night.

1987
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,287
Seriously, guy, what the heck are you talking about?

1072
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,069
I have no idea what you're saying.

833
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:43,910
That's weird. I guess his date
got cancelled for some reason.

1206
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:47,615
I bet he's plan cool 'cause of all
the bragging he was doing yesterday.

751
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,670
And probably feels horrible.

785
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,147
Yeah, that's what's going on.

456
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,108
There'll be others.

21
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:56,155
Huh?

1073
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:58,639
You know, you should come join
us for our party at the club room.

2019
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,795
I'm sure we haven't reached the maximum capacity yet.

1143
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:04,483
Party in the club room? What party?

643
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:06,155
Okay then, suit yourself.

1074
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,260
He's in shock from getting dumped.

1869
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:11,355
That's it. No matter what I said, he'd ignore it.

1075
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,069
If that's what he wants, so be it.

1144
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:17,006
I'll just leave him alone, and time
would work its magic on his wounds.

5
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:20,300
Hm?

1552
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:27,998
A lot of people from my class were absent.

2020
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,990
Probably the work of that cold that was going around.

1207
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:34,912
After he got to school, Taniguchi
went straight to the nurse's office.

752
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,905
He never showed up to class.

2052
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,553
I wasn't too surprised about that. He looked terrible.

1208
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:44,678
What did surprise me though was the
seat behind me stayed empty all day.

753
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:48,287
Wow, even Haruhi was absent.

1949
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:51,217
I didn't realize this year's cold was that serious.

1270
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:56,053
Think about that for a second,
you got a virus, then you got Haruhi.

1950
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,951
Virus infiltrates her body and gets the best of her

674
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:00,820
that's gotta be some cold.

1076
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,060
We don't really get a chance to
go in the water this time of year.

1077
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:20,270
They got us doing weight training,
and stuff like that instead.

523
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:22,250
At least you're warm.

6
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:25,858
Hm?

1988
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,576
Looks like she's absent today. Can I sit behind you?

229
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:35,764
Yeah, sure.

1209
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,350
This cold that everyone's come down
with came out of nowhere, didn't it?

22
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,375
Huh?

405
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,146
What do you mean?

1004
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,998
It's been going around the campus
for at least a week or so now.

675
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:56,900
You're kidding me, a week?

1271
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,865
They're pretty sure it's not the flu.

884
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,576
But if you want my opinion,
the flu would have been better.

1817
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,108
At least they can give you vaccination for that.

1210
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,764
Back up. You just said this cold has
been going around for a week, right?

2080
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,793
At least that there're a lot of people who were absent.

1145
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,720
Don't tell me you're just noticing.

1005
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,967
Yeah, I don't know. I guess I am.

1553
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,733
It got worse at the beginning of the week.

1272
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,397
Man, I hope they don't cancel school.

834
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:26,350
They'd probably take it out of
one of our vacation, you know?

1505
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,975
I bet it sucks to be Taniguchi right now.

1653
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:36,623
His dad thinks that unless he's gotta
fever of 104, he sucked up and go to school.

1554
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,860
He's a heal-it-with-willpower kind of guy.

1654
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,000
Kunikida, this is probably gonna sound weird

1389
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,459
but I didn't notice that he was
that sick until I saw him this morning.

754
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:52,389
What? You're kidding, right?

2180
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,030
Didn't you see him on Monday? He was already in bad shape.

1454
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,405
He missed gym class yesterday, remember?

1211
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:06,905
What's the matter, Kyon? Not hungry?

1326
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:11,580
What the heck is going on around here?

949
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,451
This is clearly an omen that
some crisis for all of humanity,

2053
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:18,569
but not for Haruhi, kind of thing was about to happen.

1655
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,287
Later, I found out my intuition was not off.

676
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,576
It was definitely an omen.

2145
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:31,147
The only part my intuition got wrong was the crisis part.

885
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,334
This wasn't a crisis for all
of humanity but not for Haruhi.

1273
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,194
This was a crisis only for the person
who noticed it in the first place.

524
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:41,725
You guessed it... Me.

1390
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:50,076
So, I sat there confused a blank look
on my face, totally alone in the world.

280
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,320
Good morning.

618
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,676
I thought you were sick.

1146
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,986
Yeah, I'd heard you weren't coming.

1594
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,260
You look okay, but you should take it easy.

2081
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,400
They put me on an IV drip at the hospital this morning.

2181
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,860
But I'm feeling better now and I was really bored at home,

886
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,510
so I thought I'd come to class.

1391
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,430
I'm gonna put this away. Back in a sec.

551
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,334
Oops, I'd better move.

1327
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,280
What's the matter? Why the weird look?

835
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:50,610
Why are you staring like that?
Is there something on my face?

677
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,444
Sorry, I'll clean this up.

1455
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:55,028
It's okay. I'm just dropping off my bag.

281
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:56,808
Okay. Thanks.

578
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:58,615
Please, take your time.

23
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:02,467
Hey!

230
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:04,896
What is it?

887
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,415
You're not supposed to be here.

723
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:08,746
What are you talking about?

2082
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,440
Is there something wrong with my coming to class today?

1392
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,467
I hope you don't think I'm
contagious, because I promise, I'm not.

1078
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:19,044
I don't care about your damn cold!

1595
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:20,770
You know that's not what I'm talking about!

1006
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:23,420
Kyon. You're acting really weird.

1907
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:27,030
Do you even know what you're saying? Are you okay?

1506
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,720
Of course I am, but don't you think it's
a little weird to see her standing there?

1908
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:33,647
You know who she is, don't tell me that you don't!

1147
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,920
And you know she shouldn't be here!

1393
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,772
I don't know what you're talking about.

1328
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,874
She's been in our class since day one.

1329
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:41,596
She's only been gone for a day or two,

1596
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,123
so how could you forget? You're being rude.

678
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:46,370
Of course I didn't forget.

1951
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,983
That's the face of the person who tried to kill me!

525
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,600
Oh, I think I get it!

1818
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:53,233
You must have dozed off while eating your lunch.

1330
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:55,358
Did you have a nightmare or something?

1212
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:59,076
Why don't you go wash your face?
I'll let you borrow my handkerchief.

7
00:25:59,225 --> 00:25:59,944
No!

59
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:01,383
Oh...

950
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:04,858
Who knows what she's gonna
pull out of that pocket of hers?

2083
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,850
I don't know what you're up to, but I'm gonna find out.

1656
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:10,420
Why did you hang your bag on Haruhi's chair?

2182
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:14,787
This has never been your seat, admit it! Haruhi sits here!

111
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:16,092
Haruhi?

1394
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:21,100
I'm sorry, but I don't know any Haruhi.

24
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,482
Huh?

282
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:26,782
Well, do you?

526
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,490
Someone named Haruhi?

142
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,114
Come on!

755
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,920
No, I've never heard of her.

579
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,381
But Haruhi is Haruhi...

2146
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:48,787
This isn't real... he doesn't remember Haruhi Suzumiya...

951
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:53,436
This can't be happening, how can
anybody forget someone like her?

60
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:54,811
Kyon.

1819
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,287
There isn't anybody in our class with that name.

1148
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:03,701
Miss Asakura's been sitting in this
chair since the last seat rotation.

2021
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:06,084
Are you sure you're not thinking of some other class?

836
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,897
This shouldn't be happening...

1693
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:10,420
I don't know anyone with the name "Suzumiya".

786
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:12,803
Maybe she's not in our grade.

2054
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,015
Kunikida, would you please have a look inside my desk?

679
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:17,686
Take out the class roster.

619
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:19,553
No worries, I'll get it.

170
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:31,640
Kunikida.

112
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:32,641
Uh-huh?

1079
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,980
Could you pinch me on the
cheek? I really wanna wake up now.

195
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,200
Seriously?

406
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:38,748
Seriously. Hurry!

8
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:46,521
Ow!

1657
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:06,075
Hey, you know who Haruhi Suzumiya is, right?

1274
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,758
No, I don't. I've never heard of her.

1870
00:28:10,352 --> 00:28:13,321
Asakura transferred out of the class, didn't she?

1909
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:16,094
What are you talking about? She never transferred.

580
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:17,969
You know Haruhi, right?

756
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,766
No. I've never heard of her.

1456
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,438
That's Haruhi Suzumiya's seat, isn't it?

1331
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:24,883
No, it's not. Miss Asakura sits there.

620
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:32,703
Why is everyone staring?

143
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,024
Stop it…

144
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,610
Stop it…

145
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:37,516
Stop it…

952
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:41,250
I can take you to see the nurse.

1213
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,516
Maybe you have a fever or something.

1275
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,524
Haruhi is gone. Nobody remembers her.

407
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:54,984
Is that possible?

1149
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:58,781
Wasn't the deal supposed to be
that the world revolved around her?

1332
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,039
Wasn't she the one the universe
was interested in? Wasn't it watching?

171
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:07,628
Nagato...

113
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,039
Nagato.

114
00:29:15,432 --> 00:29:16,272
Nagato!

172
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:21,921
Not here.

1214
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,531
She'd be in the club room right now.

408
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,024
Oh yeah, Koizumi!

376
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:35,235
Wait a minute...

621
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:37,586
Where did class nine go?

2147
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:48,289
They're gone. Koizumi and everyone in class nine... gone.

283
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:50,789
What is this?

409
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:54,258
What's happening?

173
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,992
Hey, you.

1952
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,750
I think class has started, young man, so get going.

1333
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:27,321
People who shouldn't be here are here.

1007
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:30,039
People who should be here aren't.

2055
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:34,742
Either the world's gone totally insane, or I'm insane.

231
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,914
Who did it?

457
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,547
Haruhi, was it you?

2148
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:08,883
The afternoon lectures went in one ear and out the other.

284
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:10,703
I was scared.

1658
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:14,117
And not just because Ryoko Asakura was back,

1871
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:17,367
but also because Haruhi and Koizumi weren't here.

1080
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,383
Before I knew it, school was over.

2183
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,580
Kunikida and Asakura were worried and tried to talk to me.

1953
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:39,563
But I don't even remember what I said back to them.

888
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,920
What are you gonna do for your
New Year's calligraphy project?

1555
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:55,230
I don't know. I can't make up my mind yet.

61
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,330
Hm...

2022
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,985
I know how about if I come up with something for you?

329
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,563
Oh, it's okay.

1556
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,296
You know I'll pick something cool, Mikuru.

285
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,742
Miss Asahina!

1597
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,946
Miss Asahina, I can't find Haruhi anywhere.

837
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:16,086
And Koizumi's class has turned
into the drifting classroom.

1820
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,961
I haven't found Nagato yet. But Asakura is here.

1395
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:20,821
And everyone in school is acting weird.

838
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,571
But you are the Miss Asahina
I've always known, aren't you?

330
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:24,854
You are right?

1008
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:28,633
You are the Miss Asahina, the one
came from the future, aren't you?

1334
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:32,891
I'm sorry but I'm not from the future.

1009
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:36,570
Could you let go off my hand now?

527
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:44,900
Hold it there, buddy.

724
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:46,539
Watch your manners, got it?

1276
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,024
You're scaring my little Mikuru here.

787
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,561
Aw, Miss Tsuruya, that hurts!

1215
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:53,633
What the... How do you know my name?

433
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:56,922
It can't be... No!

2023
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,430
I've never met you before. Who the heck are you, huh?

788
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:03,030
Mikuru, do you know this guy?

889
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:06,867
No, I've never seen him before.

377
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:14,672
Well... I, uh...

410
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,531
I don't know you.

528
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:28,336
Are you okay, Mikuru?

757
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,687
Miss Asahina, don't do this.

953
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:36,640
There is no way I'd ever mistake
anyone for you, Miss Asahina.

581
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:38,976
Not in a million years.

62
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,101
Wait.

1277
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:49,375
That's it. I think I know how I can
prove she is the Miss Asahina I know.

286
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:51,023
Miss Asahina!

25
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,023
Yes?

1659
00:33:52,257 --> 00:33:56,312
I know for a fact you've got a tiny star
shaped mole on your breast right about here.

680
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,265
You have to let me see it.

115
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:18,440
Mikuru!

1010
00:34:21,156 --> 00:34:24,414
You've got a lot of nerve pulling
stuff like that with her, nyoron.

681
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,625
She freaks out super easy.

1457
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:28,898
And if you do something like that again,

1598
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:32,492
you're gonna have to face my wrath, got it?

378
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,265
Wait up, Mikuru.

789
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:52,719
It's over. Everything's over.

954
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:03,414
I've finally run out of options.

955
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,959
I don't have her number anymore.

1150
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:08,715
And since I don't know her address,

1396
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:11,039
I can't find it by calling information.

1081
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:15,203
Now that I think about it,
I've never even been to her house.

1738
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:17,687
So just showing up is out of the question too.

1335
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:22,320
There was only one place for me to go.

1989
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,420
A fortress of final refuge, my last line of defense.

2149
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:31,320
If we are defeated there, it's over. The end of the line.

174
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:40,578
Please...

582
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,211
Thank God. You're here.

725
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:02,156
Why is she wearing glasses?

1397
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:04,484
And why is she looking at me like that?

116
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:09,922
Nagato.

26
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:13,070
Yes?

434
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:14,781
I was wondering...

1990
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:20,047
This is gonna sound weird but, do you know who I am?

63
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,765
I do.

956
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:36,414
I was hoping you'd say that. I
know a few things about you too.

64
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:37,294
Uh...

890
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:41,297
Mind if I tell you what I know?

891
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,336
For starters, you aren't human.

1954
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,656
You're sort of an android created by alien species.

9
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:50,650
Uh.

1955
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:55,094
And you've got these powers kind of like
magic, that you used to save us every now and then.

1660
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,429
You made a bat that hit home runs, and you
fought a giant cricket in another dimension.

1557
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,820
Anyway, that's the stuff I know about you.

232
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,617
Am I wrong?

196
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:14,390
I'm sorry.

458
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,299
Why'd she say that?

839
00:37:17,764 --> 00:37:20,174
What's Nagato apologizing for?

2084
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,758
I know you are a student here and you're in class five.

790
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,330
So yes, I've seen you around.

2085
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,883
But I'm afraid that's pretty much all I know about you.

2150
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,812
Actually, this is the first time I've ever spoken to you.

1694
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:39,750
So what you're saying is you're not an alien.

197
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,531
Ali... en?

1661
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,422
And the name Haruhi Suzumiya... You don't...

552
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,156
You don't remember it?

10
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,720
No.

411
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,937
But, you have to.

892
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,859
Think back and try to remember.

27
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,500
Hey.

1739
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,656
Don't you remember this past summer when we
had to repeat the same two weeks 15,000 times?

644
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,220
Come on, try to remember.

2024
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:13,273
Everyone we know changed between yesterday and today!

1011
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,734
Haruhi's gone but Asakura's here!

1695
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:18,773
You know who's responsible for it, don't you?

1599
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,742
Was it the Data Integration Thought Entity?

1082
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,570
If Asakura's been resurrected,
you'd know about it, wouldn't you?

791
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,570
She's the same as you, right?

645
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:29,640
What the hell's going on?

2025
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,220
You're the only one who can tell me what's happening.

1278
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,640
You've always been able to, remember?

198
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,351
Stop it...

287
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,360
I'm so sorry.

1740
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,703
I didn't mean to freak out on you like that...

726
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:00,601
I just wanted to be sure...

233
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:01,840
That's all.

199
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:12,195
Damn it...

200
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,398
Game over.

2086
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:21,406
If this is someone's attempt to try and drive me crazy,

288
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,310
it's working.

459
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:25,750
Man, is it working.

893
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,523
I wonder who's behind all this.

289
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,265
Is it Haruhi?

1216
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:35,800
The Data Integration Thought Entity?

1336
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,080
Or some new enemy we haven't seen yet.

99
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,679
Sorry.

1217
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,781
This is just the literary club room.

1507
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,990
It looks the same as it did back in
May when Haruhi dragged me here by force,

1600
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:21,969
and I saw Nagato's face for the first time.

290
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:27,554
Wait... No...

957
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,226
The only thing that's different
about this room is the computer.

958
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,617
The literary club never had one.

1279
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:36,187
And that's not the one Haruhi swiped.

1398
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,344
She's definitely not the Nagato I know.

840
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,550
She would never act like this.

2184
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:52,695
Nagato, would it be okay if I use your computer for a bit?

146
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:01,255
Not yet.

1083
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,101
I guess before she lets me use it
she has to move some files around.

1821
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,125
I bet it's stuff she doesn't want anyone to see.

355
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,133
And I get that.

1601
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,375
I wouldn't want another people to see those
pictures I have of Miss Asahina, you know.

65
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:50,830
Okay.

201
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:54,724
Thank you.

1822
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,265
I couldn't find any files about the SOS Brigade.

1823
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,461
Or the pictures of Miss Asahina that I'd hidden.

1824
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,078
I couldn't find the SOS Brigade website, either.

1084
00:42:21,594 --> 00:42:24,858
There wasn't any proof of
Haruhi's existence on it anywhere.

1012
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,890
I was hoping to find some clue
or hidden message left by Nagato.

2185
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,125
Like the time Haruhi and I were trapped in a Closed Space.

646
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,375
That's what I was hoping.

489
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,030
Sorry to bother you.

412
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,170
Are you finished?

1013
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:43,940
Yeah, I couldn't find the
things I was hoping it was there.

66
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,870
Wait.

553
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,607
Take one, if you want.

1741
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:20,469
The one good thing about experiencing a metric
ton of weirdness since the beginning of school

758
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:22,410
is that I become used to it.

1558
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:27,630
If I hadn't, I would've gone crazy
talking to the school's counselors by now.

894
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,786
Where the heck could she be...?

1337
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:39,708
Tossing me out into a world like this.

841
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:43,552
I wonder where she is and what
kind of trouble she's causing.

1014
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:53,888
Damn it. Why do I have to be
the one who's gotta look for her?

460
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:00,216
Welcome home, Kyon!

895
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:03,935
Mom said dinner's almost ready.

622
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:06,333
It's dinner time, Shami.

1458
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:10,040
Di-dinner, di-dinner, di-dinner, dinner.

490
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,380
Dinner, di-dinner...

435
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:16,648
What was that for?

583
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:19,888
Do you remember Haruhi?

1459
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,833
And Miss Asahina, and Nagato or Koizumi?

1742
00:44:23,232 --> 00:44:27,615
You remember we all played baseball together,
and went to an island and made a crappy movie?

461
00:44:28,294 --> 00:44:31,052
What? I don't know.

1602
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:36,435
Okay. How long have we had this little guy?

1015
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:38,070
Do you know who brought him here?

2151
00:44:38,294 --> 00:44:42,099
Did you forget? You got him about a month ago, you silly.

2026
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,450
A friend of yours moved overseas and gave him to you.

623
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,849
Isn't that right, Shami?

462
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,677
Give me Shami back!

1151
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,302
There's things I need to talk to
him about. Alone if you don't mind.

28
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,232
Huh?

1910
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,747
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave right now, Sis.

1338
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,490
You're gonna talk to Shami? Seriously?

436
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,911
The floor is cold!

842
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,599
Hey, mommy. Kyon's gone crazy!
He's trying to talk to Shami.

491
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:14,552
Listen up, Shamisen.

1085
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:18,365
Now I know I told you before
that you should never, ever, talk.

759
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,169
But I'm revoking that order.

959
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,880
So come on you little furball. I
wanna hear your voice right now.

1086
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,700
Go ahead, Shamisen. Say something.

175
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:27,744
Anything.

1991
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,474
Talk about philosophy or science, anything you want.

1280
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,872
Doesn't matter if I don't understand.

331
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,529
Say something.

1339
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,638
Do you understand anything I'm saying?

1152
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,724
Maybe you can hear me, but for some
reason you can't reply. Is that it?

1016
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,779
If the answer is yes, I want you
to hold out your right front paw.

1087
00:45:47,966 --> 00:45:51,185
If the answer is no, I want you to
hold out your left front paw okay?

291
00:45:57,849 --> 00:45:59,169
That figures.

1218
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:04,247
I can say for a fact now that
this is not a world where cats talk.

2152
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:07,865
Now I'm weird for trying to have a conversation with him.

1992
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,920
As of today, this particular world I'm in is normal.

259
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,622
And I'm not.

492
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:17,700
Is that really true?

792
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,669
It's December the nineteenth.

1662
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,607
Starting today, the school days are shorter.

1460
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,911
The cold has spread all over the school.

1508
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,482
Good morning. I hope you are awake today.

147
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,810
I guess.

1825
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,513
You know, just because your eyes are open,
that doesn't necessarily mean you're wide awake.

2056
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:53,482
You have to accept the reality that's in front of you.

1993
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,122
And that'll help you start to understand everything.

1994
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,763
So, how about it then? Do you think you can do that?

148
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:01,268
Asakura.

1461
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,318
You're just acting like you don't know
what's going on around here, aren't you?

1088
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:12,794
Be honest. Hasn't the thought of
killing me ever crossed your mind?

2186
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,357
I think you should go to the hospital as soon as possible.

1340
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,075
You should do it before it's too late.

682
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:29,040
Consider this if you will.

2153
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:32,775
You have a very unhappy person living in a certain place.

896
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:35,157
Then he opens his eyes one day,

1399
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,423
the whole world has completely changed.

584
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,462
It's a beautiful world.

1153
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:43,072
Calling it Utopia doesn't even
do it justice, it's that wonderful.

1872
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:46,572
And this person will never be unhappy ever again.

1559
00:47:47,376 --> 00:47:51,503
Over night, he was snatched from the
jaws of Hell and taken straight to Heaven.

1873
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:55,589
The thing is, this person didn't do this himself.

1341
00:47:56,144 --> 00:48:01,339
In fact, he had absolutely no idea who
is responsible for changing his world.

585
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:02,871
It was a total mystery.

1911
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:06,475
And that's how he stayed. Never knowing who it was

760
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,824
or why they did it, forever.

1089
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:13,246
So, I ask you. Is this something
this person should be happy about?

586
00:48:13,745 --> 00:48:15,042
Up until the other day,

1462
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,761
I've been run ragged by all the
weird happenings going on around Haruhi.

1219
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,207
But none of that matters to the
person I'm right now. In this world.

843
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:26,621
There's no Haruhi, no Koizumi.

1560
00:48:26,826 --> 00:48:29,355
Nagato and Miss Asahina are normal humans.

1912
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:33,191
There aren't any aliens, time-travelers or espers.

1696
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:35,974
Not to mention the fact that cats don't talk.

493
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,207
It's a normal world.

529
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:46,960
But here's the thing.

1603
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:50,183
Was I happier in a world with Haruhi in it?

2116
00:48:50,777 --> 00:48:53,683
Or am I happier here in a world where she's disappeared.

530
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,040
Well, am I happy now?

292
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,285
After school,

2117
00:49:13,441 --> 00:49:16,238
my legs automatically took me to the literary club room.

2187
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:19,769
When class ended, I'd always head over to the SOS Brigade.

1154
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:24,316
I'd play games with Koizumi and
sip on a cup of Miss Asahina's tea.

1090
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:28,175
And I'd listen to Haruhi talk
crazy about some new plan she had.

554
00:49:28,808 --> 00:49:30,355
It's like a bad habit.

1091
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:34,496
Let me tell you. Trying to quit it
cold turkey isn't easy believe me.

1342
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:37,371
Today feels different for some reason.

793
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,691
What am I gonna do with this?

1463
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:47,433
I guess Nagato gave it to me because
she'd like me to join the literary club.

1400
00:49:48,558 --> 00:49:51,933
But even in this world, the
literary club doesn't have any members.

1604
00:49:52,246 --> 00:49:54,535
I wonder if she's trying to recruit people.

437
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,767
Sorry, I didn't...

117
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:03,509
Mikuru!

260
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,486
If anything,

1401
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,525
I hope there comes a day when I can
have a cup of Miss Asahina's tea again.

149
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:22,719
Come in.

11
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:25,990
Hi.

587
00:50:26,536 --> 00:50:27,916
Is it okay that I came?

118
00:50:30,124 --> 00:50:30,764
Thanks.

897
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,822
Well, here I am. And I have
no idea what I'm gonna do next.

1402
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,048
Are all those books on the shelf yours?

1343
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:01,275
Some of them have been here all along.

150
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:08,665
I, uh...

463
00:51:09,423 --> 00:51:11,181
I borrowed this one

555
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,603
from the city library.

119
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:18,720
Really.

12
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,270
Um.

1220
00:52:09,517 --> 00:52:13,103
So, just wondering, have you
ever tried writing a novel yourself?

413
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:20,280
I just read them.

464
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,095
For a second there,

1403
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:26,501
I thought that the files she was hiding
yesterday was a book she was writing.

1092
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,563
That's something I'd like to read.

2154
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:32,282
Maybe it's sci-fi. It couldn't be a love story, could it?

960
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:33,493
Are you know one who wrote this?

1956
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,173
Collect the keys necessary to activate the program.

727
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:38,900
The time limit is two days.

465
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:40,681
Did you write this?

1017
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,954
It does look like my handwriting.

1826
00:53:44,273 --> 00:53:47,064
But I don't remember writing anything like that.

356
00:53:47,564 --> 00:53:48,657
You don't, huh?

531
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:51,380
Of course, you don't.

2087
00:53:52,048 --> 00:53:55,392
No, it's fine. I'd be more worried if you did write it.

532
00:53:56,243 --> 00:53:58,228
Sorry, don't mind me.

120
00:54:16,493 --> 00:54:17,553
Nagato!

1221
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,657
You left a message for me after all.

1743
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,090
I'm considering this a present from you to me.

1697
00:54:26,751 --> 00:54:28,910
You gave me a hint to break out of this mess.

728
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,032
That's what this is, right?

151
00:54:37,126 --> 00:54:37,954
Program.

202
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:39,251
Necessary.

67
00:54:39,712 --> 00:54:40,470
Keys?

234
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,586
Time limit.

176
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,490
Two days.

898
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,423
Today is the nineteenth. Does
this mean, two days from today?

2188
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,350
Or two days from when the world turned upside down for me?

1155
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,186
I guess in the worst case scenario,

1404
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,220
it would mean the dead line's tomorrow.

1874
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:06,735
I don't really understand, but it says some keys
are needed to start kind of program or something.

588
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:09,819
But, what are the keys?

1156
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,694
And if I find all the keys, am I
supposed to turn them in for prize?

1744
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,170
And if I figure out how to start this program,

2027
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,608
does that mean the world goes back to the way it was?

2189
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,170
These key things are pretty vague when you think about it.

1779
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,803
They're probably not the kind you use in locks.

1995
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,430
Maybe they're key words or key persons or something.

899
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,200
I mean, they could be anything.

1222
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:32,381
Are they things or a bunch of words?

844
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,320
Am I gonna have to carry them?

1913
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,826
Seriously, Nagato. I would've appreciated a
little less mystery and a lot more info in a clue.

466
00:55:53,178 --> 00:55:55,944
Key, key, key, key.

761
00:55:56,406 --> 00:55:58,670
It's no use. I have no idea.

1780
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:08,090
I guess the Nagato in this world is really shy.

1996
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:12,186
Or maybe she's just not used to people noticing her.

961
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:29,470
Maybe joining the literary club,

2118
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:33,326
having fun in a world without Haruhi wouldn't be so bad.

1157
00:56:38,404 --> 00:56:41,834
Who am I kidding? I can't bail yet.

1093
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,770
I haven't tasted Haruhi's hot pot.

1223
00:56:45,037 --> 00:56:49,131
And an image of Santa Asahina hasn't
burned itself onto my retinas yet.

647
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:51,467
I guess I'll go home now.

68
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,080
Okay.

1745
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,444
You weren't waiting for me to leave, were you?

648
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,381
Walking home with Nagato.

1746
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,150
I don't remember ever having done this before.

467
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:24,160
Hey, there, Nagato.

29
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:25,450
Yes?

1914
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,154
Well, I was just curious. Do you live by yourself?

69
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:29,688
Yeah.

1405
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,514
I bet you're wondering how I knew that.

1094
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,326
You know, I've been to your
place quite a few times, actually.

1095
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,910
But, I bet if I told you that now,

1827
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:42,350
you'd think I was talking nonsense or something.

1281
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,490
Since you live by yourself, have
you ever thought about getting a cat?

845
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,280
You know, they're pretty cool.

1698
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,944
The weird thing about them is that sometimes,
it's like they can understand what you say.

494
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,770
Pets aren't allowed.

203
00:57:56,089 --> 00:57:57,409
Oh, I see.

13
00:58:06,694 --> 00:58:07,220
Uh…

30
00:58:08,983 --> 00:58:09,600
Hmm?

332
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,256
Will you come?

177
00:58:11,608 --> 00:58:12,428
Where to?

556
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:16,553
Where I live, tonight.

152
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:24,497
Come in.

204
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:25,767
After you.

293
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:51,360
What's wrong?

153
00:58:51,858 --> 00:58:52,662
Nothing.

2057
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:57,811
I have no idea she's being shy or timid or aggressive.

1957
00:58:58,971 --> 00:59:01,342
It looks like the layout of her room changed a bit.

1663
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:07,139
Nagato, is it okay if I take a look in here?

357
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,600
Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,490
I'll... just be a sec.

205
00:59:29,784 --> 00:59:30,524
Thank you.

154
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,510
I, uh...

31
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,450
Hmm?

962
00:59:47,553 --> 00:59:50,545
I met you…I mean, we met before.

624
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,873
Outside of school, once.

121
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:55,790
We did?

379
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:56,931
Do you remember?

155
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:57,975
I don't.

558
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,000
We met at the library.

589
01:00:03,154 --> 01:00:04,881
Back in May, this year.

683
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:08,553
You got me a library card.

414
01:00:11,944 --> 01:00:13,264
Yeah, I remember.

2155
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,623
The first SOS brigade's search for mystery and phenomena.

684
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,426
And if I recall correctly,

1875
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,904
I could barely pry you away from the bookshelves.

2058
01:00:21,553 --> 01:00:24,230
But, this version of Nagato shouldn't know about that.

438
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,290
Excuse me, Nagato.

1344
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:30,692
Could you tell me more about that day?

1781
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,690
It was May, or rather it was the middle of May.

1876
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,010
It was my first time going to the public library.

2028
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,760
I didn't know what I had to do to get a library card.

1699
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:50,510
There were lots of people that day and the
librarians looked like they were really busy.

729
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,440
I didn't wanna bother them.

1700
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,881
I have a hard time in situations where I
have to talk to people and ask for something.

1561
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,890
So I just stood there feeling sorry
for myself and then someone came up to me.

1018
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,320
He went through the whole process
for me even filled up the form.

900
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,069
When I got my card I just left.

2088
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,300
I didn't know what to say to this person who helped me.

495
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,108
That person was you.

1158
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,730
It always bothered me that I didn't
thank you for your help that day.

794
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:30,061
So I was surprised when I was
at school and there you were.

333
01:01:34,877 --> 01:01:35,937
So, thank you.

1664
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,420
Saying "I remember" would be easy right now.

1096
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:48,024
But that's not how the story goes.

1509
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,320
We were just killing time at the library.

2190
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,360
Because we were all on one of Haruhi's so-called missions.

1464
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,836
And there's another detail you left out.

1159
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,550
Haruhi, you don't even mention her.

1605
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,590
I wonder where's the Nagato I used to know.

100
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,570
Hello.

846
01:02:22,053 --> 01:02:24,220
Well, right now is a little...

294
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,720
Uh-huh. Okay.

206
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,771
Wait here.

762
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:47,623
Oh? What are you doing here?

1747
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,287
What am I doing here? What are you doing here.

2029
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,154
Well, I guess you could say I'm doing volunteer work.

2119
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,623
But I think the fact you're here is what's more unusual.

1345
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,510
So, did you cook all this up yourself?

1406
01:03:06,256 --> 01:03:10,020
Every now and then I whip something
up to eat and bring it over for Nagato.

963
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,490
It's the only way I know to
make sure she's eating properly.

559
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,950
Do you guys get along?

1665
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:19,860
We both live in the same apartment building.

1701
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,500
How about you? Why did you decide to stop by?

358
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,592
Umm... I, uh...

1019
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,590
We were walking, and we both
happened to live out this way so…

1465
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:34,620
I'm kind of on the fence right now about
whether I should join the literary club.

1466
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,654
And I had a couple of questions for her.

1877
01:03:38,198 --> 01:03:41,508
So she invited me up here and we talked about it.

590
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,390
But I didn't force her.

1748
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,720
I just can't picture you in the literary club.

1915
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,650
You don't seem like you'd be too interested in it.

2059
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,780
Do you like to read books or do you wanna be a writer?

847
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:56,420
I don't know. That's what I'm
trying to figure out, I guess.

122
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:57,960
Really…

1562
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,890
Wait. Aren't you going to stay for dinner?

2120
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,220
You should, you know. I think I outdid myself this time.

496
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,620
Sorry to bother you.

1510
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,460
You know, I think I will stay for dinner.

1097
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,160
Food sounds really good right now.

1346
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:43,303
Yeah, if I don't eat something
soon I might not make it home tonight.

1606
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,858
If I went home now, it would be like
meeting someone and unintroducing yourself.

2156
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,950
Besides, it's rare to see Nagato actually want something.

560
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:01,210
Whoa, look who's back.

848
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,150
Food tastes better when it's
eaten with company. All right?

685
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,270
So guess what I saw today.

1666
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:12,050
I was with some friends at the train
station and we were looking at some clothes.

1958
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,830
I saw the scarf, Yuki that would look great on you.

1607
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:19,320
I wasn't gonna say anything, just going
to buy it and give it to you for Christmas.

1282
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,090
But then I didn't because I was
worried you weren't going to like it.

2089
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:25,180
Anyway, if you want, we could go check it out together.

1702
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,850
If you end up liking it, I'll get it for you.

497
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,000
I'll think about it.

1224
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,914
While we're out and about, we could
go check out some Bathroom supplies.

1283
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,562
Looks like this version of
Asakura is on good terms with Nagato.

763
01:05:36,259 --> 01:05:38,139
She's kind of annoying, too.

359
01:05:40,281 --> 01:05:41,571
So, is it good?

2157
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,515
I feel like I'm camped out in front of the gates of hell.

1782
01:05:52,007 --> 01:05:55,890
Make sure you put the leftovers in a separate
container and remember to put it in the fridge.

1828
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:59,610
I'll be back tomorrow for my dish. See you then.

1783
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:10,062
Hey. Can I come back to the club room tomorrow?

1511
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,030
I don't really have any place else to go.

32
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:27,880
Hey.

33
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:29,930
Hey!

295
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,500
Welcome back.

1959
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,860
I've been talking to you this whole time, you know.

1467
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,850
I don't know what's wrong but you
look like you saw an alien or something.

1608
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,320
That wouldn't be unusual for a guy like me.

2030
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:44,130
Besides, I just saw something even more unbelievable.

34
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:44,870
Huh?

156
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:45,880
Nothing.

649
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,910
So, what were you saying?

795
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,050
I wasn't saying. I was asking
if you had a crush on Nagato.

1020
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,470
Well, I certainly don't hate her.

1407
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:02,460
I owe her my life. She saved me
that time you were trying to cut me up.

686
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,250
But I can't tell you that.

591
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,310
Maybe I'm overreacting.

1878
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:09,937
Besides, you're into even weirder girls than her.

1408
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:12,468
Nagato isn't really your style, is she?

1160
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,720
How do you know my tastes in women?

964
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,230
I asked Kunikida and he told me.

1563
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,920
He said you were like that in junior high.

1098
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:23,600
What a jerk. He's got no
business talking about that stuff.

1161
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:28,240
If you decide to go out with
Nagato, don't play around with her.

625
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,340
Take it seriously, okay?

296
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,350
If you don't,

650
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,000
I will never forgive you.

2090
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:40,671
Why are you so concerned about me hurting her feelings?

297
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,060
I don't know.

1829
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,750
Well, maybe because she's a neighborhood friend.

1609
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:50,125
Or maybe because she's the type of
person who needs someone to look after her.

101
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:52,070
Right.

468
01:07:56,211 --> 01:07:57,052
See you later then.

35
01:07:57,225 --> 01:07:57,865
Bye.

1468
01:08:11,156 --> 01:08:13,420
I wanted to hurry home and get to sleep.

687
01:08:13,953 --> 01:08:15,210
If I get to see you again,

901
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:17,200
even if it was only in a dream.

1610
01:08:17,617 --> 01:08:19,996
I bet she could show up in people's dreams,

651
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,742
subconsciously of course.

1162
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:29,484
Damn it. You're still causing
trouble whether you're here of not.

1225
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,523
Just for once, couldn't you at least
butt in when you are really needed?

1564
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,031
Seriously, it would be so awesome if
you help me out once in a while, you know.

123
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,850
Why me?

902
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,382
I really, really missed Haruhi.

592
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,156
December the twentieth.

1021
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:36,530
I wake up from a dreamless night.

903
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:39,571
Today should be the time limit.

1611
01:09:40,187 --> 01:09:42,835
But I haven't found the so-called keys yet.

1409
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,190
If I don't do something about it today,

1226
01:09:45,468 --> 01:09:47,320
things could stay like this forever.

796
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,520
Or they might even get worse.

1284
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:55,062
Nagato, why did you set a time limit?

1227
01:09:55,987 --> 01:09:59,117
With your power you should've
been able to give me plenty of time.

207
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,351
Hey, Kyon!

904
01:10:08,186 --> 01:10:10,356
So about Chemistry next period.

1612
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,328
Today's our row's turn to give the answers…

415
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:15,242
I need your help.

36
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:19,640
Huh?

334
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:25,882
Hey, Kunikida.

208
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:26,850
What's up?

965
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,953
Do you think you could teach
this guy about sodium hydroxide.

2191
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,570
I think he's stuck in how it relates to hydrochloric acid.

1565
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,950
Well, for starters, if you mix the two of
them together, they neutralize each other.

124
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:38,970
Get it?

626
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,000
Explain this part to me.

593
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:46,929
You don't get that one?

469
01:10:47,207 --> 01:10:48,351
It's really simple.

14
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,970
Um,

2060
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,179
Okay. First you have to calculate the number of moles.

70
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,414
Mm...

360
01:10:55,349 --> 01:10:56,930
So anyway Kyon.

2091
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,398
I heard you spazzed out the other day? Care to comment.

1469
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,117
You should know. You were here that day.

2121
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,350
I was in the nurse's office trying to sleep off my cold.

1512
01:11:06,837 --> 01:11:09,537
And I got stayed home yesterday. Finally.

1749
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:13,520
Anyway, you were saying stuff like how
Asakura shouldn't have been here or something?

498
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:14,868
What's up with that?

298
01:11:15,509 --> 01:11:16,489
I don't know.

1830
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:20,914
You were saying it was weird Miss Asakura was
here and some other girl should be here instead.

561
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,720
Someone called Haruhi?

1410
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:25,213
Who is this girl supposed to be anyway.

1228
01:11:28,143 --> 01:11:29,937
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

2158
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:33,640
Haruhi? Wait, are you guys talking about Haruhi Suzumiya?

1831
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,830
Wait a minute. You know who he is talking about?

37
01:11:35,923 --> 01:11:36,603
Yup.

299
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:38,125
Oh, this too.

2192
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:41,060
Come on. Are you even trying to figure these out yourself?

416
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:41,677
What did you say?

905
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:43,720
But I really don't get it, man.

652
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,648
What did you say? Before.

797
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,516
Huh? I said I didn't understa

178
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,601
Not that.

499
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,828
Oh, Haruhi Suzumiya?

1613
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,929
She was the gonzo girl of east junior high.

2061
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,601
The two of us were in the same class in middle school.

1879
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:02,190
I didn't know you guys knew each other. It's a...

439
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,843
You slimy octopus!

38
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,109
Huh?

849
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,109
Who're you calling an octopus?

1784
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,304
If I'm an octopus, you're a dried-up old squid!

1667
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,281
You know Haruhi? You really know who she is?

39
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,240
Huh?

1470
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,885
Of course, I know her. Even after fifty
years you don't forget someone like her.

1099
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:25,382
All the kids who went east
junior high know that crazy chick.

850
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,757
Let me go, man. What the hell?

1614
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,117
Where is she? Where the hell did Haruhi go?

764
01:12:30,203 --> 01:12:31,980
Hey, Kyon. Come on, stop it!

209
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,265
That hurt!

1880
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,859
Where, where, where. You're like a broken record.

1229
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:39,180
What's wrong with you? You see her
somewhere and fall in love with her?

380
01:12:39,303 --> 01:12:40,413
Give it up, guy.

1163
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:44,359
Sure she's got top-class looks but
her personality is totally haywire.

1703
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,250
I mean in the first year she went and painted
all this weird graffiti all over the campus.

688
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:49,920
Yeah, I already know that!

798
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,850
Where is she? You better tell
me where Haruhi is right now.

627
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,593
She's at Koyoen academy.

1916
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,359
She's a student at that up-tight prep school, man.

628
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:01,930
She's at Koyoen academy?

2092
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,680
Are you telling she's some kind of snobby rich kid now?

1347
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,646
Isn't that an elite all-girl's school?

71
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:07,230
Kyon.

1471
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:10,040
That school's been coed for a while now.

1230
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:14,020
Yeah, he's right. As long as you
got the grades, anyone can go there.

799
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,468
You don't have to be a chick.

906
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,742
Are you okay? If you've got a
fever, I could take you to the…

235
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,268
Wait, Kyon.

440
01:13:26,911 --> 01:13:28,131
I'm leaving early!

1513
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,760
Tell Okabe whatever you want. I've
got the plague, dysentery and typhus too.

1100
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,690
I felt like I was dying so I left.

335
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,770
And Taniguchi.

72
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:36,580
What?

336
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,250
Thanks, buddy.

236
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,900
What? Sure.

594
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,034
Shoot. I miscalculated.

1022
01:14:26,221 --> 01:14:30,315
The school is really quiet. The
classes must still be in session.

1411
01:14:31,159 --> 01:14:35,096
This time of year, all the high schools
in the city are on a half-day schedule.

907
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:39,159
I'm early. And there's still
an hour before classes let out.

1566
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:42,455
Maybe I should just force my way in there.

1285
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,018
I'm sure that's what Haruhi would do.

966
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,143
I wonder if I could pull it off.

1472
01:14:49,423 --> 01:14:52,120
Who am I kidding? I don't have the guts.

1023
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:57,010
Besides, unlike Haruhi, I know
when it's better to play it safe.

2122
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:19,430
No way. It's that girl from class nine, Koizumi's class.

1412
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:23,323
I thought she disappeared but it
looks like she goes to this school now.

1413
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:27,026
I hope I can see Haruhi from this spot.

851
01:15:27,549 --> 01:15:29,166
I've got a fifty-fifty chance.

1414
01:15:29,729 --> 01:15:31,870
But if she's in some after school club,

2062
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,260
then I'll have to stay in here for god knows how long.

1615
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,284
I could be prank scarecrow you for a while.

1286
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:42,630
Wait. Maybe there's another SOS
brigade right here at Koyoen academy.

2193
01:15:43,284 --> 01:15:46,096
Maybe she's found a whole new group of people to be in it.

1785
01:15:47,565 --> 01:15:50,674
Damn it. Just that thought, that makes me sick.

1832
01:15:51,002 --> 01:15:55,670
Is it possible that me, Miss Asahina,
Nagato and Koizumi have outlived our usefulness?

1616
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:58,430
If that's the case, I'm out of the picture.

2123
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:01,299
I'm not even a supporting character in this crazy setup.

1704
01:16:01,995 --> 01:16:04,799
I couldn't live with that. Anything but that.

1024
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:09,229
Damn it. What would I believe
in? Who am I supposed to pray to?

1881
01:16:09,588 --> 01:16:14,385
Christ? Buddha? Mohammad? Zarathustra? Lovecraft?

1164
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:19,518
I don't care who it is. Just get
me out of this... whatever this is.

337
01:16:39,922 --> 01:16:40,893
There you are.

261
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:43,643
I found you.

381
01:16:45,254 --> 01:16:48,057
Haruhi Suzumiya.

908
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,604
And look. Koizumi is there too.

1668
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,221
It looks like they're walking home together.

1669
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,020
I guess in this world, they're pretty close.

1348
01:16:59,503 --> 01:17:01,893
Whatever. I don't care about that now.

2031
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,250
Just seeing Haruhi's face again brings back memories.

967
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,390
Her face looks exactly the
same as the beginning of school,

1473
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,810
before she came up with the SOS brigade.

1833
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,651
Like a wrestler... looking for someone to fight.

2032
01:17:14,616 --> 01:17:17,386
But I shouldn't be thinking about the past right now.

262
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:24,870
What's this?

2093
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,260
Hey, come on, guy. You're not turning chicken, are you?

73
01:17:29,261 --> 01:17:30,261
Move.

74
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,420
Move!

40
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:37,830
Hey!

417
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:43,221
What do you want?

1786
01:17:46,049 --> 01:17:49,065
Well, what do you want? And who are you anyway?

2124
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:54,252
I don't think a total stranger has ever yelled "hey" at
me before so get to the point and tell me what you want.

2063
01:17:54,798 --> 01:17:57,268
And if you're here to pick up girls, you better leave.

1750
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,541
And I guess you've never met me before either.

2194
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:05,800
I can't say I have. Would you mind telling us who you are?

1617
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,362
You're a transfer student here, aren't you?

2159
01:18:09,221 --> 01:18:11,831
You're right. I transferred to this school in the spring.

689
01:18:12,205 --> 01:18:13,230
But how did you know that?

1917
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,541
Do you remember something called the Organization?

629
01:18:16,816 --> 01:18:18,506
Organization? Which one?

1474
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:20,950
I mean, there are lots of organizations.

125
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:24,463
Haruhi.

2094
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:29,290
Nobody gave you permission to call me by my first name.

418
01:18:29,816 --> 01:18:31,206
I don't know you,

1618
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:34,002
so stop bothering me and get out of my way.

179
01:18:35,373 --> 01:18:36,273
Suzumiya!

157
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:38,377
Hang on.

1349
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:40,268
Don't call me by my last name, either.

1918
01:18:40,728 --> 01:18:43,468
How do you know my name, anyway? I don't know you.

1619
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:45,826
What are you wearing? A North High uniform?

1025
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,990
You don't belong here so go home.

730
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,010
Come on, Koizumi. Let's go.

75
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:50,971
Okay.

300
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,284
Wait! Haruhi!

595
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,470
Take your hands off me.

338
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,310
Miss Suzumiya.

909
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,320
Are you coming or not, Koizumi.

41
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,210
Yes.

500
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,900
Wait! Wait a minute!

76
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:05,850
Halt.

1919
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:09,040
What's going on here? You don't go to this school.

1101
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,170
What's that, a North High uniform?

237
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,450
Well, uh...

158
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,337
Damn it.

690
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:15,909
Whoa, hold on, son! You...

501
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,770
Get off. Get off me.

126
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,557
Haruhi!

596
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,260
Just tell me one thing.

1231
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:24,190
Tanabata, three years ago. Remember?

1350
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:32,620
You drew a bunch of hieroglyphs on the
campus grounds that night, didn't you?

2125
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,920
So what if I did? That's not news. Everybody knows that.

2126
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:42,752
But what they don't know is that you weren't the
only one who snuck into the school that night, were you?

533
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,820
The guy carrying Asa…

1415
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:48,776
I mean, carrying a girl on his
back. You remember that guy, don't you?

1351
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,730
You made him draw those things, right?

1567
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,221
And I know what those drawing were saying.

765
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,643
They said "I am right here."

731
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,756
I think we've had enough...

42
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:02,346
Hey!

691
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,200
Calm down, son. Calm down!

339
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,080
Miss Suzumiya?

77
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:08,526
Haru…

238
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:13,990
That hurts!

968
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,580
Why? How come you know about me?

800
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,350
Who have you been talking to?

2033
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:23,220
Hang on. I never told anyone before about that night,

441
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:24,330
back when I was...

239
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,510
North high?

852
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,971
Who are you? What's your name?

240
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:32,296
John Smith.

241
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,640
John Smith?

1287
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:45,780
You? That's impossible, you can't be.

1165
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:51,159
Then you're the weird high schooler
who helped me three years ago...

340
01:20:51,373 --> 01:20:52,783
Miss Suzumiya.

801
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:56,487
Hey, somebody call a teacher!

102
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:57,967
Bingo.

301
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:59,016
Are you okay?

242
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,002
It matched.

2095
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:04,534
That's it. I finally found something I can call a lead.

1834
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:08,471
I found the one person in this upside down world

969
01:21:08,705 --> 01:21:11,268
who has the same memories as me.

1166
01:21:35,213 --> 01:21:37,276
Actually I've met John Smith twice.

103
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,630
Twice?

692
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:42,670
On my way home that night,

2034
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,471
after doing those drawings, a voice called out to me.

1620
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:50,073
He said "John Smith wishes you the best
of luck in making the world more exciting."

1960
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:55,510
Really? I don't remember saying anything like that.

1751
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:58,627
Great. Her memories aren't the same after all.

1167
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,620
And of all the things to say, why
did this other John Smith say that?

1232
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:07,200
I mean, he was giving Haruhi
advice that was totally unnecessary.

341
01:22:08,086 --> 01:22:09,726
Um, excuse me.

1787
01:22:10,002 --> 01:22:12,479
I just wanna make sure I understand everything.

243
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,090
Yeah, sure.

1882
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:20,276
To summarize, you said you're from a
different world than the one you're currently in?

78
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,550
Yeah.

910
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:25,710
In this other world myself and
Miss Suzumiya go to North High,

1997
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:28,540
and are members of something called the SOS brigade?

127
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:29,588
Uh-huh.

1998
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:35,320
And with us there is a time traveler named
Mikuru Asahina and an alien being named Yuki Nagato.

2096
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:41,980
I'm supposed be an esper, and the three of us were
sent by our respective groups to observe Miss Suzumiya.

562
01:22:42,497 --> 01:22:43,707
That's pretty much it.

128
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,550
Hahaha.

419
01:22:45,981 --> 01:22:47,411
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1568
01:22:47,983 --> 01:22:50,183
It's just that I think it's a great story.

853
01:22:50,307 --> 01:22:51,041
And I'd like to believe you...

1026
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,830
And every time I would get
bored, Closed Space would appear.

79
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,362
Yeah.

1027
01:22:59,385 --> 01:23:02,393
And if that happened, it meant
the whole universe was in danger?

302
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:03,247
That's right.

2127
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,268
But the me in that world didn't know she had that power.

970
01:23:06,471 --> 01:23:08,106
I was the only one who didn't...

442
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,320
That's how it was.

2195
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:12,104
And you really didn't care about having just a normal day.

1475
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:14,049
And I was always causing trouble, right?

80
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,221
Yeah.

382
01:23:21,213 --> 01:23:22,627
That is so cool!

693
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,830
No way. Do you believe me?

1705
01:23:27,307 --> 01:23:31,096
Sorry, but the version of you that comes
from my world never believed anything I said.

1621
01:23:31,668 --> 01:23:34,128
That's because that me is a complete idiot.

443
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:35,948
But I believe you.

802
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:42,838
Because that kind of world is
way more unbelievably cooler!

1416
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:47,400
After I met John Smith, I did some
research on the students at North High.

444
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,705
I staked them out,

1670
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:50,885
but I never saw anyone who looked like John.

1569
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:55,432
But now I know that's because three
years ago you weren't a student there yet.

732
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,643
What are you smiling about?

383
01:23:58,510 --> 01:23:59,790
Who me? Nothing.

766
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:02,066
Anyway, I've got a question.

1920
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:04,580
Why didn't the you in this world go to North High?

1671
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:07,200
'Cause it didn't really matter where I went.

1352
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,010
For one thing, John would've graduated
by the time I started high school.

1353
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:13,160
Besides, I couldn't find him anywhere.

1921
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:18,471
Also my teacher kept bugging me about how Koyoen
had the best record around for college acceptance.

597
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:20,041
Those are good reasons.

733
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,768
So why are you going there?

803
01:24:24,198 --> 01:24:26,000
I guess for the same reasons.

1288
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:30,213
I selected this school because it
complimented my educational aptitude.

1233
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:34,362
The SOS brigade. It sounds like fun.

1168
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,924
Yeah, well to be honest, you
were the only one having fun there.

2064
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:41,034
If I were to believe the story you've been telling us,

1922
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:46,034
the situation which you claim to or found
yourself in can be interpreted in one of two ways.

2196
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:52,338
I'll explain. The first interpretation to consider
would be that you've been transported to a parallel world.

210
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,070
Like this.

1234
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:59,245
The second interpretation would
be that the actual world you live in

211
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,370
thank you,

2160
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,550
the world is the thing which has been completely altered.

1028
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,409
Everything except you, of course.

1961
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:10,034
But either interpretation presents its own dilemma.

1923
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:15,800
In the first case, we have the question of
what happened to the version of you in this world.

1788
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:21,385
And the second, there's a question of why you
were the only person not affected in the world.

767
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,338
If this is a parallel world,

1289
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:28,127
then somehow you have to find a way
to return to the world you come from.

804
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,924
But if the world has changed,

2128
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:34,110
then your task would be to find a way to change it back.

1102
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:39,660
If that's so and you're successful
at changing the world back,

1514
01:25:39,799 --> 01:25:43,955
I would be concerned that this version of
Miss Suzumiya and myself would disappear.

445
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:46,262
Be that as it may,

1999
01:25:46,387 --> 01:25:51,120
the quickest way to figure out the puzzle would
be to find a one responsible for changing the world.

1235
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:55,791
But other than Haruhi, who's got
the power to do something like that?

1290
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:02,299
Perhaps invaders from a parallel
dimension are playing a trick on you.

2197
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:05,760
You never know. They could pop up when you least expected.

971
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,909
Okay, now you're pulling my leg.

2000
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,018
If I were you, I wouldn't rule out that possibility.

263
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,840
At any rate,

1789
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:19,252
you now seem to have the keys that were
inferred in that message Yuki Nagato wrote you.

911
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,750
I don't know about you but I
wanna check out this club room.

1924
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,650
And I wanna meet Miss Nagato and Miss Asahina too.

1835
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:31,040
If I'm the one who changed the world, maybe if I
go there and meet them, I'll remember something.

264
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,490
Right, John?

1570
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,430
That's the only way we can be sure, right?

1622
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:36,850
When you say John, are you referring to me?

1836
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:39,300
Why go with Kyon when John's a much cooler name.

1476
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:41,320
Besides, it's really common in the west.

1029
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:45,670
What kind of idiot would give you
a lame nickname like Kyon anyway?

1103
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,565
Okay, guys. Hurry up. We gotta go.

81
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:49,970
Uh...

104
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,110
Where?

1104
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,932
Where else? North High, of course.

912
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,362
I'll go out and grab us a taxi.

630
01:26:59,971 --> 01:27:01,487
Thanks! Have a good day!

913
01:27:03,454 --> 01:27:05,471
Typical behavior from that one.

1515
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:07,606
But seeing it again makes me feel better.

914
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:11,041
I'll take care of mine and Miss
Suzumiya's portion of the bill.

1169
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:15,779
So are you guys... you know, close?

2035
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:21,502
As a matter of fact, I am in love with Miss Suzumiya.

384
01:27:23,799 --> 01:27:24,863
Are you serious?

1790
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:27,977
Yes. I happen to think she's a charming person.

972
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,280
Oh, I've heard that line before.

1672
01:27:30,409 --> 01:27:34,643
Unfortunately, Miss Suzumiya isn't
interested in someone as ordinary as myself.

1883
01:27:35,245 --> 01:27:39,307
The only reason she started talking to me in the
first place was because I was a transfer student.

1925
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,112
And lately I can tell she's getting bored with me.

2097
01:27:45,924 --> 01:27:51,401
So let me get this straight. In your world, you
weren't the type of person who attracted her attention?

631
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:52,743
Hate to break it to you,

1673
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:57,213
but the only special ability I have was
getting myself mixed up in weird happenings.

420
01:27:57,948 --> 01:27:58,901
Very interesting.

973
01:27:59,377 --> 01:28:03,948
Then the Miss Suzumiya in your
world is only interested in you,

1837
01:28:04,307 --> 01:28:06,850
not some unique characteristic or special power.

1791
01:28:07,745 --> 01:28:12,526
Of course, that's assuming that Miss Suzumiya
of your world has the same personality as mine.

421
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,596
Makes me jealous.

2036
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:32,630
What are you doing? Don't just stand there. Hurry up!

265
01:28:33,715 --> 01:28:34,585
Shall we go?

15
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:35,995
Uh…

653
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,729
Come on. Hurry. Let's go!

1477
01:28:42,463 --> 01:28:45,580
Crap! School's been out for a while now.

1884
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,280
And I told Nagato I'd be coming to the club room.

974
01:28:48,713 --> 01:28:51,166
Please wait a little bit longer.

534
01:29:04,544 --> 01:29:06,074
We're here. Now what?

1838
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:10,784
I don't mind you guys crashing my school, but
your uniforms would stick out like a sore thumb.

2198
01:29:11,202 --> 01:29:13,962
That might be a problem if a teacher catches us, you know.

422
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:15,880
Yeah, good point.

2161
01:29:17,534 --> 01:29:20,588
I got it. Here's what we're gonna do. Come on. Huddle up.

244
01:29:22,756 --> 01:29:23,536
You got it?

654
01:29:25,244 --> 01:29:26,714
That's the Haruhi I know.

1105
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:33,698
I sure hope you wash these things.

563
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:36,276
Yep. About a week ago.

2037
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:39,530
Okay, is there a good place to change into the these?

470
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:40,980
Right here is fine.

1354
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,174
I didn't think your legs were so long.

1417
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:55,112
Hey, John, make sure no one's watching.

82
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,000
Yeah.

129
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,692
Uh…Hey!

1030
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,815
What are you worried about.
I've got a t-shirt on underneath.

130
01:30:03,154 --> 01:30:04,754
Yeah...

180
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,385
All done!

655
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:10,589
Aren't you a little cold?

245
01:30:10,863 --> 01:30:11,613
Not at all!

1623
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,860
Hey, could you put your hair in a ponytail?

43
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,250
Why?

564
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:20,431
No reason. Never mind.

502
01:30:22,245 --> 01:30:23,573
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1516
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:27,720
It doesn't look like it takes much effort
but it's annoying trying to get it right.

2098
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,830
I guess that makes me look like I'm really working out.

385
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,360
How's this look?

159
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,420
Spot on.

1106
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:38,963
In fact, I think it makes you look
thirty-six percent more charming.

342
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:41,230
What an idiot.

768
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,346
Hey, Koizumi, are you ready?

471
01:30:44,683 --> 01:30:46,549
Yes, I am, I think.

472
01:30:46,986 --> 01:30:48,386
Now, you look cold.

212
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,950
Yes, well,

915
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,186
Miss Suzumiya, if you are not
planning on wearing the jacket,

1418
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:54,840
would it be possible for me to wear it?

83
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:55,424
Nope.

1571
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,120
I have to use the jacket to hide our bags.

656
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,346
Here you go, John, catch!

1419
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,126
Okay, we're gonna sneak into the school

1624
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:07,250
by pretending we just came back from a run.

105
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:08,150
Ready?

854
01:31:10,276 --> 01:31:12,675
Here we go! One, two, one two!

855
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,182
Stopping Haruhi from running
off is pretty much impossible.

2065
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:19,534
And I mean that in absolutely every sense of the word.

503
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:21,166
I certainly knew it.

2162
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:24,245
And present circumstances prove this Koizumi knew it too.

856
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,460
What's happening now is kinda
funny when you think about it.

1517
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,940
It's taking so much work for these two
trying to get onto the North High campus.

1706
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:34,719
Just three days ago, they were students here.

632
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:38,573
So she stayed out today.

1291
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:43,650
This was a lot easier than I thought.

361
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:44,820
Don't be silly.

1355
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:48,860
It's getting late. Are you sure Miss
Nagato will still be in the club room?

1107
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,430
She will, but we have to hurry up.

343
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:51,705
Wait a second!

181
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,080
What now?

2066
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,915
Change our plan. We should capture Miss Asahina first.

694
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,330
Wait. We're supposed to...

1707
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,752
Miss Nagato can wait for a little bit longer.

1885
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:02,666
Hey, don't worry, we'll be in and out in a flash.

857
01:32:04,768 --> 01:32:06,330
Okay, to the calligraphy club!

1792
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,643
I'm sorry, Nagato. Please wait a little longer.

975
01:32:09,987 --> 01:32:11,948
Is there a Miss Asahina in here?

303
01:32:13,006 --> 01:32:14,946
That's... me?

916
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:17,080
I told her not to make a scene.

769
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:19,100
Hey, is that her over there?

598
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,640
Is she really a junior?

1518
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,643
No mistake at all. That's definitely her.

1236
01:32:26,799 --> 01:32:30,963
You there. I'm Suzumiya, Head of the
Student Council Intelligence Agency!

1886
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,660
Mikuru Asahina, I'd like to have a word with you.

1625
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,784
Please gather your things and come with me.

2038
01:32:36,049 --> 01:32:40,640
Student Council lntel... Have I done something wrong?

734
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,915
I'm so sorry, Miss Asahina.

131
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,780
Nagato.

695
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:50,860
Sorry I'm late. I got a...

696
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,635
Watch out. Coming through.

535
01:32:53,558 --> 01:32:55,108
Pardon the intrusion!

423
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:56,600
Sorry about this.

446
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:02,270
Well, hello there.

304
01:33:05,002 --> 01:33:06,600
Where are we?

424
01:33:06,752 --> 01:33:07,909
I haven't done...

735
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:10,510
Why did you lock the door?!

1031
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:11,460
What do you think you're doing...

344
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:12,340
Just be quiet.

1708
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:16,322
It's like before. I'm getting all misty-eyed.

345
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:18,017
Ah, nostalgia.

736
01:33:18,057 --> 01:33:19,768
So you're Miss Yuki Nagato?

917
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,056
Hi, there. I'm Haruhi Suzumiya!

1926
01:33:22,572 --> 01:33:25,447
And this cutie with the big boobs is Miss Asahina!

1572
01:33:26,015 --> 01:33:29,087
And the guy in the gym clothes is Koizumi.

106
01:33:29,957 --> 01:33:30,757
Hello.

1108
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,345
That's not suspicious or anything.

2199
01:33:33,862 --> 01:33:36,814
And I think you already know John Smith over there, right?

425
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:38,540
Who's John Smith?

1170
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,533
Yeah, just let that one go for now.

1292
01:33:42,244 --> 01:33:44,712
So this is the SOS Brigade club room.

1709
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:47,095
There's nothing here, but it's got potential.

1237
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:50,234
We can start filling up the
empty spots with all kinds of stuff.

160
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:54,572
I, uh...

1839
01:33:54,597 --> 01:33:56,478
Okay. So, what's the first thing we're gonna do?

44
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,090
Huh?

918
01:33:57,281 --> 01:34:00,572
Wait, You came all the way over
here and you don't have a plan?

1032
01:34:00,805 --> 01:34:03,065
Man, you are exactly like Haruhi.

2067
01:34:04,094 --> 01:34:07,033
You know, on second thought this place might not work.

737
01:34:07,622 --> 01:34:09,002
What are you talking about?

1171
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:12,587
Look, I really like the idea of
using this room as our headquarters

1840
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,220
but it's gonna take me forever to get over here.

473
01:34:15,766 --> 01:34:17,026
Hey, wait a minute.

1420
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:20,915
What if we pick a time and meet over
the cafe in front of the train station?

738
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:23,556
Hang on. I have a question.

1962
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:28,380
Are you trying to start up an SOS Brigade in this
world because it sounds an awful lot like you were.

1841
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,650
I haven't really decided what I'm gonna call it.

2099
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:33,580
Come to think of it though, that's not such a bad idea.

1573
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:37,766
Whatever I call it, the first mission is
going to be getting you back to your world

1842
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:39,587
assuming you're from a different one, of course.

362
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,517
If not, then...

599
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:42,041
Okay, but before you...

2129
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:57,049
What did you do that for? You scared the heck out of me.

1033
01:34:57,424 --> 01:34:59,127
Don't go turning it on like that.

1519
01:35:00,533 --> 01:35:02,910
You mean you didn't turn the computer on?

1293
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:07,320
Perhaps someone adjusted the
settings to automatically turn it on.

386
01:35:10,092 --> 01:35:11,302
Let me see that!

1109
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,860
What's happening? What's going on?

770
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:15,526
I don't know. Hang on a sec.

84
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:31,370
John?

1110
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,600
Are you gonna tell us what's going
on or have you gone totally crazy?

657
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,978
I'm okay. Perfectly sane.

1238
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:54,174
Yeah. You're definitely not, Nagato.

1793
01:36:04,978 --> 01:36:08,120
You got it. Everyone present and accounted for.

1294
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,744
I can't take credit for this one. No.

1111
01:36:16,212 --> 01:36:19,228
Haruhi dragged Koizumi and
everyone else here all by herself.

1356
01:36:19,759 --> 01:36:22,392
By the way, Nagato, it's been a while.

771
01:37:10,486 --> 01:37:11,930
What's up with the computer?

1626
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,900
What's that weird message supposed to mean?

697
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,740
Well, say something, John.

1627
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:20,090
Nagato, does any of this stuff ring a bell?

246
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:21,860
It doesn't.

504
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,230
You sure about that?

505
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:25,820
Of course, I'm sure.

1710
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:31,462
Nagato figured out the way to send a message.

1963
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,560
I don't know what this emergency escape program is.

600
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:36,290
But if she's behind it,

1628
01:37:36,587 --> 01:37:38,520
I have to trust she knows what she's doing.

1295
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:43,300
I mean, at this point doubting
her would be like doubting my sanity.

1034
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,770
Hey, John. What's wrong with you?

1296
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,620
You've got a funny look on your face.

1112
01:37:47,876 --> 01:37:50,962
You're not telling me what's going
on and it started to freak me out.

305
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:52,140
I mean the...

739
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:53,540
Just be quiet for a second!

2163
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:58,630
I'm sorry. I just need a little time to think about this.

182
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,350
How rude!

536
01:38:06,665 --> 01:38:08,120
What's that look for?

161
01:38:08,892 --> 01:38:09,612
Nothing.

213
01:38:36,087 --> 01:38:36,970
It's okay.

132
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:40,275
Nagato.

601
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:42,180
You can have this back.

214
01:38:42,916 --> 01:38:43,821
I'm sorry.

85
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:50,450
Okay.

387
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:03,337
You see, Nagato.

1843
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:06,392
In my world I was already a member in this club.

1478
01:39:07,572 --> 01:39:11,173
It'd be kind of redundant if I went
through the process of joining in again.

447
01:39:12,392 --> 01:39:13,806
Try to understand.

1887
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:21,017
The truth is, in the place where I come from
I'm the first official member of the SOS Brigade.

602
01:39:24,173 --> 01:39:27,350
Right. Okay. Here goes.

658
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:48,923
I will never forgive you.

426
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,853
Makes me jealous.

805
01:40:08,955 --> 01:40:12,337
Is this... the literary club?

2200
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:17,705
Funny. It doesn't feel like I've returned to my old world.

1357
01:40:18,494 --> 01:40:20,790
This is the same room I was in before.

1297
01:40:21,728 --> 01:40:25,275
But it doesn't have any of the SOS
Brigade stuff that Haruhi brought in.

183
01:40:27,169 --> 01:40:28,099
It's hot.

919
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,220
Damn, it's like summer in here.

474
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:35,806
Wait, when is this?

1711
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:43,420
When I looked, my shoes weren't in my locker.

1712
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:46,320
And this was definitely the middle of summer.

920
01:40:46,716 --> 01:40:49,775
I get the feeling I've been
thrown into another time again.

2164
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:54,086
First thing is first. I gotta figure out what year it is.

1964
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:56,798
And what month, what day, hour, down to the minute.

1239
01:40:57,150 --> 01:41:00,150
There's a big difference for me
whether it's the past or the future.

698
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:17,494
Welcome to the store, sir.

699
01:41:19,431 --> 01:41:22,376
So that's it, huh? Nagato.

448
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:24,990
Today is Tanabata.

1113
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:28,103
July the seventh, three years ago.

806
01:41:28,694 --> 01:41:30,384
That can only mean one thing.

1479
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,431
That's right. That day in the club room,

1240
01:41:36,456 --> 01:41:38,230
when Haruhi had us make our tanzaku.

976
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:41,620
After everyone left, I time
traveled here with Miss Asahina,

1520
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,595
and met up with the adult version of her.

2130
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:49,275
I got stuck that night helping the middle school version
of Haruhi draw all those weird symbols at the school.

1521
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:54,533
After that, Miss Asahina found out
she couldn't get us back to our own time.

1574
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:56,980
So we went Nagato's house to ask for help.

2001
01:41:57,364 --> 01:42:00,400
And that can only mean one thing. They're both here.

1713
01:42:01,298 --> 01:42:03,718
I've got two people who can help me get back.

1965
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:07,860
After time traveling on that crazy day of Tanabata,

1844
01:42:08,132 --> 01:42:10,580
I showed up in this world at about nine o'clock.

1888
01:42:11,759 --> 01:42:14,220
Miss Asahina fell asleep right after we got here.

2002
01:42:14,744 --> 01:42:17,525
And then the adult version of Miss Asahina showed up

1927
01:42:17,658 --> 01:42:20,158
and told me where to go and what to do from there.

2039
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,165
I know where Nagato lives so I can go there any time.

1035
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:28,595
But before I do, I think I'd
better go see someone else first.

306
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:54,540
There we are.

1522
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,165
Wow. This is making me jealous of myself.

2040
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,680
Right now I wish I could switch places with that guy.

1241
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,165
It would be nice but back then, now,

1242
01:43:09,205 --> 01:43:11,056
I didn't meet another version of me.

427
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:12,640
If I show up now,

2165
01:43:12,697 --> 01:43:15,189
it would conflict with the memories I have of that night.

858
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:20,361
I'd rather not mess with the
space-time continuum any more,

506
01:43:20,412 --> 01:43:21,658
thank you very much.

307
01:43:26,318 --> 01:43:27,446
Miss Asahina?

1036
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:32,923
She's out and if I remember
correctly, a few seconds later...

1794
01:43:34,064 --> 01:43:37,189
Yes. The adult Miss Asahina makes her entrance!

700
01:43:37,431 --> 01:43:38,281
Hello there Kyon, It's me.

859
01:43:38,306 --> 01:43:40,064
It's just like how I remember.

475
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:41,297
After this happens,

1889
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:43,610
I'm supposed to go meet the middle school Haruhi.

1421
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:46,450
But this version of me has other plans.

308
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:57,220
Miss Asahina.

388
01:44:01,810 --> 01:44:03,845
I, uh. I just...

476
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:05,976
Good evening, Kyon.

1714
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,790
It's been a while since we talked, hasn't it?

1243
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:16,204
I'm glad we were able to meet again.

1037
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:20,010
Although I wish it wasn't due to
another one of my silly mistakes.

2166
01:44:20,329 --> 01:44:23,780
Miss Asahina, don't tell me you knew I'd be here tonight.

1038
01:44:24,072 --> 01:44:28,033
I mean, that you'd see this other
version of me here in this time.

1172
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:31,423
Yes. I've known about it all along.

603
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:34,540
You knew about it, huh?

1039
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:38,251
Then the night of Tanabata, three
years ago, that was your doing?

1629
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:42,930
'Cause if it was, then you must've given
the teenage Asahina the order to come here.

1715
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:47,570
Yes. It was necessary to set it up like that.

1114
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:51,212
If I didn't, you wouldn't have
known to come to the park tonight.

45
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:56,125
Uhh…

1966
01:44:56,330 --> 01:45:01,095
Haruhi mentioned something about hearing John
Smith calling out to her when she was walking home.

659
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,530
Right. The mystery voice.

363
01:45:03,935 --> 01:45:04,975
Know who it is?

860
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:08,236
It's you. This version of you.

2167
01:45:10,822 --> 01:45:13,837
Right now my priority is to get you where you need to be.

1575
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:18,095
But after the mission's complete, you'll
have to decide your next step on your own.

1890
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:21,250
All I can do is point you in the right direction.

1523
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:30,390
What happened to the flow of time anyway?

1298
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:33,548
I mean it's like the whole darn
thing's gone completely out of whack.

807
01:45:33,903 --> 01:45:36,083
I can't tell you the details.

772
01:45:36,414 --> 01:45:37,904
Classified information, huh.

565
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:39,680
Oh, no, it's not that.

2003
01:45:40,423 --> 01:45:43,040
I can't explain it to you in a way you'd understand.

2100
01:45:43,423 --> 01:45:46,392
I can only give you a general idea of the circumstances

2201
01:45:46,544 --> 01:45:49,509
like how I did when we first met and I told you who I was.

1480
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,260
Explaining would only complicate things.

86
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,560
Yeah.

1358
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:57,548
I knew you'd understand the situation.

1173
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:01,806
You said something once that was
sort of like what Nagato would say.

1928
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:05,915
Something about how the computers of the
future weren't at all like the ones we have today.

1524
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:11,220
Yes, the computer and network system you
rely on in your time are physical things.

1040
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,212
But in my time, we've gotten
rid of their physical properties.

1576
01:46:14,384 --> 01:46:16,587
They exist like thoughts inside our heads.

346
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:18,478
Like the TPDD.

808
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:20,579
All right, your time machine.

1174
01:46:21,275 --> 01:46:25,267
Time Plane Destruction Device. Yes.

604
01:46:26,423 --> 01:46:27,920
Wasn't that classified?

2068
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:32,431
I don't have as many restrictions now as I had before.

2202
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:36,009
And believe me, I had to work my butt off to get this far.

1630
01:46:42,697 --> 01:46:44,869
Do you have any idea why this is happening?

2131
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:47,954
All I know is that the time I was living in has changed.

1716
01:46:48,246 --> 01:46:50,861
But when did it happen and why did it happen?

1525
01:46:51,290 --> 01:46:55,431
The only person who could answer that
question is the Miss Nagato of this time.

633
01:46:56,158 --> 01:46:57,954
But I can say one thing.

1845
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:04,197
The time plane you came from was altered
early in the morning on December the eighteenth,

1244
01:47:04,419 --> 01:47:06,769
three years from this point in time.

1175
01:47:09,033 --> 01:47:13,642
I see. I guess that means I
didn't wake up in a parallel world.

773
01:47:14,311 --> 01:47:16,298
The whole world was changed.

701
01:47:16,703 --> 01:47:18,587
That seems to be the case.

215
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:20,090
Let's see.

216
01:47:21,861 --> 01:47:22,845
Look here.

977
01:47:23,582 --> 01:47:25,837
This is the normal flow of time.

2004
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:29,228
But three years from now on December the eighteenth,

1481
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,861
the world, your world changed like this.

702
01:47:33,203 --> 01:47:35,933
In one night the STC data,

809
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,267
um, the world itself changed.

1176
01:47:40,619 --> 01:47:44,697
The disruption in space-time was so
big, we could see it in the future.

1967
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:48,150
To return it to normal requires Miss Nagato's help.

634
01:47:48,588 --> 01:47:50,288
And your help too, Kyon.

703
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,390
It won't work without you.

660
01:47:53,324 --> 01:47:54,869
Who's responsible for it?

2005
01:47:55,298 --> 01:47:58,454
Well, I guess that's obvious. It's got to be Haruhi.

16
01:47:59,353 --> 01:47:59,863
No.

1526
01:48:00,947 --> 01:48:03,564
Miss Suzumiya isn't the person behind it.

1482
01:48:05,634 --> 01:48:08,642
Although, you do know who the person is.

605
01:48:09,697 --> 01:48:11,197
But if it isn't Haruhi,

364
01:48:12,135 --> 01:48:13,475
then who is it?

1115
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:15,709
I suppose we still have some time.

1177
01:48:16,775 --> 01:48:18,850
Do you mind if we talked for a bit?

1752
01:48:22,228 --> 01:48:25,462
Back then I didn't know my left from my right.

1753
01:48:25,711 --> 01:48:28,329
Miss Suzumiya did whatever she wanted with me.

1245
01:48:29,353 --> 01:48:32,050
She made me wear all those costumes.

87
01:48:32,321 --> 01:48:33,221
Yeah.

1178
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:37,744
It was a lot of trouble at the time
but they're all happy memories now.

507
01:48:39,676 --> 01:48:41,136
Kyon, you know what?

88
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:42,490
What?

1929
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:48,322
One day, you're going to look back on the days
you spent as a high school student with nostalgia.

978
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:53,361
This time in your life will be
over before you even realize it.

774
01:48:54,010 --> 01:48:56,384
It'll all seem like a dream.

309
01:49:07,737 --> 01:49:09,126
Miss Asahina?

635
01:49:19,462 --> 01:49:21,340
Sorry. What did you say?

1527
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,494
Our time is almost up here. We should go.

1577
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:30,711
Oh, right. You mean to Nagato's apartment.

1246
01:49:30,736 --> 01:49:35,517
Not just yet. Don't you have
something else you need to do first?

46
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:44,994
Hey!

1422
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:50,353
John Smith wishes you the best of
luck in making the world more exciting!

537
01:49:55,498 --> 01:49:57,056
Remember him, Haruhi.

508
01:49:57,819 --> 01:49:59,337
Remember John Smith.

1299
01:50:00,556 --> 01:50:03,900
Whatever you do, remember I was here.

347
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,180
Hold on, Kyon.

1930
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:29,962
I'm sorry. I still feel uneasy around Miss Nagato.

1717
01:50:33,090 --> 01:50:35,744
I think I understand how you'd feel that way.

266
01:50:43,689 --> 01:50:45,454
Nagato, hey.

810
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:50,140
Listen, something's happened.
It's sort of hard to explain,

1528
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:52,048
but I've come back from the future again.

1041
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,025
The adult Miss Asahina's with me.

775
01:50:55,329 --> 01:50:56,939
I really need your help now.

1116
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:00,673
In fact it's because of you that
I've come back to this time again.

2101
01:51:01,392 --> 01:51:04,165
Miss Asahina and I should be up in your guest room now.

1483
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:06,690
We are sleeping in there frozen in time.

776
01:51:10,994 --> 01:51:13,376
It's back to room 708 again.

740
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,658
Nagato can figure this out.

861
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,923
She'd better figure this out.
Otherwise, I'm in big trouble.

365
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:33,850
May we come in?

477
01:51:38,072 --> 01:51:39,244
It's gonna be okay.

538
01:51:40,837 --> 01:51:42,927
I know. You're right.

606
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:44,611
I'm sure it'll be fine.

1968
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:57,140
No mistake about it. This is the Nagato I remember.

1529
01:51:57,315 --> 01:51:59,655
I guess I don't need to introduce myself.

2168
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:03,140
But I'd like you to meet Miss Asahina, the adult version.

310
01:52:03,462 --> 01:52:04,662
I understand.

741
01:52:08,312 --> 01:52:09,592
May I have a look in there?

184
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,340
I mean...

1117
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:15,340
You may not. The room is
designed to freeze time within it.

811
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:23,776
It sounds complicated I know,

1969
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:26,020
but that's pretty much exactly the way it happened.

1674
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:35,611
This proves that you are the one responsible
for bringing me back here from the future.

133
01:52:43,767 --> 01:52:44,857
U-Um...

1754
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:50,322
I'd like to straighten out this
abnormality in space time as soon as possible.

1484
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:54,510
But you are the only one who can restore
the time-plane back to the way it was.

607
01:52:54,602 --> 01:52:55,852
And so I'm begging you.

267
01:52:59,060 --> 01:52:59,980
Please help.

1423
01:53:05,236 --> 01:53:08,249
I'm also begging you, Great God Nagato.

509
01:53:08,423 --> 01:53:09,893
That's my wish, too.

366
01:53:10,569 --> 01:53:11,689
I will confirm.

428
01:53:19,934 --> 01:53:21,054
I failed to sync.

2132
01:53:22,304 --> 01:53:25,851
I cannot access my variant in that space-time continuum.

1530
01:53:26,233 --> 01:53:31,062
She has erected a system barrier that
does deny my request for synchronization.

2133
01:53:31,999 --> 01:53:35,940
I understand the situation now. Restoration is possible.

1931
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,310
The one responsible for this space-time alteration

1179
01:53:42,593 --> 01:53:46,429
did so by harnessing Haruhi
Suzumiya's ability to generate data

1042
01:53:46,585 --> 01:53:49,937
as well as altering specific
sectors of data within the world.

1359
01:53:50,447 --> 01:53:54,819
That is why Haruhi Suzumiya was
left powerless after the modification.

1531
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,420
And why the Data Integration Though
Entity does not exist in that time-plane.

1300
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:04,163
Haruhi Suzumiya's powers were
stolen and used to alter memory data.

1360
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:08,194
The range of the alteration begins
on the morning of December eighteenth,

1361
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:13,066
three years and five months from
now, and stretches backwards 365 days.

348
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:13,710
Wait a minute.

1846
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:20,788
You're saying the memories inside this range
have changed, but everything before is the same.

1180
01:54:21,130 --> 01:54:24,421
If that's true, then is the version
of you I'm talking to right now,

979
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:28,070
the three years ago July seventh
version of you the original you?

162
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:29,110
Correct.

1847
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:35,773
To return the world to the way it was,
return to the December eighteenth of the future.

2041
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,765
When the process that alters space-time is completed,

1675
01:54:38,882 --> 01:54:41,180
you must activate the program to correct it.

1532
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,366
You're gonna come with me, though. Right?

510
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:44,650
I cannot leave here.

163
01:54:45,005 --> 01:54:45,875
Why not?

1301
01:54:46,404 --> 01:54:48,284
I cannot leave the two of them alone.

921
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:51,601
The versions of Miss Asahina
and me that are frozen in time.

367
01:54:52,522 --> 01:54:54,042
Emergency Mode.

742
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:56,910
But then, what should I do?

268
01:55:01,069 --> 01:55:02,117
Compositing.

1362
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:27,124
You must inject the correction program
into the one who altered space-time.

1755
01:55:28,694 --> 01:55:31,101
Don't you have a less painful way of doing it?

2203
01:55:31,671 --> 01:55:34,640
I mean, what if I stuck them in the wrong place with that?

107
01:55:36,295 --> 01:55:36,985
Right.

2102
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,640
There you go creating dangerous-looking things again...

2204
01:55:50,810 --> 01:55:53,788
The program will be effective if injected through clothing

1795
01:55:53,952 --> 01:55:56,960
however, direct contact with skin is preferred.

1247
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:06,101
You're kidding. This thing
doesn't shoot real bullets, does it?

349
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,952
Short needles.

1932
01:56:08,265 --> 01:56:11,015
The program is applied to the tips of the needles.

1756
01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:21,257
So who am I supposed to shoot with this thing?

478
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:24,760
Who is responsible?

2006
01:56:25,726 --> 01:56:30,233
I want the name of the person who altered
space-time and changed the world and everyone in it.

1424
01:56:31,301 --> 01:56:33,827
If Haruhi didn't do this, then who did?

185
01:56:40,883 --> 01:56:41,765
It was...

389
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:00,780
Are you serious?

47
01:57:01,810 --> 01:57:02,300
Yes.

511
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:05,030
Is that really true?

48
01:57:05,675 --> 01:57:06,215
Yes.

1718
01:57:10,237 --> 01:57:12,679
I will upload the coordinates of your target.

390
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:15,460
Okay. Thank you.

311
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:22,180
I understand.

1302
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:26,554
So then we just go there to inject
the correction program and that's it?

704
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:28,718
In your present condition,

1970
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:31,760
you will be caught in the alteration of space-time.

539
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,468
I will counteract it.

217
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:39,997
Your hand.

1971
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,645
I have deployed an Anti-Data Reconfiguration Screen

2042
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:12,653
and a protective field onto the surface of your body.

312
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:14,630
You are next.

89
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:15,817
Okay.

1757
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,756
I never apologized for what happened that day.

1363
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:25,020
I remember the last time you did this.

862
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:27,160
This is the first time for me.

512
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,661
Oh, it is, isn't it?

247
01:58:39,219 --> 01:58:40,069
Okay, Kyon.

922
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:43,263
We really should get going now.

368
01:58:48,774 --> 01:58:49,794
Thanks, Nagato.

350
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:51,309
I do not mind.

479
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:55,669
Nagato, will you...

705
01:58:58,099 --> 01:59:01,794
Are you gonna wait for me?

134
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:03,600
I will.

513
01:59:17,661 --> 01:59:19,030
Are you ready, Kyon?

1758
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:39,513
Watch out, this might make you a little dizzy.

248
01:59:40,230 --> 01:59:41,208
Here we go.

249
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:50,091
We're here.

1796
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:59,544
This is the time and place Miss Nagato gave me.

2134
02:00:01,138 --> 02:00:03,895
It's the place where Haruhi and Koizumi changed clothes.

566
02:00:04,716 --> 02:00:07,489
Coincidence? I wonder.

218
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:09,890
It's cold.

429
02:00:17,747 --> 02:00:18,716
Sorry about this,

351
02:00:18,990 --> 02:00:19,730
but thank you.

1364
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:21,856
No worries. It's the least I could do.

863
02:00:23,570 --> 02:00:25,770
We forgot to put on our shoes.

1797
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:29,849
I hope Miss Nagato still has them at her place.

1759
02:00:30,013 --> 02:00:32,270
I don't really think she just throw them away.

269
02:00:32,524 --> 02:00:33,599
That's true.

391
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:37,669
Let's get going.

1118
02:00:43,356 --> 02:00:47,434
We've landed on December
eighteenth at 4:18 in the morning.

1119
02:00:47,958 --> 02:00:50,050
The world hasn't been changed yet,

1365
02:00:50,138 --> 02:00:52,880
but in about five minutes, it will be.

1043
02:00:53,278 --> 02:00:56,559
Which means Haruhi and Koizumi
are still students in North High.

2069
02:00:57,013 --> 02:01:00,330
And if I went home, I'd find myself blissfully asleep,

1676
02:01:00,419 --> 02:01:02,330
knowing nothing of what was about to happen.

219
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:03,930
Get ready.

1044
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:17,200
It's who Nagato said it would be.

1120
02:01:17,489 --> 02:01:19,484
The person who altered space-time.

706
02:01:20,283 --> 02:01:21,793
I can't jump out just yet.

1366
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:25,184
We wait until the process is finished,

1760
02:01:25,395 --> 02:01:28,036
then I shoot them with the correction program.

1677
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:03,911
This is it. It's a disruption of space-time.

661
02:02:04,570 --> 02:02:06,442
What an incredible power.

1181
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:33,114
It's done. The process is finished.

923
02:02:33,481 --> 02:02:36,716
The world has been changed. And
she's just been reborn into it.

864
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:40,169
Okay, it's our turn now, Kyon.

49
02:03:02,053 --> 02:03:02,633
Hey.

608
02:03:09,487 --> 02:03:11,937
It's me. We meet again.

540
02:03:14,784 --> 02:03:16,661
So it really was you.

1303
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:20,099
What are you doing out here? And why?

2135
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:24,260
Funny, I was just about to ask you the exact same thing.

186
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,684
A walk...

392
02:03:38,556 --> 02:03:39,746
That's not true.

636
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:42,309
That's not true, Nagato.

369
02:03:43,022 --> 02:03:44,182
You were tired.

1367
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,466
You'd had enough of Haruhi's nonsense,

1182
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:48,411
getting dragged all over the place.

980
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:50,294
You were tired of protecting me.

1933
02:03:50,575 --> 02:03:52,646
And you were tired of whatever else you had to do,

981
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:54,270
stuff we didn't even know about.

865
02:03:54,810 --> 02:03:57,620
The fatigue you felt from all
those things kept building up.

1121
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:03,940
A collection of error data will
accumulate in my memory over time.

982
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:07,755
The bugs will eventually become
triggers and affect my behavior.

1533
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:11,224
Also these circumstances are unavoidable.

1848
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:17,075
Three years from now on the morning of
December eighteen, I will reconstruct the world.

514
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:18,786
I cannot prevent it.

1485
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:23,620
Because I am currently unable to
identify exactly what the error data is.

313
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,934
Well, I know.

743
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:28,474
I know what the trigger is.

1678
02:04:28,614 --> 02:04:31,150
That caused your abnormal shift in behavior.

924
02:04:31,921 --> 02:04:35,111
I know what the error data is
that kept piling up inside you.

1761
02:04:35,809 --> 02:04:39,200
The truth is it's something completely cliche.

1304
02:04:40,045 --> 02:04:41,974
Even though you're a human interface,

925
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:44,817
and you can't operate beyond
the limits of your programming.

1425
02:04:45,130 --> 02:04:47,130
This is something even you aren't into.

1248
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:51,099
Sure you don't understand. But I do.

866
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:53,270
And I'm sure Haruhi does, too.

393
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,763
You see, Nagato.

637
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:59,224
They're called feelings.

1486
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:04,677
It figures you wanna experience
emotions, when you never even have them.

1934
02:05:05,170 --> 02:05:10,992
I mean, didn't you wanna shout, or cry, or
yell "leave me alone, I've had enough," sometimes?

1891
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:14,794
Well, even if you never thought about that stuff,

926
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:17,044
it's normal for you to want to.

1368
02:05:17,559 --> 02:05:19,280
You should've been allowed to do that.

662
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,830
I'm partly to blame, too.

1631
02:05:22,110 --> 02:05:24,841
Good! Now lift you leg like you gonna jump.

1183
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:29,890
Without thinking, I made it a
habit to rely on you more and more.

1632
02:05:30,567 --> 02:05:33,216
I wouldn't think for myself. It was always.

1798
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:36,169
"Oh, Nagato can fix this. She can do anything."

1799
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,653
Turns out I'm an even bigger idiot than Haruhi.

744
02:05:40,036 --> 02:05:41,800
And all I did was complain.

812
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,270
With all of that stacking up.

1578
02:05:45,232 --> 02:05:49,294
It's no wonder you finally went so
screwy that you tried to change the world.

394
02:05:50,710 --> 02:05:52,864
A bug? An error?

707
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:55,302
Seriously, give it a rest.

541
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:57,677
Nagato wished for it.

2070
02:05:57,903 --> 02:06:00,780
She just wanted to live in a normal world, that's all.

2136
02:06:01,420 --> 02:06:04,145
And after worrying about it for the past couple of days.

1679
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:06,790
I finally have the answer I was looking for.

1184
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:12,192
Why did she leave it to me to
get everything back the way it was.

542
02:06:12,957 --> 02:06:14,082
The answer is simple.

1487
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:17,291
She trusted me to make the right choice.

2103
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:22,620
The altered world? Or the original? Which one's better.

867
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:26,010
And I have to choose. Damn it.

813
02:06:27,965 --> 02:06:29,885
What the hell I was thinking.

1633
02:06:30,363 --> 02:06:32,550
All the things that happened around Haruhi.

1680
02:06:32,887 --> 02:06:35,254
Every little thing that defied common sense.

663
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,043
How do I feel about them?

430
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:38,460
I'm sick of them.

395
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:39,754
I've had enough.

220
02:06:40,247 --> 02:06:40,927
Seriously.

927
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:43,153
I can't take much more of this.

1488
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:52,400
I am a normal guy who just happened
to get sucked into all this crazy stuff.

1579
02:06:53,051 --> 02:06:57,543
A high schooler struggling against the
unreasonable impossible demands of Haruhi.

1719
02:06:57,950 --> 02:07:00,330
I should've taken a harder stance against it.

664
02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:02,168
So that's how it is, huh?

665
02:07:02,914 --> 02:07:04,364
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

868
02:07:04,814 --> 02:07:06,414
It's question and answer time.

1800
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:12,150
It's an important question, so listen up, okay?

543
02:07:12,681 --> 02:07:13,931
And I want an answer.

1045
02:07:14,348 --> 02:07:16,438
Ready? Then, let's take the quiz.

1580
02:07:23,881 --> 02:07:26,411
Think about it. Then, give me your answer.

869
02:07:26,949 --> 02:07:29,082
Come on, go ahead, and say it.

2222
02:07:29,895 --> 02:07:34,688
Haruhi forced to do all kinds of crazy things, and
if that wasn't enough you were attacked by aliens,

2223
02:07:34,712 --> 02:07:38,395
and you had to listen to weird stories
from time-travelers and espers, too.

2071
02:07:38,910 --> 02:07:42,342
One weird unexplainable thing happening after another.

2205
02:07:42,809 --> 02:07:48,434
And a cherry on top is the iron-clad rule that Haruhi had
to be kept in the dark about everything that was going on.

2206
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:52,582
The person behind it all can't found out. It's a catch-22.

1892
02:07:54,036 --> 02:07:56,887
And none of that was fun. Is that what you think?

515
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:58,466
You were sick of it.

370
02:07:58,490 --> 02:07:59,237
You had enough.

352
02:07:59,261 --> 02:08:00,586
It was stupid.

708
02:08:00,610 --> 02:08:02,240
You couldn't take anymore.

480
02:08:02,986 --> 02:08:04,626
Huh, Is that right?

2207
02:08:05,367 --> 02:08:07,942
If you're having trouble following me, let me spit it out.

1305
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:16,100
Uh-huh? That's pretty much how it is.

1849
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:19,637
Be honest with yourself, you can't stand Haruhi.

870
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,486
She is a huge pain in the ass.

1046
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:23,231
Everything she wants to do sucks.

1850
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:26,113
There's no way you had any fun at all, is there?

1122
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:28,996
You can't deny it, don't even try.

431
02:08:38,153 --> 02:08:39,207
So, explain this.

871
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:42,715
Why'd you press the enter key?

814
02:08:43,530 --> 02:08:45,246
The emergency escape program.

1426
02:08:45,476 --> 02:08:47,636
The one Nagato left to undo everything.

2208
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:53,790
And you answered "Yes" to that question. Isn't that right?

1972
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:59,470
Even after the great Miss Nagato went through
all that trouble to give you a calm peaceful world.

481
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:00,900
You turned it down.

609
02:09:01,730 --> 02:09:02,980
Why did you do it, man?

1973
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:05,840
Weren't you the one who is always whining about it?

2007
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:08,770
You were always crying about how miserable you were.

928
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:12,371
If that's the case, then who
cares about the escape program.

745
02:09:12,449 --> 02:09:13,754
You should have ignored it.

1369
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:16,366
Yeah, back in that world you rejected,

1123
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:18,340
Haruhi is just some stuck-up girl.

2008
02:09:18,797 --> 02:09:21,797
And Miss Asahina is just a cute sweet moe character.

1047
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:24,207
Koizumi is a normal highschooler.

1534
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:28,067
And Nagato is just a super shy book worm.

872
02:09:28,575 --> 02:09:30,795
Well, most of the time anyway,

1370
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:34,824
but if she heard some stupid joke I
bet she'd laugh, and then she'd blush.

1306
02:09:35,202 --> 02:09:38,482
And she got older, her heart
would open up a little more everyday.

1762
02:09:38,945 --> 02:09:41,505
You never know, she might have been like that.

1185
02:09:42,231 --> 02:09:45,637
But you had to go and throw away a
normal life by hitting that button.

270
02:09:46,446 --> 02:09:47,366
Why is that?

1801
02:09:55,473 --> 02:09:58,285
Quiz time is over. Time to answer the question.

1935
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:03,910
Don't you think Haruhi and all the weird
things she made happen were just a little bit fun?

271
02:10:04,792 --> 02:10:05,822
Spit it out!

544
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:17,700
Yeah, of course I do!

2043
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:30,120
Of course it was fun! And I loved every minute of it.

1851
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:34,988
Don't go asking me stupid questions that are so…

164
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:38,106
Obvious!

1763
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:51,145
You'd have to be crazy to think it wasn't fun,

1720
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:54,692
only the biggest idiot in the world
would say "it wasn't fun" if they were asked.

1764
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:57,348
They'd be thirty times more dense than Haruhi.

1427
02:10:57,740 --> 02:11:00,210
Aliens, time-travelers and espers, man.

2104
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:04,000
One's enough. But no, I got to hang out with all three.

1186
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:08,121
And then there's Haruhi who's
got the craziest power of them all.

1765
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:12,020
And then, there's all these other
mysterious power sprinkled all over the place.

1535
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:15,192
How could I not find all these stuff fun?

1048
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:19,340
Ask me as many times as you
want, and my answer won't change.

371
02:11:20,049 --> 02:11:21,179
Of course I do.

449
02:11:41,375 --> 02:11:42,635
I guess that's it.

1124
02:11:44,343 --> 02:11:46,263
The other way's definitely better.

1974
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,450
Having the world like this just doesn't feel right.

450
02:11:50,434 --> 02:11:51,683
I'm sorry, Nagato.

1187
02:11:52,004 --> 02:11:55,710
But I like the "you" you used to
be more than the "you" you are now.

1428
02:11:56,446 --> 02:11:58,426
You look better without glasses anyway.

1049
02:11:58,750 --> 02:12:00,410
I don't know what you are saying.

135
02:12:00,449 --> 02:12:01,099
Nagato.

1050
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:03,410
You have to change yourself back,

1536
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,570
change everything back to the way it was.

1371
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:08,060
I can help. All you have to do is ask.

1721
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:12,379
You didn't have to use all that amazing
power you have to change the world like this.

1489
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:14,650
I liked things better the way they were.

90
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:15,480
Kyon,

929
02:12:16,909 --> 02:12:18,434
it doesn't matter what you say.

1975
02:12:18,910 --> 02:12:21,746
This version of Miss Nagato doesn't have any power.

272
02:12:22,230 --> 02:12:23,000
Look at her.

545
02:12:24,959 --> 02:12:26,029
She is a normal girl.

108
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:46,820
Sorry.

396
02:12:51,270 --> 02:12:52,403
Kyon, watch out!

1722
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:14,879
I could never, ever let you hurt Miss Nagato.

1429
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:19,496
What is this…What the heck is going on?

610
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:30,699
It hurts... It hurts...

250
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:34,220
It hurts...

251
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:35,440
It hurts...

252
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:37,110
It hurts...

253
02:13:37,300 --> 02:13:38,598
It hurts...

397
02:13:40,410 --> 02:13:41,785
Miss Asakura...?

1802
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:46,080
You don't have anything to worry about anymore.

314
02:13:46,352 --> 02:13:47,632
I'm here now.

1188
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:53,710
I'll kill anything that
frightens you or tries to hurt you.

1852
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:57,340
After all, that's my only reason for being here.

398
02:14:03,252 --> 02:14:04,512
You should know.

1766
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:09,760
This is exactly what you wished for, isn't it?

91
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:12,170
Well?

315
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:19,830
That's a lie.

1803
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:23,309
There's no way Nagato would've wished for this.

1976
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:26,410
The abnormality that formed inside Nagato's system,

2137
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:29,690
must have caused her to create a malfunctioning Asakura.

1051
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:33,340
That's it. She's Nagato's shadow.

1430
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:37,810
Time to die. It'll be quick, I promise.

1189
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:40,790
You're making Miss Nagato very sad.

1190
02:14:41,903 --> 02:14:44,880
Does it hurt? Savor that sensation.

1307
02:14:45,470 --> 02:14:49,918
Because a few seconds from now, it'll
be the last memory you'll ever have.

451
02:15:04,408 --> 02:15:06,606
What... but how...

50
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:08,640
Why?

1893
02:15:10,872 --> 02:15:13,965
It's like I've seen this happen somewhere before.

709
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:17,926
Damn it. I'm blacking out.

666
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:21,606
Don't die, Kyon. Hang on!

482
02:15:21,630 --> 02:15:22,949
I'm so sorry, Kyon.

667
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:25,879
I knew this would happen.

873
02:15:26,246 --> 02:15:29,395
That hurts, Miss Asahi... nas?

316
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:32,387
Oh, I get it.

516
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:34,160
I'm seeing double...

221
02:15:35,570 --> 02:15:36,692
So cold...

611
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:40,230
The blood won't stop...

273
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:45,020
I'm dying...

1125
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,710
Sorry about this. But I had a good
reason for not stepping in sooner.

1052
02:15:59,230 --> 02:16:01,650
Don't worry. It hurt for me, too.

874
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:06,324
Who? Whatever. I don't know...

2009
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:10,699
We'll take care of everything. Just go to sleep now.

222
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:14,621
Damn it...

187
02:16:16,646 --> 02:16:19,136
Nagato...

2044
02:16:34,876 --> 02:16:39,175
Weird. I feel like I just had the most amazing dream.

875
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:48,926
Look who's decided to wake up.

1804
02:16:49,810 --> 02:16:52,184
You're in a deep sleep for quite a while there.

2045
02:16:54,030 --> 02:16:56,720
I suppose I should say "good morning" to you however,

638
02:16:57,030 --> 02:16:58,410
it's the late afternoon.

1681
02:16:59,410 --> 02:17:01,699
I am glad you regained consciousness though.

1936
02:17:02,690 --> 02:17:04,934
I was starting to get really worried you wouldn't.

136
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:05,910
Oh but,

1537
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:08,370
perhaps your mind is still a little hazy.

1581
02:17:08,473 --> 02:17:10,370
How are you feeling? Do you know who I am?

983
02:17:10,694 --> 02:17:13,254
You first. Do you know who I am?

2209
02:17:14,887 --> 02:17:18,170
Of course I know who you are. What a strange thing to say.

254
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:19,770
When is it?

1126
02:17:20,670 --> 02:17:23,574
Is that really the first thing
you wonder about when you wake up?

1431
02:17:24,074 --> 02:17:25,846
Oh, perhaps you're trying to figure out

1723
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:28,176
what's your current situation is. Is that it?

984
02:17:28,801 --> 02:17:33,817
Either way, it's December the
twenty-first, 4:00 P.M. exactly.

567
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:36,817
It's the twenty-first?

452
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,207
Where am I anyway?

930
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:41,600
The Municipal General Hospital.

1432
02:17:42,168 --> 02:17:44,465
It's a nice room. I bet it's expensive.

1249
02:17:44,817 --> 02:17:48,067
The chairman of the hospital happens
to be an old friend of my uncle's.

1490
02:17:48,418 --> 02:17:50,850
He personally made all the arrangements.

1372
02:17:51,293 --> 02:17:52,918
That's why you get to enjoy this room.

1894
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:56,060
Hate to break it to you, but I know you're lying.

1433
02:17:56,317 --> 02:18:00,074
Correct. The truth is, the Organization
stepped in and arranged everything.

1053
02:18:00,567 --> 02:18:03,637
You know, you've been unconscious
for the past three days now.

985
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:08,207
My superiors were so upset. I
had to submit a written apology.

612
02:18:08,590 --> 02:18:10,028
I got quite a grilling.

1805
02:18:10,670 --> 02:18:13,293
I'm still wondering what I'm doing here though.

568
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:15,082
Why was I unconscious?

483
02:18:15,492 --> 02:18:16,871
You don't remember?

876
02:18:18,106 --> 02:18:21,426
I suppose that's normal. You
did hit your head pretty hard.

2210
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:28,231
It's strange. You don't have any external signs of injury.

2072
02:18:28,879 --> 02:18:31,840
And your brain and internal organs are perfectly fine.

1191
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:35,400
So do you know what happened to me?

931
02:18:36,350 --> 02:18:39,540
Well, what happened was you
fell down the stairs at school.

1127
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:44,960
In fact, it was the most
spectacular tumble I've ever seen.

1937
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:47,770
I was worried for you if you wanna know the truth.

2010
02:18:48,510 --> 02:18:53,074
When you hit the ground, there was a bang so loud, I
wouldn't have been surprised if you'd never woke up.

2211
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:57,580
I fell down the stairs at school on December eighteenth...

986
02:18:58,360 --> 02:19:00,145
It was quite horrifying, really.

2138
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:04,871
An ambulance came and we just watched as they
carried out your limp body and took you to the hospital.

1853
02:19:05,558 --> 02:19:08,668
I've never seen Miss Suzumiya go so pale before.

2046
02:19:09,610 --> 02:19:12,290
And Miss Nagato was the one who called the ambulance.

1128
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:14,830
Her calm demeanor saved your life.

1054
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:17,520
How did Miss Asahina react to it?

1806
02:19:18,170 --> 02:19:20,730
Exactly as you would imagine in that situation.

1250
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:25,082
She was clinging to you, and crying,
and yelling your name, of course.

2212
02:19:25,950 --> 02:19:28,640
Do you remember what time on the eighteenth that happened?

639
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:30,810
It was in the afternoon.

2213
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:34,746
The SOS Brigade was going on a shopping trip for supplies.

453
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:36,500
Shopping for what?

1192
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:38,926
Oh, you don't remember that either?

1582
02:19:39,550 --> 02:19:43,317
On Christmas day, there is a children show
happening in Miss Suzumiya's neighborhood.

1682
02:19:43,650 --> 02:19:47,746
So, naturally she suggested we all get
together and put a show of our own for them.

1583
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:50,810
Still making decisions for the rest of us.

932
02:19:51,291 --> 02:19:52,895
Miss Suzumiya would play Santa.

815
02:19:53,168 --> 02:19:55,960
And after drawing straws, you
won the role of the reindeer.

399
02:19:56,507 --> 02:19:57,567
Congratulations.

1491
02:19:58,070 --> 02:20:02,059
Then we decided to go buy the materials
we needed to make your reindeer costume.

816
02:20:02,428 --> 02:20:04,238
That was the plan, however...

2105
02:20:04,613 --> 02:20:06,957
As we were going down the stairs next to the club room,

1373
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:10,110
you were bringing up the rear and
the next thing we knew, you fell down.

517
02:20:10,730 --> 02:20:12,231
That's a dumb story.

1492
02:20:12,778 --> 02:20:17,106
Miss Suzumiya said when she started down
the stairs, she felt someone else there.

1308
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:21,160
She thought she saw a skirt
flitting past in a corner of her eye.

1493
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:25,863
However, at that time of day, we
were the only ones left in the building.

1129
02:20:26,290 --> 02:20:28,020
I wonder who the mystery woman is.

1767
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:31,060
Do you remember seeing anyone before you fell?

1584
02:20:31,368 --> 02:20:33,328
Do you remember if you were pushed or not?

274
02:20:34,380 --> 02:20:35,762
No, I don't.

2047
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:39,692
I was pushed down the stairs by a mystery woman, huh.

1130
02:20:40,137 --> 02:20:44,082
That theory doesn't sound too
crazy compared to everything else.

710
02:20:47,403 --> 02:20:48,645
Are you the only one here?

2139
02:20:48,887 --> 02:20:51,817
Were you expecting anyone in particular this whole time?

668
02:20:52,004 --> 02:20:53,832
Perhaps, someone special?

1131
02:20:56,770 --> 02:20:59,810
We've been taking shifts and
watching over you while you slept.

1055
02:21:00,082 --> 02:21:03,574
That way, when you woke up you'd
always have someone here for you.

817
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:05,756
Your family's also been here.

1634
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:07,940
They brought you a fresh change of clothes.

1585
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:13,950
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

1854
02:21:15,410 --> 02:21:18,220
It's nothing. I'm just a little jealous, is all.

818
02:21:18,830 --> 02:21:20,830
That's not a problem, I hope.

2048
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:26,120
That's a weird thing to say considering my situation?

1855
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:28,920
All the Brigade members have been taking shifts.

1938
02:21:29,426 --> 02:21:33,949
Miss Suzumiya said that watching out for the
safety of her subordinates was her responsibility.

1895
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:50,090
She has been here the whole time. For three days.

1494
02:21:50,890 --> 02:21:54,559
You really had her worried. And me, too.

1251
02:21:55,510 --> 02:21:58,574
And you know what happens when
Miss Suzumiya's mood gets shaken up.

2214
02:21:59,230 --> 02:22:03,043
Well, I'll tell you all about what's being going on later.

1374
02:22:04,676 --> 02:22:08,504
Don't you have more pressing matters
to attend to besides chatting with me?

1132
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:10,496
What? Like scribbling on her face?

1538
02:22:11,613 --> 02:22:13,481
That thought hadn't even crossed my mind.

1724
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,004
You are not really going to do that, are you?

51
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:48,884
Hey.

223
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,137
Hey, Kyon!

2169
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:13,270
Let me know when you're gonna wake up before you wake up.

933
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:16,426
You can't expect a girl to just
get up and be ready like that.

137
02:23:16,610 --> 02:23:17,130
Haruhi.

255
02:23:17,410 --> 02:23:18,160
Yeah, what?

777
02:23:18,350 --> 02:23:19,606
You've got some drool there.

987
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:28,528
I hope you didn't do anything
stupid like scribble on my face.

518
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:30,430
No, but I wanted to.

1896
02:23:31,550 --> 02:23:33,848
Well, is that all you've got to say for yourself?

1856
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:39,137
I guess I made you worry, didn't I? I apologize.

778
02:23:41,035 --> 02:23:43,699
Fine! I accept your apology.

988
02:23:44,306 --> 02:23:49,184
You made me worry but as Brigade
Leader it's my duty to worry.

711
02:24:05,887 --> 02:24:08,309
Miss Asahina, how are you?

569
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:12,760
Oh, stop overreacting.

2106
02:24:13,193 --> 02:24:15,813
He just got a bump on the head and fainted. That's all.

819
02:24:16,021 --> 02:24:18,181
I knew all along he was okay.

1539
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:20,699
There's no way Kyon wasn't gonna wake up.

1725
02:24:20,918 --> 02:24:23,898
The SOS Brigade doesn't take vacations, guys.

1635
02:24:23,930 --> 02:24:26,070
We're in this together till the bitter end.

2218
02:24:26,379 --> 02:24:29,765
If you think getting hit on the head and
not waking up excuses you from your duties,

2219
02:24:29,789 --> 02:24:31,762
you've got another thing coming.

2011
02:24:32,123 --> 02:24:35,348
Abandoning your post for three days is unacceptable.

1726
02:24:35,570 --> 02:24:38,700
I'm talking fines here, fines! Plus back-pay!

1857
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:43,559
That sounds reasonable. Do you have any
suggestions for how I'm gonna pay off this debt?

2107
02:24:48,643 --> 02:24:51,528
For starters, you have to treat all the members to tea.

484
02:24:51,875 --> 02:24:53,085
For three days too.

400
02:24:53,290 --> 02:24:54,250
Okay, then what?

2108
02:24:54,430 --> 02:24:59,153
Then you'll have to come to the Christmas party wearing
the reindeer costume and put on a show for everyone!

1540
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:02,504
And you're gonna have to do it again and
again until everyone thinks it's awesome.

2170
02:25:02,770 --> 02:25:05,780
And if it's boring, I'm sending you to another dimension.

2073
02:25:05,941 --> 02:25:08,715
And you'll have to do it again at the kid's party too.

317
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:10,246
You got that?

2171
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:21,949
I was awake, but they wouldn't let me leave the hospital.

989
02:25:22,410 --> 02:25:23,930
They had to run a bunch of tests

1897
02:25:24,129 --> 02:25:26,606
so I ended up staying over night just to be safe.

1807
02:25:27,090 --> 02:25:31,363
My mom and sis dropped by after the hospital
called, they stayed for a little bit then left.

1977
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:37,653
Now that I was alone, I finally had a chance to
think about all this stuff that had happened to me.

934
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:53,012
What would've happened if I
hadn't chosen to fix the world?

1375
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:58,184
Nagato, Miss Asahina and Koizumi would
all just be normal human beings now.

1858
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:03,520
And Haruhi would just be a slightly
eccentric borderline obnoxious high school girl.

1541
02:26:05,284 --> 02:26:07,444
But I already made my decision, didn't I.

1376
02:26:08,003 --> 02:26:10,348
This world is the one I like the best.

1056
02:26:10,770 --> 02:26:12,430
If I didn't really feel that way,

1193
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:16,168
then what would have been the point
of almost dying trying to save it?

1133
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:26,100
Sorry about this. But I had a good
reason for not stepping in sooner.

1057
02:26:26,822 --> 02:26:29,112
Don't worry. It hurt for me, too.

2012
02:26:29,932 --> 02:26:33,629
We'll take care of everything. Just go to sleep now.

1434
02:26:36,064 --> 02:26:38,274
Yeah, I guess that sounds about, right?

52
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:00,220
Hey.

1636
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:02,184
I hope you weren't looking all over for me.

1542
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:05,778
Not that you have any trouble finding me.

1768
02:27:08,914 --> 02:27:11,514
I am responsible for everything that happened.

935
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:18,426
You understand everything then?

779
02:27:18,856 --> 02:27:20,656
That on December eighteenth,

1859
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:23,270
you remade the world we knew and everyone in it.

570
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:25,110
Everything from April,

1978
02:27:25,262 --> 02:27:28,238
actually farther back than that, up to the present.

318
02:27:29,143 --> 02:27:30,453
I understand.

1495
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:34,957
So then why didn't you tell me about it?

1377
02:27:35,390 --> 02:27:38,613
I mean, you could have said something.
Wouldn't that have been better?

1194
02:27:39,230 --> 02:27:41,973
I don't know. I might have been
able to figure out how to help you.

936
02:27:42,323 --> 02:27:45,493
Even if I did inform you, I
was malfunctioning at the time.

2216
02:27:45,715 --> 02:27:50,191
I would've erased the memories of our
conversations from you and restructured the world

2217
02:27:50,269 --> 02:27:52,051
regardless of your intentions.

937
02:27:52,709 --> 02:27:55,957
And there is no guarantee that
it's not the current situation.

1637
02:27:56,330 --> 02:28:00,817
All I did was preserve the possibility
to return the world to its normal settings.

1543
02:28:01,090 --> 02:28:05,113
Allowing you to meet me on December
eighteen was critical for that to happen.

1860
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:07,900
Don't forget you left me with an escape program.

546
02:28:08,027 --> 02:28:09,629
That was help enough.

138
02:28:13,889 --> 02:28:14,746
Nagato.

319
02:28:19,052 --> 02:28:20,252
I'm so sorry.

92
02:28:26,350 --> 02:28:27,184
Yuki.

613
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:31,280
Means snow, doesn't it?

1727
02:29:12,799 --> 02:29:15,539
Options for my punishment are being examined.

1586
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:18,630
And who's gonna be doing this examination?

1252
02:29:19,398 --> 02:29:21,748
The Data Integration Thought Entity.

1253
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:27,067
The possibility for another
malfunction on my part is uncertain.

1808
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:30,200
As long as I am allowed to exist in this world,

1809
02:29:30,332 --> 02:29:33,106
my internal errors will continue to accumulate.

1309
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:36,106
That would be dangerous for everyone.

1310
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:38,676
Then you can tell them to go to hell!

1378
02:29:42,890 --> 02:29:44,720
You can tell this to your head honcho.

2172
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:48,110
If anything happens to you or if they make you disappear,

1544
02:29:48,833 --> 02:29:51,293
I'll snap, I'll go crazy, you understand?

2109
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:59,543
I'll do whatever it takes to bring you back. I mean it.

990
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:03,040
I might not have any power, but
I can whip Haruhi into a frenzy.

1683
02:30:04,430 --> 02:30:06,988
That's gonna be the trump card in my pocket.

1728
02:30:08,050 --> 02:30:11,535
All I have to do is say "Hi, I'm John Smith."

1545
02:30:12,030 --> 02:30:15,613
Oh, yeah, I know what you are
thinking. I've got the power of a loofah.

1939
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:18,710
But Haruhi's got the power of a stubborn old goat.

669
02:30:19,314 --> 02:30:20,984
And if Nagato disappears,

1311
02:30:21,121 --> 02:30:24,692
I'd reveal the whole kit and caboodle
to Haruhi and make her believe it.

1898
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:28,106
And then we'd go off on a journey to find Nagato.

1729
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:30,336
And Haruhi would do something big to find out

2013
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:33,582
where the Data Integration Thingy had hidden Nagato.

320
02:30:33,820 --> 02:30:34,856
I'd make her.

1940
02:30:35,293 --> 02:30:38,040
And I'd get Miss Asahina and Koizumi involved too.

877
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:41,820
Nagato's our friend, our ally.

1638
02:30:42,220 --> 02:30:46,040
Haruhi would never just stand by and do
nothing if one of her friends went missing.

1058
02:30:46,499 --> 02:30:48,371
That's the kind of person she is.

454
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:50,280
She's egotistical,

1810
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:52,637
she's selfish and be downright pushy sometimes.

1496
02:30:52,903 --> 02:30:55,690
Our annoying, wonderful, Brigade Leader.

1769
02:30:58,850 --> 02:31:03,074
I don't know what kind of high-level
thing this Data Integration Thought Entity is.

1379
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:06,957
And who knows what kind of horrible
power they can unleash on its enemies.

1380
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:11,863
Whatever it is, I bet it's intelligent
enough to know right from wrong.

1435
02:31:12,491 --> 02:31:14,551
If I could talk to it I could find out.

1497
02:31:15,530 --> 02:31:20,113
I'd ask it why it didn't see fit to
give Nagato a more complete personality.

1312
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:25,840
Like Asakura before she turns psycho.

1195
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:29,621
A girl who's popular with everyone
at school, who's bright and social,

938
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:32,449
the kind of girl goes to the
malls with friends on weekends.

2074
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:35,160
It could have made her someone like that, couldn't it?

991
02:31:36,670 --> 02:31:39,800
Why the heck would it make
her some lonely melancholic girl

2014
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,567
who just sits by herself reading books all day long?

1059
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:47,168
What? Because she wouldn't
seem like the literary club type?

1498
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:49,840
Because she wouldn't catch Haruhi's eye?

712
02:31:50,206 --> 02:31:51,840
How prejudice can you get?

2075
02:31:56,900 --> 02:32:01,363
If it won't listen to me, then I promise, I'll
change the world again, and this time I'll use Haruhi.

640
02:32:01,730 --> 02:32:03,170
It'd know she can do it.

1770
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:07,790
I'll make this world a place where you're here
and the Data Integration Thought Entity isn't.

1639
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:13,160
Even if we have to flip the universe over
on its side, I promise, we'll get you back!

1640
02:32:13,980 --> 02:32:16,320
You can go and tell that to your superiors.

321
02:32:21,325 --> 02:32:22,464
Transmitting.

224
02:32:35,890 --> 02:32:36,887
Thank you.

1499
02:32:56,709 --> 02:32:59,582
Come on, Kyon. It's morning, so wake up.

165
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:02,371
Wake up!

2173
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:06,004
A couple of days later I returned home from the hospital.

1254
02:33:06,309 --> 02:33:10,090
Today is December the twenty-fourth.
The last day of semester.

1730
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:20,070
Kouyouen Academy is back to being a private
all-girls' prep school it's supposed to be...

1587
02:33:20,416 --> 02:33:22,879
Taniguchi never caught that horrible cold.

2174
02:33:23,606 --> 02:33:27,160
And Miss Asahina and Miss Tsuruya recognized me on sight.

1436
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:30,918
The world is back to normal. Thank God.

1313
02:33:34,572 --> 02:33:38,129
However, another critical
decision has been placed in my hands.

1255
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:43,059
If me, Nagato and Miss Asahina don't
go back to the past one more time,

713
02:33:43,204 --> 02:33:44,699
the world won't get fixed.

939
02:33:45,470 --> 02:33:48,410
We haven't decided when that's
supposed to happen yet, though.

1811
02:33:48,944 --> 02:33:51,374
But whether it's now or later on down the road,

1437
02:33:51,567 --> 02:33:53,473
we'll take care of it once and for all.

780
02:33:56,140 --> 02:33:57,980
No more looking back for me.

1588
02:33:58,005 --> 02:34:00,590
I had to make a choice, that's what I did.

1196
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:05,949
And not in some unconscious fit
of happy insanity like Haruhi does.

93
02:34:06,629 --> 02:34:07,370
Nope.

1641
02:34:07,550 --> 02:34:11,973
I chose this world and all the crazy
weirdness that comes with it all by myself.

1771
02:34:18,513 --> 02:34:21,133
It's the decision I have to live with forever.

547
02:34:23,751 --> 02:34:25,291
Man, I'm so pathetic.

1684
02:34:26,670 --> 02:34:29,410
Now I've gone and become a responsible type.

1256
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:34,871
The days when I thought it was
cool to just sit and watch are over.

1197
02:34:35,270 --> 02:34:38,580
And just like the other subordinate
members of the SOS Brigade,

1438
02:34:38,730 --> 02:34:41,450
I am an active protector of this world.

1439
02:34:42,850 --> 02:34:47,082
Right now Haruhi's having her Christmas
Party, and serving up a hotpot cooking.

1381
02:34:47,530 --> 02:34:51,488
By the way, her and Miss Asahina did
the last of the shopping and what not.

1685
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:54,140
I know I'm usually the official bag carrier,

1314
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:58,150
but I was given a special exemption
this time while I got to bed at home.

1440
02:34:59,790 --> 02:35:03,910
Haruhi being Haruhi is probably
planning some kind of switcheroo on us.

2215
02:35:04,660 --> 02:35:10,332
I wouldn't doubt if she change the menu at the last minute
so that everyone will be all "WOW" when she opens the lid.

1441
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:14,750
I wonder what she is going to do today.

2220
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:17,984
Being Haruhi, she'd go overboard and surprise us

2221
02:35:18,035 --> 02:35:21,637
by roll out some funky dish that's never
been attempted in the history of cooking.

1642
02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:24,137
This hotpot could be a threat to humankind.

401
02:35:30,001 --> 02:35:31,291
Whatever, right?

1643
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:38,059
A sweet fragrance wafts from the club room.

1500
02:35:38,629 --> 02:35:40,400
I guess they've already started cooking.

1686
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:43,800
It's weird, but I feel sort of satisfaction.

1060
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:46,990
I'm sure though that there'd
be more trouble before I know it.

1442
02:35:47,662 --> 02:35:51,172
I still have to return to the past and
help change the world back to this one.

781
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:55,540
Well, I still got some time.

878
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:58,646
I'm not saying I've got a lot,

820
02:35:58,670 --> 02:36:01,270
but I know I don't have to go
back there right now, either.

2140
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:06,481
You got that, world? You're okay for a bit there, right?

1899
02:36:06,996 --> 02:36:11,340
You don't mind if I take a little break
before going back in time and fixing you, do you?

188
02:36:12,010 --> 02:36:13,129
Oh, well.

1382
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:19,559
At least, wait until after I have
some of Haruhi's hotpot cooking, okay?

275
02:41:13,063 --> 02:41:14,083
There. Done.

225
02:41:14,220 --> 02:41:15,340
Thank you.

94
02:41:19,970 --> 02:41:20,690
Here.

53
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:21,540
Wow.

166
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:24,110
Come on!

95
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:24,960
Okay.
