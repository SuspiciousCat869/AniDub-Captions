1
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,082
Uh, it's a girl, watch out!

2
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,069
Whoa!

3
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:13,602
No!

4
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:16,908
Element, lightning, descend!

5
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,362
Oh, thanks a lot, Lee.

6
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,284
Don't take your eyes off it.

7
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:29,221
Sekura, now!

8
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:30,193
Right.

9
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:41,114
Windy card, come to my aid and stop Elle.

10
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:43,606
Windy!

11
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:54,419
Stop!

12
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:06,122
Return to your power, confine!

13
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:08,702
Arrow card, go!

14
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:36,681
Lee deserves that Clow card much more than she does.

15
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,370
Wow, looks like you've got a fan club.

16
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:43,282
Wow, great job, Sekura.

17
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,315
The arrow card really had it in for ya.

18
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:49,249
Ha, do I know how to pick a card captor or what?

19
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,409
Hmm.

20
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:20,984
Pie and cupcakes.

21
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,278
Wh, where am I?

22
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:18,578
Huh?

23
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:49,394
I'm underwater, but how can I breath?

24
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:59,506
Water is ever flowing, ever flowing...

25
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,857
What a weird dream.

26
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:48,412
Jeffrey?

27
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:49,378
Here.

28
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:51,745
Kimberly?

29
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,389
Here.

30
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,178
You've done much better this term, Kim.

31
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,405
Uh, Harrison.

32
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:58,145
Here.

33
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,106
Let's try a little harder next semester, okay?

34
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:03,633
Allie?

35
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:04,367
Here.

36
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,279
So, how'd you do?

37
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:07,726
I got a C!

38
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:10,433
I thought I was going to flunk music for sure.

39
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,951
You weren't that bad.

40
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:13,253
Madison?

41
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:14,431
Coming.

42
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,615
Well done, Madison.

43
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,441
Thanks.

44
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,374
So, you're nervous too, huh?

45
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:27,553
Me? As if.

46
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:30,059
Spring break, he has to show his mom.

47
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:33,429
You'd be nervous too if you met her.

48
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,435
Clam up.

49
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:37,026
Hey Madison, how'd it go?

50
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:38,582
The same as last semester.

51
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,309
That must mean straight A's again, right?

52
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,141
Lee Shoron.

53
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,656
And Maylin Ray.

54
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:47,943
Here.

55
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:58,888
Oh boy, Lee looks like he's gonna be sick.

56
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:02,425
So, are you going to go anywhere for spring break?

57
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,499
What is this?

58
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:07,440
Why didn't I get straight A's?

59
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:11,627
You just need to spend a little bit
more time studying for your tests, Maylin.

60
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:13,642
I'm sure you'll do better next term.

61
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,699
One B-, I can show her this.

62
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:33,908
Huh?

63
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,943
No homework for a whole week.

64
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,706
Yeah, spring break's the best.

65
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,673
Want to look inside?

66
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,418
Sure.

67
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:48,812
Hmm, I can't decide which one.

68
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,790
I see you've finally made up your mind.

69
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:57,246
This one was my favorite too.

70
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:58,414
Thanks.

71
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,161
Oh, I almost forgot.

72
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,645
You get to draw one.

73
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:08,879
The Readington Shopping District
is having a big contest right now.

74
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,449
Everyone who buys something gets to draw one.

75
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,458
Cool, good luck Sekura.

76
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:21,048
And the grand prize is a trip for four to Hong Kong.

77
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,030
So far, everyone's gotten the consolation prize.

78
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:42,231
So, what color is it?

79
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:45,698
Hey, look, it's a gold one,

80
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:48,377
probably just the consolation prize.

81
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:50,077
Ah.

82
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:53,888
Gold is the,

83
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:56,135
grand...

84
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:57,921
Grand?

85
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,581
Grand?

86
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:05,419
Look!

87
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,216
The grand prize!?

88
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:10,766
That's amazing, Sekura, a trip over seas.

89
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:13,883
And just in time for spring break.

90
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:15,332
Yeah, I know.

91
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:18,219
I've never even been on a plane before.

92
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,202
I haven't seen Hong Kong in ages.

93
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,110
Kiro, you've been to Hong Kong?

94
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,501
Oh yeah, I used to live there.

95
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:29,669
While Clow Reed was still around.

96
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:36,243
So, that must mean the Clow
cards have been to Hong Kong too.

97
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,699
Oh, they haven't just been there,

98
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:41,234
that's where they were created, Sekura.

99
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:46,619
I wonder what Hong Kong's like?

100
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,116
Just stick with me.

101
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:50,629
I'll take you to all the best spots in town.

102
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,423
But, wait a sec,

103
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:57,602
Hey, what is it?

104
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:02,041
Didn't you tell me your father was
going away on a business trip this week?

105
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,250
Oh, I forgot.

106
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,482
You should go.

107
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,096
Are you sure?

108
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:12,548
Absolutely.

109
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:16,635
I just wish I could go with you.
I've never been to Hong Kong before,

110
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:18,958
but I think it will be okay if Tori takes you.

111
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:19,443
Huh?

112
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,713
But Tori, what about,

113
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,973
what about your part-time job?

114
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,941
I'd miss five shifts, but I'll do it.

115
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:32,836
Huh?

116
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,416
You're the best!

117
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,016
And Madison makes three.

118
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:38,349
Tori, why don't you take Julian along too?

119
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,641
Sure, I think he can make it.

120
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,349
As far as I know, I don't think he has anything planned.

121
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,145
Yeah.

122
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:03,300
I wonder if that one over there is our plane.

123
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,414
Huh?

124
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:06,382
Okay Sekura, act natural.

125
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:08,930
You, you brought your video camera?

126
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,348
Of course, I'm going to videotape everything

127
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:16,046
and then edit it into a video
scrapbook with my mom's new software.

128
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:22,006
I think I'll call it Madison
and Sekura's first world tour.

129
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,381
Maybe we can use it for our independent study project.

130
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,503
Sekura, come on.

131
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:29,585
It's time to board.

132
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,677
Okay.

133
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:40,526
Sekura, don't forget, you can't wear shoes on the plane.

134
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,408
Really? You can't?

135
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,412
Miss, you may leave your shoes on if you wish.

136
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:52,844
Huh?

137
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:57,554
Tori!

138
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,886
That was so not funny.

139
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:04,959
Fresh air.

140
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,577
Kiro, would you get back in the,

141
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:09,564
uh,

142
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,339
Kiro, just stay hidden a little longer.

143
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:16,471
But it's hot.

144
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:18,319
Hey Sekura.

145
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:19,774
Julian.

146
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:23,040
So are you ready for our big trip?

147
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,103
This'll be my first time in Hong Kong too.

148
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:29,156
Oh, and by the way, thanks for inviting me.

149
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:31,766
Sure.

150
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,487
You ladies have a nice day.

151
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,214
Wow.

152
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,959
This room's huge!

153
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,339
Sekura.

154
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:58,138
Kiro!

155
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:03,658
How could you forget that I was stuck in there?

157
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:06,493
This is not funny!

158
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:11,415
But since you did bring me back to Hong Kong,

159
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,327
I'll forgive you.

160
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,821
For now anyway.

161
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:20,306
Has it changed much, Kiro?

162
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,452
Has it changed?

163
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,732
What an amazing view!

164
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,301
Has it ever changed!

165
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:30,719
Whoa, man!

166
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:44,184
Hong Kong Island is so close to our hotel.

167
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:47,799
Yeah, it says right here, it
only takes five minutes by ferry.

168
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:53,813
Hey, if you keep leaning over
like that, the sharks will get ya.

169
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:55,337
Huh?

170
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,021
They have sharks here?

171
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,796
Yep, the guidebook says so.

172
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:00,302
Oh.

173
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,502
Huh?

174
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,594
A shark?

175
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:12,660
Ah, it's so beautiful.

176
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,091
How much farther is it?

177
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:16,766
Don't worry, we'll be docking soon.

178
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:23,032
I've just never been to such a big city before.

179
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:24,902
Neither have I.

180
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,034
This is going to be the best vacation.

181
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:30,477
Film me later, okay?

182
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:31,744
Okay.

183
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:49,722
Wow, things really changed.

184
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:52,615
It's been a long time since you've been here, Kiro.

185
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:54,608
I'll bet hundreds of years.

186
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:56,521
But it,

187
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,362
it still feels the same.

188
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:03,303
I can still sense powerful forces,

189
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,212
the traces of ancient magic.

190
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,882
They're as strong as ever.

191
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:08,666
Not to mention that,

192
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:13,967
all the food is still great.

193
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,135
Oh Kiro.

194
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:23,200
What is it?

195
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:28,165
I was just thinking how Sekura's never been very lucky.

196
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:29,712
What'd you say?

197
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,466
Oh, hear me out.

198
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:37,087
I remember Clow Reed used to
say that nothing is accidental.

199
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:40,779
Well maybe Sekura was supposed to
win the grand prize for a reason.

200
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,041
You never know. Stranger things have happened,

201
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:47,047
especially in Hong Kong.

202
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,553
Oh come on, Kiro.

203
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:11,231
This dream again.

204
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,118
Who are you?

205
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,522
The dream again.

206
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:47,159
It, it was just so strange.

207
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,265
And we'd like four of these, oh, four of that,

208
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,637
oh, a bunch of these and four of this one too.

209
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:58,590
Is that all, sir?

210
00:17:58,615 --> 00:17:59,584
We'll let you know.

211
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,477
Okay, dig in!

212
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:04,938
Okay.

213
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,402
Madison, would you like to share one with me?

214
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,375
Sure.

215
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,118
Kiro!

216
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:15,782
Kiro?

217
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,104
I think I'll try something else.

218
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:19,682
Yeah.

219
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:22,059
Okay, what was wrong with that one?

220
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:24,304
No, nothing.

221
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,062
I just changed my mind.

222
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,259
Well, let me see it then.

223
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:33,745
Huh, but there's so many to try.

224
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,847
You don't want this one.

225
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:37,428
Pass it over.

226
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:40,005
But.

227
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:43,408
Pass it over now!

228
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,090
Well, speed it up, squirt.

229
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:05,987
Right.

230
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:12,432
Changed my mind, we'll eat it.

231
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,046
Doesn't it look delicious, Madison?

232
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:16,980
Mm, it sure does.

233
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,887
Fine, whatever.

234
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,395
Okay, okay.

235
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:26,716
After lunch, what do you say we go check out Bird Street?

236
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,556
Did you say Bird street?

237
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:31,679
Yeah, it's a street packed with birds.

238
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,158
I've never seen so many birds in one place.

239
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,368
They're the most popular pet in Hong Kong.

240
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,110
Look at all the different kinds.

241
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:48,385
I'll bet some of them can learn to talk too.

242
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,625
That's so cool.

243
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:52,632
Wow.

244
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:54,656
Ah, Bird Street.

245
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,294
You've been here?

246
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,833
Mmhmm, and it hasn't changed a bit.

247
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,199
Huh?

248
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:03,903
Hello.

249
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:24,914
What's wrong?

250
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:29,130
It feels like we're being watched.

251
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,931
There's something strange around here.

252
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:45,272
Kiro, there can't be a Clow card here, can there?

253
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:47,643
No, this is different.

254
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:52,268
This feels more evil.

255
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:55,438
Hey, look at those ones.

256
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:57,691
Hm, they must have escaped.

257
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,038
Those birds!

258
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:10,985
Sekura!

259
00:21:11,658 --> 00:21:13,307
We've got to follow her.

260
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:14,293
Okay.

261
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:16,393
All right, where's she running off to?

262
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:17,048
Hurry up.

263
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:19,491
We'll be right back.

264
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:22,364
Huh?

265
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,298
Release.

266
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:46,540
Stop!

267
00:21:58,887 --> 00:21:59,493
There!

268
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:19,931
I'm sensing something.

269
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:31,844
Huh?

270
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:00,837
Wake up!

271
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:02,116
Huh?

272
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,851
It's you.

273
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:16,997
What are you doing here?

274
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:21,238
Whoa!

275
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:36,215
Uh, Kiro, where do you think she could have run off to?

276
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:43,975
I'm sorry, hey, are you okay?

277
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:48,745
Yeah, I'm fine.

278
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:50,402
Wait a,

279
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,914
Hey Maylin.

280
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:54,882
Madison Taylor?

281
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,932
What in the world are you doing here?

282
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,300
Sekura won a trip in a raffle.

283
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,672
Yo, little girl.

284
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:08,654
I see you brought the stuffed toy.

285
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,279
Hey!

286
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,609
They let you through customs?

287
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,036
All right, that's it!

288
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:17,936
Oh, come on, let me outta here.

289
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:21,124
Hey Madison, have you seen Lee around?

290
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:25,482
He said there was a strange aura
and then he took off somewhere.

291
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:28,873
Well, I've been looking all over for Sekura too.

292
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:29,980
Huh?

293
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:31,812
Sekura!

294
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:35,301
Lee!

295
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:38,102
Hey Madison.

296
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:39,540
Are you okay?

297
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:42,284
Where did you go? I was so worried about you.

298
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:43,906
Oh, I'm fine.

299
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:45,839
But you're soaking wet.

300
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,829
You had me so scared.

301
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:49,269
Sekura!

302
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:52,630
Oh.

303
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,097
I told you to stay close.

304
00:25:57,564 --> 00:25:58,624
I'm sorry.

305
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,084
I saw,

306
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:03,929
I didn't mean to worry you, really.

307
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:07,845
Kids.

308
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,786
Why in the world did you take off on me like that?

309
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:14,176
Hey, what's up guys?

310
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,869
Hello, how you doing, Julian?

311
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:17,031
Well hello there.

312
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:24,130
We need to get you into some dry clothes.

313
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,240
Mmhmm.

314
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:00,341
I'm kind of glad you got soaked back there.

315
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,634
These outfits are so cute.

316
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:06,047
You should let me take you.

317
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,459
You look great.

318
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:10,594
Blue is my favorite color.

319
00:27:20,435 --> 00:27:21,655
So sweet.

320
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:24,602
Oh, I think it's adorable.

321
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,802
So cute.

322
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,291
So irresistible.

323
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:35,109
Who are they?

324
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:36,859
No clue.

325
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:40,309
Who knew that Lee kid was so rich?

326
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:41,654
This house is incredible.

327
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,672
Well, speaking of cute.

328
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:45,052
Hello.

329
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,441
Hey boys.

330
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:48,222
Hey girls.

331
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,169
Hey boys.

332
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:51,346
Hey girls.

333
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:53,757
I hope we get to eat, don't you?

334
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:55,323
Hm?

335
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,159
Who are they?

336
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,176
So who are all those girls, Lee?

337
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:10,753
They're Lee's sisters.

338
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:11,823
All of them?

339
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:14,977
Yeah.

340
00:28:15,064 --> 00:28:15,985
Wow.

341
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,930
I like this one.

342
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:20,934
They're really energetic.

343
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:23,857
Hey, don't you mean really weird?

344
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,717
Kiro.

345
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,998
Oh, I'm sorry, Lee.

346
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:47,007
She's so beautiful.

347
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,882
Hello mother.

348
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,389
Pleased to meet you.

349
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:52,820
How do you do?

350
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:54,599
That's Lee's mother?

351
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,441
But she looks so young.

352
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:01,330
Mm hm.

353
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:04,702
Boy, she looks pretty spooky to me.

354
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:06,069
Kiro!

355
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:08,677
I'm okay.

356
00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:12,540
He's standing so still.

357
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

358
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,946
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

359
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:22,648
I'm Sekura Avalon.

360
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:25,372
Thank you for the beautiful clothes and I'm really...

361
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,436
I can sense great power.

362
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,344
You possess the Clow cards.

363
00:29:47,942 --> 00:29:50,106
When one has great powers,

364
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:53,203
it will at times attract grave danger,

365
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,718
but you must know that already.

366
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,522
I insist, you must stay here tonight.

367
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:06,529
What?

368
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,378
Lee.

369
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,991
I want you to show me your report card.

370
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,241
Ah, what a day.

371
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:40,820
I can't believe how pretty Lee's mom is.

372
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:42,080
Yeah.

373
00:30:42,286 --> 00:30:43,592
She's beautiful,

374
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:47,406
but there's something mysterious about her.

375
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:49,365
I thought so too.

376
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:53,382
She holds a great deal of power, more than Lee.

377
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:57,620
I'm not surprised that Lee's mother
could sense me in the Clow cards.

378
00:30:57,846 --> 00:31:02,563
Remember, everyone in their family
is a direct descendant of Clow Reed.

379
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:06,903
Was Clow Reed the most powerful
sorcerer in all of Hong Kong?

380
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:09,427
Yeah, probably in all of Asia.

381
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:14,108
But word is he certainly wasn't
the most popular man around.

382
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:18,749
When you have that much influence,
you're bound to make enemies along the way.

383
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:29,188
Did what his mom say about power
attracting danger freak you out?

384
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:33,593
I'm sure everything is gonna be just fine.

385
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:34,865
Yeah.

386
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:38,794
Tomorrow, we'll go downtown and go shopping.

387
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:43,519
And eat more Chinese food.

388
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:47,985
Goodnight Madison.

389
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:49,571
Night Sekura.

390
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:13,562
When one has great powers, it
will at times, attract grave danger.

391
00:32:36,717 --> 00:32:38,252
The dream again.

392
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,697
Who are you?

393
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:58,803
Answer me!

394
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:21,350
At last, you have finally come back for me.

395
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:24,438
Huh?

396
00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:29,288
I've been waiting all this time.

397
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:36,017
I've been waiting all this time,

398
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,518
waiting for you, for you to return!

399
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:01,573
You've finally come to set me free.

400
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,286
Sekura, what's wrong?

401
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,598
Sekura!

402
00:34:26,251 --> 00:34:27,688
Are you okay?

403
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:31,581
That dream.

404
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:40,321
That's no ordinary dream.

405
00:34:45,558 --> 00:34:46,964
Come in.

406
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:11,172
I call on the power of the celestial spirits divine,

407
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:15,492
water, wood, metal, wind, and earth,

408
00:35:15,753 --> 00:35:18,996
power of the thunder and lightning abound,

409
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,813
I command thee.

410
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:28,073
Gather and grant me knowledge, release your light.

411
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:45,957
The spirits tell me you have
been summoned here to Hong Kong.

412
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:48,974
Summoned by whom?

413
00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:57,725
By the woman in your dreams.

414
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:01,491
Be careful.

415
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:05,894
There are many powerful spirits at work here.

416
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,463
But what should I do?

417
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:14,691
It is you and you alone that
knows the path that you must follow.

418
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:20,660
With the magic of the Clow
cards comes great responsibility

419
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,791
and even greater risk.

420
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:28,156
The evil that seeks you now is very powerful.

421
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:36,706
But so are the spirits that will guide you.

422
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:44,038
This evil lures you only in your dreams.

423
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:47,425
Your dreams are where you will find the answer.

424
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:02,933
Sekura, you will find your way.

425
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,448
I know you will.

426
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,038
Don't worry.

427
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:20,449
You will know what to do when the time comes.

428
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:35,642
It was so nice to meet you.

429
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,575
Bye.

430
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,637
Bye.

431
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:41,380
Come back soon.

432
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:44,052
You really slept over last night?

433
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:45,111
Yep.

434
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:45,997
Hm.

435
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,818
Well, I shoulda slept over too.

436
00:37:56,558 --> 00:37:59,157
Thank you so much for everything.

437
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,136
Beware of water.

438
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:15,701
Hey, come on, let's get going.

439
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:16,803
Oh.

440
00:38:16,942 --> 00:38:18,312
Coming.

441
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:23,262
Please take care, Sakura.

442
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:25,645
Okay.

443
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:33,487
The one in the back that looks
like a knife is the Bank of China.

444
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:37,431
And the one with the canon on the
roof is the Hong Kong Shang Hai Bank.

445
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,105
This area is Hong Kong's financial district.

446
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:43,249
Those banks are fierce competitors.

447
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,309
Hmm.

448
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:48,289
Hey, who knew the little girl could be such a tour guide?

449
00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:50,187
And when are we gonna eat lunch?

450
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:55,567
I can't even think about food now.

451
00:38:55,794 --> 00:39:00,956
I can't stop thinking about that woman
in my dreams and what she wants from me.

452
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,121
Was Lee's mother right?

453
00:39:03,648 --> 00:39:06,865
Does this woman have something to do with the Clow cards?

454
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:10,929
My dreams will be where I find the answer.

455
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:14,001
Maybe Kiro was right.

456
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,461
I was destined to win this trip.

457
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:24,262
Why do we have to follow them around all day?

458
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:25,815
I don't have a choice.

459
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,218
Mother told us to.

460
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,778
What, to be their personal tour guides?

461
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:31,813
Well no.

462
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:33,225
Yeah, then what?

463
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:38,263
She sensed that Sakura might be in some kind of danger.

464
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:43,706
A barret.

465
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:45,409
Ah.

466
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:53,532
Hey, the woman in my dreams
had a barret just like this one.

467
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:59,386
This is getting weird.

468
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,152
It's pretty.

469
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:03,980
Yeah.

470
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,799
I'll take this one.

471
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:16,978
What? No, I, Julian, wait!

472
00:40:17,003 --> 00:40:17,582
Uh.

473
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,757
Really, you don't have to.

474
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:21,164
Here.

475
00:40:23,978 --> 00:40:25,625
It really suits you.

476
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:31,479
Oh thank you, Julian.

477
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:36,520
What's wrong?

478
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:38,965
Nothing.

479
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:40,439
Huh?

480
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,584
Sekura?

481
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,129
Oh, not again.

482
00:40:57,485 --> 00:40:58,532
That's it.

483
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:13,608
Huh?

484
00:41:14,378 --> 00:41:15,548
That little.

485
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:22,301
Kiro, you can come out now.

486
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:27,575
There's an evil presence and it's growing even stronger.

487
00:41:27,645 --> 00:41:28,478
Come on.

488
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:37,336
Hey, are those the birds that were in your dream?

489
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,230
Yeah.

490
00:41:38,283 --> 00:41:39,118
Uh oh.

491
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:40,940
They're not ordinary birds.

492
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:45,101
They're spirits and I don't mean the good kind either.

493
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:48,418
Huh?

494
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,156
Should we follow them?

495
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:02,823
You bet.

496
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:39,682
Looks like no one's around.

497
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:41,169
Mmhmm.

498
00:42:43,498 --> 00:42:44,408
What is it?

499
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:47,110
Do you hear water?

500
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:55,882
Oh yeah.

501
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:13,134
It's coming from the book.

502
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,944
That woman.

503
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,163
Huh?

504
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:44,381
No!

505
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,320
What are you, oh?

506
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,594
Come inside.

507
00:44:00,502 --> 00:44:02,678
Sekura, wake up, hurry up.

508
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:05,992
Come inside.

509
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:14,085
Come back to me.

510
00:44:20,568 --> 00:44:21,607
No choice.

511
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:24,234
Sekura!

512
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:24,967
Oh!

513
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:28,397
Hey, we've been looking everywhere for you.

514
00:44:30,985 --> 00:44:32,006
I sense it.

515
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:36,562
Sekura?

516
00:44:53,054 --> 00:44:55,649
Sekura, what's happening?

517
00:45:01,857 --> 00:45:04,135
What's going on here?

518
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,556
Are you okay?

519
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:47,918
Kiro?

520
00:45:47,944 --> 00:45:50,357
You're starting to look like yourself again.

521
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,663
Are we in the dream?

522
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:56,048
This is not a dream.

523
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:12,880
You created this world with your magic.

524
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:17,980
What is this? Who are you two?

525
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,370
She's the woman on the book!

526
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,178
You're just a little girl.

527
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:23,858
How did you get here?

528
00:46:33,438 --> 00:46:34,599
Answer me.

529
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:40,127
Answer me!

530
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:41,444
Sekura!

531
00:46:41,628 --> 00:46:42,377
Right.

532
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,180
Fly!

533
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:47,687
A Clow card?

534
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:52,510
Tell me, where did you get a Clow card?

535
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:08,647
Kiro, she seems to know about the Clow cards.

536
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,513
Uh Sekura, watch out!

537
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,816
Freeze.

538
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,190
Another Clow card.

539
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:36,054
Lee!

540
00:47:38,221 --> 00:47:40,199
You have Clow cards too.

541
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,672
How'd you get here?

542
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:46,033
I was underwater, then suddenly, I'm here.

543
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,080
What happened to everyone else?

544
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:49,612
They were right behind me.

545
00:47:50,023 --> 00:47:52,326
We've got to find them now.

546
00:47:53,878 --> 00:47:55,935
There's no need to look.

547
00:47:56,919 --> 00:48:00,561
The ones who came with you are over there.

548
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:20,476
Tell me, where is Clow Reed?

549
00:48:20,694 --> 00:48:22,108
I am waiting.

550
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:26,706
I know I've seen her before.

551
00:48:27,561 --> 00:48:29,492
Where is Clow Reed?

552
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:32,473
Let's split up now.

553
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:34,967
I'll go and try to distract her

554
00:48:35,252 --> 00:48:38,272
and you go and help out the others, okay Sekura?

555
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:42,568
Where is Clow Reed?

556
00:48:45,786 --> 00:48:46,672
Go!

557
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:55,287
Storm!

558
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:11,238
Sword!

559
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,333
Fly!

560
00:49:29,478 --> 00:49:30,570
Let's go.

561
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,910
Maylin, Tori,

562
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:41,928
Julian.

563
00:49:44,405 --> 00:49:47,027
I'll be back, I promise.

564
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,442
Sekura, hurry.

565
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,199
Ug, it's not working.

566
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:12,740
Madison, you're okay.

567
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,860
All right.

568
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,666
Where, where are we?

569
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:22,739
We'll explain it all later.

570
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:26,652
Huh?

571
00:50:40,226 --> 00:50:43,100
It is unforgivable.

572
00:50:44,023 --> 00:50:47,063
It is unforgivable.

573
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:50,655
Unforgivable!

574
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,504
Kiro, stay here.

575
00:50:57,529 --> 00:50:58,132
Sekura!

576
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:58,957
Sekura!

577
00:51:03,175 --> 00:51:06,614
Lee, Lee, where are you?

578
00:51:06,912 --> 00:51:08,281
Answer me!

579
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:13,262
Fly away, now.

580
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:18,194
Quick, get out.

581
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:28,813
Listen, you guys have to escape, now.

582
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:29,252
But.

583
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,957
Her powers are weaker above.

584
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,305
You should be able to escape if you fly up.

585
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:38,385
Silence!

586
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:41,280
Wait, no!

587
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,283
If Clow Reed won't set me free,

588
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,988
then I will use all of your powers to escape

589
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,245
and then I will finally have my revenge.

590
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:12,446
Sekura, come on, let's get out of here.

591
00:52:14,825 --> 00:52:15,658
Hurry.

592
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:19,491
If we don't go now, we'll all be caught.

593
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,211
Sekura.

594
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:45,199
You will not escape!

595
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:54,905
There's the way out!

596
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:38,065
Sekura?

597
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,348
I guess it was all my fault.

598
00:53:42,373 --> 00:53:44,076
Come on, don't say that.

599
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:46,867
It wasn't you. It was the woman on the book.

600
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:48,475
Book.

601
00:53:49,597 --> 00:53:50,187
The book.

602
00:53:50,212 --> 00:53:51,897
Speaking of which.

603
00:53:54,395 --> 00:53:55,470
What book?

604
00:53:55,495 --> 00:53:59,297
A magical book that acts as a
gateway to a different dimension.

605
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:01,538
The dimension we were just in.

606
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:05,082
So, if we find the book, we can save everyone.

607
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,177
What kind of book was it?

608
00:54:07,397 --> 00:54:11,996
It was an old book with a strange aura.

609
00:54:13,246 --> 00:54:13,866
Huh?

610
00:54:14,205 --> 00:54:16,290
The aura has disappeared.

611
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:17,712
It's not here.

612
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,982
It's gone.

613
00:54:22,456 --> 00:54:23,544
Sekura.

614
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:26,862
Lee,

615
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:28,809
Maylin,

616
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:30,844
Tori,

617
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:34,716
and Julian.

618
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:37,470
Don't lose hope.

619
00:54:37,597 --> 00:54:40,625
We'll find a way back in there and save them.

620
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:46,519
That woman, I remember her now.

621
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:50,171
Is someone down there?

622
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:51,946
I will be right away to you.

623
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:53,802
Someone's coming.

624
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:55,585
Let's get outta here.

625
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,458
Yeah.

626
00:54:57,485 --> 00:54:59,153
How can I help you?

627
00:55:02,419 --> 00:55:03,152
Hmm?

628
00:55:05,127 --> 00:55:07,068
Her name was Soo Yung.

629
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,053
She used to read people's
fortunes on the surface of water.

630
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,441
A fortune teller?

631
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:17,061
Yeah, Clow Reed never spoke about
it, but the story was that one day,

632
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:21,711
Soo Yung bumped into him on the street and
they fell in love with each other that very moment.

633
00:55:22,682 --> 00:55:23,426
Go on.

634
00:55:23,451 --> 00:55:24,555
At the time,

635
00:55:25,837 --> 00:55:29,227
Clow Reed's magic was growing increasingly powerful.

636
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:34,302
As he and Soo Yung grew closer,
he taught her how to use magic,

637
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,999
but she began to use her magic for evil instead of good.

638
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:43,146
Clow Reed was the only one powerful enough
to stop her and as she plotted to destroy him,

639
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:47,621
he learned of her plans and created
another dimension in which to imprison her.

640
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:50,507
But that was so long ago.

641
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,415
Shouldn't she be dead by now?

642
00:55:53,488 --> 00:55:54,820
She is. It's her spirit.

643
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:55,852
Her spirit?

644
00:55:56,245 --> 00:56:00,197
Her world is a different kind of
dimension than the one that we live in.

645
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:04,393
Somehow, when she died, her spirit
must have become trapped inside.

646
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,106
She may not even realize she's dead.

647
00:56:07,753 --> 00:56:11,172
It's a very complicated spell, Sekura.

648
00:56:11,665 --> 00:56:17,070
Clow Reed must have known that she could have
escaped from a mortal prison using her magic.

649
00:56:17,177 --> 00:56:20,149
So where does the book fit in to this whole thing?

650
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:24,148
Simple, she needed to lure him
into the dimension to escape.

651
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:27,328
Maybe that explains why you were drawn to its aura.

652
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:29,101
You had the Clow cards.

653
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:30,254
If that's true,

654
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:34,784
I should be able to get back into that dimension
again, but how can I do it without the book?

655
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:40,776
Hm. Hard to say. There is usually more
than one doorway into dimensions like that.

656
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:45,601
But the energy has already disappeared
from the shop we were in today.

657
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:49,022
And the book isn't around anymore either.

658
00:56:52,852 --> 00:56:53,670
Book.

659
00:56:57,515 --> 00:57:00,881
Kiro, I know the place on the cover of that book!

660
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:02,288
What?

661
00:57:04,885 --> 00:57:07,435
It's the place where the woman was sitting.

662
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,255
It's the well!

663
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:22,063
Hey, what?

664
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:23,554
Did you figure something out?

665
00:57:23,676 --> 00:57:26,208
Yeah, I know where the entrance is.

666
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:28,166
I was just there yesterday.

667
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:31,237
Hey, way to go. Now we can go find the others.

668
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,123
Yeah.

669
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,522
All right!

670
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:36,099
Now that's why I made you the card captor.

671
00:57:36,124 --> 00:57:36,932
Mmhmm.

672
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:39,547
And I've got the perfect battle costume.

673
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:56,461
So, this is it?

674
00:57:57,087 --> 00:57:57,998
Yeah.

675
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:02,057
Hm, there's a really strong energy coming from it.

676
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,122
Sekura, don't!

677
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:21,754
What is that?

678
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:23,154
It's the force field.

679
00:58:23,179 --> 00:58:24,280
Force field?

680
00:58:24,305 --> 00:58:28,292
A powerful spiritual boundary
has been created around this well.

681
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:30,402
But what can we do?

682
00:58:30,861 --> 00:58:31,923
Not much.

683
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:36,610
Clow Reed created this barrier and he
has much stronger magical powers than we do.

684
00:58:36,635 --> 00:58:37,562
But how do we...

685
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:40,267
Huh?

686
00:58:41,107 --> 00:58:42,600
What is it, Kiro?

687
00:58:42,628 --> 00:58:43,875
Somebody's coming.

688
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,920
Quick, in here.

689
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,669
Huh?

690
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:05,335
What's Lee's mom doing here?

691
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,496
Stand back.

692
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:15,704
But we already tried that.

693
00:59:17,515 --> 00:59:20,005
Lee's presence has disappeared.

694
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:22,326
I know.

695
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:23,640
It's my fault.

696
00:59:24,678 --> 00:59:26,301
That is not true.

697
00:59:28,438 --> 00:59:32,217
His powers were no match for her magic.

698
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:37,324
But yours, maybe.

699
00:59:42,093 --> 00:59:44,428
She is very powerful.

700
01:00:00,528 --> 01:00:01,881
Go, Sekura.

701
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:04,869
Madison, you stay here.

702
01:00:04,974 --> 01:00:06,283
Are you sure?

703
01:00:07,963 --> 01:00:09,781
Please be careful, Sekura.

704
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,746
Yeah, I will.

705
01:00:12,848 --> 01:00:14,947
And thanks for the battle costume.

706
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:21,489
It's made of all water resistant materials
so it will keep you dry in the water.

707
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:37,769
Come back soon.

708
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:01,175
Where are we?

709
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:06,827
It's an energy tunnel, a passage way. Take a good look.

710
01:01:07,777 --> 01:01:13,859
This place connects to thousands of different dimensions.
If we get lost in here, we'll never be able to get out.

711
01:01:13,896 --> 01:01:15,286
So where do we go?

712
01:01:15,311 --> 01:01:16,766
Use your thoughts.

713
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:22,686
Concentrate your energy on the place you
wish to be and your thought will guide you there.

714
01:01:24,794 --> 01:01:27,109
I want to go where my friends are being kept.

715
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:29,213
That's it.

716
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:42,149
Where are we?

717
01:01:43,695 --> 01:01:46,924
I don't think we came out in the right place, Kiro.

718
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:49,912
Wait, this aura, it's,

719
01:01:53,726 --> 01:01:54,804
that way.

720
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:11,512
Bird Street.

721
01:02:11,965 --> 01:02:15,260
It's like a bunch of different
dimensions have merged together.

722
01:02:16,062 --> 01:02:17,060
Keep going.

723
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:17,828
Okay.

724
01:02:36,348 --> 01:02:40,054
The aura's growing stronger and stronger. It's close now.

725
01:02:54,821 --> 01:02:56,804
The energy's coming from in there.

726
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:57,783
You're right.

727
01:03:13,148 --> 01:03:13,989
Ready?

728
01:03:14,108 --> 01:03:15,441
Yeah.

729
01:03:45,497 --> 01:03:48,003
You again, why did you return?

730
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:49,625
I want my friends back.

731
01:03:52,137 --> 01:03:56,793
If you want me to return them to
you, you must bring Clow Reed to me.

732
01:03:56,818 --> 01:03:59,335
I already told you, we can't do that.

733
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:00,099
Clow Reed is...

734
01:04:00,124 --> 01:04:02,432
I've been waiting all this time.

735
01:04:06,397 --> 01:04:10,192
Waiting for him to set me free.

736
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:14,494
Would you just listen to what we're trying to tell you?

737
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:15,426
Geez.

738
01:04:15,974 --> 01:04:17,873
She won't listen.

739
01:04:24,012 --> 01:04:26,032
Whoa, what's going on?

740
01:04:29,189 --> 01:04:30,939
It's an earthquake!

741
01:04:40,498 --> 01:04:41,158
Huh?

742
01:04:50,435 --> 01:04:51,809
There they are.

743
01:04:56,285 --> 01:04:58,540
I will ask you one last time.

744
01:04:58,707 --> 01:05:00,342
Where is Clow Reed?

745
01:05:00,575 --> 01:05:03,053
That's what we've been trying to tell you.

746
01:05:03,078 --> 01:05:04,847
Clow Reed is dead!

747
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,812
In that case, you shall all perish here!

748
01:05:45,794 --> 01:05:46,930
This place.

749
01:06:01,718 --> 01:06:02,882
Sekura.

750
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:03,918
Right.

751
01:06:08,072 --> 01:06:13,278
Oh key of Clow, power of magic, power of light,

752
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:17,528
surrender the wand, the force, ignite.

753
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:19,824
Release!

754
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:31,952
Wand!

755
01:06:34,905 --> 01:06:36,103
What's happening?

756
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:40,424
They're coming.

757
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:56,105
Where'd she go?

758
01:06:56,499 --> 01:06:58,244
Hey, up there.

759
01:07:09,287 --> 01:07:10,796
What is this place?

760
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:12,724
What have you done with Clow Reed?

761
01:07:15,793 --> 01:07:17,828
Clow Reed is dead!

762
01:07:32,703 --> 01:07:36,127
We can't just keep running like this. We've gotta hide.

763
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,057
I can't just leave my friends.

764
01:07:44,826 --> 01:07:46,209
Kiro!

765
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:48,425
Sekura!

766
01:07:59,577 --> 01:08:02,602
Now, tell me, where is Clow Reed?

767
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:05,720
Clow Reed is already dead.

768
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,601
You are a liar!

769
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:11,880
No, it's true. He passed away a long time ago.

770
01:08:11,905 --> 01:08:12,885
It can't be!

771
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:20,449
He can't be dead.

772
01:08:21,012 --> 01:08:22,840
Clow Reed can't.

773
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:26,826
Huh?

774
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:34,159
Huh.

775
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:37,735
He trapped me in there.

776
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:46,646
I will have my revenge!

777
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:11,083
I don't even know how long it has been.

778
01:09:24,183 --> 01:09:27,487
All these years, I've used my powers to summon him,

779
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,469
tried to escape.

780
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:31,024
I trusted him.

781
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:34,194
Together we could have ruled all the land.

782
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:36,554
What a fool I was.

783
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:15,468
Why did you summon me here?

784
01:10:16,857 --> 01:10:19,385
You have disappointed me, Soo Yung.

785
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:23,342
All that I know, I learned from you.

786
01:10:23,755 --> 01:10:24,750
Join me.

787
01:10:24,991 --> 01:10:27,342
Together we would be invincible.

788
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:30,019
I taught you magic, yes,

789
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:32,958
but magic should be used to serve the greater good,

790
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:35,540
not as a tool of power and destruction.

791
01:10:36,047 --> 01:10:39,328
I'm sorry, but you've left me no choice.

792
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,437
The path you've chosen must end here.

793
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:58,295
The barret was the third entrance into the dimension.

794
01:10:58,529 --> 01:11:01,412
She's been trapped inside the well ever since.

795
01:11:14,243 --> 01:11:16,757
Water is ever flowing.

796
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,292
Water is ever flowing?

797
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:24,628
That was Clow Reed's voice!

798
01:11:36,116 --> 01:11:37,310
That's it!

799
01:11:40,806 --> 01:11:42,549
Arrow!

800
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:23,465
You again.

801
01:12:37,671 --> 01:12:40,574
You felt betrayed by him, didn't you?

802
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:50,953
I'm sure he never meant to imprison you forever, Soo Yung.

803
01:12:51,153 --> 01:12:52,708
I know he didn't.

804
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:54,817
But he's gone now.

805
01:12:58,876 --> 01:13:02,306
I'm sorry you've suffered, but

806
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:06,897
please let my friends go.

807
01:13:10,004 --> 01:13:11,332
Clow Reed, is he really dead?

808
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,742
Mmhmm.

809
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,355
I waited for him to come back to set me free.

810
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,279
I wanted revenge.

811
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:33,003
Huh?

812
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:47,648
I was so angry at him

813
01:13:50,644 --> 01:13:52,450
for doing this to me.

814
01:14:13,485 --> 01:14:16,230
But he is gone and I shall go too.

815
01:14:19,047 --> 01:14:20,822
I am sorry.

816
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:24,902
I didn't mean to hurt you or your friends.

817
01:14:49,496 --> 01:14:53,242
All she wanted was to be set
free and have her spirit move on.

818
01:14:53,431 --> 01:14:56,089
She didn't know that Clow Reed had died.

819
01:14:59,243 --> 01:15:00,343
It's over.

820
01:15:00,388 --> 01:15:02,791
Her spirit can find peace now.

821
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:24,556
Lee,

822
01:15:24,782 --> 01:15:25,602
Maylin,

823
01:15:26,016 --> 01:15:26,921
Julian,

824
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:28,503
Tori,

825
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:31,690
you're okay.

826
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:48,224
What was it that we visited yesterday, Julian?

827
01:15:49,604 --> 01:15:51,248
I don't really remember.

828
01:15:51,628 --> 01:15:52,601
Me neither.

829
01:15:57,538 --> 01:15:59,488
They don't remember a thing, do they?

830
01:16:00,824 --> 01:16:01,416
Nope.

831
01:16:03,607 --> 01:16:05,704
It's probably for the best.

832
01:16:05,857 --> 01:16:07,566
Don't know how we'd ever explain it.

833
01:16:07,595 --> 01:16:09,709
Well, maybe next time.

834
01:16:10,436 --> 01:16:11,062
Huh?

835
01:16:11,509 --> 01:16:13,997
I think we'll be back again soon.

836
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:17,591
I got a feeling we haven't seen the last of this place.

837
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:22,678
That sorceress may have seemed evil,

838
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,620
but she just wanted her spirit to be set free.

839
01:16:34,554 --> 01:16:37,230
I'm glad my friends are okay too.

840
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:44,870
Well, if you do come back to
Hong Kong one day, count me in.

841
01:16:45,556 --> 01:16:46,838
You bet.
