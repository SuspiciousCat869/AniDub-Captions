1
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:37,937
Yet another village is dead.

2
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:46,557
Let's go.

3
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:50,243
Soon this place, too, will be
consumed by the Toxic Jungle.

4
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,335
A thousand years have passed since the
collapse of industrialized civilization.

5
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:10,213
A Toxic Jungle now spreads, threatening
the survival of the last of the human race.

6
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,690
Ohmu tracks.

7
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,394
Looks like they're still fresh.

8
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,042
A perfect Ohmu shell.

9
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,823
Amazing.

10
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,633
I've never seen a whole shell before.

11
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,995
A perfect sound.

12
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,600
Ah!

13
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:14,632
It even chipped a Xerconian ceramic sword.

14
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,152
This should make the people of the valley happy.

15
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:21,321
They won't have to worry about finding
materials for making tools for a long time.

16
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:26,374
What an amazing eye.

17
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:28,932
I wonder if I could fly back home with this.

18
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,718
It came off.

19
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,936
It's so light.

20
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:21,159
Oh! The Mushigo Palms are
sending out their afternoon spores.

21
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:39,298
It's so beautiful.

22
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:42,102
It's hard to believe these spores could kill me.

23
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,841
Five minutes without a mask, and I'd be dead.

24
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:06,014
What's that?

25
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,564
My heart's pounding.

26
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:19,328
What's going on?

27
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:23,518
Gunshots.

28
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,465
Someone's in trouble. The insects must be attacking.

29
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,766
Oops, sorry.

30
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:52,725
There they are.

31
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:54,923
Look at that cloud of spores.

32
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,197
An Ohmu! It must be the one that shed that shell.

33
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,101
Whoever it's chasing will never escape that way.

34
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,878
I hope they see the signal.

35
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,372
Good. They're coming this way.

36
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:54,027
There they are.

37
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:14,281
What an amazing Ohmu.

38
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,947
Get upwind of it!

39
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:22,350
Right!

40
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,364
Ohmu, go back to the jungle. This is not your world.

41
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:32,194
Come on, now. Be good.

42
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,245
Look at those red eyes.

43
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:38,946
It's blind with rage. I've got to calm it.

44
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:10,742
Look at that. She's stunned it with flash grenades.

45
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,584
An insect charm.

46
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:23,315
Ohmu, wake up.

47
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:25,463
You need to go back to your jungle.

48
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,196
It's coming to.

49
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,872
Unbelievable.

50
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,861
It's going back to the jungle.

51
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:02,625
She turned it back with nothing but
an insect charm and flash grenades.

52
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,345
Lord Yupa!

53
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,300
Nausicaa. I didn't recognize you.

54
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,007
It's been over a year now. It's great to see you.

55
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:56,134
Thank you for helping me with that Ohmu.

56
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,277
You've mastered that glider of yours.

57
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,676
You think so? Father says I have a long way to...

58
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:01,842
Hm?

59
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:06,812
Oh, yes. I forgot all about this little fellow.

60
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:09,303
He's the reason I got in trouble with the Ohmu.

61
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,860
Wow, is that a fox-squirrel? I've never seen one.

62
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:17,046
I hadn't, either. I saw an insect carrying
him off, and I mistook him for a human baby.

63
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,779
I had no choice but to use my gun.

64
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:21,525
So, that's why the Ohmu was so angry with you.

65
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:22,662
He's quite spirited.

66
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,263
Apparently, he didn't inhale
too much of the jungle's poison.

67
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,983
Better not touch him. Even the babies are vicious.

68
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:28,984
Come on.

69
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,490
It's OK.

70
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:32,204
Careful.

71
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,027
There's nothing to fear.

72
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,689
Nothing to fear.

73
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,872
See? Nothing to fear.

74
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,187
Right?

75
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,512
You were just a little scared, weren't you?

76
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:06,661
He's perfect. Will you let me keep him, lord Yupa?

77
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,464
Of course. Certainly.

78
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:10,523
Thank you!

79
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,969
Kai, Kui! Do you remember me?

80
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,510
What a mysterious power she has.

81
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:20,173
You must be tired after running from that Ohmu.

82
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:26,373
So, how's your family, Nausicaa?

83
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:30,295
What's wrong?

84
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:32,324
It's...

85
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:36,209
Father can't fly anymore.

86
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:37,710
King Jihl?

87
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:40,577
So the jungle's poisons are taking their toll.

88
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:42,397
Yes.

89
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,883
Father says it's the fate of
all of us who live near the jungle.

90
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,656
I'm sorry. I should have come sooner.

91
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:53,692
No, I'm just glad you could come at all.

92
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:59,698
Lord Yupa, there's something I want to
show you when we get back to the valley.

93
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,002
I've created my own secret room.

94
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:02,510
Oh.

95
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:05,536
I haven't shown it to anyone
yet because it'll frighten them.

96
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:06,926
You get to be the first!

97
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,054
I'll go on ahead and announce you. See you there!

98
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:11,915
Lord Yupa?

99
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:12,775
Hmm?

100
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,357
Do you think you could carry this back for me?

101
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:18,053
I'm afraid it's not the easiest thing to fly with.

102
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:31,285
She certainly knows how to read the wind.

103
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:33,176
Come, you two! We're almost there.

104
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:11,103
Oh! Lord Yupa!

105
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,068
Gol, Muzu, how have you been?

106
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:17,118
Good, good! The wind is strong and the water is clear.

107
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:18,969
Hi!

108
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:19,880
Hi, lord Yupa!

109
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,856
Hello, girls. You're looking well.

110
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:38,839
Welcome home, lord Yupa!

111
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,153
We've waited so long for your return!

112
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:47,562
Princess, lord Yupa has arrived.

113
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:48,801
I'm almost finished.

114
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,153
Welcome back, lord Yupa!

115
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,983
Why, Mito, you're looking fit!

116
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:58,097
Thank you. I'm looking forward to hearing
all the news from the other kingdoms tonight.

117
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:00,983
OK, start her up!

118
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,617
Nice work, Princess.

119
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,191
Thanks.

120
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,976
This is high-grade material, lord Yupa.

121
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,414
I'll send out a party to retrieve the
rest of the shell first thing tomorrow.

122
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,084
Come on. It's OK.

123
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,045
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,636
Lord Yupa, we had a baby born in the valley this year.

125
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,464
Wonderful. Let's have a look.

126
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:33,945
Oh, she's a fine baby.

127
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:37,423
Strong and healthy. She reminds me of Nausicaa as a child.

128
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:40,734
We would be very honored if
you would choose a name for her.

129
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,546
With your blessing, fair winds are sure to favor her.

130
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:45,022
Very well.

131
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:47,593
I'll see that she's given a good name.

132
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,294
Thank you, lord Yupa.

133
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:53,089
May she grow up to be strong just like Princess Nausicaa.

134
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:53,881
Hmph!

135
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:57,241
It's good to hope for a daughter
who's strong like the Princess,

136
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:00,179
but not for one who likes to play in the Toxic Jungle.

137
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,006
But, Mito, the jungle is where I found the Ohmu shell.

138
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,089
All I do is worry when she's running around out there.

139
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:09,037
I'd trade a thousand Ohmu shells for a good night's sleep.

140
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:12,715
Sorry, Mito. We'd rather have the Ohmu shells.

141
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:14,948
The Princess should explore all she wants.

142
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:17,911
I agree. Who else would rescue me when I'm in trouble?

143
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:22,496
Welcome home.

144
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:24,964
Welcome home, lord Yupa, you've been missed!

145
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,198
Our blessings, lord Yupa!

146
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,358
We're so happy you've returned.

147
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,494
Lord Yupa!

148
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:53,860
So Nausicaa rescued the great lord Yupa?

149
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:58,721
This is such a wonderful
valley, Jihl. It soothes my heart.

150
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:01,636
How are the other kingdoms you visited faring?

151
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,871
Mm, things are grim.

152
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,797
I found two more kingdoms to the south
that have been consumed by the jungle.

153
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,908
It seems as if it spreads faster every day.

154
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:15,180
And the kingdoms that still survive
are torn by war and starvation.

155
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:17,097
The cities are plagued with fear.

156
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,665
Why can't the other kingdoms live happily as you do here?

157
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:25,378
It's because we have the wind from the
sea to protect us from the jungle's poisons.

158
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:28,245
We know the poison cannot reach us here.

159
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:32,797
Lord Yupa, isn't it about time you settled down here?

160
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:38,089
With my present condition, it
would bring peace of mind to us all.

161
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:42,385
<i>Ha-ha-ha! That's impossible.</i>

162
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:46,634
Lord Yupa must continue his search. It's his destiny.

163
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:49,901
It's my destiny, is it?

164
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:52,546
Obaba, what is it that lord Yupa searches for?

165
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,570
What? Nausicaa.

166
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,564
How could you not know this, child?

167
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:59,979
The answer is on the tapestry which hangs before you.

168
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:04,722
Although I can no longer see it, I remember it well.

169
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,930
There is a figure in the upper left corner.

170
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:15,650
After a thousand years of darkness, he will
come, clad in blue and surrounded by fields of Gold

171
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:19,900
to restore mankind's connection
with the Earth that was destroyed.

172
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:24,505
And he will guide the people of this
planet at last to a land of purity.

173
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:27,770
Lord Yupa, are you searching for the man in blue?

174
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:29,525
I thought that was just a myth.

175
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:33,258
It is a myth. Obaba is just teasing me.

176
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,359
Not true. That is the goal you seek.

177
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,996
The only goal I seek is to understand
the mysteries of the Toxic Jungle.

178
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,707
I want to know if mankind is
truly fated to be swallowed up by it.

179
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,122
Or if there is still some hope that we may survive.

180
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:50,357
I want to know the truth.

181
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,361
I wish there was something I could do to help lord Yupa.

182
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,582
Princess? Princess?

183
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,448
Mito? What is it?

184
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:31,339
Gol has detected something in the wind.

185
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,564
All right, I'll be right there.

186
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,715
What's going on?

187
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,273
There's a good storm brewing, Princess,
and I'm afraid something's not right.

188
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,430
There it is. Up there!

189
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:14,697
It's an airship.

190
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:17,373
What in the world is an airship doing way out here?

191
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,566
What's going on?

192
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:21,674
Lord Yupa, there's an airship.

193
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,692
Are you sure?

194
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:23,604
Here he comes.

195
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,355
It's enormous.

196
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,035
It's a Tolmekian ship.

197
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,122
It's in trouble!

198
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,704
They're trying to make an emergency landing.

199
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:46,840
Help me launch, Gol.

200
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:47,634
What?

201
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,614
Princess, it's too dangerous.

202
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,145
I'll just guide them to the shore.

203
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:55,693
Here they come.

204
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:59,241
All right, Princess. Ready to launch!

205
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,567
Teto, hold on.

206
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:32,091
Oh, no, they must have landed in
the jungle and angered the insects!

207
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:37,483
Turn your ship! You're gonna crash!

208
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:38,987
Turn the ship!

209
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,599
Turn!

210
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,056
It's down.

211
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:00,839
The Princess.

212
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:02,967
They crashed, by the sea cliffs!

213
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,452
Let's go!

214
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,327
Everyone, to the cliffs!

215
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:07,466
Let's go! Let's go!

216
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,843
There she is. She's alive.

217
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:55,647
Where am I?

218
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,584
Don't talk. You're in the valley of the wind.

219
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,847
I am Lastel...

220
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,016
<i>Lastel of Petite.</i>

221
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,568
You must... burn the cargo.

222
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:21,560
The cargo?

223
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:24,216
I beg of you, burn everything.

224
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:25,925
Yes, Lastel, I understand.

225
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:27,910
Everything is burning. Don't you worry.

226
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,735
Look over there!

227
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:30,039
Where?

228
00:25:30,357 --> 00:25:31,517
Thank god.

229
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:33,063
Princess!

230
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:33,832
Get that fire out!

231
00:25:33,857 --> 00:25:35,531
Yes, follow me, follow me!

232
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:36,474
Every direction!

233
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,157
We need more men!

234
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:38,926
Hurry!

235
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,525
A Princess of Pejite? What's
she doing on a Tolmekian ship?

236
00:25:57,576 --> 00:26:00,453
Everybody, get out now! There's an insect in there.

237
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:01,834
No, oh, no!

238
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:06,124
Oh, no! It's calling for help!

239
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,395
Maybe it can't fly?

240
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,309
Get your guns!

241
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:09,008
Don't shoot!

242
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,866
You'll enrage every insect in the jungle.

243
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,694
I can kill it in one shot.

244
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,687
You can't kill that with just a gun.

245
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:16,057
Then what do you suggest we do?

246
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,914
Wait.

247
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:19,200
Mito, will you get my glider, please?

248
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:19,946
Right away.

249
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,234
Princess!

250
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,269
Easy, Princess.

251
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,345
You need to return to your jungle. Understand?

252
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:44,386
You're strong. You can fly.

253
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:48,795
It's working!

254
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,200
Look!

255
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:51,797
There. That's a good boy.

256
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:52,519
Step aside.

257
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:53,432
Hey, give the road.

258
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:53,825
They come.

259
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,965
Here you go, Princess.

260
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:55,680
Thanks, Mito.

261
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:07,390
Look, it's worked!

262
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,571
Yes!

263
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:17,866
Unbelievable!

264
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,533
She did it!

265
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:19,081
Thanks gods bless us.

266
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:24,187
Thank goodness. I'd hate to think what would have happened
if the insects in the jungle would've come to its aid.

267
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,677
An Ohmu.

268
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:14,920
This row is clear!

269
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:16,317
Don't touch this area!

270
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,127
It's all clear.

271
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:18,411
We haven't cover this clock yet.

272
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:19,423
The west grove is open.

273
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,643
Do you see any?

274
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,827
Over here! I found one!

275
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:25,082
They found one?

276
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:26,281
Down here.

277
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:30,070
That ship was infested with spores, all right.

278
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:32,698
Good thing you found this before it released its poisons.

279
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,943
Keep up the good work, son.

280
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:40,413
I'll keep searching till I find every last one.

281
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:50,394
Ah! What in the world do you think that thing is?

282
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:53,220
I don't know. The fire didn't seem to harm it at all.

283
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:56,111
OK, everyone. We'll examine this thing later.

284
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,422
Go help look for spores in the fields.

285
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:01,609
Make sure you get every last one of 'em!

286
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:05,890
What a mess those Tolmekians dumped on us.

287
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,419
Mito, take a look at this.

288
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:08,689
What?

289
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:14,871
It's beating like a heart.

290
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,878
Looks like this thing is alive.

291
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:20,124
Lord Yupa, what is this?

292
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:23,355
While I was traveling, I heard a frightening rumor.

293
00:30:23,911 --> 00:30:28,944
It was said that a monster from the old world
was unearthed from deep beneath the city of Pejite.

294
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:31,526
A monster from the old world?

295
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,034
A Giant Warrior.

296
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:34,344
A Giant Warrior?

297
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,129
From the seven days of fire?
That was a thousand years ago.

298
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,464
It can't be.

299
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:51,833
After they incinerated the Earth, all the
Giant Warriors were said to have turned to stone.

300
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:58,769
Apparently, one has lain dormant deep
underground for the past 1,000 years.

301
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:02,321
If they unearthed it in Pejite,
what was it doing on a Tolmekian ship?

302
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:07,460
Tolmekia is far to the west,
and its rulers are very warlike.

303
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:11,036
That they had a Pejite hostage on board worries me.

304
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,236
Take care of the rest, will you?

305
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:16,554
Right.

306
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:28,854
What can that be?

307
00:31:35,747 --> 00:31:36,271
What's that?

308
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:36,993
What's that?

309
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,509
Tolmekian airships! Get everyone to the castle!

310
00:31:55,535 --> 00:31:56,780
Out of the way!

311
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:04,616
Everyone, to the castle!

312
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,625
Everyone, to the castle!

313
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:07,921
Hurry!

314
00:32:10,325 --> 00:32:11,461
They're after father!

315
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:14,185
Move out! Move!

316
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:14,774
Go!

317
00:32:22,136 --> 00:32:24,796
Obaba, quickly, hide yourself.

318
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,679
I think I'll stay right here.

319
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:33,267
Go, go! Go!

320
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:36,520
Up there.

321
00:32:44,952 --> 00:32:46,043
Princess!

322
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:02,243
I'll kill you!

323
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,923
Nausicaa!

324
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:33,277
Don't move.

325
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:38,840
This Ohmu shell knife can slice right
through that Xerconian ceramic armor of yours.

326
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,667
That's lord Yupa, the sword master.

327
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:44,059
Soldiers of Tolmekia, hear me now.

328
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:49,024
Last night, the people of this valley risked their
lives attempting to prevent your airship from crashing.

329
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:52,615
And just this morning, they finished
giving your dead a proper burial.

330
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:57,178
This may be a small kingdom, but it
clearly deserves your courtesy and respect.

331
00:33:57,525 --> 00:34:00,294
If you are here to make war, there must be a reason,

332
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:04,081
and it's only right to first send a
messenger to announce your grievances.

333
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:09,937
Nausicaa, be calm.

334
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,918
If you fight now, the people
of the valley will be massacred.

335
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,785
We must stay alive and wait for the right opportunity.

336
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,639
I'm going to...

337
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,584
Put it down, Kurotowa.

338
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,689
But she...

339
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:32,202
Oh, fine. But look at this mess.
Now I must acquire all new men.

340
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:35,676
So, you're lord Yupa, the greatest swordsman in the land.

341
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,298
I'm offended that you think we need reprimanding.

342
00:34:39,172 --> 00:34:41,628
We're not savages who've come to massacre your people.

343
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:45,042
We're here to talk. So would
you put your knife away? Please?

344
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:51,936
Ah, beat it.

345
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:00,459
Secure the room.

346
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:25,490
It's the Princess.

347
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:26,640
The Princess.

348
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,482
She's OK.

349
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:32,968
Listen now.

350
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:37,962
You will be addressed by her highness
Kushana, commander of the Tolmekian army.

351
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:39,782
Villagers,

352
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,673
we have come to your land in the name of peace.

353
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,130
Our goal is to unify the kingdoms surrounding Tolmekia,

354
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,466
and build a world of prosperity.

355
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,856
You now live at the edge of the jungle,

356
00:35:51,272 --> 00:35:52,649
on the verge of extinction.

357
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,749
Follow us, and join our enterprise.

358
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:59,699
We shall put the Toxic Jungle to the
torch and resurrect this land together.

359
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,843
Burn the Toxic Jungle?

360
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:01,296
With what?

361
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,201
Is that possible?

362
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:04,854
I have in my possession mankind's greatest tool,

363
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,384
the awesome force which once
allowed human beings to rule the Earth.

364
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:12,597
I guarantee that those who join me

365
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:17,825
will live without fear of the insects
or the jungle's poisons ever again.

366
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,386
Stop! Stop, I say!

367
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,144
You must not touch the Toxic Jungle.

368
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,993
What are you babbling about, woman?

369
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,542
Guards, take her away.

370
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:33,107
No, let her speak.

371
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:38,629
Since the origin of the Toxic Jungle, 1,000 years ago,

372
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:41,440
people tried time and again to burn it.

373
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,547
But time and again, their attempts
did nothing but enrage the Ohmu,

374
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:49,736
and swarms of them spilled from the jungle

375
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,768
and stampeded across the lands.

376
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:05,405
They toppled cities, destroyed
kingdoms and killed thousands.

377
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,851
The Ohmu could not be stopped.

378
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:10,017
Such rage did they feel,

379
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,487
the Ohmu fought till they died of starvation.

380
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:17,092
Then spores took root in their corpses,

381
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:21,096
and the land soon became part of the Toxic Jungle.

382
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:24,391
That's why you do not interfere with it.

383
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,111
Silence, you old hag.

384
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:27,691
We will have none of your raving.

385
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,234
You won't, will you?

386
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,693
How will you shut me up?

387
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:31,996
Will you kill me, too?

388
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:33,458
Ah, silence, I said!

389
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:35,006
Go ahead and kill me!

390
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:41,219
It'll be easier for you to kill an old, blind
woman than it was for you to murder our king Jihl!

391
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:42,259
King Jihl?

392
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:44,156
What? He was bedridden!

393
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:46,214
You murderers! You'll pay for this!

394
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,494
We won't let you get away with this!

395
00:37:49,152 --> 00:37:52,253
Silence them! No mercy for the insolent.

396
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:55,559
Quiet, everyone, please. I need everybody to listen to me.

397
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,703
I can't bear to have anyone else die.

398
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:04,226
I beg of you...

399
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:07,350
Princess.

400
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:11,080
Obaba, please understand.

401
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,336
We need to do as the Tolmekians say.

402
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:32,503
Move! Move!

403
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,482
Heave! Heave! Heave!

404
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:42,136
Set it down over there.

405
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,371
Let's go. Come on!

406
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,201
Nice valley. I think we should keep it.

407
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:52,628
I must object, your highness.

408
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,957
Our orders are to transport the Giant
Warrior back to Tolmekia immediately.

409
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:59,166
Those orders cannot be carried out.

410
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,216
The Giant Warrior is so heavy, even
our largest ship couldn't transport it.

411
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:07,148
Your highness, you can't want
to stay and start a new Kingdom?

412
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,443
Then what should I do?

413
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:13,248
You really think I should deliver that
monster as a plaything for those fools back home?

414
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:15,702
Ah, yes, I do see your point.

415
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:18,086
But I am just a soldier of Tolmekia.

416
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,358
I am not in a position to make that decision.

417
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:22,016
Hmm. Weasel.

418
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:28,018
I'm reporting back to Pejite.

419
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:30,251
While I'm gone, begin to awaken the warrior.

420
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:31,243
Right.

421
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:32,920
They have a gunship?

422
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:35,929
Yes, an unexpected find for such a quaint valley.

423
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,542
Those are my orders.

424
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:41,386
I'll leave for Pejite first thing in the morning.

425
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:44,373
But, Kushana, why must the Princess go with you?

426
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:47,592
Aren't five hostages, food and the gunship enough?

427
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,832
Select your five hostages and load up
the cargo barge before tomorrow's departure.

428
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:55,387
Take it all.

429
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,921
We leave nothing here.

430
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,647
Mito, thank you for accompanying the Princess.

431
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,785
No, I'm glad to go. But look at those greedy Tolmekians.

432
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,223
They're stripping us of everything.

433
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,471
Don't worry about that.

434
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:14,266
Our only concern is that the warrior stay dormant.

435
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:17,890
I'm going to leave the valley, then
I'll slip back and wait for my chance.

436
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:18,621
Good luck.

437
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,180
Nausicaa?

438
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:40,920
Teto, where has Nausicaa gone?

439
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,795
Nausicaa, what are you doing here?

440
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:42,019
This chamber is filled with toxic plants.

441
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,361
I collected the spores and grew them down here myself.

442
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:48,220
Don't worry. The plants aren't poisonous.

443
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:50,054
They're not poisonous?

444
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:54,126
It's true. The air is pure in here.

445
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,563
But I know these plants from the jungle.

446
00:41:57,836 --> 00:41:59,430
These are some of the most lethal.

447
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:04,856
I irrigated this chamber using water drawn
from deep underground by the castle windmill.

448
00:42:05,677 --> 00:42:07,500
I used soil drawn from there as well.

449
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:14,350
I found that, with clean water and soil, the
plants from the Toxic Jungle aren't poisonous.

450
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,833
All the poison is in the soil.

451
00:42:17,256 --> 00:42:19,723
Even the topsoil in our valley is polluted.

452
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:26,177
But I don't understand who
could've polluted the entire Earth.

453
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:28,805
You discovered this all on your own?

454
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:33,055
Yes. I was hoping to find a cure for father's illness.

455
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:34,118
But...

456
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:39,375
It's too late now. I'm shutting down.

457
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,859
I've already cut off the water.

458
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:45,631
Soon, these plants will wither and die.

459
00:42:58,271 --> 00:42:59,281
Nausicaa.

460
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:02,338
I'm afraid of myself, lord Yupa.

461
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:07,030
I had no idea that my rage could drive me to kill.

462
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,961
No more killing. It has to stop.

463
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:42,958
Princess Nausicaa!

464
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,935
We gathered these for you.

465
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:47,635
Chiko nuts.

466
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:49,040
You can take them on your trip.

467
00:43:51,156 --> 00:43:52,267
Oh, my.

468
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,029
There are so many.

469
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,801
You must have worked very hard.

470
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:00,264
Thank you.

471
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:02,504
I'll think of you when I eat them.

472
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,981
We don't want you to go.

473
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:05,799
Hurry up! Get in the ship.

474
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,752
All right, I must go now.

475
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:13,612
There's no need to cry. I'll be back very soon, OK?

476
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:14,939
You mean it?

477
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:18,409
Of course! Have I ever broken a promise to you?

478
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:19,822
No.

479
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:21,148
See?

480
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,251
Mm-hm.

481
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:24,514
You'll come back, huh?

482
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:25,188
Mm-hm.

483
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:27,300
Now, be good while I'm gone.

484
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:27,816
We will.

485
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,387
Ok.

486
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:29,333
Bye!

487
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,756
Bye, Princess!

488
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:46,623
Good luck!

489
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:47,865
Take care of the Princess!

490
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,686
Protect her!

491
00:45:39,943 --> 00:45:42,023
Hey, Niga, aren't we in Pejite yet?

492
00:45:42,064 --> 00:45:44,762
Yeah, hurry it up. My back is killing me.

493
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:48,155
Good lord, no wonder they sent you two off to be hostages.

494
00:45:48,187 --> 00:45:49,513
All you do is complain.

495
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:53,372
Hey, doesn't this formation seem strange?

496
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:55,862
Why are we flying so close together?

497
00:45:56,017 --> 00:45:56,920
Yeah.

498
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,842
It's as if they fear an attack.

499
00:46:15,036 --> 00:46:18,060
The air beneath the clouds must
be charged with poisonous gas.

500
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,248
What?

501
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:29,203
Hey, sit down.

502
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:33,886
It's a gunship!

503
00:46:36,236 --> 00:46:38,308
Enemy ship! We're under fire!

504
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,254
Your highness, they're attacking us!

505
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:46,384
Our number two ship is down!

506
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:55,072
What did I tell you?

507
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,580
This is terrible!

508
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:03,515
Look out! He's coming in from below!

509
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:04,841
That's a Pejite gunship!

510
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:05,444
Pejite?

511
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:18,451
Number three's been hit!

512
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:20,078
Signal from number three!

513
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:21,721
They can't steer! They can't steer!

514
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,961
Where's our fighter plane?

515
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:24,810
These are some flimsy ships.

516
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:34,400
He's hit the rear guard!

517
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:41,856
The barge detached.

518
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:48,573
Teto, come on.

519
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:09,637
We're going down. We got to get out of here.

520
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:11,138
Princess!

521
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:19,704
Stop it! All this killing must stop!

522
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:30,129
You must stop!

523
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,299
Princess!

524
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,939
This way, Mito.

525
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,050
Princess, where are you going?

526
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:11,327
Let's try the gunship.

527
00:49:11,374 --> 00:49:11,993
What?

528
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,185
Mito, hurry up!

529
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:16,436
Uh, right.

530
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,097
Start the engine. Then we'll shoot the door open.

531
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:20,493
Got it!

532
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:30,165
Come on!

533
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:31,301
Hurry!

534
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:35,685
Here, get in!

535
00:49:35,901 --> 00:49:36,788
Can we launch?

536
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:38,296
I hope so.

537
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,941
Open the throttle to full, then fire.

538
00:49:42,956 --> 00:49:43,397
Roger.

539
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:45,523
Ready? Now!

540
00:49:56,932 --> 00:50:00,799
Put on your masks. I'm going below
the clouds to rescue the cargo barge.

541
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:14,273
Hold on, Teto. Don't die.

542
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:32,034
Look at this. I've never seen
the poison this dense before.

543
00:50:32,223 --> 00:50:34,621
Mito, watch the starboard side of the ship.

544
00:50:34,638 --> 00:50:36,435
We should come across the barge any minute.

545
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,078
Roger.

546
00:50:37,187 --> 00:50:38,730
It should be gliding.

547
00:50:40,397 --> 00:50:41,184
There it is!

548
00:50:41,892 --> 00:50:43,035
Down to the right.

549
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:59,265
Princess! Nausicaa!

550
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:01,498
Hold on. I'll throw you a tow rope.

551
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:05,915
The towing hook broke. We can't be towed.

552
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:09,815
I don't want to land in the
jungle. The insects will eat us alive!

553
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:11,555
We'd rather jump to our deaths.

554
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:15,528
Calm down. Dump the cargo, and we'll help you land.

555
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:16,353
Goodbye.

556
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:17,141
It's being nice knowing you!

557
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,111
Listen to me. Just dump the cargo.

558
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:22,311
Mito, cut the rear engine.

559
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:22,694
What?

560
00:51:22,853 --> 00:51:24,822
Just do as I say. Hurry!

561
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:25,752
All right.

562
00:51:31,478 --> 00:51:33,247
Princess, what are you doing?

563
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:38,086
Put on your mask!

564
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:39,332
You'll die!

565
00:51:39,372 --> 00:51:40,582
Put it back on!

566
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:43,922
Listen, please. Dump your cargo and glide down with us.

567
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:44,972
You'll be just fine.

568
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:47,973
We'll do whatever you say! Just put your mask on!

569
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:49,767
Do it now, please!

570
00:51:55,638 --> 00:51:56,932
Look at her smiling.

571
00:51:56,995 --> 00:51:59,116
She actually thinks we're going to be OK.

572
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:00,497
Hurry! Dump the cargo!

573
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,429
Start the engine. We'll look for a place to land.

574
00:52:04,464 --> 00:52:06,454
Ah, I inhaled some of that poison.

575
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:10,328
Hurry up!

576
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:11,550
This is wasteful!

577
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:13,256
Don't think about it. Hurry.

578
00:53:25,113 --> 00:53:27,011
What do we do? Princess!

579
00:53:27,027 --> 00:53:27,999
Is everyone OK?

580
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:28,392
Yeah.

581
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:29,167
Sense of.

582
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:29,774
Don't move.

583
00:53:30,787 --> 00:53:31,375
You.

584
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:37,088
Thank you for rescuing me, Nausicaa.

585
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,922
Princess, you brought her with you on purpose?

586
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,374
You're too naive.

587
00:53:41,571 --> 00:53:44,593
You shouldn't think we're best
friends now, just because you saved me.

588
00:53:45,837 --> 00:53:48,286
Listen, you don't understand the jungle.

589
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:55,348
This is no place for guns. If you fire that
here, the insects will descend upon us in seconds.

590
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:00,884
They're already enraged from all
your ships crashing into their jungle.

591
00:54:01,635 --> 00:54:02,791
Look at them swarming.

592
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:15,919
The Giant Dragonflies are the sentries of the jungle.

593
00:54:15,935 --> 00:54:18,231
Soon, they'll summon hordes of insects to this site.

594
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:21,456
We must get out of here now.
Bring me your extra rope. Quickly.

595
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,409
Mito, repair their towing hook.

596
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:23,846
Right.

597
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:26,028
Oh.

598
00:54:26,103 --> 00:54:28,617
Don't move. I'm the one who gives the orders.

599
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:30,832
What are you so afraid of?

600
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:33,208
You act like a scared little fox-squirrel.

601
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,058
What did you call me?

602
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,850
Don't be afraid. There's nothing to fear.

603
00:54:37,866 --> 00:54:39,954
I just want you to go back to your own country.

604
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:42,248
How dare you talk to me that way?

605
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:53,847
They're here.

606
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,405
Stay calm.

607
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:10,222
Whatever you do, don't startle them.

608
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,852
We're in the middle of an Ohmu nest!

609
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:15,555
We're surrounded!

610
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:38,595
They're examining us.

611
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,743
Ohmu, please forgive us for disturbing your nest.

612
00:55:44,138 --> 00:55:45,505
We're very sorry.

613
00:55:46,394 --> 00:55:49,014
We are not your enemies. We mean you no harm.

614
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:11,866
Princess?

615
00:57:20,573 --> 00:57:21,739
The pilot from Pejite.

616
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,279
He's still alive? Ohmu, wait!

617
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:40,684
What's going on?

618
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,525
Their eyes are red with rage!

619
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:54,540
Princess, what in the world do you think you're doing?

620
00:57:54,697 --> 00:57:58,218
Take off as soon as the waters are
calm, wait for me above the cloud line.

621
00:57:58,324 --> 00:58:01,116
If I'm not back in one hour, return to the valley.

622
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:02,276
Are you crazy?

623
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:04,046
Princess, no!

624
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:22,189
The Princess is gone.

625
00:58:23,524 --> 00:58:25,177
Why don't I take that for you?

626
00:58:29,017 --> 00:58:32,013
All right, let's do as the Princess said.

627
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,669
She better be OK.

628
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:58,926
<i>Whoa!</i>

629
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,040
I'm trapped.

630
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:08,026
It's jammed.

631
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:10,520
Ah!

632
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,271
No... ah!

633
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,224
Who are you?

634
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:42,037
You've done far too much killing.

635
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:44,909
My insect charm and flash grenade won't do any good now.

636
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:47,007
Quicksand.

637
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,314
No!

638
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,617
Oh!

639
01:01:19,103 --> 01:01:21,022
It's already been two hours.

640
01:01:21,082 --> 01:01:23,243
More insects keep coming by the minute.

641
01:01:23,259 --> 01:01:25,434
Princess, where are you?

642
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:27,566
Princess!

643
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,337
Nausicaa.

644
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,415
Nausicaa.

645
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,026
Come here.

646
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:53,375
Come here, child.

647
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:56,431
Father!

648
01:02:07,386 --> 01:02:08,493
Mother's here, too?

649
01:02:17,913 --> 01:02:19,749
Wait. Don't go this way.

650
01:02:23,062 --> 01:02:25,003
Stay away! Ah!

651
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:31,587
Get back. There's nothing here.
Stay away from me. Please go.

652
01:02:37,527 --> 01:02:38,608
Get back inside.

653
01:02:40,396 --> 01:02:41,546
She's got a baby Ohmu.

654
01:02:41,952 --> 01:02:43,761
The insects have bewitched her.

655
01:02:45,124 --> 01:02:46,690
Hand it over, child.

656
01:02:48,024 --> 01:02:50,588
No. It hasn't done anything wrong.

657
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:53,819
Insects and humans cannot live in the same world.

658
01:02:54,012 --> 01:02:55,180
You know that.

659
01:03:01,804 --> 01:03:02,941
You knew that.

660
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,127
Don't kill it! Please, don't kill it!

661
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:09,613
Please.

662
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,613
Teto.

663
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,384
What a strange place.

664
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:39,483
Hey!

665
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,562
I found your glider.

666
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,078
How are you feeling?

667
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,032
Where are we?

668
01:04:47,737 --> 01:04:49,249
I should introduce myself first.

669
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:51,272
I'm Asbel from the land of Pejite.

670
01:04:51,831 --> 01:04:53,443
I'd like to thank you for saving me.

671
01:04:54,577 --> 01:04:56,945
I'm Nausicaa. I'm from the valley of the wind.

672
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:00,198
What is this place?

673
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:03,763
You're not going to believe this.

674
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:06,020
We're actually beneath the Toxic Jungle.

675
01:05:06,296 --> 01:05:07,426
Beneath the jungle?

676
01:05:07,554 --> 01:05:10,150
Yeah. See that? We fell through that hole there.

677
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:11,961
Along with a bunch of sand.

678
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:16,614
How can we be breathing without our masks?

679
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,497
I don't know. Somehow the air down here is clean.

680
01:05:20,439 --> 01:05:21,459
I couldn't believe it, either.

681
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:24,406
I never dreamed the Toxic Jungle could be like this.

682
01:05:31,914 --> 01:05:32,440
What's wrong?

683
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:46,772
Nausicaa, don't wander off too far.

684
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:10,900
What a magnificent tree.

685
01:06:26,276 --> 01:06:28,323
It's dead, but water's still flowing through it.

686
01:07:03,388 --> 01:07:05,779
This is like the sand from the bottom of our well.

687
01:07:13,923 --> 01:07:17,730
It looks like these trees must die and
fossilize, and then crumble into sand.

688
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:37,677
Nausicaa?

689
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:43,893
You crying?

690
01:07:48,284 --> 01:07:49,040
It's OK, though.

691
01:07:50,784 --> 01:07:51,708
I'm just happy.

692
01:08:09,138 --> 01:08:11,788
I can't believe she's dead. Lastel was my twin sister.

693
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:13,997
I wish I could have been there for her.

694
01:08:15,297 --> 01:08:17,803
I'm sorry. I was too late to save her.

695
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:18,462
No.

696
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:20,917
I apologize.

697
01:08:21,073 --> 01:08:23,242
You took care of my sister while she was dying,

698
01:08:23,309 --> 01:08:24,895
and I just shot down your ship.

699
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,046
It's OK.

700
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:30,055
So, the Giant Warrior's in the valley of the wind now.

701
01:08:37,216 --> 01:08:39,966
Ugh, these nuts taste awful. What are they?

702
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:42,951
They're called Chiko nuts.
They're supposed to be good for you.

703
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,237
Why is it everything that's good for you tastes so bad?

704
01:09:10,811 --> 01:09:12,339
What's the origin of the jungle?

705
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:15,905
You sure spend a lot of time
thinking about strange things.

706
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:19,518
The trees of the Toxic Jungle must have evolved

707
01:09:19,566 --> 01:09:22,838
to purify the Earth of all the
pollution that we humans have made.

708
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:27,210
The trees absorb the pollution so it becomes inert.

709
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:31,118
Then they die and petrify and crumble into purified sand.

710
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:34,166
That's how these underground caverns must've been formed.

711
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,790
And the insects, they evolved to guard this place.

712
01:09:39,211 --> 01:09:41,934
If that's true, then mankind is destined to go extinct.

713
01:09:42,694 --> 01:09:45,275
It'll take centuries for these trees to cleanse the Earth.

714
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:47,315
We can't survive with insects that long.

715
01:09:49,244 --> 01:09:53,389
Somehow, we are going to have to find a
way to stop this Toxic Jungle from spreading.

716
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:56,918
You Pejites sound just like the Tolmekians.

717
01:09:57,148 --> 01:10:00,682
What? We are nothing like those bloodthirsty Tolmekians.

718
01:10:00,845 --> 01:10:02,889
We'd never use the warrior as a weapon.

719
01:10:03,687 --> 01:10:05,507
Let's get some sleep, Asbel.

720
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:08,333
We'll need our strength to make it to Pejite tomorrow.

721
01:10:32,405 --> 01:10:33,231
All is well, sir.

722
01:10:33,246 --> 01:10:34,469
Fine, fine.

723
01:10:37,076 --> 01:10:38,251
Everything going smoothly?

724
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:38,973
Yes, sir.

725
01:10:39,023 --> 01:10:41,531
The warrior's torso is almost developed.

726
01:11:04,378 --> 01:11:08,121
I swear, the more I gaze at
you, the more attractive you get.

727
01:11:09,038 --> 01:11:13,958
You're awakening long-forgotten ambitions,
even in a lazy old soldier like me.

728
01:11:17,725 --> 01:11:19,804
Oh, is that a smile?

729
01:11:20,122 --> 01:11:23,899
Perhaps you should remain buried
deep beneath the Earth after all.

730
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:25,581
Sir!

731
01:11:26,271 --> 01:11:28,985
Her highness's fleet was
attacked by a survivor from Pejite.

732
01:11:29,106 --> 01:11:31,107
All but one of her ships were destroyed.

733
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,298
What happened to her highness?

734
01:11:34,132 --> 01:11:37,450
According to our reports, her ship exploded in midair.

735
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:40,229
How shall we proceed, sir?

736
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:44,037
Do the villagers know that
their Princess's ship went down?

737
01:11:44,122 --> 01:11:44,527
No, sir.

738
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:45,806
Good. Keep it that way.

739
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:47,911
Continue working as if nothing has changed.

740
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,764
Yes, sir.

741
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:59,641
So, is this lowly soldier finally
on the path to fame and fortune,

742
01:12:00,328 --> 01:12:02,049
or on the path to destruction?

743
01:12:11,064 --> 01:12:13,263
Lord Yupa, Mito and the others are back.

744
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:15,581
They're all waiting for you at the Acid Lake.

745
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:25,099
Down there.

746
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:39,415
We shouldn't have returned without the Princess.

747
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,458
No, I'm glad that all of you are safe.

748
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,661
You're letting me go?

749
01:12:48,105 --> 01:12:53,369
Yes, granted that you drown the Giant Warrior
in the Acid Lake and then return to your Kingdom.

750
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,260
You have very few soldiers left in the valley.

751
01:12:56,299 --> 01:13:00,303
We could easily defeat your forces now,
but I see no point in further killing.

752
01:13:00,816 --> 01:13:03,157
The warrior can't be drowned or destroyed,

753
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:05,936
and until it walks on its own, it can't be moved.

754
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:07,811
Don't you understand?

755
01:13:07,827 --> 01:13:10,205
It's too late. There's no turning back now.

756
01:13:10,746 --> 01:13:16,040
I was ordered to attack Pejite because we feared
another Kingdom would get a hold of the warrior's power.

757
01:13:16,785 --> 01:13:22,156
Once its existence is known, all the remaining
Kingdoms will send their armies here to claim it.

758
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:26,640
You really only have one choice, lord Yupa.

759
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,371
Revive the Giant Warrior.

760
01:13:29,513 --> 01:13:33,620
Use it to repel the invading Kingdoms
and learn to live with the monster.

761
01:13:33,843 --> 01:13:34,320
Look.

762
01:13:38,591 --> 01:13:41,314
Hmm, an insect did that?

763
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:45,284
That's right, and whatever lucky man
becomes my husband will see worse than that.

764
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,540
The insects must be stopped.

765
01:13:47,569 --> 01:13:50,961
You must revive the warrior and use
it to destroy them and their jungle.

766
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,639
<i>Steal it from us as we stole it from petite.</i>

767
01:13:54,655 --> 01:13:55,987
That's what I'd do if I were you.

768
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:02,460
No, we will keep the warrior
dormant as it was meant to be.

769
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:04,231
Lord Yupa!

770
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:05,330
Emergency!

771
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,991
Hey wait! You gotta give us the password.

772
01:14:07,087 --> 01:14:08,127
I'm in a hurry!

773
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:08,805
Wind?

774
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:09,741
Valley!

775
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:10,781
OK.

776
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:12,393
Some of the spores survived!

777
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:13,689
What? In the valley?

778
01:14:14,062 --> 01:14:17,501
They're spreading poison everywhere.
The whole valley's in a panic.

779
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,761
It's poison! See them?

780
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,654
We need to do something.

781
01:14:26,669 --> 01:14:27,366
Don't be foolish.

782
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:29,729
Hurry! Before it's too late!

783
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:33,883
If we don't do something fast,
the whole valley will be destroyed.

784
01:14:33,898 --> 01:14:35,015
The spores spread fast.

785
01:14:35,078 --> 01:14:38,771
If we give them tools to burn the
spores, they could use them against us.

786
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,799
We have no choice. Hand over everything but their guns.

787
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:42,324
Yes, sir.

788
01:14:42,414 --> 01:14:44,071
Sir, the ship is ready to apart.

789
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,754
Try not to fail this time.

790
01:14:46,058 --> 01:14:49,441
Assemble all the Tolmekian soldiers left
in Pejite and bring them to the valley.

791
01:14:49,457 --> 01:14:50,092
Yes, sir.

792
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,579
What a mess. This is starting to look bad already.

793
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:55,089
This way. Come here.

794
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:56,138
Come on! Hurry!

795
01:14:56,169 --> 01:14:57,462
Let's go! Let's go!

796
01:14:59,656 --> 01:15:01,382
Good luck finding the Princess.

797
01:15:01,398 --> 01:15:04,468
Take care of the valley, and don't do anything rash.

798
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:05,174
Yes, sir.

799
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,205
Come on. Let's get back to the valley.

800
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:23,892
Check it!

801
01:15:24,564 --> 01:15:25,545
Oh, no!

802
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:27,841
We're too late.

803
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,859
The spores have infested the entire tree.

804
01:15:30,384 --> 01:15:31,830
This one's infected, too!

805
01:15:32,585 --> 01:15:34,245
This way! Get out of the way!

806
01:15:34,277 --> 01:15:35,690
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

807
01:15:37,397 --> 01:15:39,321
Oh, no. It's everywhere.

808
01:15:41,048 --> 01:15:42,085
Obaba.

809
01:15:43,336 --> 01:15:47,277
This forest is doomed. We must burn it down.

810
01:15:47,769 --> 01:15:52,201
If we hesitate, the Toxic Jungle
will engulf the entire valley.

811
01:15:53,601 --> 01:15:54,897
Isn't there some other way?

812
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:59,178
This forest has protected the valley
from the jungle's poisons for 300 years.

813
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:02,064
If only the Tolmekians had never come.

814
01:16:10,043 --> 01:16:12,384
It looks like things are getting out of control.

815
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:14,250
We better get back there fast.

816
01:16:28,027 --> 01:16:30,496
You think so? Everything looks the same to me.

817
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:35,466
The insects have left the jungle.

818
01:16:38,951 --> 01:16:41,879
What's going on? My heart's pounding like crazy.

819
01:16:42,837 --> 01:16:46,185
Hey, we're almost there! Pejite's just over that mountain.

820
01:17:07,088 --> 01:17:10,072
Something strange is going
on. What's that haze over there?

821
01:17:14,944 --> 01:17:16,434
Asbel, put your mask on!

822
01:17:19,452 --> 01:17:21,437
The insects. They're all dead.

823
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:23,645
We've got to get to Pejite.

824
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,321
Be careful.

825
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:26,354
The Tolmekian army could still be there.

826
01:18:18,953 --> 01:18:19,962
A dead Ohmu.

827
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:22,463
And the capital's been destroyed.

828
01:18:34,332 --> 01:18:35,396
<i>Petite is finished.</i>

829
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:39,040
It was far too much to pay, even if it
did get the Tolmekians out of our city.

830
01:18:39,104 --> 01:18:42,010
"Too much to pay"? Asbel, what are you talking about?

831
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:46,763
An airship.

832
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:49,040
It's one of ours! They're landing. Let's go.

833
01:19:01,719 --> 01:19:04,138
Asbel, you're still alive.

834
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:07,399
What have you done to our city? It's completely destroyed.

835
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,870
Don't worry. We can rebuild it.

836
01:19:09,886 --> 01:19:12,346
And if the jungle starts to
spread here, we'll burn it off.

837
01:19:12,362 --> 01:19:12,711
Asbel.

838
01:19:12,759 --> 01:19:14,944
With what? The Giant Warrior isn't here.

839
01:19:15,234 --> 01:19:17,440
We know. It's in the valley of the wind.

840
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:18,556
How do you know that?

841
01:19:19,568 --> 01:19:22,076
We've already made plans to get it back.

842
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:24,333
Our plan is being executed as we speak.

843
01:19:25,504 --> 01:19:27,622
All Tolmekians in the valley will be dead by now.

844
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:28,238
What?

845
01:19:29,277 --> 01:19:31,106
What are you planning to do with my valley?

846
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,455
Asbel, who is this?

847
01:19:34,755 --> 01:19:36,483
She's the Princess of the valley of the wind,

848
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:38,682
and she saved my life.

849
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:40,312
The valley of the wind?

850
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:42,486
Tell me. What is gonna happen?

851
01:19:46,497 --> 01:19:49,121
Asbel, you know what the plan is. You have to tell me.

852
01:19:51,112 --> 01:19:53,000
We're going to bait insects into the valley.

853
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:56,923
So you lured the insects here into Pejite?

854
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,714
What a monstrous thing to do.

855
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:09,570
We have to get the warrior out of the hands
of the Tolmekians, no matter what it takes.

856
01:20:09,784 --> 01:20:12,272
We're doing this for the good of
the planet. You got to understand.

857
01:20:12,749 --> 01:20:15,234
The good of the planet? You're killing my people!

858
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:19,017
Don't do this. I beg you! Please, please, stop this now!

859
01:20:19,063 --> 01:20:19,921
It's too late.

860
01:20:20,451 --> 01:20:23,059
Once the insects start stampeding, they can't be stopped.

861
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,590
The Tolmekians nearly killed off all our people.

862
01:20:28,655 --> 01:20:29,933
They must be stopped.

863
01:20:30,941 --> 01:20:32,435
We have no other choice.

864
01:20:34,795 --> 01:20:35,501
Stop her!

865
01:20:35,517 --> 01:20:35,993
Stop her!

866
01:20:36,009 --> 01:20:36,628
Grab her!

867
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:40,909
Let me go!

868
01:20:41,377 --> 01:20:43,101
Ah, let me go!

869
01:20:46,584 --> 01:20:49,340
Things may seem bad to you now, Princess,

870
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:52,674
but once we have the warrior, we'll
burn the jungle, and take back the Earth.

871
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:55,558
You savages. You're just as bad as the Tolmekians.

872
01:20:55,622 --> 01:20:58,483
You're wrong. The Tolmekians want to take over the world.

873
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,366
Listen. Every one of us relies on water from the wells,

874
01:21:01,638 --> 01:21:04,314
because mankind has polluted all the lakes and rivers.

875
01:21:04,684 --> 01:21:06,568
But do you know why the well water is pure?

876
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,785
The trees of the wasteland purify it.

877
01:21:08,801 --> 01:21:10,700
And you plan to burn the trees down?

878
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:13,099
You must not burn down the Toxic Jungle.

879
01:21:13,162 --> 01:21:15,959
You should have left the warrior beneath the Earth.

880
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,477
So what should we do?

881
01:21:17,718 --> 01:21:19,924
Surrender and become the slaves of the Tolmekians?

882
01:21:20,012 --> 01:21:21,490
Don't you understand?

883
01:21:21,505 --> 01:21:23,488
Asbel, tell them how the jungle evolved,

884
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:27,064
and how the insects are guarding it
so we won't pollute the world again.

885
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,615
Asbel, please?

886
01:21:31,769 --> 01:21:32,629
What are you doing?

887
01:21:32,645 --> 01:21:33,533
Stay right there.

888
01:21:34,232 --> 01:21:35,719
Let go of the Princess, now!

889
01:21:36,068 --> 01:21:37,181
Calm down, Asbel.

890
01:21:38,531 --> 01:21:39,538
Let her go!

891
01:21:39,946 --> 01:21:40,796
I mean it!

892
01:21:41,456 --> 01:21:43,281
Nausicaa, go back and warn your people.

893
01:21:49,015 --> 01:21:49,874
Asbel!

894
01:21:50,121 --> 01:21:51,161
Let me go!

895
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:24,951
What a bunch of fools.

896
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:31,731
I can't wait to beat the tar out of those Tolmekians.

897
01:22:31,755 --> 01:22:33,900
I thought we said we wouldn't do anything rash.

898
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,759
Don't panic. Rescue the soldiers with the tanks.

899
01:22:36,808 --> 01:22:37,284
Yes, sir.

900
01:22:37,331 --> 01:22:37,674
Sir.

901
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:37,975
Let's go.

902
01:22:37,991 --> 01:22:40,040
The villagers just killed our last soldier on the field.

903
01:22:40,096 --> 01:22:41,319
Are they heading for the castle?

904
01:22:41,547 --> 01:22:42,209
Not yet.

905
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,980
But more of them keep gathering.

906
01:22:44,624 --> 01:22:48,698
All this over a little forest.
They're as annoying as the Pejites.

907
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:49,938
If they just calmed down...

908
01:22:54,482 --> 01:22:54,935
Look out!

909
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:55,363
Huh?

910
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:02,481
They hijacked our tank.

911
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:05,382
Get this thing moving!

912
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:06,772
I'm going. Don't rush me.

913
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:07,733
Fire!

914
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:09,266
Here they come!

915
01:23:09,891 --> 01:23:10,927
Forward!

916
01:23:13,468 --> 01:23:14,781
Come on, come on. Let's go.

917
01:23:14,976 --> 01:23:16,461
Maybe it's this one.

918
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,941
Hey, it's doing something.

919
01:23:19,973 --> 01:23:22,159
Niga, where are you going?

920
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,837
What do you think you're doing?

921
01:23:28,853 --> 01:23:29,691
Go forward!

922
01:23:29,746 --> 01:23:31,335
I know. I know.

923
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:37,292
The tank!

924
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,537
They're getting away! Send out all the tanks!

925
01:23:44,967 --> 01:23:45,732
Your highness.

926
01:23:45,747 --> 01:23:46,366
Attention!

927
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:51,584
She's alive. That dream didn't last long.

928
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,795
Your highness!

929
01:23:58,394 --> 01:23:59,928
We'll hold off the troops.

930
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:03,082
You round up the villagers and
seek shelter by the Acid Lake.

931
01:24:03,098 --> 01:24:04,130
Right. Let's go!

932
01:24:05,025 --> 01:24:05,578
Come on!

933
01:24:06,062 --> 01:24:09,898
We just have to lie low until
the Princess returns in the gunship.

934
01:24:12,688 --> 01:24:13,792
Don't slow down!

935
01:24:13,807 --> 01:24:14,270
Come on.

936
01:24:14,285 --> 01:24:15,092
You can make it!

937
01:24:15,108 --> 01:24:16,033
Keep moving!

938
01:24:16,406 --> 01:24:18,047
Don't just stand there. Give me a hand.

939
01:24:18,063 --> 01:24:19,690
But I have a bad back.

940
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:23,780
Oh, get us out of here! The tanks are coming!

941
01:24:26,759 --> 01:24:28,428
You're turning in circles.

942
01:24:28,718 --> 01:24:29,817
Go forward!

943
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:34,463
We're hit!

944
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:47,054
What do you got, soldier?

945
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:48,458
It's a ship from Pejite.

946
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,278
I caught a glimpse beyond the clouds.

947
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:50,890
Good work.

948
01:25:05,445 --> 01:25:07,242
Be careful. She's a wild one.

949
01:25:14,803 --> 01:25:15,621
Quickly now.

950
01:25:18,384 --> 01:25:20,394
Nausicaa, we're going to get you out of here

951
01:25:20,904 --> 01:25:22,809
so you can warn the people of the valley.

952
01:25:22,907 --> 01:25:25,566
There may still be enough time if you take your glider.

953
01:25:25,807 --> 01:25:27,553
It's ready and waiting for you.

954
01:25:28,728 --> 01:25:31,001
Asbel told me everything that has happened.

955
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,083
I'm going to be taking your place, Princess.

956
01:25:33,305 --> 01:25:33,964
Put this on.

957
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:34,934
But who are you?

958
01:25:35,538 --> 01:25:37,424
I'm Asbel and Lastel's mother.

959
01:25:39,644 --> 01:25:40,896
You're their mother.

960
01:25:42,485 --> 01:25:43,803
Please, forgive us.

961
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,472
What our people did was horribly wrong.

962
01:25:47,869 --> 01:25:48,577
Hurry.

963
01:25:55,597 --> 01:25:56,932
What will happen to her?

964
01:25:57,037 --> 01:25:58,712
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

965
01:26:01,134 --> 01:26:01,739
There she is.

966
01:26:01,754 --> 01:26:03,882
Yes, the Princess.

967
01:26:04,741 --> 01:26:05,878
Please be careful.

968
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,658
And forgive us for the way you've been treated.

969
01:26:08,754 --> 01:26:09,898
Nausicaa, this way.

970
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:10,653
Here.

971
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:11,837
Hurry.

972
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:12,793
Be careful.

973
01:26:12,828 --> 01:26:13,411
Good luck.

974
01:26:14,196 --> 01:26:15,389
Thank you, everyone.

975
01:26:16,891 --> 01:26:17,798
Take care.

976
01:26:18,068 --> 01:26:19,465
I'm sorry it took me so long.

977
01:26:21,878 --> 01:26:23,017
Can you launch from here?

978
01:26:23,758 --> 01:26:24,430
I'll try.

979
01:26:32,967 --> 01:26:34,135
The Tolmekians!

980
01:26:37,064 --> 01:26:39,608
Get us out of here. Head for the clouds!

981
01:26:45,863 --> 01:26:46,678
Cease fire!

982
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:54,502
They'll never survive. It's a
pilot's worst nightmare in those clouds.

983
01:26:59,925 --> 01:27:02,479
This is suicide! I can't steer!

984
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,427
The storm is tearing the ship apart!

985
01:27:12,452 --> 01:27:16,065
It's no use! Our only hope is to
get out of these clouds and fight back!

986
01:27:22,086 --> 01:27:23,646
They expected this.

987
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,952
Look. What are they doing?

988
01:27:34,392 --> 01:27:37,644
Oh, no. They're trying to pin us against
the clouds so they can board our ship.

989
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,187
Open it up!

990
01:27:52,626 --> 01:27:55,223
They're coming in. You got to get out of here now!

991
01:27:55,787 --> 01:27:57,481
I can't just leave you like this.

992
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:00,086
Or your mother, or the girl who took my place in the cell.

993
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:01,801
You need all the help you can get!

994
01:28:02,001 --> 01:28:04,629
You have to save the people of the valley. Please.

995
01:28:04,758 --> 01:28:07,010
Go, or my people will never forgive themselves.

996
01:28:11,512 --> 01:28:12,592
Go, go, go!

997
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,493
Take the ship. I want every Pejite dead. Now.

998
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:28,995
Go, Nausicaa, go!

999
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:30,384
Asbel!

1000
01:29:28,916 --> 01:29:30,198
There's the Princess!

1001
01:29:31,688 --> 01:29:32,682
Mito!

1002
01:29:40,557 --> 01:29:41,459
Ha-ha!

1003
01:29:47,723 --> 01:29:50,344
Mito, lord Yupa, the valley's in danger.

1004
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,043
Princess!

1005
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:54,077
Hurry! Hurry! Please!

1006
01:29:54,245 --> 01:29:56,198
I'll send out the docking hook now.

1007
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:58,862
Lord Yupa, pull the red lever on your right.

1008
01:30:04,555 --> 01:30:07,164
Why is this taking so long? Knock it down.

1009
01:30:12,691 --> 01:30:14,830
This door's gonna bust any second now.

1010
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:16,514
Fine. Let them break it down.

1011
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,864
We must fight them with honor and with dignity.

1012
01:30:21,002 --> 01:30:22,067
What's behind us?

1013
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:23,393
A bird?

1014
01:30:24,806 --> 01:30:26,914
Look! A gunship from the valley of the wind!

1015
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:27,319
What?

1016
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:36,872
Get him!

1017
01:30:45,435 --> 01:30:48,234
It's lord Yupa. Kill him, and you'll be famous.

1018
01:30:56,176 --> 01:30:59,401
I suggest you surrender. There's
no ship coming to rescue you.

1019
01:30:59,726 --> 01:31:00,829
This guy's tough.

1020
01:31:05,695 --> 01:31:09,073
This is way too fast! The engine's gonna burn out!

1021
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:12,468
I don't care, as long as it holds
out until we get to the valley.

1022
01:31:12,696 --> 01:31:13,780
Increase speed!

1023
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,829
Please, dear god, please hear this prayer.

1024
01:31:16,852 --> 01:31:18,695
You must protect the people of the valley.

1025
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:36,339
I don't like waiting.

1026
01:31:36,902 --> 01:31:37,935
Check your weapons.

1027
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,253
Well, this is dull. Are they ever going to budge?

1028
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,143
They're waiting for their Princess.

1029
01:31:43,222 --> 01:31:44,008
The Princess?

1030
01:31:44,264 --> 01:31:47,242
They expect her to come back here
and rescue them with their gunship.

1031
01:31:47,481 --> 01:31:49,665
That gunship could be a real pain in the neck.

1032
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:51,793
Should we start a fight now and avoid the mess?

1033
01:31:51,857 --> 01:31:54,400
Do you know anything about
that old ship they're hiding in?

1034
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:57,030
I've heard it was built before the seven days of fire.

1035
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:58,071
I don't know if it's true.

1036
01:31:58,094 --> 01:32:00,882
But it's supposed to have traveled
everywhere, even to the stars.

1037
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:05,735
They say guns can't penetrate its armor,
but I bet if you hit it just right...

1038
01:32:05,751 --> 01:32:07,493
No, we'll wait for the Princess.

1039
01:32:07,524 --> 01:32:07,905
What?

1040
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:12,019
I want to see if she can make it back
alive from the middle of the jungle.

1041
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:16,262
If she's not dead, I'd like a chance to get to know her.

1042
01:32:20,186 --> 01:32:22,338
So, men, have you made up your minds yet?

1043
01:32:22,836 --> 01:32:25,615
If you advise the villagers to surrender, I'll let you go.

1044
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:28,742
Or would you rather end up like Pejite?

1045
01:32:30,173 --> 01:32:32,382
It's strange that you're a Princess, too.

1046
01:32:32,645 --> 01:32:35,273
You're not anything at all like our Princess.

1047
01:32:35,872 --> 01:32:37,824
Ah, take a look at my hands.

1048
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,561
I have the same illness as King Jihl.

1049
01:32:40,934 --> 01:32:44,111
Six months from now, my hands will be as hard as rocks.

1050
01:32:44,795 --> 01:32:49,545
But our Princess told me that she truly
loves these beat-up old hands of mine.

1051
01:32:50,876 --> 01:32:54,684
When she looks at these hands, she
knows these are the hands of a hard worker.

1052
01:32:54,994 --> 01:32:57,747
How can you be so foolish? The jungle is killing you,

1053
01:32:57,846 --> 01:32:59,611
yet you want to live in harmony with it?

1054
01:33:00,222 --> 01:33:01,973
You plan to burn down the jungle,

1055
01:33:02,184 --> 01:33:05,103
but we've learned to use fire only in small amounts.

1056
01:33:05,171 --> 01:33:08,137
That's right. Too much fire gives birth to nothing.

1057
01:33:08,705 --> 01:33:11,394
Fire can reduce a forest to ashes in a day,

1058
01:33:11,683 --> 01:33:15,461
while it takes the water and the
wind 100 years to grow one anew.

1059
01:33:15,697 --> 01:33:18,435
We prefer the ways of the water and the wind.

1060
01:33:18,524 --> 01:33:22,381
The Princess will be devastated
when she sees that our forest is gone.

1061
01:33:24,408 --> 01:33:26,600
Sir. Do we have any orders yet, sir?

1062
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,093
Just shut up.

1063
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:29,005
Yes, sir.

1064
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:36,736
Something must have happened,
she's starting to look cute to me.

1065
01:33:36,855 --> 01:33:39,681
Kurotowa, prepare the troops to attack.

1066
01:33:39,937 --> 01:33:42,336
What? We're not going to wait?

1067
01:33:42,455 --> 01:33:44,235
We'll begin the attack in one hour,

1068
01:33:44,305 --> 01:33:46,149
so get the troops fed and ready to go.

1069
01:33:49,268 --> 01:33:52,558
Ah, yes, food. Plenty of time for a leisurely meal.

1070
01:33:53,257 --> 01:33:54,185
Someone's coming.

1071
01:34:01,723 --> 01:34:03,013
Gol, what's wrong?

1072
01:34:04,047 --> 01:34:05,363
The wind has died.

1073
01:34:05,378 --> 01:34:06,498
There's no wind?

1074
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:10,811
I don't believe it. It's never stopped before.

1075
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:12,474
Ahhh!

1076
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:14,016
Obaba, what's the matter?

1077
01:34:14,059 --> 01:34:15,268
Are you OK?

1078
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:18,132
Someone... someone, take me outside.

1079
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:20,020
Something is very wrong.

1080
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:28,491
The wind has stopped blowing.

1081
01:34:43,169 --> 01:34:45,637
Obaba, what's making my ears hurt?

1082
01:34:45,739 --> 01:34:47,041
It's in the air.

1083
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:49,805
The atmosphere is saturated with anger.

1084
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:07,019
We're close.

1085
01:35:07,191 --> 01:35:10,339
We've cleared the jungle. Three minutes to the Acid Lake.

1086
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:13,412
Idle the engines. Drop beneath the clouds.

1087
01:35:22,177 --> 01:35:24,507
Princess, what's that red glow?

1088
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,031
Ohmul!

1089
01:35:45,015 --> 01:35:46,016
Look at them all.

1090
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,769
Every Ohmu in the jungle is
headed straight for the valley.

1091
01:35:49,086 --> 01:35:50,924
What's making them stampede like that?

1092
01:35:57,766 --> 01:35:59,780
Something out there is calling to the herd.

1093
01:36:00,048 --> 01:36:02,556
Mito, pull the ship up to the left.

1094
01:36:02,731 --> 01:36:03,409
Roger.

1095
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:34,371
What's that? Mito, send out a flare.

1096
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:35,892
Ready?

1097
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,167
Fire!

1098
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:45,556
What the heck is that?

1099
01:36:57,154 --> 01:36:58,791
No, they've got a baby Ohmu.

1100
01:36:58,866 --> 01:37:01,729
They're using the baby to lure the herd into the valley.

1101
01:37:02,304 --> 01:37:04,034
I'll blast them out of the sky.

1102
01:37:04,049 --> 01:37:04,692
No!

1103
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:09,379
Don't shoot, Mito! Don't shoot!

1104
01:37:14,249 --> 01:37:15,663
What do you mean?

1105
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,932
If we kill the baby Ohmu, there'll
be no way to stop the stampede.

1106
01:37:19,019 --> 01:37:22,629
What are we supposed to do? I
can't watch our valley be destroyed.

1107
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:23,931
Don't worry, Mito.

1108
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:26,466
I'll get the baby Ohmu back to the herd. Just trust me.

1109
01:37:34,783 --> 01:37:36,269
Hey, what are you doing?

1110
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:38,016
Go warn the valley!

1111
01:37:39,397 --> 01:37:41,949
But, Princess, you don't even have a weapon.

1112
01:37:53,984 --> 01:37:56,074
That flare is not one of ours, your highness.

1113
01:37:56,113 --> 01:37:56,868
What's the range?

1114
01:37:56,883 --> 01:37:58,398
Approximately 20 leagues.

1115
01:37:58,414 --> 01:37:59,791
Just the other side of the lake.

1116
01:38:00,061 --> 01:38:01,574
Is it the Princess's gunship?

1117
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:02,693
Most likely.

1118
01:38:06,178 --> 01:38:06,900
It's a flare.

1119
01:38:10,754 --> 01:38:14,027
Yes, that's their distress
signal. It's the gunship, all right.

1120
01:38:14,672 --> 01:38:16,672
Hour's up, Kurotowa. Let's go.

1121
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:17,929
Sure you don't want to wait?

1122
01:38:18,206 --> 01:38:20,096
No, I have chosen the bloody path.

1123
01:38:27,097 --> 01:38:28,920
Infantry, move out!

1124
01:38:33,982 --> 01:38:35,004
Won't you go in?

1125
01:38:35,329 --> 01:38:36,488
I'm staying right here.

1126
01:38:44,505 --> 01:38:45,221
Gunship!

1127
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:49,096
Fire!

1128
01:38:58,965 --> 01:39:01,856
Hold your fire! You idiot, stop it!

1129
01:39:05,265 --> 01:39:06,402
It's the Princess's gunship!

1130
01:39:06,495 --> 01:39:07,116
Princess!

1131
01:39:07,657 --> 01:39:10,372
Wait for my orders. Hold your fire!

1132
01:39:10,637 --> 01:39:11,541
Your highness!

1133
01:39:16,152 --> 01:39:17,233
What happened to the Princess?

1134
01:39:17,248 --> 01:39:18,071
Where is she?

1135
01:39:18,098 --> 01:39:19,743
Shouldn't she be in the back seat?

1136
01:39:19,948 --> 01:39:22,547
Listen up. A herd of Ohmu was coming this way.

1137
01:39:22,769 --> 01:39:23,603
They're what?

1138
01:39:23,618 --> 01:39:24,589
The Ohmu?

1139
01:39:24,803 --> 01:39:28,425
The Princess stayed to try to stop
the stampede from reaching the valley.

1140
01:39:28,761 --> 01:39:30,269
This is no time for a battle.

1141
01:39:31,107 --> 01:39:33,303
Everybody, get to high ground. Hurry!

1142
01:39:34,447 --> 01:39:34,844
The Ohmul!

1143
01:39:34,859 --> 01:39:35,574
Come on!

1144
01:39:37,801 --> 01:39:40,706
Obaba, I see a red glow in the distance.

1145
01:39:43,234 --> 01:39:44,916
It keeps getting bigger.

1146
01:39:45,201 --> 01:39:46,640
It's coming this way.

1147
01:39:47,037 --> 01:39:49,713
Just hold on tight to Obaba, children.

1148
01:39:50,438 --> 01:39:53,918
The Ohmu will come. There's nothing we can do about it.

1149
01:39:54,085 --> 01:39:54,935
Quickly!

1150
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,525
Don't panic. Just keep moving forward.

1151
01:39:58,732 --> 01:39:59,520
There's still time.

1152
01:40:00,011 --> 01:40:02,394
But, Mito, we're going to die anyway.

1153
01:40:02,593 --> 01:40:04,149
We should die in the valley.

1154
01:40:04,236 --> 01:40:04,721
No.

1155
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,956
As long as the Princess hasn't given up, we can't, either.

1156
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,755
Hold the Ohmu off for as long as possible.

1157
01:40:11,053 --> 01:40:12,173
I'll be back with help.

1158
01:40:12,732 --> 01:40:14,454
Your highness, don't do it!

1159
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,233
It's not ready yet.

1160
01:40:16,264 --> 01:40:18,202
If not now, Kurotowa, then when?

1161
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:19,465
Move out!

1162
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:27,729
Don't shoot! Listen to me, please!

1163
01:40:41,186 --> 01:40:42,984
She flies like the wind!

1164
01:40:43,339 --> 01:40:46,256
She's trying to tell us something. We shouldn't shoot her.

1165
01:40:46,423 --> 01:40:49,110
Anyone who interferes with the plan is an enemy.

1166
01:40:49,301 --> 01:40:52,113
Besides, if we don't release
this baby Ohmu in the valley soon,

1167
01:40:52,207 --> 01:40:53,645
we'll be the ones in trouble.

1168
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:58,943
Here she comes. Wait till she gets close, and then fire.

1169
01:41:12,188 --> 01:41:13,733
She's in range. Shoot her!

1170
01:41:13,748 --> 01:41:14,648
I can't.

1171
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,130
It's Lastel.

1172
01:42:04,633 --> 01:42:05,276
Ohmu...

1173
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:35,610
I'm not gonna hurt you. Don't be frightened.

1174
01:42:35,677 --> 01:42:37,055
I'm not your enemy.

1175
01:42:40,789 --> 01:42:42,433
I'm so sorry.

1176
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,618
Is there any way you can forgive us?

1177
01:42:45,634 --> 01:42:47,994
We've treated you so badly.

1178
01:42:56,976 --> 01:42:59,502
No, don't move. You'll bleed to death.

1179
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:03,251
Come on. Be a good boy. Hold still.

1180
01:43:13,035 --> 01:43:14,559
Oh, no! They've found us!

1181
01:43:15,153 --> 01:43:16,448
They're coming this way!

1182
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:20,458
No, you can't go in this lake with wounds like that!

1183
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:23,495
This water's bad! It's filled with acid!

1184
01:43:57,376 --> 01:43:58,329
Ohmu?

1185
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,014
You're so kind. It's gonna be all right.

1186
01:44:30,263 --> 01:44:32,230
Soon they'll be here to take you home.

1187
01:44:38,871 --> 01:44:41,618
Where are they going? How can they be turning away?

1188
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:46,152
Ohmu, not that way! You're headed straight for the valley!

1189
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:51,877
They must be blind with rage.

1190
01:44:52,132 --> 01:44:53,726
If I can't find a way to calm them...

1191
01:45:08,154 --> 01:45:09,136
Those idiots!

1192
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,760
They're drawing the Ohmu with their fire.

1193
01:45:11,347 --> 01:45:12,428
We're gonna live.

1194
01:45:12,506 --> 01:45:13,753
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1195
01:45:13,994 --> 01:45:15,110
Help me tip this over.

1196
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:17,240
Wait!

1197
01:45:17,865 --> 01:45:20,534
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1198
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:22,468
You're gonna fly me back to the herd,

1199
01:45:22,685 --> 01:45:24,693
and we're gonna give their baby back to them.

1200
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:26,973
There's no reason to pull a stunt like that.

1201
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:28,777
It's too late. The herd won't stop.

1202
01:45:31,716 --> 01:45:34,322
You'll take us there and set us down in front of the herd.

1203
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:35,712
Now, let's get going.

1204
01:45:36,561 --> 01:45:38,082
But there's no way you'll survive.

1205
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:40,963
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1206
01:45:46,935 --> 01:45:49,226
Obaba, are we all going to die?

1207
01:45:49,967 --> 01:45:53,679
If that is to be our fate, we can only wait and see.

1208
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:55,369
They don't even flinch.

1209
01:45:55,384 --> 01:45:56,521
I think we should retreat, sir.

1210
01:45:56,537 --> 01:45:59,238
Don't be stupid, soldier. There's nowhere to retreat to.

1211
01:46:01,789 --> 01:46:03,132
Let us get off here.

1212
01:46:03,493 --> 01:46:05,025
Hey, hold your position!

1213
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,408
Wait! Hold it!

1214
01:46:06,582 --> 01:46:08,888
Stand your ground until her highness returns.

1215
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:11,729
Where is she? Your highness!

1216
01:46:34,517 --> 01:46:35,788
The Giant Warrior!

1217
01:46:36,423 --> 01:46:37,179
It's him!

1218
01:46:38,086 --> 01:46:39,181
It's the warrior!

1219
01:46:42,064 --> 01:46:43,248
Now we got 'em!

1220
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:46,179
It's the Giant Warrior!

1221
01:46:58,732 --> 01:47:01,134
It's falling apart. I knew it was too soon.

1222
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:11,800
Incinerate them! What are you waiting for?

1223
01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:15,803
Were you not designed to be the most
evil creature on the face of the Earth?

1224
01:47:31,992 --> 01:47:35,280
Amazing. No wonder the world was incinerated.

1225
01:47:36,527 --> 01:47:38,418
Hail to Kushana!

1226
01:47:49,816 --> 01:47:50,745
Hit them again!

1227
01:47:51,744 --> 01:47:54,539
Listen to me, warrior. Fire on my command!

1228
01:48:17,372 --> 01:48:17,804
Run!

1229
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:23,219
It's dead!

1230
01:48:23,782 --> 01:48:24,505
No!

1231
01:48:25,801 --> 01:48:26,674
We're doomed!

1232
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:27,389
Oh, no!

1233
01:48:27,404 --> 01:48:28,071
Run!

1234
01:48:33,066 --> 01:48:34,839
The Giant Warrior died.

1235
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:36,912
That's the way it should be.

1236
01:48:37,153 --> 01:48:40,687
The anger of the Ohmu reflects the anger of the Earth.

1237
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,127
The Earth knows it's wrong for us to survive

1238
01:48:45,396 --> 01:48:48,598
if we have to depend on a monster like that.

1239
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:49,821
It's the Princess!

1240
01:48:49,836 --> 01:48:51,393
The Princess is back!

1241
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:02,107
Princess!

1242
01:49:02,122 --> 01:49:03,194
What is she doing?

1243
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,678
She'll be killed!

1244
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:18,804
Look, the color's changing. Their rage is subsiding.

1245
01:50:40,622 --> 01:50:43,223
The rage. It's left the atmosphere.

1246
01:50:44,625 --> 01:50:47,567
We're OK. The Ohmu have stopped running.

1247
01:51:04,916 --> 01:51:06,446
There's the Princess!

1248
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:16,365
She's dead, Obaba. She's dead.

1249
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:21,472
The Princess has quieted the rage of the Ohmu.

1250
01:51:22,222 --> 01:51:25,054
She gave her life to save the valley.

1251
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:27,135
Look! Over there!

1252
01:52:32,273 --> 01:52:34,489
What is this? What are these lights?

1253
01:53:01,048 --> 01:53:01,694
Teto.

1254
01:53:18,282 --> 01:53:19,522
I'm glad you're OK.

1255
01:53:20,134 --> 01:53:22,008
Ohmu, thank you.

1256
01:53:22,911 --> 01:53:23,612
Thank you!

1257
01:53:44,506 --> 01:53:45,741
It's a miracle!

1258
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:47,734
What beautiful creatures!

1259
01:53:48,673 --> 01:53:53,010
Who knew how wonderful and caring the Ohmu could be?

1260
01:53:54,604 --> 01:53:55,385
Children!

1261
01:53:55,847 --> 01:53:59,701
Look carefully and tell me
what these blind eyes cannot see.

1262
01:54:00,175 --> 01:54:03,791
The Princess is wearing a blue
dress I've never seen before.

1263
01:54:04,977 --> 01:54:07,947
It looks like she's walking through a Golden field.

1264
01:54:17,066 --> 01:54:19,452
After a thousand years of darkness,

1265
01:54:19,566 --> 01:54:23,631
he will come, clad in blue and
surrounded by fields of Gold!

1266
01:54:25,761 --> 01:54:26,993
What's the matter?

1267
01:54:27,569 --> 01:54:29,986
The legend has come true!

1268
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:33,125
Look there!

1269
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:35,783
The glider!

1270
01:54:36,085 --> 01:54:37,003
There's wind!

1271
01:54:37,234 --> 01:54:38,830
The wind has come back!
