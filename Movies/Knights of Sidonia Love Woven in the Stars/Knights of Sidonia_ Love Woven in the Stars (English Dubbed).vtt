we came out here
in the first place.

Our aim is to
colonize Planet Seven.

Uh. Come again?

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:33.272 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's even capable of

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:34.839 position:38% line:89% align:start
That one?

00:10:34.972 --> 00:10:36.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I thought its existence
was entirely theoretical.

00:10:36.972 --> 00:10:38.638 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SASAKI] We built it using
the data left behind

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.239 position:16% line:89% align:start
by the scientist Ochiai.

00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:46.606 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SASAKI] That's right.
We managed to get

00:10:46.739 --> 00:10:49.006 position:16% line:83% align:start
the thing built, anyway,
but there are still

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
some major problems.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:53.773 position:19% line:83% align:start
Particularly the energy
it consumes.

00:10:53.906 --> 00:10:57.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TSURUUCHI] So to fire one shot,
you need tens, hundreds,

00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:59.407 position:13% line:89% align:start
thousands, ten thousands--

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.841 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah! Agh! You're kidding me!

00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:03.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
That is the problem
we're facing:

00:11:04.074 --> 00:11:06.074 position:19% line:89% align:start
Our current technology.

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.208 position:41% line:83% align:start
[IZANA]
Okay, so, how can we do this?

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.473 position:27% line:83% align:start
Where can we get
that much energy?

00:11:10.607 --> 00:11:12.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
[YURE] We'll collect it
from the star Lem.

00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:15.374 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'll place the Stellar Energy
Collectors near it

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
and they'll absorb
the star's energy.

00:11:17.741 --> 00:11:20.008 position:24% line:83% align:start
After about a year,
they'll be full.

00:11:20.142 --> 00:11:24.341 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's great! We can shoot it
as many times as we want!

00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:27.209 position:7% line:83% align:start
What's the risk? That the Gauna
will find it somehow?

00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:29.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
[YURE] The risk is low,
because the system uses

00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:30.875 position:21% line:89% align:start
no Heigus particles.

00:11:31.008 --> 00:11:34.809 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right. Gauna respond to
Heigus particles and Kabi.

00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:37.210 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah. So what you're saying is,

00:11:37.342 --> 00:11:38.943 position:30% line:83% align:start
it's virtually
invisible to them?

00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:41.909 position:27% line:83% align:start
But... due to its
simple construction,

00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:44.676 position:24% line:83% align:start
all it's able to do
is gather energy.

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:47.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'll need a separate system
to complete the second phase

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.977 position:27% line:83% align:start
of the operation,
actually sending the energy

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.443 position:27% line:89% align:start
to the emitters.

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.311 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YURE] For that,
we'll deploy a network

00:11:53.443 --> 00:11:55.476 position:13% line:89% align:start
of transmitters and relays.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.510 position:10% line:83% align:start
[EN] Oh, so they're probably
going to find it anyway.

00:11:58.643 --> 00:12:00.010 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's unfortunate.

00:12:00.144 --> 00:12:02.311 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll wait to deploy
the transmitters till after

00:12:02.443 --> 00:12:04.110 position:13% line:89% align:start
the energy's amply charged,

00:12:04.244 --> 00:12:08.611 position:16% line:83% align:start
before we fire, and in an
extremely narrow time span.

[KOBAYASHI]
Which brings me to this:

00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:12.312 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:51.288 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can't allow anything
to threaten Sidonia.

00:42:51.422 --> 00:42:52.487 position:21% line:89% align:start
So the answer's yes.

00:42:52.621 --> 00:42:54.088 position:27% line:89% align:start

Midorikawa, Ochiai--

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.957 position:19% line:83% align:start
No. The Hybrid Kanata,
what do we know about it?

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:17.424 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not much.

00:43:17.556 --> 00:43:20.690 position:13% line:83% align:start
We don't know where it is,
but it seems to have left Lem.

00:43:20.823 --> 00:43:22.690 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmph. Makes sense.

00:43:22.823 --> 00:43:25.589 position:10% line:83% align:start
It'll take some time for him
to fully recover his Ena.

00:43:25.723 --> 00:43:27.756 position:13% line:83% align:start
He probably wanted to avoid
the risk of running into

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:29.358 position:19% line:89% align:start
the Gauna before then.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.891 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA]

00:43:36.457 --> 00:43:40.724 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA]
Um, it's about Ochiai.

00:43:41.857 --> 00:43:45.892 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's supposed to be dead.
Why is he alive?

00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:49.426 position:24% line:83% align:start

a sensitive question.

The Immortal Council?

00:44:04.492 --> 00:44:07.826 position:13% line:83% align:start
The highest governing body
on Sidonia, all immortals.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, you mean, it wasn't
an urban legend, after all?

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.093 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can't keep it secret
anymore, Kobayashi.

00:44:14.226 --> 00:44:17.492 position:7% line:83% align:start
At the very least, she, of all
people, should know the truth.

[gasps]

The material is able
to pierce a Gauna core.

00:44:30.061 --> 00:44:32.994 position:16% line:83% align:start
And are you aware how it
was discovered? The Kabi.

00:44:33.127 --> 00:44:36.895 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes, I am. Six centuries ago,
the Sidonia encountered

00:44:37.028 --> 00:44:39.128 position:13% line:89% align:start
a mysterious ruin in space,

00:44:39.262 --> 00:44:41.561 position:33% line:83% align:start
where it was
discovered by chance.

00:44:41.695 --> 00:44:43.795 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your account is correct,
and we were the ones

00:44:43.928 --> 00:44:45.329 position:19% line:89% align:start
who investigated that.

00:44:45.461 --> 00:44:46.962 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:44:47.095 --> 00:44:48.962 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIYAMA]
It was a special space,

00:44:49.095 --> 00:44:51.329 position:27% line:83% align:start
one that cut off
Heigus particles.

00:44:51.461 --> 00:44:55.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
And when we delved into it,
we found the Gauna there.

00:44:55.495 --> 00:44:56.796 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SUZUKI]
Gauna!

00:44:56.929 --> 00:44:59.363 position:38% line:89% align:start

Ochiai, give
the order to retreat!

00:45:06.063 --> 00:45:08.762 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIYAMA] We didn't have an
adequate way of fighting back.

00:45:08.897 --> 00:45:11.563 position:27% line:83% align:start
We had no choice
but to go farther in.

00:45:11.697 --> 00:45:13.563 position:30% line:83% align:start
In that space,
with nowhere to run,

00:45:13.697 --> 00:45:16.364 position:10% line:89% align:start
we saw it for the first time.

00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:20.431 position:10% line:83% align:start
We discovered the one way to
defeat the Gauna--the Kabi--

00:45:20.596 --> 00:45:22.030 position:21% line:89% align:start
and we became heroes.

00:45:22.164 --> 00:45:25.698 position:19% line:83% align:start
The first in Sidonia's
history to defeat them.

00:45:27.764 --> 00:45:29.131 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIYAMA]
And so...

00:45:29.265 --> 00:45:32.597 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's where the research
into immortality began.

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:35.398 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:45:35.531 --> 00:45:37.198 position:30% line:83% align:start
And when Ochiai
dedicated himself to

00:45:37.332 --> 00:45:39.831 position:19% line:83% align:start
researching the Gauna,
he came to believe

00:45:39.965 --> 00:45:43.199 position:13% line:83% align:start
that they might possibly be
the ultimate life form.

00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:45.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why... he wanted
to attempt to fuse

00:45:45.799 --> 00:45:47.232 position:27% line:89% align:start
human with Gauna.

00:45:47.366 --> 00:45:51.465 position:7% line:83% align:start
And so, you see, Ochiai became
obsessed with the Gauna.

00:45:51.598 --> 00:45:53.433 position:19% line:89% align:start
And then a century ago,

00:45:53.598 --> 00:45:58.333 position:13% line:83% align:start
when he created the Hybrid,
he parted ways with the Sidonia.

00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:02.900 position:16% line:83% align:start
He ejected the Kabizashi,
and allowed the Gauna inside,

00:46:03.033 --> 00:46:06.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was the event that
instigated the 4th Gauna War.

00:46:06.533 --> 00:46:08.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you already knew that much.

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:11.800 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tell it all! He only did that
because he wanted to prove

00:46:11.933 --> 00:46:14.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
that the Gauna
were after the Kabi!

00:46:14.434 --> 00:46:17.201 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA] In fact, the Gauna
are drawn not just by Kabi,

00:46:17.335 --> 00:46:20.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
but by anything that uses
the Heigus particles.

00:46:20.234 --> 00:46:22.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why the Sidonia
was in danger.

00:46:22.435 --> 00:46:25.201 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI] We captured Ochiai
and took his research data,

00:46:25.335 --> 00:46:29.068 position:7% line:83% align:start
locking them both securely away
beneath Kunato Developments.

00:46:29.201 --> 00:46:33.668 position:16% line:83% align:start
But now, he has rebelled
against us again.

00:46:33.802 --> 00:46:37.069 position:24% line:83% align:start
The blood worm that
we found inside Kunato...

00:46:37.202 --> 00:46:40.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
...was used as a way for
Ochiai to take over his body.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.314 position:21% line:83% align:start
She was on your team,
along with you and Tanikaze.

00:59:10.447 --> 00:59:14.947 position:19% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Sorry, I never
realized she had a brother.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.680 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TOUTAROU] I was still
very young when she died,

00:59:16.813 --> 00:59:19.415 position:21% line:89% align:start
so that makes sense.

00:59:19.547 --> 00:59:20.981 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KUNATO]
Hmm.

00:59:21.115 --> 00:59:24.647 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have any idea
how long it's been since then?

00:59:24.781 --> 00:59:26.248 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOY A]
Ha, ha!

00:59:26.382 --> 00:59:29.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
How's it feel to know
your sister's a Gauna?

00:59:29.348 --> 00:59:33.148 position:19% line:83% align:start
[BOY B] Here's an idea:
throw yourself in the reactor!

00:59:33.281 --> 00:59:35.382 position:24% line:89% align:start
[TOUTAROU sniffing]

00:59:35.515 --> 00:59:37.016 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sister...

00:59:37.149 --> 00:59:39.049 position:10% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR O] The Suppression
Force--they've gone down!

00:59:39.182 --> 00:59:40.249 position:33% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR P]
The Gauna have breached

00:59:40.383 --> 00:59:42.915 position:16% line:89% align:start
our last line of defense!

00:59:45.016 --> 00:59:49.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
I see... It still feels
like it was yesterday.

00:59:49.982 --> 00:59:53.283 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TOUTAROU] I asked them if they
would let you join my team.

00:59:53.417 --> 00:59:54.716 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm honored.

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:57.117 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KUNATO]
I look forward to it.

01:00:02.217 --> 01:00:04.983 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TANBA] We only have 60 hours
left to get this thing running!

01:00:05.117 --> 01:00:07.816 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, you there!
That's enough slacking off!

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:10.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Large Gauna Cluster
is getting closer,

01:00:10.517 --> 01:00:12.784 position:13% line:89% align:start
but I think we'll make it.

01:00:19.118 --> 01:00:22.184 position:10% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR Q] The Large Gauna
Cluster has passed Planet Eight.

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:25.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
It should reach us in
approximately 240 hours.

01:00:26.085 --> 01:00:27.818 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA]
If the Yukimori gets built,

01:00:27.952 --> 01:00:29.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
we can fire the Graviton
Radiation Emitter

01:00:29.885 --> 01:00:32.252 position:16% line:89% align:start
before the enemy arrives.

01:00:32.386 --> 01:00:34.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
All that's left now is
finding the primary core.

--[beeping]

01:00:36.185 --> 01:00:38.185 position:10% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR Q] The Large Gauna
Cluster is moving.

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:40.119 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's sending Gauna to Lem!

01:00:40.252 --> 01:00:41.752 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA]
They can't be...

01:00:41.885 --> 01:00:44.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR Q] A large number of
Gauna Pods are heading for Lem!

01:00:44.453 --> 01:00:47.286 position:13% line:83% align:start
[gasps] They must be coming
after the collectors!

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:49.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR R] At their
current rate of speed...

01:00:49.353 --> 01:00:52.353 position:10% line:83% align:start
...they're on track to reach
Lem within 48 hours!

01:00:52.487 --> 01:00:53.686 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA]
How'd this happen?

01:00:53.819 --> 01:00:55.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did they analyze
the brain of the pilot

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:58.719 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Intelligent-Type
Gauna devoured...

01:00:58.854 --> 01:01:00.987 position:13% line:89% align:start
...and discover our plans?

01:01:01.121 --> 01:01:03.454 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI] Midorikawa, form
a Suppression Force comprised

01:01:03.587 --> 01:01:09.321 position:7% line:83% align:start
of all Mizuki's and Series 19s
and launch at once.

01:01:09.454 --> 01:01:11.121 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am!

01:01:15.621 --> 01:01:17.489 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA] This is
XO Midorikawa to all ships

01:01:17.621 --> 01:01:19.355 position:21% line:89% align:start
in the Mizuki fleet.

01:01:19.489 --> 01:01:22.955 position:7% line:83% align:start
We're heading to Lem to defend
the stellar energy collectors

01:01:23.088 --> 01:01:26.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
against a suspected
Gauna attack.

01:01:27.055 --> 01:01:29.022 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is it okay to send
this many ships?

01:01:29.155 --> 01:01:31.088 position:21% line:83% align:start
With the Large Gauna
Cluster being so close?

01:01:31.222 --> 01:01:33.956 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we lose the collectors,
we'll lose anyway.

01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:36.689 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I thought they weren't
going to attack them.

01:01:36.822 --> 01:01:39.822 position:13% line:89% align:start
I mean... It is the Gauna.

01:01:39.956 --> 01:01:41.223 position:10% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR T] The Suppression
Force has completed

01:01:41.356 --> 01:01:42.456 position:16% line:89% align:start
their nine-ship linkage.

01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:44.223 position:47% line:89% align:start

Tsumugi...

01:01:54.257 --> 01:01:57.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TANBA] Wait! You want it
done in two days?!

01:01:57.723 --> 01:01:59.457 position:24% line:89% align:start
It isn't that easy!

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.157 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SASAKI]
We have to.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
Our top priority is tuning up
the rear propulsion system.

01:02:28.859 --> 01:02:30.692 position:35% line:83% align:start

I want to talk to you.

01:02:30.825 --> 01:02:32.925 position:19% line:89% align:start
Have you got a moment?

01:02:38.359 --> 01:02:40.027 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.826 position:35% line:89% align:start
Captain...?

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.060 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI] Hmm. I'm not even
sure where to start.

01:02:46.193 --> 01:02:48.427 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was so long ago.

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:50.826 position:30% line:83% align:start
I do know that
I was in my teens,

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.826 position:16% line:83% align:start
so, I guess that means it
was about 700 years ago.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.594 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Seven hundred years?!

01:02:56.727 --> 01:03:02.194 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, I guess it has
been quite a long time.

01:03:03.894 --> 01:03:06.894 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI] Back then,
I was just a girl who decided

01:03:07.028 --> 01:03:09.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
she wanted to be a pilot,
because of this pilot

01:03:09.727 --> 01:03:12.195 position:30% line:89% align:start
I looked up to.

01:03:12.329 --> 01:03:13.762 position:24% line:89% align:start
They were the best.

01:03:13.895 --> 01:03:16.496 position:30% line:83% align:start
A better pilot
than anyone around.

01:03:16.628 --> 01:03:19.962 position:10% line:83% align:start
They'd even managed to defeat
a Gauna, back when the Gardes

01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:22.561 position:19% line:83% align:start
were far less powerful
than they are now,

01:03:22.695 --> 01:03:24.995 position:13% line:89% align:start
and there weren't any Kabi.

01:03:25.129 --> 01:03:29.096 position:19% line:83% align:start
A true genius, head and
shoulders above the rest.

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:31.796 position:10% line:83% align:start
There was even a plan to take
his personality and memories

01:03:31.929 --> 01:03:34.562 position:10% line:89% align:start
and copy them for posterity.

01:03:34.696 --> 01:03:38.829 position:5% line:89% align:start
That pilot... was Hiroki Saito.

01:03:38.963 --> 01:03:40.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
The one who raised
you underground.

01:03:41.063 --> 01:03:45.196 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Wait. My grandfather?

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.964 position:5% line:89% align:start
But... Seven hundred years ago--

01:03:47.097 --> 01:03:49.031 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI] He wasn't actually
your grandfather.

01:03:49.164 --> 01:03:50.297 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:03:50.431 --> 01:03:52.730 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI]
What I'm saying is that you are

01:03:52.864 --> 01:03:55.563 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hiroki Saito's clone.

01:03:55.697 --> 01:03:59.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
A special version,
made by forbidden means.

01:04:01.164 --> 01:04:02.931 position:33% line:89% align:start
Genetic tech.

01:04:03.065 --> 01:04:04.998 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAGATE]
She told me everything.

01:04:05.132 --> 01:04:07.432 position:10% line:89% align:start
All the details of that time.

01:04:07.564 --> 01:04:13.865 position:10% line:83% align:start
My grandfather, her, Hiyama,
and the scientist Ochiai.

01:04:15.332 --> 01:04:18.866 position:10% line:83% align:start
The captain had seemed so far
away and untouchable before,

01:04:18.999 --> 01:04:23.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
but now, she felt like someone
I'd known for a very long time.

01:04:25.199 --> 01:04:26.699 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAGATE]
Thank you for telling me.

01:04:26.832 --> 01:04:28.066 position:19% line:89% align:start
I really appreciate it.

01:04:28.199 --> 01:04:29.966 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI]
All my life...

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:34.466 position:10% line:83% align:start
...I've done whatever it took
to keep Sidonia alive.

01:04:34.599 --> 01:04:37.933 position:27% line:83% align:start
But, then, Saito
denied immortality.

01:04:38.067 --> 01:04:41.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
And he chose to raise you
in the traditional way.

01:04:41.933 --> 01:04:44.867 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ugh. I'm scared what I've
done isn't that different

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
from Ochiai--It's the same,
just to a lesser degree.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.933 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAGATE]
Captain...

01:04:51.067 --> 01:04:54.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI sighs] Perhaps
even now... as I send you

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:57.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the other pilots
to your deaths,

01:04:57.768 --> 01:05:00.268 position:21% line:83% align:start
I am telling myself
that same, old lie--

01:05:00.402 --> 01:05:02.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
That I'm protecting Sidonia.

01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:11.469 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KOBAYASHI chuckles]
Maybe I'm just tired.

01:05:11.602 --> 01:05:13.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

01:05:13.568 --> 01:05:14.869 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAGATE]
Captain, listen.

01:05:15.002 --> 01:05:17.668 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sidonia only made it
this far because of you!

[KOBAYASHI gasps]

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:32.870 position:27% line:83% align:start
Know this: That I
believe in you, Captain!

01:05:35.936 --> 01:05:40.070 position:27% line:83% align:start
This battle could
very well be our last.

01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:43.471 position:30% line:83% align:start
So I'm counting
on you, Tanikaze.

01:05:43.604 --> 01:05:45.570 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ma'am!

One group is heading towards us!

01:05:53.438 --> 01:05:54.904 position:38% line:89% align:start
How many?

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
[OPERATOR V] Multiple Gauna

01:06:02.072 --> 01:06:03.705 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUHATA]
They want to delay us.

01:06:03.838 --> 01:06:05.105 position:30% line:89% align:start
Which means...

01:06:05.239 --> 01:06:07.272 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll shake them off
at full speed.
