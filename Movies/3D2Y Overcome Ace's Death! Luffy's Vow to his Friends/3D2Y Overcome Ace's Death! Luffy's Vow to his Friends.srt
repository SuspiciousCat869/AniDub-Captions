1
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:10,585
Luffy, Listen to me, okay?

2
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:14,868
There's only one way to live without any regrets.

3
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:19,957
Someday, we're gonna set sail, just like Sabo.

4
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:22,388
We're gonna live the way we wanna live...

5
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,551
more free than anyone else.

6
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:53,734
Ace! We're getting you outta here!

7
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,043
Luffy, no!

8
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:57,942
Now, activate the encircling walls!

9
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,511
What is that?

10
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,622
They've closed us in!

11
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,181
What the hell's going on?

12
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:08,770
What's going on down there?

13
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,702
Why didn't the last wall raise?

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,272
It's Oar's body.

15
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,476
The walls don't seem strong enough to lift it!

16
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:17,177
We simply can't wait around any longer.

17
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:17,942
Do it now!

18
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:20,619
Meteor Volcano!

19
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:43,562
Phase two is the immediate execution of Portgas D. Ace!

20
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:48,619
I'm here, Ace!

21
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:52,116
Straw Boy!

22
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,101
Stop being so reckless!

23
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:56,044
I need a favor!

24
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,419
Little Oars!

25
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,177
Save Ace!

26
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:02,504
How is he still alive?

27
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:03,982
Back off!

28
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:06,239
You're not killing Ace!

29
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:10,199
It's a fluke you got this far and
you're too green to go any further.

30
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,557
Gum-Gum Stamp Gatling!

31
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:21,332
You almost made it.

32
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,475
We caught those punks off guard.

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,034
I never said they had sunk all of our ships.

34
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:34,042
Another coated pirate ship's about to enter the bay,

35
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:35,993
Now, sink that thing!

36
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,981
Cease fire! The ship is too fast.

37
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,830
Aim your fire at Oars!

38
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,660
He plucked the ship right out of the bay!

39
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:48,904
They've broken through the encircling walls!

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,863
It's Whitebeard!

41
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:56,856
Whitebeard has entered the plaza!

42
00:02:58,572 --> 00:02:59,687
Oars.

43
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,639
Everyone, try to save Ace!

44
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:11,871
And as soon as we've got him back, then destroy the Navy!

45
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:14,947
You ready?

46
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:15,940
Yeah.

47
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,857
Hold on, Ace! I'm coming to get you!

48
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:29,118
Keep running straight ahead and don't look back!

49
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:30,139
Inazuma!

50
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:32,458
Don't worry, Iva, I shall give it my best.

51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,257
It's a bridge!

52
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:39,868
Thanks, Crab.

53
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:41,051
Straight to the top.

54
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,801
It's Inazuma of the Revolutionary Army!

55
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:44,471
Luffy!

56
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:47,930
I told you! I'm here!

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,733
You're a pirate, Luffy!

58
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,365
That makes you my enemy!

59
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,182
Garp, no!

60
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:08,784
I made it!

61
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,914
You really are crazy.

62
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,819
Hold it!...

63
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,916
Struggle all you like,

64
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,419
but you're trapped in the palm of my hand!

65
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:17,378
What the heck is that thing?

66
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,185
Three, quick! Build us a wall!

67
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,947
I'm not losing now!

68
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,097
Gum-Gum Giant Balloon!

69
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:26,748
Candle Wall!

70
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,935
Here's the key! Best of luck to you, Straw Hat!

71
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,973
Thanks, Three!

72
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:39,501
Fire!

73
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:42,414
Blow them to bits before they hit the ground!

74
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,722
Captain Buggy! Brother 3 was caught in that blast!

75
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,079
No way!

76
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:55,119
You've never listened to a word I said, have you?

77
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,038
Ever since you were a whiny brat,
you've always been doing crazy things.

78
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:01,930
You really haven't changed much at all!

79
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:02,748
Let's go!

80
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:15,768
Ace.

81
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,868
Sorry, Luffy. I tried.

82
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,185
Don't worry.

83
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:22,587
We'll get you some help.

84
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:27,099
Thank you for trying so hard,
but this is as far as I can go.

85
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:29,639
C'mon, what're you saying? This isn't over yet!

86
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,995
We were so close.

87
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:35,684
Don't give up yet, we still have a chance.

88
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:38,357
You're too late!

89
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:41,717
This way, Doctor! Quick! It's not looking good!

90
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,912
I can feel my life slipping away.

91
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:49,504
So listen to me, Luffy.

92
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:51,158
Ace.

93
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:54,785
I can't raise my voice anymore. I'm too weak.

94
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:58,823
Tell everyone else what I'm about to say, all right?

95
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,056
Pops, my family...

96
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,955
...and you, Luffy.

97
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:12,233
Thank you, for caring about someone like me.

98
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:15,940
Who has such bad blood in his veins.

99
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,262
Thank you for loving me.

100
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,677
Thank you so much!

101
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:53,754
Did you have a nightmare?

102
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:57,639
You're covered in sweat.

103
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,045
Here, try drinking this.

104
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:23,243
After losing his brother Ace in
the War of the Best at Marine ford,

105
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,288
Monkey D. Luffy remained in a fragile state,

106
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:29,823
both mentally and physically, for quite some time.

107
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:33,033
There is yet joy beyond your sorrows!

108
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,631
What's gone maybe gone?

109
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:37,388
But you still have something
left in this world to treasure.

110
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:40,486
Here's my advice. You can do with it what you will.

111
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,958
Your choice won't affect me either way.

112
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,603
But I do want to help you.

113
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:50,224
Taking Rayleigh's advice to heart,

114
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,552
Luffy traveled with him to Ruskaina.

115
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,868
This is the power to feel the
presence of others more strongly.

116
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,685
This is Observation Haki!

117
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,142
Next, the Armament Haki.

118
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:13,528
This power acts as if the user is wearing invisible armor.

119
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:21,519
Now, watch closely.

120
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,333
The power to intimidate your enemies into submission!

121
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,572
This is Conqueror's Haki!

122
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,928
Before journeying to the New World,

123
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:43,764
Luffy has decided to undergo a
two-year training course from Rayleigh,

124
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:48,062
who is teaching him to harness
the mysterious power known as Haki.

125
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:49,519
All right.

126
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,637
Time to hold off on the adventures,

127
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:53,061
just for a little bit.

128
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,253
Do you feel okay?

129
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:02,844
Yeah.

130
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,282
I just wonder what everyone's up to.

131
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:08,202
You mean all of your friends?

132
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:14,455
You still have something left in
this world to treasure, don't you?

133
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,525
I still have my crew!

134
00:09:31,706 --> 00:09:32,966
Zoro.

135
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,366
I have an ambition of my own.

136
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:38,197
To be nothing less than the world's greatest swordsman.

137
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:40,721
I solemnly swear...

138
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,867
...that I will never lose again!

139
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,419
Until the day comes when I defeat him and take his title,

140
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,632
I will never lose, for as long as I live!

141
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:55,834
Is that okay, King of the Pirates?

142
00:09:58,491 --> 00:09:59,456
Usopp.

143
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:02,684
Usopp.

144
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:06,486
I am... I am the captain of the Usopp Pirates.

145
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,068
A brave warrior of the sea!

146
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:14,090
And mark my words, you will
never set foot in that village!

147
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,052
Get on!

148
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,179
Huh?... We're friends.

149
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:18,431
So hurry up and get on.

150
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:23,489
I really am a Pirate Captain now!

151
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,316
Nami.

152
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,402
Luffy.

153
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:36,918
Please help me.

154
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:46,212
He's gonna pay!

155
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,371
Luffy!

156
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:50,930
Nami!

157
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:55,619
No matter what, you'll always be my friend!

158
00:10:58,498 --> 00:10:59,154
Yeah.

159
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,522
Sanji.

160
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,987
Say, have you ever heard of the All Blue?

161
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:11,475
I'll be joining your little crew on
your quest to be King of the Pirates.

162
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:14,121
Your dream is foolish. Then again so's mine.

163
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,221
Now's as good a time as any to get started on it.

164
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:20,661
I'll be the cook on your ship. Does that sound okay?

165
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:21,971
Yeah!

166
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:24,744
Hey, Head Chef Zeff!

167
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,159
Thanks, you geezer!

168
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:30,100
I owe my life to you, old man!

169
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,651
And Chopper, too.

170
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:37,169
I needn't have friends, but I can
still fight for something I believe in!

171
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:38,846
You do have friends!

172
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:39,440
Huh?

173
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:42,596
I am your friend, Chopper!

174
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,305
Okay. Maybe I do want to be a pirate.

175
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:49,484
But I can never be one of you. I'm not even a human!

176
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:54,050
Shut up! Let's go!

177
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:55,522
Robin.

178
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:58,311
It's settled. I'm staying on the ship.

179
00:11:58,699 --> 00:11:59,477
Huh?

180
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:05,295
Those pirates just declared
war against the World Government!

181
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,701
One more thing!

182
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:12,111
Tell me that you wanna live!

183
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,529
I wanna live!

184
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:19,565
And Franky.

185
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:21,321
I almost forgot!

186
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,784
If you want your undies back then
you're gonna have to join my crew!

187
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,596
You guys need me, that's for sure!

188
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:31,820
You got the finest vessel on the sea, and not
a single shipwright? Heh. That's a real pity.

189
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,804
You don't leave me much choice.

190
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,646
Gotta take care of my masterpiece!

191
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,260
So set sail, I'm joining the crew!

192
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,630
I'm gonna super miss you guys!

193
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,925
And Brook.

194
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:49,915
I'm glad to hear that Laboon
is well and still waiting for me.

195
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:53,872
My shadow has returned, and we're leaving the Devil's Sea.

196
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,263
Every day on that boat was difficult.

197
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,640
Frankly, I'd given up all hope.

198
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:03,603
But, Luffy, you know what?

199
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:09,181
I'm just so happy to still be alive!

200
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,121
Ah. So does the offer to join your crew still stand?

201
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:13,646
Yeah, welcome aboard.

202
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,297
What?!

203
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:16,596
For real?!

204
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,413
No way!

205
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,869
That's why... I have to get stronger.

206
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,514
So I can protect my friends.

207
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,877
So I can fight to make their dreams
come true, just like they do for me.

208
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:35,790
Who knows.

209
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,120
Maybe your friends are thinking the exact same thing.

210
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:41,804
Perhaps they all want to get stronger, just like you.

211
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,708
The sun will rise soon.

212
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:51,298
Get some rest. Tomorrow's gonna be even tougher.

213
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,982
Right. Night, old man.

214
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,653
Damn ape!

215
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,428
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

216
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:20,773
Haki!

217
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,871
Huh? Where'd the gorilla go?

218
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,464
Won't even know what hit him!

219
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:29,485
Okay.

220
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,309
Second Gear!

221
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:35,201
Time for...

222
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,873
...Jet Pistol!

223
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:42,781
There we go!

224
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,197
A rabbit?!

225
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,469
Huh...

226
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,252
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

227
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:55,881
You're gonna pay for that!

228
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,932
You having fun yet?

229
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:00,973
It's tricky.

230
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:03,068
We call that one a Toughness Rabbit.

231
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,082
Consider your cheeks an introduction!

232
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:06,799
Whatever, I'll get it back!

233
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,747
Based on what I saw, you can now use Armament Haki...

234
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,417
with a 50 percent chance of success, that is.

235
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:15,281
Your Observation Haki's also getting a lot better.

236
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:19,081
You should be able to sense both your
enemies' presence and how strong they are.

237
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:21,287
You rely far too much on your vision.

238
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:24,023
So we'll need to prevent you
from doing that in the future.

239
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:24,881
Huh?

240
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:27,462
That's better.

241
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,422
I can't see.

242
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:31,112
Leave it on for a while and let yourself get used to it.

243
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:37,531
This is stupid. I can't see a thing!

244
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,515
This is training!

245
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,407
You have to use all of your senses.

246
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:41,998
Not just your eyesight.

247
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,801
No matter how good your eyes may be,

248
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:47,517
you'll never see everything.

249
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:51,688
Enemies that move at the speed of light
must be detected through other methods.

250
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:57,305
Once you develop your Observation
Haki, you can intercept their attacks.

251
00:15:59,115 --> 00:15:59,692
Right!

252
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:00,997
Let's do it!

253
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:07,773
There!

254
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:51,264
Byojack, how much time has
passed since we began our attack?

255
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:54,523
Let me see... Eight minutes.

256
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:59,892
It shouldn't take that long to
sink three warship sand a puny liner!

257
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:02,221
Get rid of the new recruits.

258
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,864
But we can't do that.

259
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:08,227
We went through lots of trouble finding the
toughest pirates on the sea while you were gone!

260
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,643
Adding weaklings from the
garbage heap won't do us any good!

261
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:15,334
Night in, Gairam, Sebastian.

262
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:18,087
Go on. Show the rookies how it's done.

263
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:21,050
You have one minute!

264
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,595
I've been it chin' for some action!

265
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:27,373
Quit yappin'. Let's go!

266
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:37,114
Who are those guys?

267
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,606
They're heading straight for the ship!

268
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:39,939
Fire!

269
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,824
They're moving too fast!

270
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:52,691
These Marines were as naive as they come!

271
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,929
I guess I'll have to teach them a lesson!

272
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,589
Screw you, old lady!

273
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,496
Kampo Kempo:

274
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,656
Antidote Granule!

275
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,374
I always thought these Navy ships were ugly.

276
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:08,774
Lemme add a few touches to spruce it up! Cube Break!

277
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,259
Remember, only one minute, men!

278
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:25,776
We need more action like that.

279
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,183
I'll take care of the rest...

280
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,582
...in 50 seconds!

281
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:31,315
All right.

282
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:46,829
Hey, is that...

283
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:48,830
It's Pirate Byrnndi World!

284
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:54,633
Gimme that.

285
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:57,348
More-More Hundredfold Gun!

286
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,265
You're gonna pay for this!

287
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,495
Burn in hell!

288
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,353
Watch out!

289
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,266
More-More Hundredfold Chop!

290
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,171
The captain's still got it!

291
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:32,571
Heh, heh. Even after all the battles
we've fought, his strength remains unbeatable!

292
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,755
'Course it is!

293
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,464
That's ridiculous...

294
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:36,290
The man's crazy!

295
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:38,536
He even blew up his own crew members!

296
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:42,046
How long?

297
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,884
Exactly 50 seconds.

298
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:46,584
Newcomers!

299
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:48,241
A few ground rules.

300
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,121
Anyone who fails to follow my orders...

301
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:53,577
...will end up like them!

302
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:54,540
World Captain.

303
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,635
All those men were putting their
lives on the line following your orders.

304
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,590
And they were taking their sweet time!

305
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:03,403
When I give you a task with a time
frame, you can't be a second late!

306
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,729
If you can't meet that simple order,

307
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,539
you don't belong on my ship!

308
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:12,579
If you're not ready to die at the hands of
our enemies or at the hands of your captain,

309
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:15,468
then you might as well make a run for it right now!

310
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:16,135
World!

311
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,875
This guy's lost his mind!

312
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,279
But if you run away, you're also dead.

313
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:33,432
Forgot that part.

314
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:38,580
Oh, World.

315
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:47,434
Ruskaina's going to be hit with severe winter next week!

316
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:51,008
It'll become extremely cold, definitely around freezing!

317
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,296
He'll need warmer clothing!

318
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:57,174
Let's see, a sweater, a scarf, gloves,
earmuffs, can't forget long underwear!

319
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:59,096
That should keep him nice and warm.

320
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,441
Oh, and he's eaten nothing but wild beast meat.

321
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,952
I need to prepare a more balanced diet for him!

322
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,232
Seafood, fruits, veggies, rice,
bread... is there anything I'm missing?

323
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:09,695
Do you remember if he likes pasta?

324
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:13,818
Yes, Princess. He really liked the penne
Gorgonzola pasta with Sea King meat on top.

325
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:15,940
Then prepare a big potful of that!

326
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:18,847
And cook it on the ship, so we
can serve it to him while it's hot!

327
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,055
A big pot of pasta, served hot.

328
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:22,945
Is there anything I'm forgetting?

329
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,290
What is it?

330
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,506
Shame on you!

331
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:29,358
Did you forget the promise you made to Rayleigh?

332
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,614
Ohh. Try to understand.

333
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:34,076
Luffy's training is very important!

334
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,675
He must not have any distractions!

335
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:40,099
For now, just hope for his success from a far!

336
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,989
That's what a proper fiancée would do!

337
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:47,624
Take it from me, men want a woman
who knows when to leave them alone.

338
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:52,248
Start acting like a warlord, instead
of a silly, little schoolgirl...

339
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:54,497
I've already thought about such things!

340
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,382
That's why I'm sending someone else
to drop off supplies on my behalf.

341
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:58,812
You think me a fool?

342
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,886
He'll be fine, so get off my back!

343
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:02,548
Her wrath is fearful indeed!

344
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:03,544
Now, where was I?

345
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:06,391
Oh, yes, a week of harsh winter will give way to spring!

346
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:08,835
Prepare Luffy some outfits for the springtime!

347
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:11,852
Cool spring outfits with lacy frills. Check.

348
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:14,142
And set off as soon as you have everything!

349
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:15,066
Right!

350
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:19,350
How could you stomp on an elderly woman like that?

351
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:19,953
Huh?

352
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:24,079
A carrier bat? Let me see.

353
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,565
It's a message from the World Government.

354
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,879
Wait. Already?

355
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:36,232
Listen! We have an emergency, ladies!

356
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,355
The World Government is summoning
the Seven Warlords once more!

357
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,543
Hey, Snake Princess!

358
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:43,364
Pay attention!

359
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:49,150
Dear Luffy, even though we cannot meet,
my heart sings at the thought of you!

360
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,436
So please accept this love I send to you,

361
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:53,396
and dream of me!

362
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:13,206
Can't believe you actually built it. Well done!

363
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:14,458
Awesome real!

364
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:17,776
With just a single shot, he destroyed the entire island!

365
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,735
Please, sir, it was nothing!

366
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:24,411
What's more impressive is that
you've returned after 30 years!

367
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:26,015
But I never lost hope!

368
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,680
Neither did we, and our perseverance has paid off!

369
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:34,332
During your lengthy absence, Sebastian and I spent
all our time collecting materials to build the ship.

370
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:36,871
So don't try to take all the credit, buddy!

371
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:38,511
Yeah, Night in is right!

372
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,111
Hey, what gives?

373
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:44,595
Enough bickering.

374
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:48,182
I'm grateful to all of you for waiting so long.

375
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:52,491
For 30 years, building ship like this has been my dream.

376
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:55,764
And thanks to your hard work, it's finally real!

377
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:59,370
The cannon... Simply amazing.

378
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:05,144
The barrel's bigger than any cannon I've seen,

379
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:07,662
but once I tack on my More-More power,

380
00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:10,113
we'll shoot cannon balls a hundred times bigger!

381
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:12,366
Why, with that beast at our disposal,

382
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:16,607
we could take out the capital of the World
Government before they even put up a fight!

383
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:18,954
Hey, that's a good idea!

384
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:22,597
Men, prepare to set sail for Mariejois!

385
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,271
World, please.

386
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:30,408
I don't think we'd be able to carry
out that plan as easily as you believe.

387
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,024
And why is that?

388
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:36,724
Because of our actions the other
day when we attacked the Navy,

389
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:40,904
the Government knows the pirate,
Byrnndi World, has escaped from Impel Down.

390
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,207
I want them to know I'm back.

391
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,519
Who really cares if they're on our tail?

392
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,939
If it were that simple, I might
be inclined to agree with you.

393
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:54,162
However, they've already summoned the
Seven Warlords of the Sea to apprehend you.

394
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:56,159
Surely that's a joke!

395
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,564
They summoned the Warlords? What does that mean?

396
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:00,756
That's right.

397
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:07,104
You were locked up for so long, you probably have no
idea how the World Government deals with pirates nowadays.

398
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,594
The Seven Warlords are pirates,

399
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:13,390
but they're sanctioned and granted
amnesty by the Government itself.

400
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:18,362
And in return, the government can
summon them for emergency situations.

401
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:22,788
But they're more than just grunts!
Their strength is not to be taken lightly.

402
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,128
Is that all?

403
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:27,893
Luckily for us, I'm a thorough collector of information.

404
00:25:28,056 --> 00:25:33,387
The warlords were summoned just this morning, so they'll
be at the government headquarters within a few days.

405
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:37,206
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid your plan
isn't going to work out given the circumst...

406
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,355
Wait a minute.

407
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:41,590
Did you say the Seven Warlords were summoned this morning?

408
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,128
I did, but why?

409
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,996
Perfect, then we'll have to take
advantage of this golden opportunity.

410
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:48,561
What are you getting at?

411
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:51,691
Which of the government dogs lives closest to here?

412
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:53,731
Let's meet 'em.

413
00:26:19,418 --> 00:26:19,862
Damn!

414
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,044
I swear all the animals are ganging up on me!

415
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:26,156
I'll get 'em back as soon as I'm done eating!

416
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,468
Ready for round two already?

417
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:31,305
Yeah! I'm tired of getting beat by them!

418
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:39,290
Later.

419
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:40,847
I see.

420
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,302
Try not to die.

421
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:45,374
Right!

422
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:52,908
Huh? Where did all of 'em run off
to? They didn't go to sleep, did they?

423
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:56,825
Hey, Mr. Gorilla! Mr. Alligator! Mr. Lion!

424
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:59,553
I'm ready! Come out and fight me!

425
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:03,195
Hey, what's that?

426
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:06,945
Whatever it is, it smells really tasty!

427
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:09,429
Where's it coming from?

428
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,386
That smells like food!

429
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,768
Okay, I gotta see...

430
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,579
I knew it!

431
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:22,240
Is all this stuff for me?

432
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:23,517
Guess so!

433
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,814
Luffy has found the food.

434
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:31,573
Yeah, it's him all right.

435
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:34,759
Luffy's there!

436
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:38,390
She's getting dizzy over nothing. Some warlord!

437
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:42,711
If she had gone over there with them,
she'd probably have a heart attack. Ugh.

438
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:45,277
Ahh, Luffy.

439
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:49,855
His appetite hasn't changed a bit!

440
00:27:49,911 --> 00:27:53,819
Why, he even ate the frilly spring outfits
we brought and those aren't food at all!

441
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:57,513
You won't believe what Luffy just did!

442
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,753
Tell me everything! Did he like it?

443
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,254
I'm looking for the Empress, the leader of Amazon Lilly.

444
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:12,122
Heh.

445
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:15,428
Who are you? State your business!

446
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:16,721
Since you asked.

447
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,527
The name's Byrnndi World.

448
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:23,312
I'm here to kidnap the government's dog, Boa Hancock!

449
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:24,383
You heard of her?

450
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:27,482
Did he just say Byrnndi World?

451
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,096
Wait. Do you know who that is?

452
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,072
How many times must I tell you?

453
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:34,831
Remember the letter from the government
that you tore up and threw away?

454
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:40,131
It mentioned a pirate so dangerous that the
Navy summoned all of the Warlords to fight him!

455
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,325
And that man is Byrnndi World!

456
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:43,253
And he is here.

457
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,930
You wish to kidnap the princess?

458
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:47,392
She is not here, but we shall face you ourselves!

459
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:48,971
What?

460
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:51,507
I, uh, didn't make any promises, right?

461
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:55,949
I just saw the Kuja's ship on the
shore and thought she might be here!

462
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:58,937
We just got unlucky this time, no big deal...

463
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:00,954
What a waste of my time.

464
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:03,051
Hold it!

465
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:10,662
You can't come here to kidnap my sister and then walk
away! then you shall find one at the end of my blade!

466
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,125
You're her sister?

467
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,853
Hey, Sonia! Mari!

468
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:17,138
Someone tell me what's going on right now!

469
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:19,743
Do you hear me? Please say something!

470
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,026
I see!

471
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,679
The Empress is on the other side of that snail!

472
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:26,299
In that case...

473
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:32,066
More-More Tenfold Shotgun!

474
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:35,800
You keep your hands off her, or else!

475
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:40,504
What's that?

476
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,063
Hey, what's up, you guys?

477
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:47,574
If you brought this food for me,
thanks, it's even better than last time!

478
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:49,146
Luffy, run away!

479
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,720
What's wrong?

480
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:53,171
Did Mr. Gorilla attack you?

481
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:00,198
Is that dude your friend?

482
00:30:00,404 --> 00:30:02,033
Byojack, who's he?

483
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,480
I have no business with the rest of you.

484
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:10,259
So time to die!

485
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,070
Yeah? Fat chance!

486
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,329
Hey, kiddo.

487
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:19,162
What're you doing?

488
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,370
Say goodbye. More-More Hundredfold Gun!

489
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:34,483
That won't work...

490
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:39,073
No, Luffy!

491
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:50,894
Luffy.

492
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:53,790
So is this the Empress of Amazon Lilly?

493
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,197
Where's Luffy? Tell me you didn't hurt him!

494
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,536
I assume she's talking about that boy.

495
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:03,595
Come here and see for yourself!

496
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,113
I'll leave my Vivre Card next to the punk.

497
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:07,868
As for you, Pirate Empress,

498
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:10,216
if you ever want to see your sisters again,

499
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:13,819
track me down in two days, before the break of dawn!

500
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,819
Good luck!

501
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,581
What? No!

502
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:29,994
World, I've heard that name from somewhere before.

503
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:30,986
Luffy.

504
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:45,994
Get over here. I think Luffy's awake.

505
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:51,993
Hancock.

506
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:54,334
What are you doing here?

507
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,993
You finally woke up! What a relief!

508
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:00,295
Don't try to get up.

509
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:02,256
You still haven't fully recovered yet.

510
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:04,024
Oh, yeah! What happened to the girls?

511
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:06,958
They we retreated for their
wounds and now they're sleeping.

512
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:08,927
As for Sonia and Mari...

513
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:10,514
That guy took them, huh?

514
00:32:10,823 --> 00:32:11,776
Yes, yes.

515
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,691
Man. What was his deal?

516
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:17,839
From sound, and he wanted something
from me because I'm one of the Warlords.

517
00:32:18,157 --> 00:32:20,064
Are you going to rescue your sisters?

518
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:20,990
Of course.

519
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,958
Princess, if he really is the notorious Byrnndi World,

520
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:27,045
then even you're too weak to challenge him...

521
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,253
I'll go with her!

522
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,750
If we're together, there's no way he can stop us!

523
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:32,988
Luffy.

524
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:38,511
Hold on. The reason that you're training here is because
you're not strong enough to fight opponents like him!

525
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,180
I haven't given up on that.

526
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:44,296
You aren't improving, but you have a
long way Togo before you master Haki.

527
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:45,965
You could be killed!

528
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:47,482
I'm not gonna lose to him!

529
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:50,507
What have you been training yourself for all this time?

530
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:54,337
If you leave right now, you
might never see your friends again!

531
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:58,755
But they came here and were kidnapped
because they we redelivering food for me!

532
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,465
I can't just sit here and do nothing
when people I care about are in trouble!

533
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:03,623
Oh, Luffy.

534
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,914
Rayleigh, I promise I'll keep him safe.

535
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:09,177
With him at my side, we'll finish this quickly.

536
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:14,158
It doesn't matter what I say.

537
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,171
I'm not going to change your mind.

538
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:19,739
Whatever you do, come back alive!

539
00:33:20,116 --> 00:33:20,862
Okay!

540
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,726
And remember, you have to be extra careful.

541
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:29,438
Nobody knows your whereabouts and I'd like to keep
it that way until your two years of training are over.

542
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:34,585
Don't stir up any trouble in public places
where you could attract a lot of attention.

543
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:35,585
I got it!

544
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:45,757
This Byrnndi World guy is on a wild ride!

545
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:49,392
The World Nobles. Other pirates. Us.

546
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,163
Crazy bastard's even killing his own crew.

547
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,079
According to what it says here,

548
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,501
he's behind this latest attack, too?

549
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:58,697
That's what the World Government thinks.

550
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,762
Soon after the World Noble case,

551
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,930
they decided to summon the Warlords.

552
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:05,855
The carrier bats were already sent out three days ago.

553
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:09,436
They didn't even notify us!

554
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:11,471
Like it or not, it's necessary.

555
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,988
Why hello, Tsuru!

556
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:17,140
Preparing for his attack isn't the only
reason the World Government was in such a hurry

557
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:19,055
to get the Warlords all in one place.

558
00:34:19,285 --> 00:34:22,265
It allows the Navy to keep them on a short leash.

559
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:27,799
After all, if any of the Warlords were to ally
with World our troubles would escalate very quickly.

560
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:30,873
Think of this as an urgent preventative measure.

561
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,900
Before he was captured 30 years ago,

562
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:38,788
he was known far and wide as the Destroyer of the World.

563
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:43,846
With his history, it's only reasonable
the Government responded the way they did.

564
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,669
Destroyer of the World?

565
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:51,787
That's what they called him.

566
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:56,173
World has a reputation for taking
out anything that crosses his path.

567
00:34:56,284 --> 00:35:00,430
He was as much a threat to other
pirates as he was to normal civilians.

568
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,281
It didn't matter who you were.

569
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:07,544
Thirty years ago, the Government
decided to secretly assemble

570
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:10,474
his enemies and others who held grudges against him.

571
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:16,210
They joined the Navy and executed a
plan to take down World once and for all.

572
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:19,872
This was back when you boys were first getting started.

573
00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:21,668
Do you remember anything?

574
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,668
Well, it does ring a bell...

575
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,460
A coalition made up of pirates and the
Navy had a tussle with World and his men.

576
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:34,340
Even though he was vastly outnumbered, he
didn't budge an inch and the coalition retreated.

577
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:39,425
But thanks to our Government spies,
ones who secretly took part in the battle,

578
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,999
our efforts were successful in the end.

579
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:45,121
Ultimately, World and his allies were defeated.

580
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,563
If it was such a decisive victory, why on
earth is he causing trouble again all of a sudden?

581
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:51,516
I have no idea.

582
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:57,655
I heard a rumor he had been locked up at
Impel Down in a frozen state of constant slumber.

583
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,962
Perhaps he was awakened somehow.

584
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:04,666
Sengoku did mention that a fair number
of prisoners snuck out of Impel Down

585
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,898
when Straw Hat turned the place inside out.

586
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:12,109
In addition to the prisoners Blackbeard
recruited, several names on that list caught my eye.

587
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:15,542
And Byrnndi World was one of them.

588
00:36:16,328 --> 00:36:19,585
Even compared to Blackbeard's crew, World is a problem.

589
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:24,757
On top of this, we're still relocating Navy
Headquarters and transitioning to the new system.

590
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:27,560
It's the worst possible time for us.

591
00:36:27,814 --> 00:36:30,429
You should know World is a More More Fruit eater.

592
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:35,348
He makes objects a hundred times bigger
and faster, then turns them into an attack.

593
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:37,562
Destroyer of the World.

594
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,058
You shouldn't take a nickname like that lightly.

595
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:41,631
Huh...

596
00:36:42,107 --> 00:36:46,654
Based on our Intel from his latest attack, I
wouldn't be surprised if he's still in the area.

597
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,790
Ready the warships!

598
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:03,084
I was wondering where you went.

599
00:37:03,676 --> 00:37:05,164
Oh. Hello, World.

600
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:12,150
Are you sure it's a wise decision for
us to go to Marine ford quite so soon?

601
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,087
Worried, are you?

602
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,567
Have some faith in your captain, all right?

603
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:18,889
You'll relax once we have the Empress.

604
00:37:18,984 --> 00:37:21,812
She's expected to respond to
the World Government's summon,

605
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:24,029
so if we successfully take her hostage,

606
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:27,000
we shouldn't have any problems getting into Marine ford.

607
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:31,249
And once we do, we can use the cannon
to launch our attack on Mariejois,

608
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:34,673
putting an end to this useless
Government once and for all!

609
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:36,127
Just picture it, will ya?

610
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,424
Their capital city burned to ash!

611
00:37:38,528 --> 00:37:40,212
The Navy in shambles!

612
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:42,582
There's no sweeter sight, my friend!

613
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,174
I'm opposed to every part of this plan!

614
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:52,676
Why is that?

615
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:55,862
Our goal from the start was freedom, not chaos!

616
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:58,881
That was all that we thought of
when we built the ship and the cannon!

617
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,965
And that's why we're gonna use
those things against the government.

618
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:05,331
Because they're the reason people like us can't be free!

619
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:08,645
Hmm. You might think of it that way.

620
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:12,133
All you and the others have to do
is shut up and do what I tell you!

621
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:15,433
I'm the captain, you follow my orders!

622
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:20,606
Just because you're my big brother doesn't
mean you can disrespect me without consequences!

623
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:24,896
Captain World, the Kuja ship is approaching
us fast, and Hancock might be on board!

624
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,806
Perfect! Ha!

625
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,864
It's time, brother!

626
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:31,095
Hmm...

627
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:36,991
This is where the Vivre Card led us, but...

628
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:40,670
Hmm, yeah? I think it might be busted.

629
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:46,177
Wait a minute, what's going on?

630
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,138
An island?!

631
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:05,983
Why's it coming up from the sea?

632
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:24,869
Awesome!

633
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:32,369
Thank you for coming all this way, Empress!

634
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:35,610
So far your sisters are enjoying their stay!

635
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:41,812
Big sis!

636
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,136
Run away! Just leave us!

637
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:45,583
Sonia! Mari!

638
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:47,362
We'll get ya outta there!

639
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,157
It looks like that kid's here, too.

640
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,691
He can take a beating, I'll give him that much.

641
00:39:53,884 --> 00:39:56,632
If you want 'em back, then you'll have to come get 'em!

642
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:58,735
I'll be waiting!

643
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:03,408
Quick, evade them! Don't let them hit us!

644
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,909
We need to get closer to that island somehow!

645
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:12,121
Just a moment.

646
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,938
They think they can avoid us that easily?

647
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:19,083
I got this!

648
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:20,584
Gum-Gum..

649
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:22,373
...Balloon!

650
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:24,519
Well, what you know?

651
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:26,817
So he's got Devil Fruit powers, does he?

652
00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:28,771
C'mon! I need bullets!

653
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,894
Heh. More-More Fifty fold Cannon!

654
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:37,131
Armament Haki!

655
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,073
Luffy!

656
00:40:43,535 --> 00:40:44,464
Are you mad?

657
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,960
Let go of me! I can't just let him die!

658
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:49,080
Hurry, Salome, help him!

659
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:53,484
Get your head on straight, Snake Princess!

660
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:56,071
Did you forget you ate a Devil Fruit as well?

661
00:40:56,166 --> 00:41:00,104
If you go after him, you'll drown,
too, and what good would that do?!

662
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:04,023
Luffy...

663
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:11,502
Just turn yourself over to my
men and no one will get hurt!

664
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:12,705
It's up to you!

665
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:26,484
You attacked my ship and harmed my
beloved. Death is too sweet a mercy for you!

666
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,595
Never mind, guys, you can go ahead and kill her!

667
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:30,869
Hold on, World.

668
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,183
We were supposed to take her as a hostage!

669
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:37,282
We can always nail her dead body
on a pole and head to Marine ford.

670
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:38,311
Kill her!

671
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:41,053
Love-Love Beam!

672
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:43,335
what happened?

673
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:48,037
So it's true. She really can turn people into stone!

674
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:53,132
Luffy!

675
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:55,683
That was far too close!

676
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:58,791
Yeah, I screwed that up. I'm sorry.

677
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:00,684
I know that kid.

678
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:03,888
Wasn't Luffy the name of that pirate, Straw Hat?

679
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,186
Those idiots. It's like they're begging me to kill 'em.

680
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,283
Don't worry about it, Captain.

681
00:42:09,545 --> 00:42:10,898
I'll help you dispose of them.

682
00:42:10,953 --> 00:42:12,161
Sebastian, good.

683
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,988
I'll give you five minutes.

684
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:16,363
How kind, but two minutes is all I'll need.

685
00:42:16,593 --> 00:42:17,363
Are you ready?

686
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:18,405
Yeah!

687
00:42:19,484 --> 00:42:20,254
Go straight!

688
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,822
We'll get in through that opening!

689
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:24,155
Great Water Shot!

690
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,377
So you wanna get your friends back.

691
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:41,016
Don't worry, you'll be together soon enough...

692
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,763
...in Hell!

693
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:53,933
Step aside if you know what's good for you!

694
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:56,643
Or perhaps you'd rather be turned to stone!

695
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,603
Love-Love Beam!

696
00:43:03,632 --> 00:43:05,182
Why isn't it working?

697
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,131
Surely no one's taste in women could be that bad.

698
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:09,245
So sorry!

699
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:12,843
Turns out that I'm blind, so
your power means nothing to me!

700
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:14,273
Don't take it personally.

701
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:17,367
This do anything for ya?!

702
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:21,921
Now, Gum-Gum Jet Pistol!

703
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:27,546
Huh?

704
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:33,770
Damn, you got me pretty good there, kid!

705
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,535
I went all out. This guy's tough.

706
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:39,649
You had your shot. Now it's my turn to pay it back!

707
00:43:42,906 --> 00:43:44,694
Hey, is that an island?

708
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:45,590
Yeah.

709
00:43:45,743 --> 00:43:47,753
Wait, no, that's a giant ship!

710
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:50,191
Wow! Someone's fighting on it, too!

711
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,749
Is that a Giant?

712
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:53,432
It's a Fish-Giant.

713
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:55,733
He's half giant and half Fish-man.

714
00:43:55,848 --> 00:43:57,764
Woah. That's a good brawl!

715
00:43:57,899 --> 00:43:59,122
Down in front! I wanna see!

716
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,584
All of you, step aside!

717
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:02,083
Make way for Buggy!

718
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:07,672
This will mark the momentous occasion in
which I make my debut as a Warlord of the sea!

719
00:44:07,918 --> 00:44:09,553
Now who's crossing our path?

720
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:12,025
Perhaps we shouldn't stick around.

721
00:44:12,712 --> 00:44:14,360
Things look pretty bad over there!

722
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:17,219
The pirates on the ship are the
reason you Warlords were summoned!

723
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:19,117
It's Byrnndi World and his gang!

724
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:20,269
For real?!

725
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:21,572
Yeah, real funny, partner!

726
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:24,138
Prankin' me on my first day on the job.

727
00:44:26,475 --> 00:44:28,620
No way!

728
00:44:29,514 --> 00:44:30,686
Another thing:

729
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:35,681
The Fish-Giant is fighting against Straw
Hat Luffy and the Pirate Empress Boa, Hancock!

730
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:37,176
Quite the coincidence!

731
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,355
That's scary!

732
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,023
Straw Hat again?! How come we
keep bumping into that loser?

733
00:44:42,051 --> 00:44:42,837
Captain Buggy!

734
00:44:42,892 --> 00:44:44,677
This is the perfect chance!

735
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:48,673
You and Straw Hat made a great team
back at Impel Down and I'm sure Hancock

736
00:44:48,698 --> 00:44:51,430
would be more than happy to team up with another Warlord!

737
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:55,728
Forget the others, we'll bring World's head
to the Navy before the meeting even starts!

738
00:44:56,316 --> 00:45:00,931
He's right, you gotta show those other Warlords
that you're the strongest, even if you are the new guy!

739
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,452
Once you take down World, then everyone'll know!

740
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,453
You're gonna be a star in no time!

741
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,232
A star you say?!

742
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,020
Don't get delusional. It's
going to be harder than it sounds.

743
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:09,551
Mm-mm.

744
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:10,952
Wait a minute.

745
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:13,517
I don't know why Straw Hat is fighting against World

746
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:16,989
or why he's even here to begin
with, but I do know the Navy wants him!

747
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,594
So let's say that the kid does defeat World.

748
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,797
Then he'll need to run before the government shows up.

749
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:27,038
I say we let Straw Hat and Hancock take down World.

750
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:30,663
Once they leave, we'll swoop in and
take all the credit without even fighting!

751
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:33,086
It's a gamble that would pay off nicely!

752
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:34,579
That doesn't make sense!

753
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:37,304
We don't even know if those two can win against World!

754
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:38,114
You're right!

755
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:41,105
Attention, please!

756
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:45,635
Contact the navy and let them know that Warlord
Buggy and his pirates are engaged in battle!

757
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:47,711
The World Pirates are going down!

758
00:45:47,736 --> 00:45:50,489
Nice! Captain Buggy's goin' for it!

759
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:52,519
What's the meaning of this?

760
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:53,601
It’s easy.

761
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,271
Once the Navy hears a Warlord and a guy so tough
he's called the Destroyer of the World are fighting,

762
00:45:58,296 --> 00:46:00,035
they'll start taking notice.

763
00:46:00,186 --> 00:46:02,468
Chances are they'll eventually send in the admirals!

764
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:04,094
Wha...? Oh!

765
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,348
If Straw Hat and Hancock can't beat him, then
we can run away and leave the rest to the Navy!

766
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:09,363
That's right.

767
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:12,027
And even better, Marine ford is pretty close by.

768
00:46:12,176 --> 00:46:13,479
So they should get here soon.

769
00:46:13,526 --> 00:46:16,839
And after that, we can sit
back, relax, and enjoy the show.

770
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:17,935
Hey, Straw Hat.

771
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:20,897
Hope you have fun getting your ass kicked on my behalf!

772
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:33,756
Did he run away?

773
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:34,343
No!

774
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,048
Great Shark Arrows!

775
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:47,571
Luffy!

776
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:49,365
You will pay for that!

777
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,375
Perfume Femur!

778
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,308
Camouflage Air!

779
00:46:57,342 --> 00:46:58,144
What happened?

780
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:04,381
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

781
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:05,653
Come on, Straw Hat!

782
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,274
You can't get killed before the Navy shows up!

783
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:10,569
Our plan's already ruined!

784
00:47:10,848 --> 00:47:11,937
Are you okay?

785
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:13,444
I'm fine, thank you!

786
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,917
I'm afraid I've gotta end this.

787
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:19,369
Shame, we were really havin' some fun!

788
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:20,884
Now die!

789
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:22,788
Spin Tornado!

790
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,509
Third Gear! Bring it on!

791
00:47:27,835 --> 00:47:31,529
Gum-Gum Giant Pistol!

792
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,277
Oh, Sebastian.

793
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,913
This is a disappointment!

794
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,469
Nice work.

795
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:54,171
Let's go, Hancock!

796
00:47:54,384 --> 00:47:56,379
Oh. Why, yes, dear!

797
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,901
I can't believe it.

798
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:03,793
Come in, Gairam.

799
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:06,431
Lead me to the intruders, and be quick about it!

800
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:07,966
Roger, Captain!

801
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,314
Keep an eye on the hostages, will ya?

802
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:17,148
Be careful, World!

803
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:19,793
Come back here!

804
00:48:19,985 --> 00:48:22,518
If you think this fight is over, you're dead wrong!

805
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:24,980
Look at that sad, little fishy face.

806
00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:28,501
You might make a cute slave!

807
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,813
Negative Extra Big Hollow!

808
00:48:30,981 --> 00:48:32,139
Go get him!

809
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,185
If... If only I had been born a puny little minnow, then
life would be so simple and free of all this violence.

810
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:44,922
Never mind.

811
00:48:44,947 --> 00:48:46,745
I don't want you anymore.

812
00:48:47,356 --> 00:48:48,419
Who's that?

813
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:50,018
What the heck?

814
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,776
Huh? Is that Straw Hat?

815
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:53,937
Hold on. Do you know her from somewhere?

816
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,455
Maybe. Nothin's really ringing a bell, though.

817
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,346
Anyway, thanks for knockin' out that fish dude!

818
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:05,160
Hey! My actions were independent of
whatever mess Chalk it up to coincidence, okay?

819
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:09,245
Besides, my friend said he needed to go
somewhere, so I just came along to pass the time.

820
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,391
I had no idea the likes of you would be
here, otherwise I might have stayed at ho...

821
00:49:12,637 --> 00:49:14,312
Oh, no!

822
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:17,770
That flying girl.

823
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,914
She just called him Straw Hat.

824
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:22,392
I see, so it's true!

825
00:49:25,054 --> 00:49:26,630
What's wrong with this ship?

826
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:28,754
Floors aren't supposed to do that!

827
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:32,557
Luffy, are you certain you don't know that girl?

828
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,982
That cute flying girl following us!

829
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:38,542
Oh! Yeah. Let me see.

830
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:41,615
I do think I met her before but I don't remember her name.

831
00:49:41,685 --> 00:49:43,055
He's playing dumb!

832
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:46,302
Infidelity! This is infidelity, isn't it?

833
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:48,668
Where are we supposed to go?

834
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:50,235
Who's that girl with the umbrella?

835
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,556
Where did she come fro... What?!

836
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:54,025
Hey, what the hell?

837
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:55,693
What is that bastard doing here?

838
00:49:55,744 --> 00:49:56,501
I don't know.

839
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,727
But isn't he a Warlord, just like you?

840
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:01,278
The World Government must have summoned him, too!

841
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:03,731
Oh!

842
00:50:04,303 --> 00:50:05,186
Slime ball!

843
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:10,208
He probably though the could show up and take the credit
for beating World, while Straw Hat did all the dirty work!

844
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:14,561
I don't know if you're trying to be ironic or
what, but either way, he's going to ruin our plans!

845
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:15,373
Cool it.

846
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,319
I just need a second to think about this, don't rush me.

847
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,084
Who am I kidding?! This is a disaster!

848
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,285
Why's everyone gotta mess up my debut?

849
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:28,083
Technically, he's supposed to be an ally, so we
might have to cut our losses and team up after all.

850
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:29,192
Our ally, eh?

851
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:30,903
He's strong, too!

852
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:32,510
I see.

853
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,940
Great news, men!

854
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:36,315
We've got some awesome backup to help us out,

855
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:37,952
so let's go on the offensive!

856
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:40,757
Follow my lead, men, we're gonna attack!

857
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:42,775
Yeah!

858
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,409
Hey, Straw Hat's over on that ship.

859
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:46,698
What's going on?

860
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,694
Who knows?

861
00:50:52,957 --> 00:50:54,384
What kinda place is this?

862
00:50:54,574 --> 00:50:56,108
Why is it like a maze?

863
00:51:01,987 --> 00:51:04,475
Finally, I thought we'd be stuck forever!

864
00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:06,062
Wait, now where are we?

865
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,661
At this point, any direction will do.

866
00:51:09,955 --> 00:51:11,933
Come on! Let's try this path!

867
00:51:12,508 --> 00:51:13,256
Gotcha!

868
00:51:15,582 --> 00:51:16,351
Luffy!

869
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,846
You're not hurt, are you?

870
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:25,289
What happened?

871
00:51:28,438 --> 00:51:32,242
I could kill the Empress, but I
think I'll have some fun with you first!

872
00:51:32,284 --> 00:51:33,904
Hancock, don't worry about me!

873
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,160
Go find your sisters!

874
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,043
But, Luffy!

875
00:51:36,162 --> 00:51:36,944
Hurry!

876
00:51:38,287 --> 00:51:40,360
All right then. I'll go.

877
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:43,365
Please be careful, my love! We shall meet again!

878
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:48,028
Yeah. I got this!

879
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,938
World, watch out for that kid!

880
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:56,021
He's no normal boy, so don't underestimate him!

881
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:56,722
Uh?

882
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,240
You remember the story, right?

883
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:04,454
He's that upstart, the one who raided Marine ford
to rescue his brother, Portgas D. Ace, from execution!

884
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:06,916
He's the leader of the Straw Hat Pirates!

885
00:52:07,012 --> 00:52:08,927
You're facing Monkey D. Luffy!

886
00:52:09,102 --> 00:52:10,821
I'm sorry. Who?

887
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:12,347
Oh, you know him.

888
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,432
The Navy Vice Admiral Garp is his grandfather!

889
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:18,349
Ah? You mean the one who throws cannon balls?

890
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:23,354
Are you telling me this twerp is the reason
the Navy Head quarters has fallen into ruin?

891
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,936
I don't believe it.

892
00:52:25,735 --> 00:52:29,648
So... you save that brother of yours or not?

893
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:35,707
A wimp like you isn't strong enough to save anybody!

894
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,662
Shut up!

895
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:46,715
Gum-Gum Gatling!

896
00:53:00,515 --> 00:53:03,639
Now, Second Gear!

897
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,131
Jet Gatling!

898
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:26,296
You're not dead yet?

899
00:53:28,286 --> 00:53:28,976
Hold on!

900
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:31,198
That must be Byrnndi World!

901
00:53:31,934 --> 00:53:33,774
This is my weapon storage.

902
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:36,733
Feel free to use whatever you want.

903
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,167
Swords.

904
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:47,791
Spears, guns, hammers.

905
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:49,549
You can take what you like.

906
00:53:49,715 --> 00:53:52,369
Then maybe this'll get fun.

907
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:56,138
I don't need any of that crap!

908
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,742
That pride'll get ya killed.

909
00:54:01,868 --> 00:54:03,097
I don't need...

910
00:54:05,946 --> 00:54:07,497
...any weapon!

911
00:54:08,685 --> 00:54:11,035
Jet Pistol!

912
00:54:12,555 --> 00:54:13,568
Haki!

913
00:54:17,898 --> 00:54:19,748
Don't push your luck, kid!

914
00:54:20,018 --> 00:54:22,823
You don't even know how to control your Haki!

915
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,660
You were too weak to save your brother

916
00:54:25,737 --> 00:54:27,519
and you're no stronger now.

917
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:31,534
Listen up, kid.

918
00:54:31,658 --> 00:54:36,139
If you can't keep up with my next move,
nothing you got's gonna make a lick of difference.

919
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,861
My More-More Tenfold Speed!

920
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,218
Well, that's just too bad, isn't it?

921
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:11,612
I take it you came hereto help the
Empress save those weakling sisters of hers.

922
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,974
Then there's something you ought a know.

923
00:55:17,534 --> 00:55:19,178
You're a weakling, too.

924
00:55:19,422 --> 00:55:22,071
You're not strong enough to save anybody!

925
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:25,582
Time to finish off the Empress.

926
00:55:30,449 --> 00:55:32,015
Get up, Straw Hat!

927
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:34,478
Easy. World made it look easy!

928
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,499
What do we do now?

929
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,448
If that guy could rough up
Straw Hat with so little effort,

930
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,471
I don't think our plan'll work out.

931
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,981
Don't just stand there! Go do something!

932
00:55:44,283 --> 00:55:46,468
Pick up Straw Hat and give him some first aid!

933
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,907
We can't let him die yet.

934
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:50,847
Wow! It's beautiful how much you care for your friend!

935
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:54,825
Make no mistake, I'll follow Captain Buggy all my life!

936
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:57,879
It doesn't matter what this idiot says, does it?

937
00:56:04,212 --> 00:56:06,957
Hmph. Garp's grandson, huh?

938
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:19,605
Hey, Garp! Sengoku!

939
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:22,633
How many pirates have you got on your side, huh?

940
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,158
You should be ashamed!

941
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:26,812
Damn it! Let's blow him to smithereens!

942
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:28,062
Not just yet.

943
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:30,120
You do have to admit that he's got a point.

944
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:32,422
Wait, what's going on out there, World?

945
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:34,657
A pirate alliance is on their side.

946
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:36,958
We'll have to fight both pirates and the Navy!

947
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:38,198
How is that happen?

948
00:56:38,223 --> 00:56:41,011
Heh. I bet the World Government is behind it.

949
00:56:41,075 --> 00:56:42,950
They're always pulling shady deals.

950
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:45,253
World, what're we supposed to do now?

951
00:56:45,627 --> 00:56:46,736
What we always do!

952
00:56:46,928 --> 00:56:49,208
Take out everybody who stands in our way!

953
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,607
Pirates and Navy!

954
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,133
Am I right, Sebastian?

955
00:56:52,268 --> 00:56:52,968
Yeah!

956
00:56:56,464 --> 00:56:59,070
This battle's gonna be tougher than we expected.

957
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:01,684
That single ship is doling out a lot of damage.

958
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:02,774
Then, let me go.

959
00:57:03,072 --> 00:57:05,830
I'll make meatloaf outta their captain and we'll be done!

960
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:06,698
No need.

961
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,161
What is a Cipher Polagent doing here?

962
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,686
The tides will turn soon enough.

963
00:57:21,524 --> 00:57:24,444
Huh? They stopped.

964
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:26,819
What the hell's goin' on here?

965
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:33,343
No! What are you doing?

966
00:57:42,364 --> 00:57:43,150
Oh, no.

967
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:45,355
What's wrong with you? Have you gone mad?

968
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,212
When the World Government's after you, then
you've got no choice but to join up with them!

969
00:57:51,243 --> 00:57:53,278
So we're not gonna follow you anymore!

970
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:54,852
Try to understand where we're coming from!

971
00:57:54,877 --> 00:57:58,328
They said they wouldn't charge us if we turned
you over to them and surrendered without fighting!

972
00:57:58,353 --> 00:57:59,672
Who told you those lies?

973
00:57:59,823 --> 00:58:01,810
You've been bought off by the World Government?!

974
00:58:01,866 --> 00:58:03,853
Hey, don't act like you're so innocent!

975
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:04,883
They are bought you too.

976
00:58:04,908 --> 00:58:07,960
But we weren't dumb enough to listen to them, unlike you!

977
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,570
World!

978
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:15,800
The plan is underway.

979
00:58:16,825 --> 00:58:18,381
Launch an all-out attack.

980
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:34,574
So many traitors.

981
00:58:35,026 --> 00:58:38,235
I can't believe I actually
thought you were my true friends.

982
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,753
Very impressive,

983
00:58:39,948 --> 00:58:40,884
Captain.

984
00:58:42,748 --> 00:58:44,432
World, get out of there now!

985
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,934
It's Cipher Pol!

986
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:47,484
What in the hell is that?

987
00:58:47,635 --> 00:58:50,096
It's the World Government's intelligence agency!

988
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,987
Correct, sir.

989
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:55,106
We've been masquerading as your crew
members, learning as much as we can.

990
00:58:55,467 --> 00:58:58,590
The act was a part of our mission. Now it's over.

991
00:59:06,726 --> 00:59:07,883
World, no!

992
00:59:09,724 --> 00:59:10,800
World...

993
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:15,402
Stop! Don't let him escape!

994
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:17,856
Nightin! Gairam! Everyone, run for it!

995
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:20,823
Byojack. What are you doing?

996
00:59:20,986 --> 00:59:22,647
What about Captain World?

997
00:59:22,901 --> 00:59:26,524
But we're all gonna die for nothing if we stay here!

998
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:28,898
As World's first mate, listen to me!

999
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:29,779
You have to...

1000
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:31,513
He wants them to leave me?

1001
00:59:31,538 --> 00:59:33,603
Roger that! Forgive me, Captain!

1002
00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:34,304
Halt!...

1003
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,459
Sebastian! Dive!

1004
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,737
They got away!

1005
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:41,297
Ah, who cares?

1006
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:43,121
They're wounded. They won't last long.

1007
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:48,233
My crew. Everyone betrayed me.

1008
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,815
It won't happen, not ever again!

1009
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,365
Did you find the Empress?

1010
00:59:54,419 --> 00:59:56,167
She's heading to my room now.

1011
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:57,565
Are you positive?

1012
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,442
What do you mean? Of course!

1013
00:59:59,544 --> 01:00:01,743
Trust me, I'll take good care of her.

1014
01:00:03,821 --> 01:00:06,807
All righty then! Once I've got her in my clutches,

1015
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,906
I'll just soften her up a little
bit, then bring her right to you!

1016
01:00:10,502 --> 01:00:11,883
how's sb holding up.

1017
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,542
He finally stopped bleeding, but...

1018
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,571
He's trying to say something!

1019
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:29,889
I don't ever wanna let my friends down like that again!

1020
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:37,513
I never wanna feel that pain again

1021
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:39,800
for as long as I live!

1022
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:45,775
I don't know what you're talking about,

1023
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,089
but lying there and moping won't fix anything!

1024
01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:48,756
Get up!

1025
01:00:49,183 --> 01:00:51,577
Snap out of it and fight! I need you!

1026
01:00:52,466 --> 01:00:55,952
Wake up, dummy! Get your lazy ass back out there!

1027
01:00:56,113 --> 01:00:57,948
Come on, Crap Hat!

1028
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,690
Don't worry about me!

1029
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,344
He's risking his life to protect me.

1030
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,508
He's so noble and brave!

1031
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:14,140
To think that I ever suspected
him of cheating, how shameful of me!

1032
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:17,421
Ah! I can swoon when my sisters are safe!

1033
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,137
Where am I?

1034
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:31,418
What is that aroma?

1035
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:37,401
Welcome, Pirate Empress.

1036
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:42,433
You failed to introduce yourself and
you don't bother to face your guest.

1037
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:43,838
Have you no class?

1038
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:51,528
I can't believe the World Government thought a
prissy little thing like you would make a good Warlord.

1039
01:01:51,695 --> 01:01:54,902
Talk about poor judgment!
Their standards must be slipping!

1040
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:02,042
I'm Nightin, ship doctor of the World Pirates
and master of Kampo Kempo, if you must know,

1041
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:04,862
I take it back, I don't care who you are.

1042
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:07,374
Just tell me where my sisters are you hag.

1043
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:08,844
You might not care.

1044
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:11,553
but I know plenty about you thanks to Byojack.

1045
01:02:11,877 --> 01:02:16,466
Believe it or not, I've even developed a
strategy that can ward off your Love-Love power!

1046
01:02:16,757 --> 01:02:19,629
Are you done babbling, or must I silence you myself?

1047
01:02:20,105 --> 01:02:22,805
Kampo Kempo Secret Medicine!

1048
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,666
This is Fishwort Hell!

1049
01:02:24,844 --> 01:02:26,723
Love-Love Beam!

1050
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:43,455
Sorry, Empress, but your power's not going to work!

1051
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:46,054
This concoction that you see before you

1052
01:02:46,157 --> 01:02:49,009
is a complex blend of hundreds of disgusting herbs.

1053
01:02:49,034 --> 01:02:52,210
Easily the most bitter kampo
medicine the world's ever seen!

1054
01:02:52,379 --> 01:02:57,540
It purged my heart of all wicked desires,
rendering your sinful Love-Love power useless!

1055
01:02:59,282 --> 01:03:01,331
Let's see what's next on the menu!

1056
01:03:05,422 --> 01:03:07,420
Kampo Poison Mist!

1057
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:10,527
What's happening?

1058
01:03:12,573 --> 01:03:14,622
Who's the one with no class now?

1059
01:03:18,646 --> 01:03:19,941
And next...

1060
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,410
Kampo Kempo Secret Medicine!

1061
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,171
Now, feast your eyes!

1062
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:30,053
Pretty!

1063
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:31,369
Elegant!

1064
01:03:31,802 --> 01:03:32,917
Bouncy!

1065
01:03:36,175 --> 01:03:37,408
Ooh.

1066
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,933
Ginseng Newcomer!

1067
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:46,521
I'm maybe 80 years old,

1068
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:49,790
but with some rejuvenating kampo, I still look amazing!

1069
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:57,108
So long! Time for my Kampo Kempo Technique:

1070
01:03:57,304 --> 01:03:58,695
Kakkon Toe!

1071
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,002
Toe! Toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, kick!

1072
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,945
Toe! Toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, kick!

1073
01:04:09,473 --> 01:04:12,558
Try handling my Cordyceps Soul Shot!

1074
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:21,155
You youngsters might not think much of kampo,
but the kempo part should be flashy enough for you!

1075
01:04:25,722 --> 01:04:27,685
Taste my Slave Arrow!

1076
01:04:33,295 --> 01:04:35,037
That was a Kampo Dome!

1077
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:37,301
This may be more to your liking.

1078
01:04:38,689 --> 01:04:40,329
A Pistol Kiss!

1079
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,649
Keep shooting! You'll never hit me!

1080
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:50,157
I wasn't known as the Queen of Kampo Kempo for nothing!

1081
01:04:51,814 --> 01:04:54,828
You're not that strong. Not that hot, either.

1082
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:59,167
Then I beg of you, grant me one last wish.

1083
01:05:02,054 --> 01:05:05,160
Shut your filthy mouth and never open it again.

1084
01:05:12,085 --> 01:05:14,733
Ugh! So bitter!

1085
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:18,219
She's dangerous!

1086
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:21,057
Like a goddess or a femme fatale!

1087
01:05:23,493 --> 01:05:24,112
But!

1088
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:28,924
Hah! No matter how much you bat your
eyelashes, your power won't work on me!

1089
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:34,875
Cordyceps Soul Shot...

1090
01:05:34,994 --> 01:05:37,153
...Burst!

1091
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,124
You can't use your snake.

1092
01:05:46,164 --> 01:05:47,521
Oh, I can't?

1093
01:05:51,473 --> 01:05:52,753
Must eat 'em all!

1094
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:58,997
Is something the matter? You're
starting to look awfully pale.

1095
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:02,326
My unparalleled beauty has won you over.

1096
01:06:02,397 --> 01:06:04,327
It was only a matter of time.

1097
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:05,877
Thus is my power.

1098
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:10,746
I could kill you in a most gruesome
fashion and no one would shed a tear.

1099
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:14,521
Why do I face no consequences for my actions, you ask?

1100
01:06:14,947 --> 01:06:15,978
i'm beautiful.

1101
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:19,587
She's looking down on me so
much she's actually looking up!

1102
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:26,215
Hey! I'll have you know I'm not into
women! So don't flatter yourself, honey!

1103
01:06:27,493 --> 01:06:30,220
I love men through and through, got it?

1104
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,826
I'm done playing games! Go to hell already!

1105
01:06:34,469 --> 01:06:36,264
Did I do something wrong?

1106
01:06:36,582 --> 01:06:37,907
Not at all!

1107
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,469
It's no use!

1108
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,032
She's just too sexy!

1109
01:07:03,741 --> 01:07:05,653
Now, Love-Love Beam!

1110
01:07:09,617 --> 01:07:11,588
So much for your repulsive medicine.

1111
01:07:12,604 --> 01:07:15,378
There's no one in this world that can hide from my beauty.

1112
01:07:15,653 --> 01:07:17,839
And nothing that can ever make it pale.

1113
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:27,695
Nightin...

1114
01:07:32,476 --> 01:07:33,755
Come on!

1115
01:07:33,938 --> 01:07:38,410
Wake up already, idiot! Time's a
wastin'! Get back out there, you damn fool!

1116
01:07:38,776 --> 01:07:42,684
If you leave right now, then you
might never see your friends again!

1117
01:07:44,654 --> 01:07:45,440
Luffy!

1118
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:46,623
Luffy!

1119
01:07:46,703 --> 01:07:47,530
Luffy!

1120
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:48,564
Luffy.

1121
01:07:48,783 --> 01:07:49,598
Luffy!

1122
01:07:49,826 --> 01:07:50,499
Luffy.

1123
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:51,500
Luffy!

1124
01:07:51,756 --> 01:07:52,424
Luffy!

1125
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:55,739
Whatever you do, come back alive.

1126
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:57,606
You're a weakling, too.

1127
01:07:57,765 --> 01:08:00,522
You're not strong enough to save anybody!

1128
01:08:00,852 --> 01:08:02,082
What's your problem?

1129
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,539
If you want to take down World, quit lyin' around!

1130
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:07,600
Get back up and fight, damn it!

1131
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:14,508
Maybe I can save them and maybe I can't,

1132
01:08:14,878 --> 01:08:18,866
but I'll never know unless I try!

1133
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:31,749
Tell me... which way did he go?

1134
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,509
He... went that way!

1135
01:08:33,784 --> 01:08:34,387
Thanks.

1136
01:08:34,471 --> 01:08:37,525
That guy better be ready for an ass-kicking!

1137
01:08:39,268 --> 01:08:42,670
C'mere World! You can't hide from me!

1138
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,454
Do you think he'll be all right?

1139
01:08:45,671 --> 01:08:48,096
Yeah. Exactly as I planned.

1140
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,509
Whoa...

1141
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,798
They'll believe anything he says.

1142
01:09:02,115 --> 01:09:02,967
Which way?

1143
01:09:05,093 --> 01:09:07,043
Huh? Really?

1144
01:09:07,706 --> 01:09:09,533
I don't get this place.

1145
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,146
The Straw Hat kid is still alive.

1146
01:09:12,723 --> 01:09:15,635
Not to worry, Byojack! He will prove no match for me!

1147
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:16,635
But, Gairam.

1148
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:19,572
He's already gotten lost in the trap I created,

1149
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:21,290
so this will be easy!

1150
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,705
Straw Hat and the Empress aren't alone anymore!

1151
01:09:23,822 --> 01:09:26,071
All this commotion's making us vulnerable!

1152
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:28,816
The Warlord Buggy managed to sneak aboard, too!

1153
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,292
I shouldn't have to say this, but be careful!

1154
01:09:31,378 --> 01:09:33,444
You worry too much! I'll finish them off!

1155
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,843
Hmm. I hope so.

1156
01:09:40,074 --> 01:09:42,402
Let's try Cube Break!

1157
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:48,446
Huh? What's that?

1158
01:09:50,662 --> 01:09:52,338
Damn! I'm trapped!

1159
01:09:52,603 --> 01:09:54,346
Now I've got you!

1160
01:10:12,153 --> 01:10:13,509
Welcome aboard my ship!

1161
01:10:13,687 --> 01:10:16,213
I'm Gairam, the man who ate the Cube Cube Fruit!

1162
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,415
Now, with my powers, I can shape anything into a cube!

1163
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:21,133
Observe!

1164
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:37,427
C'mon, kid, are you serious?

1165
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:40,389
You think I'm gonna let you reach the captain that easily?

1166
01:10:40,777 --> 01:10:41,881
Try this!

1167
01:10:42,008 --> 01:10:44,234
Cube Booster!

1168
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:50,479
Heh.

1169
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,086
Cube Booster!

1170
01:11:10,686 --> 01:11:14,455
I thought you'd put up more of a fight,
but I'm afraid there's no escaping that one.

1171
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:16,896
Hmm?

1172
01:11:17,412 --> 01:11:19,644
Crap Hat must've beaten World by now!

1173
01:11:19,819 --> 01:11:22,634
Time for us to take cred... er, I mean see how he's doing.

1174
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:23,225
Hold it!...

1175
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:23,642
Eh?

1176
01:11:24,118 --> 01:11:27,813
Who're you? Wait a second, you must be
that other guy that Byojack mentioned.

1177
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,854
Why are you here?

1178
01:11:29,728 --> 01:11:31,374
That fellow doesn't look too friendly.

1179
01:11:31,405 --> 01:11:32,874
Perhaps we shall go back.

1180
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:36,158
Well, it doesn't matter. You're going down, clown!

1181
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:39,875
Cube Booster!

1182
01:11:42,806 --> 01:11:45,601
Watch out, I think he might have Devil Fruit powers!

1183
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,803
Really? What gave you that idea?

1184
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:58,147
Phew, I thought I was a goner!

1185
01:11:58,172 --> 01:11:59,071
Straw Hat?

1186
01:11:59,096 --> 01:12:01,427
You were supposed to be fighting
World. Would you hurry it up?

1187
01:12:01,499 --> 01:12:02,818
Didn't I crush you already?

1188
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:04,560
How did you survive that attack?

1189
01:12:05,623 --> 01:12:06,722
I'm made of rubber!

1190
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:11,194
Enough with the chit-chat! Get moving!
You've got more important things to do!

1191
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:13,125
Cut me some slack!

1192
01:12:13,284 --> 01:12:15,015
This place is really confusing!

1193
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,463
That's Straw Hat for ya, always full of excuses!

1194
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:18,859
Why am I in a priced?

1195
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:22,769
Don't argue with me! Get out there and beat World already!

1196
01:12:22,912 --> 01:12:24,748
Or my plan's going to be ruined.

1197
01:12:25,001 --> 01:12:26,311
That's our captain!

1198
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:29,420
First he heals him, and then he gives him a pep talk.

1199
01:12:29,576 --> 01:12:33,182
Now he's even offering to stay here and
fight this guy so Straw Hat can go ahead!

1200
01:12:33,207 --> 01:12:36,017
Truly. You're an inspiration to all of us!

1201
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,147
Quite the interpretation.

1202
01:12:38,298 --> 01:12:39,655
I'm just so happy!

1203
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:43,192
No matter where my captain
leads, I'm a Buggy man till the end!

1204
01:12:43,383 --> 01:12:44,351
It's settled, men!

1205
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:46,862
Let's help Captain Buggy help his friend.

1206
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,697
Buggy! Buggy!

1207
01:12:48,768 --> 01:12:50,104
Hey. What do we do?

1208
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:52,701
Beats me. Just play along for now.

1209
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:55,471
Buggy! Buggy!

1210
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,865
Uh, what are you going to do?

1211
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:01,513
Y'know, I'm startin' to think this may be fate.

1212
01:13:01,846 --> 01:13:08,511
I'm no slouch, but the bounty on my head wasn't half as
much as these guys when we were still stuck at Impel Down.

1213
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:11,682
But now, they're all working under me.

1214
01:13:11,873 --> 01:13:14,723
So I must be one of the greatest pirates in the world!

1215
01:13:14,876 --> 01:13:16,726
There's no other explanation!

1216
01:13:17,422 --> 01:13:20,688
I'm not gonna let some idiot with a hammer defeat me!

1217
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:22,590
Hey, Straw Hat!

1218
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:26,477
I can handle this chump on my
own. You go on and beat World!

1219
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:29,543
And don't worry, I won't tell anyone I saved your ass.

1220
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:34,445
I'm famous enough as-is, so it's not like I
need to steal any thunder from a rookie like you.

1221
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,051
Let's just say you owe me one, okay?

1222
01:13:38,243 --> 01:13:40,206
I bet you can pay me back somehow.

1223
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:41,291
Yeah, are you sure?

1224
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:43,619
Did you hear anything I just said, ya moron?

1225
01:13:43,678 --> 01:13:45,964
Hurry up before I change my mind! Jeez!

1226
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:49,208
I got it! Kick his ass for us, Buggy!

1227
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:53,085
Hey! We're still in the same awful situation as before!

1228
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:54,896
That guy wants to kill us!

1229
01:13:55,293 --> 01:13:57,088
Huh? Ya don't say.

1230
01:13:57,414 --> 01:13:59,767
Can these idiot seven fight to begin with?

1231
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:03,972
When the ship gets messy, it's time to take out the trash!

1232
01:14:04,184 --> 01:14:07,974
Step right up and witness the
power of the Cube Cube Fruit!

1233
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:13,430
Now! Air Cube!

1234
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:15,234
What the hell?

1235
01:14:15,266 --> 01:14:17,181
He turned the air into a cube?

1236
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:19,931
Now! Air Cube Booster!

1237
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:22,193
Candle Wall!

1238
01:14:23,608 --> 01:14:25,370
Run before he attacks again!

1239
01:14:25,395 --> 01:14:27,463
Thanks, partner! I'm counting on you!

1240
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,104
Cheap parlor trick!

1241
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,711
He's headed right where I want him!

1242
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:40,390
Which way should we go now, Captain?

1243
01:14:40,415 --> 01:14:42,066
Damn it! There's no escape!

1244
01:14:42,138 --> 01:14:44,649
That's right. Now you're stuck with me!

1245
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:47,442
Time for my Cube Break!

1246
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,918
Help me!

1247
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,526
Captain Buggy!

1248
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:55,434
It's time to finish you off.

1249
01:15:01,499 --> 01:15:04,183
Too slow, bozo! Your cubes suck! Is that all ya got?

1250
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,901
Captain Buggy does it again!

1251
01:15:06,019 --> 01:15:08,322
Even turning into a cube can't stop his trash talk!

1252
01:15:08,347 --> 01:15:10,706
Why don't you try this on for size?

1253
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:13,477
Cube Booster!

1254
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,361
Wow! You've got terrible aim!

1255
01:15:22,796 --> 01:15:24,878
No, you're right where I want you.

1256
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:27,889
Totem Cube!

1257
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:30,010
Eh? What the hell's a totem cube?

1258
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,868
Just this!

1259
01:15:33,758 --> 01:15:34,938
How do you like that?

1260
01:15:35,252 --> 01:15:38,502
Let's find out how bad my aim really is.

1261
01:15:38,692 --> 01:15:41,179
All right, batter up! Here we go!

1262
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:43,799
Almost there!

1263
01:15:46,993 --> 01:15:49,163
Well, well, fancy seeing you here!

1264
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,104
It was real nice knowin' ya!

1265
01:15:52,342 --> 01:15:54,621
Now! Chop-Chop Quick Escape!

1266
01:15:56,432 --> 01:15:57,529
I broke free!

1267
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,300
He has Devil Fruit powers, too.

1268
01:15:59,325 --> 01:16:01,274
All right, body, now pull it together!

1269
01:16:01,299 --> 01:16:02,867
No! That won't work!

1270
01:16:04,909 --> 01:16:07,716
If I gotta beat you piece by piece, then so be it!

1271
01:16:08,742 --> 01:16:10,083
This does not good.

1272
01:16:10,108 --> 01:16:13,509
I'll be fine. I've still got a trump card up my sleeve.

1273
01:16:13,588 --> 01:16:14,255
You do?

1274
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:14,811
Yeah.

1275
01:16:15,293 --> 01:16:19,411
Though I told myself I'd never use
it again unless absolutely necessary.

1276
01:16:19,797 --> 01:16:20,981
This movie is no joke.

1277
01:16:21,006 --> 01:16:24,042
It has the power to destroy
several towns in one fell swoop!

1278
01:16:24,248 --> 01:16:27,490
In fact, you guys could get hurt
if you're in the way, so watch out!

1279
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,756
Whoa! I forgot how strong he was!

1280
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,708
Yeah, don't worry, we'll stay out of your way!

1281
01:16:31,733 --> 01:16:33,798
He must be talking about the Buggy Ball!

1282
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,482
I haven't seen one of those in forever!

1283
01:16:35,531 --> 01:16:36,650
Why giving me away?

1284
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:41,108
Ah. You mean that little explosive you
used against the Minotaurus back in Impel Down?

1285
01:16:41,203 --> 01:16:43,966
That's a Muggy Ball. They're
two completely different things.

1286
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,821
But yeah, one of those.

1287
01:16:45,972 --> 01:16:49,046
All I need is a little distraction
to get the rest of my body back!

1288
01:16:49,323 --> 01:16:51,139
Would you stop with the chit-chat, damn it?

1289
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:53,018
Air Cube!

1290
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:56,957
Get outta here with that junk! Special Muggy Ball!

1291
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:00,349
Wow!

1292
01:17:00,595 --> 01:17:01,398
Got it!

1293
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:04,828
Damn! You'll pay for that!

1294
01:17:04,964 --> 01:17:07,062
How dare you use a bomb on my ship!

1295
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:08,920
Huh?

1296
01:17:11,035 --> 01:17:13,369
Perfume Femur!

1297
01:17:19,243 --> 01:17:20,767
Now, where is Luffy?

1298
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,507
He went that way.

1299
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,487
Huh?

1300
01:17:28,133 --> 01:17:28,952
Huh?!

1301
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:31,737
We won! He's been defeated!

1302
01:17:31,962 --> 01:17:33,923
Captain Buggy saved us!

1303
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,417
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he didn't do that.

1304
01:17:36,442 --> 01:17:40,231
Big deal. No one needs to find out. Let's just celebrate!

1305
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:44,159
Yeah! Captain Buggy, he's the best!

1306
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:47,318
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

1307
01:17:50,512 --> 01:17:51,896
All right then, everybody!

1308
01:17:52,023 --> 01:17:53,835
Let's go track down World next!

1309
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,520
And above all else, remember to be flashy!

1310
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:59,180
Yeah!

1311
01:17:59,573 --> 01:18:02,775
My goodness. How much longer can he drag this out?

1312
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:06,825
How did it come to this?

1313
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,389
Byojack.

1314
01:18:09,327 --> 01:18:10,946
You don't look too cheery.

1315
01:18:11,448 --> 01:18:12,303
Mm?

1316
01:18:15,602 --> 01:18:16,889
What happened to them?

1317
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,676
Who's doing all this?

1318
01:18:19,265 --> 01:18:20,765
It's Nightin and Gairam.

1319
01:18:21,442 --> 01:18:23,965
These intruders... they beat them.

1320
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,647
Huh? Who told Gairam to fight?

1321
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,571
Ridiculous!

1322
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:32,874
Nobody around here know show to follow my orders anymore!

1323
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:34,134
Wait just a minute.

1324
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:36,864
They both fought really hard trying to protect us...

1325
01:18:38,142 --> 01:18:39,897
They did it for your sake!

1326
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:41,694
What are you getting at?

1327
01:18:41,809 --> 01:18:42,892
He still here.

1328
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,882
Straw Hat is on the ship causing trouble.

1329
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:47,893
They thought you'd be angry, so
they tried to end things quickly.

1330
01:18:48,004 --> 01:18:50,411
Ha! A fat lot of good that did us.

1331
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,094
Now we're down to just you and me!

1332
01:18:52,262 --> 01:18:53,700
What were they thinking, huh?

1333
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:55,507
Forget it.

1334
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:59,134
The Pirate Empress is on her way here, isn't she?

1335
01:18:59,341 --> 01:19:01,350
She is, but World...

1336
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,431
You stay put. I'll handle it.

1337
01:19:07,388 --> 01:19:09,684
Brother. I'm sorry.

1338
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:12,824
What are you apologizing for, huh?

1339
01:19:14,252 --> 01:19:15,404
You're wrong.

1340
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:20,634
This... it wasn't supposed to be this way.

1341
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:23,675
This isn't the dream we were fighting for!

1342
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,225
Huh?

1343
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,728
Remember why we first set out to sea?

1344
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,372
Look at it, World!

1345
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:38,774
It's amazing.

1346
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,809
There's so much we haven't seen,

1347
01:19:40,893 --> 01:19:43,512
so many islands and places we haven't been to!

1348
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:45,875
Don't you wanna go out there some day?

1349
01:19:45,954 --> 01:19:47,169
Yeah, of course I do!

1350
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,829
So where do you want to go to first?

1351
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:51,820
Byojack! Are you okay?

1352
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,289
Yeah. It's nothing, I'll be fine.

1353
01:19:54,566 --> 01:19:55,996
You don't sound fine.

1354
01:19:56,807 --> 01:19:59,995
Listen. You can make our dream come true, World.

1355
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:03,098
There're all kinds of adventures
out there waiting for you!

1356
01:20:03,123 --> 01:20:06,483
Stuff that's bigger and wilder than I could ever imagine!

1357
01:20:06,991 --> 01:20:09,059
You mean you're not gonna come with me?

1358
01:20:09,115 --> 01:20:10,218
I can't go.

1359
01:20:11,829 --> 01:20:13,875
I've been like this since I was little.

1360
01:20:13,969 --> 01:20:15,312
I'd just get in the way.

1361
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:17,213
Hey, don't say things like that!

1362
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:18,137
That's for you.

1363
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,990
I doubt you want to stay on this tiny island forever.

1364
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:22,762
There's a lot of cool things to see.

1365
01:20:22,913 --> 01:20:26,378
So, get out of there and you can
live big enough for the both of us!

1366
01:20:26,457 --> 01:20:27,608
I don't think so.

1367
01:20:28,197 --> 01:20:29,014
No why!

1368
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:31,255
Because I'm not leaving here without you!

1369
01:20:32,111 --> 01:20:35,996
I'll go explore the world, and
you'll be right there with me!

1370
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:37,449
But I can't.

1371
01:20:37,474 --> 01:20:38,802
You don't have to be strong,

1372
01:20:38,827 --> 01:20:40,462
'cause I'll be there to protect you!

1373
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:42,571
Sailing together is the only way!

1374
01:20:42,959 --> 01:20:44,602
You really think so?

1375
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:49,813
Don't cry! You're the older brother. That's weird!

1376
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,677
Several years later, we finally left the island.

1377
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:58,544
All we wanted was adventure...

1378
01:20:58,664 --> 01:21:01,610
a chance to see all the wonders of the world.

1379
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,438
That's enough, World.

1380
01:21:26,497 --> 01:21:28,513
If you keep going like this, you're gonna kill 'em!

1381
01:21:30,616 --> 01:21:32,834
Don't ever mess with the Byrnndi brothers!

1382
01:21:32,985 --> 01:21:34,978
I'm not gonna say it twice!

1383
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:45,490
Sir! Vice-Captain Byojack's been kidnapped!

1384
01:21:45,515 --> 01:21:46,560
He's been what?

1385
01:22:16,568 --> 01:22:19,397
Yeah!

1386
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:32,435
We'll destroy anyone who stands in our way!

1387
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,169
I don't give a damn who you think you are!

1388
01:22:42,647 --> 01:22:44,761
We were supposed to be searching for freedom...

1389
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,237
the dream we had since we were kids.

1390
01:22:47,564 --> 01:22:49,709
But everyone else saw things differently.

1391
01:22:49,852 --> 01:22:51,902
To them, we were just pirates.

1392
01:22:52,069 --> 01:22:56,270
Eventually, the Navy and World
Government placed you on their wanted list.

1393
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,534
Then before we knew it, you had a terrifying reputation.

1394
01:22:59,877 --> 01:23:02,673
They called you Destroyer of the World.

1395
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,543
A submarine?

1396
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:10,213
That way we can travel underwater
and only surface when we need to.

1397
01:23:10,363 --> 01:23:12,401
Just think of all the fights we can avoid!

1398
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:16,842
Nowadays, since we have so many crew
members, we need to build a bigger ship anyway.

1399
01:23:17,031 --> 01:23:18,702
What sort of weapons should it have?

1400
01:23:19,009 --> 01:23:21,122
I want a giant cannon tacked on to it!

1401
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:23,697
The biggest that anyone's ever seen! Huge!

1402
01:23:23,722 --> 01:23:25,239
Why would we need such a thing?

1403
01:23:25,382 --> 01:23:28,608
If we'll be avoiding unnecessary
battles, then there's no point.

1404
01:23:29,695 --> 01:23:30,759
You've got it backwards.

1405
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:31,897
Think about it.

1406
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:35,806
If the ship has a cannon big and
strong enough to intimidate our foes,

1407
01:23:35,831 --> 01:23:40,152
combine that with my More-More power,
and no one's ever gonna want to attack us.

1408
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:42,900
Put that cannon on the ship and we'll never fight again.

1409
01:23:42,925 --> 01:23:43,752
Oh!

1410
01:23:44,036 --> 01:23:46,308
Then it's settled! I'll get right to work!

1411
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:48,692
We're finally building our dream ship!

1412
01:23:48,947 --> 01:23:52,197
Freedom! It's a symbol of our lifelong goal!

1413
01:23:53,993 --> 01:23:55,628
It's only a ship, brother.

1414
01:23:58,559 --> 01:24:00,355
That was 30 years ago.

1415
01:24:00,672 --> 01:24:03,639
We were all on the path to freedom at last.

1416
01:24:03,757 --> 01:24:08,343
And so we all went to work building
this ship, Groseade, to follow that hope.

1417
01:24:08,368 --> 01:24:12,686
This ship... we built it while you were
imprisoned because we had our dream in mind,

1418
01:24:12,837 --> 01:24:15,007
not so we could take down the World Government!

1419
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:15,990
Byojack.

1420
01:24:16,072 --> 01:24:18,260
Are you still thinkin' about that crap?

1421
01:24:19,367 --> 01:24:22,457
Then you can just sit right there and watch what happens.

1422
01:24:22,673 --> 01:24:24,526
And don't bother me anymore!

1423
01:24:25,462 --> 01:24:28,131
Our dream hasn't mattered for a long time now.

1424
01:24:28,748 --> 01:24:31,101
Certainly not since you all left me for dead!

1425
01:24:31,126 --> 01:24:34,248
I told you! That was all a misunderstanding!

1426
01:24:34,645 --> 01:24:36,431
Yeah, I know what you said!

1427
01:24:37,187 --> 01:24:39,604
Forget it. I don't care anymore.

1428
01:24:39,629 --> 01:24:40,942
World, wait!

1429
01:24:49,213 --> 01:24:51,682
Sorry, brother, this is all I can do.

1430
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:00,862
Luffy!

1431
01:25:01,107 --> 01:25:02,770
Guys! Are you okay?

1432
01:25:03,576 --> 01:25:05,753
I'll get you out! Just hold on a sec!

1433
01:25:07,371 --> 01:25:09,396
You've become quite the pest.

1434
01:25:09,983 --> 01:25:12,599
Why can't you just mind your own damned business?

1435
01:25:12,718 --> 01:25:14,427
You pathetic little brat!

1436
01:25:14,474 --> 01:25:16,675
You think you can kidnap my friends?

1437
01:25:16,707 --> 01:25:17,859
Not gonna happen!

1438
01:25:18,081 --> 01:25:21,974
Besides, if I can't beat up some sad old man,

1439
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:23,960
how can I protect my crew?

1440
01:25:24,404 --> 01:25:25,573
Your crew, huh?

1441
01:25:26,382 --> 01:25:28,941
Is that really what you're so stuck on?

1442
01:25:30,068 --> 01:25:31,824
You're so transparent.

1443
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:35,590
This is all because you couldn't
save your big brother, isn't it?

1444
01:25:36,336 --> 01:25:39,363
And where are these beloved crew mates of yours?

1445
01:25:39,707 --> 01:25:40,990
I pity them!

1446
01:25:44,851 --> 01:25:47,717
I'm gonna put an end to this in 30 seconds!

1447
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,843
You won't beat me twice.

1448
01:25:50,216 --> 01:25:52,036
More-More...

1449
01:25:52,234 --> 01:25:53,896
...Tenfold Shotgun!

1450
01:25:54,477 --> 01:25:56,755
Second Gear!

1451
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:04,690
Luffy!

1452
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:12,310
Looks like my prediction was off.

1453
01:26:13,254 --> 01:26:16,990
But I'm only gonna need ten seconds this time around.

1454
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:23,061
Hm? Are you begging for mercy?

1455
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,949
Even if you move ten times faster than normal,

1456
01:26:28,201 --> 01:26:30,793
it's not gonna matter if I'm holding on to you!

1457
01:26:31,029 --> 01:26:34,090
You think you're clever. We'll see.

1458
01:26:34,153 --> 01:26:36,536
More-More Thirty fold Speed!

1459
01:26:36,577 --> 01:26:38,029
Jet Pistol!

1460
01:26:39,336 --> 01:26:41,922
What's wrong? You still can't hit me?

1461
01:26:46,332 --> 01:26:47,030
Fool.

1462
01:26:47,321 --> 01:26:49,596
It's not just speed I command...

1463
01:26:52,021 --> 01:26:55,723
...but the overwhelming power that goes along with it!

1464
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,530
Fifty fold Speed!

1465
01:27:00,323 --> 01:27:02,064
Furious Hammer!

1466
01:27:03,395 --> 01:27:04,469
Oh, no!

1467
01:27:09,354 --> 01:27:11,652
Those attacks won't work on me.

1468
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:12,683
Huh?

1469
01:27:13,495 --> 01:27:14,571
I'm a rubber man!

1470
01:27:14,965 --> 01:27:17,507
Oh, yeah. How could I forget?

1471
01:27:17,675 --> 01:27:19,709
Get ready! Third Gear!

1472
01:27:24,443 --> 01:27:26,690
Giant Pistol!

1473
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:32,849
You'll always be too weak, kid.

1474
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:46,061
We'll see about that.

1475
01:27:46,743 --> 01:27:48,031
Come here!

1476
01:27:49,374 --> 01:27:51,266
Jet Pistol!

1477
01:27:51,551 --> 01:27:52,489
It doesn't matter.

1478
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:55,984
Use the Armament Haki all you want!

1479
01:27:57,566 --> 01:27:59,631
Jet Gatling!

1480
01:28:00,815 --> 01:28:02,377
The power is useless,

1481
01:28:02,532 --> 01:28:04,430
if you can't even hit me!

1482
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,402
Save your friends, huh?

1483
01:28:23,703 --> 01:28:24,736
And your brother?

1484
01:28:25,763 --> 01:28:28,686
Ha! You can't even save yourself!

1485
01:28:38,991 --> 01:28:40,641
We are out. we find exit.

1486
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:43,799
Yeah. Took us long enough! Good riddance to that crap!

1487
01:28:43,929 --> 01:28:47,355
Time for us to blow this joint.
Straw Hat'll be fine on his own.

1488
01:28:47,444 --> 01:28:48,858
You know, they can hear you.

1489
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:50,392
What? Oh, uh.

1490
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:51,949
What a tragedy!

1491
01:28:52,013 --> 01:28:54,842
Without me, World must be beating Straw Hat to a pulp!

1492
01:28:55,238 --> 01:28:58,147
If only I hadn't taken that wrong turn,

1493
01:28:58,172 --> 01:29:00,880
Sorry to interrupt, Captain, but what's that?

1494
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:01,642
Huh?

1495
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:03,806
It's a fleet of Navy ships!

1496
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:06,070
But why would the Navy show up here?

1497
01:29:06,095 --> 01:29:08,752
Because you told us to contact the Navy.

1498
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,421
Ah. I did, didn't I?

1499
01:29:10,715 --> 01:29:16,771
Hey! I'm right over here! The newest warlord, Buggy,
is now fighting the Destroyer of the World himself!

1500
01:29:16,896 --> 01:29:20,668
That's right... the new warlord, Buggy, right here!

1501
01:29:22,172 --> 01:29:24,723
Somebody is frantically waving his hands at us.

1502
01:29:24,748 --> 01:29:26,281
What do you think we should do, sir?

1503
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:29,172
What else? All ships, start firing!

1504
01:29:29,434 --> 01:29:32,206
All ships, commence firing!

1505
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:33,166
Eh?

1506
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:42,818
It is terrible.

1507
01:29:42,972 --> 01:29:45,849
The Navy will discover Luffy's whereabouts soon!

1508
01:29:46,252 --> 01:29:48,549
Circle the ship around back! Go!

1509
01:29:48,614 --> 01:29:49,034
Right!

1510
01:29:52,702 --> 01:29:53,958
What's goin' on now?

1511
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:57,050
The Navy's here,

1512
01:29:57,496 --> 01:30:00,601
and they're launching an all-out attack on our ship!

1513
01:30:07,421 --> 01:30:08,408
The Navy.

1514
01:30:14,131 --> 01:30:18,190
Hey, if they're trying to sink the
whole place, why are we even here?

1515
01:30:18,773 --> 01:30:21,065
Kind of a waste of our time, isn't it?

1516
01:30:31,036 --> 01:30:31,765
Perfect!

1517
01:30:33,835 --> 01:30:35,071
What now, World?

1518
01:30:35,366 --> 01:30:37,966
I didn't expect the Navy to fall into our lap!

1519
01:30:38,379 --> 01:30:39,934
Time to change our plan!

1520
01:30:40,087 --> 01:30:44,233
We've got the perfect opportunity to hit
'em where it really hurts! Prepare the cannon!

1521
01:30:44,258 --> 01:30:45,339
Are you mad?

1522
01:30:45,521 --> 01:30:50,113
If we fire from such a close range, our
whole ship's going to sink from the impact!

1523
01:30:51,051 --> 01:30:53,402
Who cares? Just get it ready!

1524
01:30:53,545 --> 01:30:54,825
But I thought the ship was...

1525
01:30:54,888 --> 01:30:57,152
Was what, a symbol of our freedom?

1526
01:30:58,837 --> 01:31:00,147
Don't you get it?

1527
01:31:01,268 --> 01:31:04,224
The ship's just a tool for getting what I want!

1528
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:07,911
The rest of you always clung to your foolish dreams.

1529
01:31:08,387 --> 01:31:12,670
But I made up my mind long ago,
even before I escaped Impel Down.

1530
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:15,410
Then you guys picked me up in this ship,

1531
01:31:15,743 --> 01:31:17,699
and I saw that massive cannon.

1532
01:31:18,111 --> 01:31:20,274
So I did what anyone else would do.

1533
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:24,977
I decided to take advantage of the
situation and use it to achieve my own goals!

1534
01:31:25,461 --> 01:31:26,939
It's not like you can blame me.

1535
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:28,742
You did a good job building it!

1536
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:30,562
You've been using us all along!

1537
01:31:30,752 --> 01:31:34,032
Is getting revenge against the
World Government? Are you care about?

1538
01:31:34,057 --> 01:31:37,456
And so what if it is? I don't care about the ship.

1539
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:41,604
And I sure as hell don't give a damn
about what happens to you dirty traitors!

1540
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,707
But Gairam, and Nightin, and Sebastian, too.

1541
01:31:44,902 --> 01:31:46,690
They fought for you because you're their friend!

1542
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:47,411
You're right.

1543
01:31:48,151 --> 01:31:51,566
I haven't trusted you or anyone
else since the very beginning!

1544
01:31:51,744 --> 01:31:54,389
I don't really need any of you, and I never did!

1545
01:31:54,532 --> 01:31:58,123
No way. That's not the brother I know.

1546
01:31:58,297 --> 01:32:00,734
You lot aren't any different from the ship.

1547
01:32:02,317 --> 01:32:04,663
Just a bunch of tools, and nothing more!

1548
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,965
World! No!

1549
01:32:07,036 --> 01:32:08,289
You maybe are my brother,

1550
01:32:08,365 --> 01:32:12,077
but if you can't follow orders, then I don't need you!

1551
01:32:15,103 --> 01:32:15,801
Huh?

1552
01:32:17,001 --> 01:32:20,027
A bunch of tools? Is that what you said?

1553
01:32:21,153 --> 01:32:23,117
That's what you think of your friends?

1554
01:32:23,243 --> 01:32:25,787
Yeah. What's it to you, huh?

1555
01:32:26,121 --> 01:32:29,155
Take it back!

1556
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:37,848
Luffy!

1557
01:32:39,152 --> 01:32:42,240
Hurry! Grab your sisters and get outta here, now!

1558
01:32:45,543 --> 01:32:46,720
The Pirate Empress?

1559
01:32:46,759 --> 01:32:49,621
Me and this guy have unfinished business!

1560
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:51,190
Mm...

1561
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:54,206
Mm.

1562
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:58,781
Mari! Sonia! Let's go!

1563
01:32:58,868 --> 01:32:59,934
Big Sis!

1564
01:33:00,426 --> 01:33:04,201
Careful! As soon as you've taken care
of him, come straight back to the ship!

1565
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:05,592
Right!

1566
01:33:05,814 --> 01:33:09,309
It doesn't matter. I don't need
the Empress as a hostage anymore.

1567
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:12,645
Now, you wanna keep fighting, go right ahead.

1568
01:33:19,367 --> 01:33:21,441
If you're sayin' a prayer, don't bother.

1569
01:33:21,709 --> 01:33:23,141
Nobody can save you now.

1570
01:33:23,647 --> 01:33:25,145
Who's gonna save you?

1571
01:33:25,365 --> 01:33:27,304
You cocky little brat!

1572
01:33:31,195 --> 01:33:32,588
I'm not losing!

1573
01:33:32,752 --> 01:33:35,026
Not to a jerk like you!

1574
01:33:38,545 --> 01:33:42,691
Friends are more than just tools!

1575
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:48,579
There's nothing wrong with abandoning the useless!

1576
01:33:48,881 --> 01:33:52,616
After all, you left your brother to die at Marine ford.

1577
01:34:01,618 --> 01:34:02,991
Get it through your head.

1578
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,289
It's already over and you failed completely.

1579
01:34:06,742 --> 01:34:09,666
You couldn't protect your brother because you're weak.

1580
01:34:11,287 --> 01:34:12,988
You may be right.

1581
01:34:13,289 --> 01:34:13,996
Hm?

1582
01:34:14,402 --> 01:34:16,250
I was weak.

1583
01:34:17,601 --> 01:34:19,635
I couldn't save Ace's life.

1584
01:34:20,048 --> 01:34:23,873
But I'm not dead yet, and I still have my crew!

1585
01:34:24,214 --> 01:34:27,225
Friends who are waiting for me... who believe in me!

1586
01:34:27,606 --> 01:34:29,528
Enough already!

1587
01:34:31,817 --> 01:34:34,414
I will protect my friends!

1588
01:34:35,422 --> 01:34:38,474
And I will become King of the Pirates!

1589
01:34:45,322 --> 01:34:46,330
Brother!

1590
01:34:48,174 --> 01:34:50,993
But before I do that, I'm takin' you out!

1591
01:34:51,257 --> 01:34:55,823
You're stubborn, but that's not enough to beat me.

1592
01:34:58,564 --> 01:35:02,396
Gum-Gum Jet Gatling!

1593
01:35:02,695 --> 01:35:05,263
More-More Hundredfold Speed!

1594
01:35:15,806 --> 01:35:17,848
Time to finish you!

1595
01:35:32,117 --> 01:35:35,086
Gum-Gum Red Hawk!

1596
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:48,419
That fire... like Ace.

1597
01:35:53,888 --> 01:35:57,788
I promised Rayleigh and Hancock that I'd make it back.

1598
01:35:58,232 --> 01:36:01,689
So I'm not gonna die here. My friends are waiting for me!

1599
01:36:08,998 --> 01:36:13,200
Why did those numb skulls start firing? It's
not like the Navy didn't know we were there, right?

1600
01:36:13,383 --> 01:36:17,245
I think I can deal with hurt feelings
as long as we live to see another day!

1601
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,683
Come on, men, put your backs into it!

1602
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:23,044
And you there, holding my legs,
don't you dare get them wet!

1603
01:36:23,132 --> 01:36:24,348
No soggy feet!

1604
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:25,905
I'm trying my best!

1605
01:36:25,944 --> 01:36:28,155
We can sort things out with the Navy later!

1606
01:36:28,218 --> 01:36:29,116
Let's go!

1607
01:36:29,147 --> 01:36:30,639
Aye, aye!

1608
01:36:35,867 --> 01:36:39,330
Luffy, please return to me safely!

1609
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:01,359
What are you doing?

1610
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,818
If they think they've beaten me,

1611
01:37:03,872 --> 01:37:05,604
they're badly mistaken.

1612
01:37:06,748 --> 01:37:08,409
Our friends were all defeated.

1613
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:09,943
This ship's destroyed.

1614
01:37:10,522 --> 01:37:12,778
You've suffered injuries all over your body.

1615
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:16,640
Brother, there's nothing left to do but run away!

1616
01:37:16,815 --> 01:37:20,541
I won't be satisfied unless I
fire the cannon at least once.

1617
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:23,418
And the Navy is the perfect target.

1618
01:37:23,965 --> 01:37:26,920
The cannon? You're really gonna use it?

1619
01:37:27,222 --> 01:37:29,311
I was gonna use it all along.

1620
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:34,088
I'm sorry I betrayed your
trust, but that's the ugly truth.

1621
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:38,686
Still, once upon a time you guys betrayed me, too.

1622
01:37:40,482 --> 01:37:42,968
Well, then. Consider us even.

1623
01:37:42,993 --> 01:37:44,258
I feared this.

1624
01:37:44,408 --> 01:37:46,728
For all these years, you've held a grudge!

1625
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:47,762
But, that was...

1626
01:37:47,787 --> 01:37:50,350
I was sealed away in ice for all that time!

1627
01:37:50,689 --> 01:37:53,339
For me, your betrayal was just like yesterday.

1628
01:37:55,486 --> 01:38:00,360
You may have put it behind you, but I will never forget.

1629
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:04,300
World, I'm sorry.

1630
01:38:07,036 --> 01:38:08,974
How do I get outta this place?

1631
01:38:30,146 --> 01:38:30,909
Admiral.

1632
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:33,958
A giant cannon just emerged,
and it's pointing right at us!

1633
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:36,031
Meteor Volcano!

1634
01:38:41,272 --> 01:38:42,149
What now?

1635
01:38:45,019 --> 01:38:46,609
The least I can do...

1636
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:48,736
...is land one hit!

1637
01:39:10,198 --> 01:39:14,552
Taste my More-More Hundredfold Cannon!

1638
01:39:20,217 --> 01:39:22,289
Remember my name!

1639
01:39:22,448 --> 01:39:26,585
It's Byrnndi World! Cower before me!

1640
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:33,276
Wha...? Evacuate!

1641
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:52,994
Luffy!

1642
01:40:19,018 --> 01:40:22,193
Oh, no. Where are you, my beloved?

1643
01:40:22,218 --> 01:40:24,514
Don't worry! I'm sure he'll be just fine!

1644
01:40:32,205 --> 01:40:33,324
World...

1645
01:40:36,367 --> 01:40:38,982
It's only a matter of time before we sink.

1646
01:40:39,859 --> 01:40:41,976
The World Pirates have lost.

1647
01:40:46,021 --> 01:40:48,023
Let's start over, World.

1648
01:40:48,689 --> 01:40:50,092
Just the two of us.

1649
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:55,867
We'll sail away, just like we planned, and be free.

1650
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:04,230
Luffy!

1651
01:41:26,177 --> 01:41:28,155
Oh, no! He's not gonna make it!

1652
01:41:32,413 --> 01:41:33,627
Yes, he will!

1653
01:41:35,748 --> 01:41:36,789
Hey!

1654
01:41:37,289 --> 01:41:38,696
Luffy!

1655
01:41:39,255 --> 01:41:42,127
Thank goodness! I'm so happy you're alive!

1656
01:42:00,022 --> 01:42:01,682
What are you smiling at?

1657
01:42:02,778 --> 01:42:04,032
Who knows?

1658
01:42:04,525 --> 01:42:05,555
You weirdo.

1659
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:09,728
Hope you got what you wanted... whatever it was.

1660
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,106
Well, Luffy.

1661
01:42:41,169 --> 01:42:44,163
You've learned the basics of
Haki, all that's left is to practice.

1662
01:42:44,188 --> 01:42:45,737
And while I'd love to stick around,

1663
01:42:45,817 --> 01:42:47,971
there's really nothing more for me to teach you.

1664
01:42:48,389 --> 01:42:49,278
There is it.

1665
01:42:49,654 --> 01:42:52,736
I think I may return to Sabaody and check up on Shakky.

1666
01:42:53,062 --> 01:42:54,316
Are you staying here?

1667
01:42:55,365 --> 01:42:59,448
Well, it's only a year and a half
since I sent out that message to my crew.

1668
01:43:00,019 --> 01:43:01,711
3D2Y.

1669
01:43:03,032 --> 01:43:06,258
Two years later instead of three days later, right?

1670
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,158
If we want to continue our journey,

1671
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:10,888
we all needed to get stronger.

1672
01:43:12,423 --> 01:43:15,099
After what happened, I'm sure they feel the same way.

1673
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:18,405
You still got six months. That's plenty of time.

1674
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:19,603
Yeah.

1675
01:43:19,937 --> 01:43:23,396
I can't wait to see how everyone
else has changed after two years!

1676
01:43:23,634 --> 01:43:25,430
I bet they'll all be super strong.

1677
01:43:25,485 --> 01:43:27,437
And that makes me wanna keep working.

1678
01:43:27,582 --> 01:43:28,701
So that's it then!

1679
01:43:28,948 --> 01:43:31,405
I'll stay here and keep training till time's up!

1680
01:43:31,547 --> 01:43:34,884
Good. Just keep on improving your Haki skills.

1681
01:43:34,986 --> 01:43:37,303
Soon, you'll be able to control it as you like.

1682
01:43:37,473 --> 01:43:38,417
You got it!

1683
01:43:39,769 --> 01:43:42,695
I'll see you back on Sabaody in six months then.

1684
01:43:44,688 --> 01:43:46,131
Hey, Rayleigh, thank you!

1685
01:43:59,133 --> 01:44:01,201
It's been two years already.

1686
01:44:02,189 --> 01:44:04,443
Right! Let's go!

1687
01:44:07,878 --> 01:44:08,728
Hi, Sunny.

1688
01:44:09,021 --> 01:44:11,454
Sorry to keep you waiting. I hope you weren't lonely.

1689
01:44:11,962 --> 01:44:15,347
Wow! Who is that gorgeous lady?

1690
01:44:15,585 --> 01:44:18,811
It's Robin, of course! Our super archaeologist!

1691
01:44:19,129 --> 01:44:21,457
And boy, did I ever miss you!

1692
01:44:21,949 --> 01:44:24,195
You haven't changed, Franky!

1693
01:44:24,481 --> 01:44:27,409
Why you bein' such a jerk? I just wanna fish.

1694
01:44:27,591 --> 01:44:32,261
Well, too bad, 'cause you can't! Everyone's meeting
on the ship, so you don't get to run off on your own!

1695
01:44:32,372 --> 01:44:33,453
It's Usopp!

1696
01:44:33,699 --> 01:44:35,765
You got so big! Just look at you!

1697
01:44:35,844 --> 01:44:36,797
You're doing ok!

1698
01:44:36,822 --> 01:44:40,112
So cuddly! I bet the lady reindeers adore you!

1699
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:41,207
I sure have missed you!

1700
01:44:41,232 --> 01:44:42,287
Uh, Nami?

1701
01:44:42,312 --> 01:44:42,901
Uh-huh?

1702
01:44:45,569 --> 01:44:46,806
Thank you for the ride.

1703
01:44:46,831 --> 01:44:49,507
That was impeccable timing I must say!

1704
01:44:52,107 --> 01:44:53,759
Listen up, you guys.

1705
01:44:53,784 --> 01:44:55,489
There's a lot of things I wanna say,

1706
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:57,248
but we don't have a whole lotta time.

1707
01:44:57,366 --> 01:44:58,591
These two years,

1708
01:44:59,155 --> 01:45:01,114
what I made you do was selfish,

1709
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:03,016
so thanks for puttin'' up with it.

1710
01:45:03,182 --> 01:45:05,542
You make it sound like that's never happened before.

1711
01:45:05,567 --> 01:45:09,071
No joke! You've always been a selfish piece of work!

1712
01:45:10,372 --> 01:45:13,540
Let's set sail!

1713
01:45:13,746 --> 01:45:15,932
Yeah!
