That's like what they do in

00:05:31.323 --> 00:05:33.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
What you should be
seeing on your devices

00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:35.926 position:10% line:89% align:start
is intel from the pill bug.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
This gang has entered
Japan illegally,

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:40.030 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I haven't figured out how.

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:42.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
I count six foreigners
and a Japanese man

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:44.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
who may be a black
market gun runner.

00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:47.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
A basic Hue check raised
red flags on all of them.

00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:50.208 position:7% line:83% align:start
So I'm pretty sure if we were
to scan them with our Dominators

00:05:50.242 --> 00:05:53.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
we'd get the exact same results.

00:05:53.043 --> 00:05:55.514 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, what's our
engagement plan, then?

00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:58.417 position:16% line:83% align:start
First, we use Drones to
block the parking lot entrance.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.584 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then we split into two teams

00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:03.020 position:10% line:83% align:start
and use the emergency stairs
and elevator to go under.

00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:05.190 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Scans have already confirmed

00:06:05.223 --> 00:06:08.593 position:7% line:83% align:start
there aren't any traps waiting
for us at either entrance.

00:06:08.627 --> 00:06:11.329 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, Mister Ginoza
and Ms. Kunizuka

00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:14.599 position:21% line:83% align:start
will go with me and
enter from the stairs.

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:18.236 position:7% line:83% align:start
As for you, Inspector. Put two
Drones in the lead position,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.972 position:10% line:83% align:start
then enter from the elevator
with Sugo and Hinakawa.

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:23.642 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MIKA]
Roger that.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] My team will
make the first move.

00:06:25.644 --> 00:06:28.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll use flash grenades
and then charge in,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
putting all of their
attention on us.

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:31.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
At the same time,

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.984 position:21% line:83% align:start
Team Shimotsuki will
come from the back.

00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:35.520 position:27% line:83% align:start
This way we can
attack on both sides

00:06:35.554 --> 00:06:38.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
and hopefully arrest
them in one fell swoop.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.226 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SUGO]
Flash grenades, huh?

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.695 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's a pretty cautious
move, Inspector.

00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:45.664 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] According to
the pill bug's report,

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.633 position:19% line:83% align:start
they're heavily armed
with automatic rifles.

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:50.268 position:66% line:89% align:start
So then...

00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:52.270 position:27% line:83% align:start
If they're able
to counter-attack,

00:06:52.304 --> 00:06:55.106 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's likely that some
of us will be injured.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.676 position:13% line:89% align:start
Move with extreme caution.

Based on what we've confiscated,
someone with complete knowledge

00:13:51.055 --> 00:13:53.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
of our security systems

Your point being?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.498 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] My point is, I think
you're up to something unsavory.

00:14:00.531 --> 00:14:01.866 position:35% line:89% align:start
Inspector,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
we're moving forward with
a number of new projects.

00:14:04.936 --> 00:14:06.704 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whether or not they're "savory"

00:14:06.738 --> 00:14:09.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
depends upon how
you look at them.

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:13.978 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm sure.

00:14:14.012 --> 00:14:16.547 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll talk after
the interrogation.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.768 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MIKA]
Chief?

00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:40.939 position:10% line:83% align:start
Inspector Shimotsuki. Please
come to my office, at once.

[KAORI]
Yup.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:56.188 position:19% line:89% align:start
However, he's so busy.

00:14:57.289 --> 00:14:58.990 position:13% line:89% align:start
You know how work can be.

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:01.659 position:19% line:83% align:start
So the actual wedding
won't be for a while.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
You'll love him. I can't wait

00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:08.800 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:15:12.937 --> 00:15:13.905 position:27% line:89% align:start
Congratulations.

00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:16.841 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Akane.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KAORI] We got matched up
through the Sibyl System.

00:15:20.645 --> 00:15:23.748 position:7% line:83% align:start
All this time, I'd held off on
using it, but I have to admit,

00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:27.119 position:7% line:83% align:start
it did a better job of finding
me a partner than I ever have.

00:15:27.152 --> 00:15:31.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
Anyway, it wasn't too long
before we let our parents know.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.958 position:13% line:89% align:start
It hasn't all been smooth.

00:15:33.992 --> 00:15:37.762 position:13% line:83% align:start
But ups and downs in love,
that's just normal.

00:15:37.795 --> 00:15:39.664 position:21% line:89% align:start
I mean, big picture.

00:15:39.697 --> 00:15:43.168 position:13% line:83% align:start
When Sibyl says it's found
the perfect man for you...

00:15:43.202 --> 00:15:47.005 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's like...
who am I to argue, right?

00:15:47.038 --> 00:15:48.539 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
You'll be fine.

00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:56.781 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KAORI] We really are blessed
to live in such peaceful times.

00:15:56.814 --> 00:16:00.718 position:19% line:83% align:start

the path to true happiness

00:16:05.957 --> 00:16:09.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
for every single person
in Japan, she sees that path

00:16:09.361 --> 00:16:12.764 position:10% line:83% align:start
clearer than they could ever
hope to see it themselves.

00:16:12.797 --> 00:16:14.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm starting to think, one day,

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:19.937 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sibyl might actually save
everyone in the whole world.

00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:21.806 position:27% line:89% align:start
I-I don't know.

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.342 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NEWS ORB] And now, we turn
to the Sibyl System

Sibyl's test run

00:16:29.647 --> 00:16:31.883 position:13% line:83% align:start

See? Just like I said.

Before I start,

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.057 position:24% line:83% align:start

Don't tell anyone we

Point is, in my position,

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.036 position:13% line:89% align:start

you have to find a way to stall.

[AKANE]
Well? Can you?!

00:18:40.811 --> 00:18:42.080 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHION]
I can't.

00:18:42.114 --> 00:18:45.450 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's too late. I'm sorry, Akane.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:51.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] You did a memory
scoop for the interrogation?

00:18:51.323 --> 00:18:52.924 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why would you do that?

Please, don't be mad.

It was the Chief's orders.

00:18:57.062 --> 00:19:00.299 position:24% line:83% align:start
Analyst Karanomori
was only doing her job.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.803 position:13% line:83% align:start
The memory scoop confirmed
he's a latent criminal.

00:19:05.836 --> 00:19:09.208 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not like it's illegal.
Just unprecedented.

Oh, no.

00:19:23.054 --> 00:19:25.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MIKA] We did use
some neurological drugs

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.058 position:21% line:83% align:start
in order to improve
brain wave detection.

[AKANE gasps]

00:19:28.327 --> 00:19:30.795 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're talking about

00:19:30.828 --> 00:19:32.797 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a major threat.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.765 position:13% line:89% align:start
He was a latent criminal.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.002 position:13% line:83% align:start
Civil rights aren't a big
concern in a case like this one.

00:19:38.035 --> 00:19:40.539 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:19:40.572 --> 00:19:41.573 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
It was?

00:19:41.607 --> 00:19:44.476 position:24% line:83% align:start

The Chief wants to see you.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:47.312 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] Why did you
order Inspector Shimotsuki

00:19:47.346 --> 00:19:48.879 position:24% line:89% align:start
to do that scoop?

That's ridiculous!

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.053 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KASEI] It's necessary...
under the circumstances.

00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:58.090 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here, look at this.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.932 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:20:09.934 --> 00:20:13.372 position:13% line:83% align:start

he was your first subordinate.

Those foreign terrorists

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
you apprehended and
we "interrogated."

00:20:22.547 --> 00:20:25.883 position:13% line:83% align:start
We found memories of them
working closely with this man,

00:20:25.916 --> 00:20:28.553 position:7% line:89% align:start
who went AWOL three years ago.

00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:31.590 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't you find that interesting?

00:20:31.623 --> 00:20:33.458 position:24% line:83% align:start
I believe that in
the intervening years,

00:20:33.492 --> 00:20:36.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
Shinya Kogami has turned
completely to crime,

00:20:36.428 --> 00:20:38.297 position:24% line:89% align:start
and now terrorism.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
We also found how they were able
to enter Japan. It was SEAUn.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.969 position:16% line:83% align:start
The illegals we captured
were heavily involved

00:20:45.002 --> 00:20:48.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
in anti-government
terrorism in that region.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.876 position:13% line:83% align:start
We have high level ties to
the Southeast Asian UN now.

00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:53.412 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're exporting Sibyl.

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:55.314 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's right. As a test to see

00:20:55.347 --> 00:20:58.550 position:7% line:83% align:start
if Sibyl can remotely monitor
people thousands of miles away,

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.286 position:16% line:83% align:start
they've built a special
administrative district.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.587 position:5% line:89% align:start
The whole of their capital city,

00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:06.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
the man-made island
of Shambhala Float.

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:10.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, the mainland is still
in a state of internal conflict.

00:21:10.128 --> 00:21:12.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
And increasingly,
the Drones responsible

00:21:12.264 --> 00:21:13.864 position:7% line:89% align:start
for defending Shambhala Float

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.867 position:19% line:83% align:start

and getting shot down.

00:21:19.371 --> 00:21:22.840 position:13% line:83% align:start

Kogami quite a bit, too.

00:21:23.675 --> 00:21:26.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
There are some hunters

the prey they hunt.

00:21:30.948 --> 00:21:33.652 position:10% line:83% align:start
We don't know how he escaped
Japan three years ago,

00:21:33.685 --> 00:21:35.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
but suppose that
really is Kogami

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:38.457 position:24% line:83% align:start
hiding out in the
turmoil of the SEAUn.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.890 position:19% line:89% align:start
And using it as a base

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:42.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
from which to send
armed terrorists here.

00:21:42.694 --> 00:21:45.263 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a good way to
attack the Sibyl System.

Don't you agree, Inspector?

00:21:47.699 --> 00:21:50.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Enforcer Kogami
would never do that.

00:21:50.968 --> 00:21:52.002 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KASEI]
Then how do you explain

00:21:52.036 --> 00:21:54.172 position:30% line:83% align:start
this brainwave
composite picture?

00:21:55.173 --> 00:21:58.008 position:19% line:83% align:start
Kogami may've crossed
paths with them.

00:21:58.042 --> 00:22:01.011 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe he does have a connection
to the terrorist group.

00:22:01.045 --> 00:22:03.682 position:16% line:83% align:start
But that said, we still
have no definitive proof

00:22:03.715 --> 00:22:06.418 position:5% line:89% align:start
he's become a criminal himself.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:09.154 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our next step should
be an investigation

00:22:09.187 --> 00:22:11.021 position:19% line:89% align:start
to uncover the truth.

00:22:17.562 --> 00:22:19.064 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] It didn't take
long to figure out

00:22:19.097 --> 00:22:21.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
the country you guys came from.

00:22:21.199 --> 00:22:24.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why'd you come to
Japan from SEAUn?

00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:26.304 position:10% line:83% align:start
Does it have something to do
with the Japanese government

00:22:26.338 --> 00:22:28.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
exporting the Sibyl
System to you?

00:22:31.743 --> 00:22:33.478 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
If you won't answer that,

00:22:33.512 --> 00:22:36.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
maybe you can tell
me about this man.

00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:40.152 position:13% line:83% align:start
And if you refuse to talk
to me, someone else will.

00:22:44.222 --> 00:22:47.292 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ask whoever you want, lady.
No one's talking to you.

00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:48.427 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Is that so?

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.297 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're the insane ones.
You lost sight of true justice

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
when you handed over our
fates to a computer oracle.

00:22:57.235 --> 00:23:00.572 position:5% line:83% align:start
[MA] Whatever you get out of us
won't make sense to you, anyway.

[AKANE grunts]

00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:13.552 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SAIGA] Would Shinya Kogami
provide his talents

00:23:13.585 --> 00:23:15.654 position:13% line:89% align:start
to a group of terrorists?

00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:18.123 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Yes. Not leading them, though.

00:23:18.156 --> 00:23:20.358 position:24% line:83% align:start
More like, serving
as a consultant.

00:23:20.392 --> 00:23:21.560 position:13% line:89% align:start
Helping to organize them,

00:23:21.593 --> 00:23:24.529 position:27% line:83% align:start
offering advice
on their strategy.

00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:27.699 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you think Kogami is capable
of being something like that?

00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:32.270 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SAIGA] So... basically
a kind of inspiration,

00:23:32.304 --> 00:23:34.339 position:19% line:89% align:start
like Shogo Makishima.

00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:35.407 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Yes.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.176 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SAIGA] I really want
to say that's impossible.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.178 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I think my fond memories

00:23:40.212 --> 00:23:42.647 position:24% line:83% align:start
for Kogami may be
clouding that judgment.

00:23:44.483 --> 00:23:46.418 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SAIGA] Given what you've
said of his recent actions,

00:23:46.451 --> 00:23:49.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't predict his
behavior anymore.

00:23:49.454 --> 00:23:50.589 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
But...

00:23:50.622 --> 00:23:53.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SAIGA] Some people try to
find meaning in their lives

00:23:53.191 --> 00:23:55.193 position:19% line:83% align:start
by fitting themselves
into a mold,

00:23:55.227 --> 00:23:57.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
or role they can
play in society.

00:23:57.496 --> 00:23:59.164 position:5% line:89% align:start
And, in turn, that's why you see

00:23:59.197 --> 00:24:01.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
so many devote their
lives to their work.

00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:06.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SAIGA] Kogami used to live this
way when he was an Enforcer.

00:24:08.373 --> 00:24:10.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
But, while chasing
after a target

00:24:10.442 --> 00:24:14.279 position:10% line:83% align:start
who didn't fit into society
at all, that being Makishima,

00:24:14.312 --> 00:24:17.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
he, too, ultimately
broke free from a mold.

00:24:17.782 --> 00:24:20.352 position:10% line:89% align:start
The mold that was his duty.

00:24:25.524 --> 00:24:29.394 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KASEI] Hm? You're applying
for an investigation abroad?

00:24:29.427 --> 00:24:30.629 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Yes.

00:24:30.662 --> 00:24:33.832 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KASEI]
You're going to SEAUn yourself?

00:24:33.865 --> 00:24:36.368 position:13% line:83% align:start
Security in the Shambhala
Float special district

00:24:36.401 --> 00:24:38.270 position:10% line:89% align:start
is run by the Sibyl System.

00:24:38.303 --> 00:24:40.272 position:27% line:83% align:start
That is to say,
police authority there

00:24:40.305 --> 00:24:43.074 position:13% line:83% align:start
lies with the Ministry of
Welfare here in Japan.

00:24:43.108 --> 00:24:46.244 position:21% line:83% align:start
So. You'll find your
actions legally protected

00:24:46.278 --> 00:24:48.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
by right of the
Public Safety Bureau.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.582 position:7% line:89% align:start
A subsidiary of the Ministry.

00:24:50.615 --> 00:24:51.850 position:35% line:89% align:start
One catch.

00:24:51.883 --> 00:24:55.620 position:7% line:83% align:start
Outside the special district,
your privileges won't matter.

00:24:55.654 --> 00:24:58.156 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because outside the walls
of Shambhala Float,

00:24:58.189 --> 00:25:00.592 position:21% line:89% align:start
they respect no law.

00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:02.260 position:10% line:89% align:start
Your investigation of Kogami

00:25:02.294 --> 00:25:05.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
will have to be an
independent endeavor.

00:25:05.397 --> 00:25:07.599 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do you understand?

00:25:07.632 --> 00:25:09.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know the risk.

00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:11.836 position:16% line:83% align:start

I'm fine by myself.

00:25:23.381 --> 00:25:24.449 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KASEI]
To be frank,

00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:27.185 position:10% line:83% align:start
considering the relationship
between you and "us,"

00:25:27.218 --> 00:25:29.554 position:7% line:89% align:start
your traveling alone is ideal.

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:35.860 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GINOZA]
For the record,

00:25:35.894 --> 00:25:38.863 position:19% line:83% align:start
they denied my request
to go with you.

00:25:38.897 --> 00:25:40.632 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's no surprise.

00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:44.569 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sending an Inspector overseas
is already unusual enough.

00:25:44.603 --> 00:25:47.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
An Enforcer's where
they draw the line.

I need a favor.

00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:51.443 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sure.

00:25:51.476 --> 00:25:53.378 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you do find Shinya.

00:25:53.411 --> 00:25:57.148 position:19% line:83% align:start
Go right up to him and
punch him in the face for me.

00:25:59.417 --> 00:26:01.319 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm not gonna hit him.

00:26:01.353 --> 00:26:03.154 position:35% line:89% align:start
Why? Uh...

00:26:05.757 --> 00:26:10.195 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I find him, I'll arrest him
and bring him back to you.

00:26:10.228 --> 00:26:11.162 position:13% line:89% align:start
Then you can have the fun

00:26:11.196 --> 00:26:13.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
of working him over
yourself, Mister Ginoza.

[SAIGA] Despite countless
cultures' best efforts,

00:27:15.694 --> 00:27:18.296 position:7% line:83% align:start
many different order and value

into chaos over the millennia.

00:27:20.465 --> 00:27:21.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
The common thread
in those failures

00:27:21.966 --> 00:27:25.470 position:10% line:83% align:start
being that most people feel
compelled to live like animals,

00:27:25.503 --> 00:27:28.306 position:19% line:83% align:start
allowing themselves to
be ruled by their desires.

be either tamed

within the Sibyl System's cage,

00:27:32.377 --> 00:27:34.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
or to live in a state
of nature and be free

by committing yourself only
to the laws of the jungle.

Neither is ideal.

In this setting, letting
instinct and willpower

00:27:49.794 --> 00:27:53.364 position:10% line:83% align:start
alone be your guide, to take
control of your own fate

00:27:53.398 --> 00:27:55.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
and live under your
own value system

must seem like the most
intoxicating of lures.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.906 position:13% line:83% align:start
Especially to those who're
driven into such a corner

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
that they've even become willing

special network bandwidth

00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:14.946 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] I'm surprised Chairman
Hang accepted a system

00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:15.914 position:13% line:89% align:start
where the main requirement

00:29:15.947 --> 00:29:19.050 position:21% line:83% align:start
is he be kept in the
dark on most details.

00:29:19.084 --> 00:29:20.852 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KASEI] It just shows
how desperate they are

00:29:20.885 --> 00:29:24.656 position:16% line:83% align:start
to restore public safety
as quickly as possible.

00:29:24.689 --> 00:29:26.658 position:16% line:89% align:start
This'll be good for you.

00:29:26.691 --> 00:29:28.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll see for yourself
how hard it is

00:29:28.459 --> 00:29:32.064 position:10% line:83% align:start
for countries outside Japan
to maintain internal peace.

00:29:32.097 --> 00:29:34.866 position:24% line:83% align:start
And with that view
will come understanding

00:29:34.899 --> 00:29:36.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
of the great value to be had

00:29:36.935 --> 00:29:40.471 position:19% line:83% align:start
in controlling society
with the Sibyl System.

Please fasten your seatbelts

00:29:59.691 --> 00:30:01.993 position:35% line:83% align:start
into SEAUn

I'm Nicholas Wong, ma'am.

00:30:31.223 --> 00:30:33.958 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm Captain of the Union
Military Police force.

00:30:33.992 --> 00:30:36.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I assume you must be
Inspector Akane Tsunemori

00:30:36.928 --> 00:30:39.198 position:13% line:83% align:start
from the Japanese Ministry
of Health and Welfare.

00:30:39.231 --> 00:30:40.431 position:41% line:89% align:start
I am.

00:30:43.168 --> 00:30:46.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then welcome to the
Southeast Asian UN.

00:30:46.738 --> 00:30:49.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're happy to have
both you and Sibyl.

[NICHOLAS]
Does our country shock you?

00:30:54.045 --> 00:30:55.214 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
No.

00:30:55.247 --> 00:30:58.716 position:10% line:83% align:start
From what I hear, it's like
this now in every country.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.152 position:30% line:89% align:start
Except Japan.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
What about the area
we're in now? Is it unsafe?

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.902 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, it's certainly better
than it used to be.

00:31:17.936 --> 00:31:21.572 position:10% line:83% align:start
We've been able to eliminate
all the major military factions.

00:31:21.606 --> 00:31:24.609 position:21% line:83% align:start
We believe the civil
war is nearing an end.

00:31:24.642 --> 00:31:26.477 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
From how you word that,

00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:29.013 position:24% line:83% align:start
it sounds like the
war's still going.

00:31:29.047 --> 00:31:30.915 position:13% line:89% align:start
And you would be correct.

00:31:31.883 --> 00:31:33.085 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS]
There are still some dissidents

00:31:33.118 --> 00:31:34.719 position:33% line:83% align:start
waging their
delusional rebellion

00:31:34.752 --> 00:31:37.055 position:27% line:83% align:start
against Chairman

This happens all the time.

This bus is reserved

[AKANE] Who are those
people wearing collars?

00:33:14.253 --> 00:33:18.190 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS] Those sad-looking
souls are latent criminals.

[gasps]

00:33:19.124 --> 00:33:19.791 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS]
Rather than locking them up,

00:33:19.824 --> 00:33:21.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
we give them freedom of movement

00:33:21.993 --> 00:33:25.696 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that device to monitor
their Psycho-Passes.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.764 position:21% line:89% align:start
If their Hue clouds,

00:33:26.798 --> 00:33:29.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
we'll instantly measure
their Crime Coefficients.

00:33:29.634 --> 00:33:30.802 position:13% line:89% align:start
Depending on that number,

00:33:30.835 --> 00:33:34.772 position:10% line:83% align:start
the collars will then inject
either anesthesia or poison.

00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:38.810 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS] We can't have those
with high Crime Coefficients

00:33:38.843 --> 00:33:40.044 position:5% line:89% align:start
living among the general public,

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:44.083 position:7% line:83% align:start
what with the impact that can
have on Area Stress Levels.

00:33:44.116 --> 00:33:45.750 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course, since we
haven't been able to build

00:33:45.783 --> 00:33:48.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
big isolation facilities
like you have in Japan,

00:33:48.653 --> 00:33:50.755 position:33% line:83% align:start
this is only
a temporary measure.

00:33:51.856 --> 00:33:54.093 position:27% line:83% align:start
I see that some
of them are soldiers.

00:33:54.126 --> 00:33:55.094 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS]
Yes,

00:33:55.127 --> 00:33:57.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
in a sense, they fill
the role of Enforcers.

00:33:57.662 --> 00:33:59.364 position:21% line:83% align:start
But their orders all
come from officers

00:33:59.398 --> 00:34:01.666 position:7% line:89% align:start
who must maintain a clear Hue.

00:34:01.699 --> 00:34:04.169 position:21% line:83% align:start
Officers are kind of
like our Inspectors.

One more piece of advice,
Ms. Tsunemori.

00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:07.705 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:34:07.738 --> 00:34:08.906 position:24% line:89% align:start
During your stay,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.975 position:27% line:83% align:start
if you leave the
Shambhala Special District,

00:34:11.008 --> 00:34:13.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
or go out to inspect
a government facility,

00:34:13.312 --> 00:34:15.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
please make sure that
you have one of our guards

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.350 position:16% line:83% align:start
accompanying you at all
times for your protection.

00:34:18.383 --> 00:34:20.818 position:19% line:89% align:start
At all times? Really?

00:34:20.852 --> 00:34:22.421 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is that a problem?

00:34:22.454 --> 00:34:23.654 position:44% line:89% align:start
No.

It's an honor.

I never expected that the

would want to meet with me.

of how interested we are

in you and your country,

00:34:57.822 --> 00:34:59.458 position:5% line:89% align:start

Thank you.

00:35:03.395 --> 00:35:05.464 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:35:05.497 --> 00:35:07.399 position:10% line:89% align:start
and I'm hoping you can help.

00:35:07.432 --> 00:35:09.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, by all means,
I'll do what I can.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
The man you're after

00:35:10.735 --> 00:35:13.205 position:19% line:83% align:start
is a terrorist working
for the guerillas?

00:35:13.238 --> 00:35:15.407 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, that's the crime
we suspect him of.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.943 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well. Around here our method
of dealing with guerillas

00:35:18.976 --> 00:35:23.047 position:7% line:83% align:start
is to actively suppress them.
We don't simply "investigate."

00:35:24.116 --> 00:35:26.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, as I said,
we're happy to help.

00:35:26.418 --> 00:35:28.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to be clear
that conditions in this country

00:35:28.986 --> 00:35:31.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
are different from what
you find in Japan.

00:35:31.423 --> 00:35:34.825 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do try to remember this
during your time here.

00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:36.461 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Of course, sir.

00:35:36.495 --> 00:35:37.429 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:35:37.462 --> 00:35:40.265 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:35:42.434 --> 00:35:44.436 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes sir, Mister Chairman.

00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:50.775 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Open case.

00:35:54.346 --> 00:35:55.347 position:44% line:89% align:start

[breathes deeply]

00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:16.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] Chuang Hang,
former army general.

00:36:16.568 --> 00:36:18.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
One of several
high-ranking officers

00:36:18.337 --> 00:36:21.340 position:16% line:83% align:start
who led factions during
12 years of civil war,

00:36:21.373 --> 00:36:24.209 position:21% line:83% align:start
fighting each other
for SEAUn control.

00:36:24.243 --> 00:36:27.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hang gained the upper hand
by securing support from Japan.

00:36:27.412 --> 00:36:30.449 position:10% line:83% align:start
And to do that, he promised
to establish a special district

00:36:30.482 --> 00:36:32.451 position:24% line:83% align:start
to be governed by
the Sibyl System.

00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:34.986 position:30% line:83% align:start
Two years ago,
he created the new assembly

00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:37.489 position:16% line:83% align:start
and promptly got himself
elected its chairman.

00:36:37.522 --> 00:36:38.590 position:10% line:89% align:start
But, not everyone was happy

00:36:38.624 --> 00:36:41.360 position:16% line:83% align:start
with a military faction
forming the new government.

00:36:41.393 --> 00:36:43.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
These guerillas have
continued to fight

00:36:43.095 --> 00:36:45.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
and make the country
unstable to this day.

00:36:46.931 --> 00:36:48.866 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] The terrorist group
that came to Japan

00:36:48.899 --> 00:36:52.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
likely belonged to a group
of these anti-Hang guerillas.

00:36:53.938 --> 00:36:55.307 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
It's obvious his grip on power

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.976 position:16% line:83% align:start
is only as strong as the
Japanese government's support.

Hello, my name is Yeo,
I'll be your personal assistant.

00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:17.229 position:7% line:83% align:start
If there's anything you need,
I've been sent here

00:37:17.262 --> 00:37:20.532 position:13% line:83% align:start
to serve you and only you,
so don't hesitate to ask, okay!

Are you hungry?

00:37:23.335 --> 00:37:25.504 position:13% line:83% align:start
Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner?
Whatever you like.

00:37:25.537 --> 00:37:27.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, and they wanted me
to remind you again

00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:29.006 position:21% line:83% align:start
that if you plan on
leaving your room,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.043 position:24% line:83% align:start
you're free to go
wherever you like in SEAUn.

00:37:32.077 --> 00:37:33.878 position:21% line:83% align:start
So long as you don't
go unaccompanied

00:37:33.911 --> 00:37:37.848 position:13% line:83% align:start
to any major facilities or
the area beyond the bridge.

00:37:37.882 --> 00:37:39.318 position:38% line:83% align:start

That won't be a problem.

[chuckles]

00:37:41.286 --> 00:37:44.021 position:19% line:83% align:start
[YEO] Oh, and arguably
the most important item:

00:37:44.055 --> 00:37:45.457 position:13% line:83% align:start
In a week, the government
will put a hold

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:47.526 position:19% line:83% align:start
on all citizens buying
and selling alcohol.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:49.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
So if you'd like some,
now would be time.

00:37:49.528 --> 00:37:50.395 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Uh...

00:37:50.429 --> 00:37:52.064 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:37:52.097 --> 00:37:55.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
Would you be offended if
I asked you a personal question?

00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:57.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YEO] Of course not. I just
hope I'm able to answer it.

00:37:58.002 --> 00:38:01.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you have a happy life living
in the Shambhala district?

00:38:01.906 --> 00:38:04.476 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh... Why, of course!

00:38:04.509 --> 00:38:06.511 position:27% line:83% align:start
Every person in
the special district

00:38:06.545 --> 00:38:09.481 position:7% line:83% align:start
appreciates having a safe life
thanks to Chairman Hang.

00:38:09.514 --> 00:38:12.250 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's because of him that
we have the Sibyl System.

00:38:13.652 --> 00:38:17.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
It wasn't that long ago that
there wasn't a single safe place

00:38:17.322 --> 00:38:19.890 position:10% line:89% align:start

00:40:00.091 --> 00:40:01.393 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's move out.

00:40:08.233 --> 00:40:09.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it.

00:40:15.106 --> 00:40:18.443 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:40:18.477 --> 00:40:21.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS] By all means,
make yourself comfortable.

00:40:21.246 --> 00:40:23.114 position:7% line:89% align:start
But if we encounter hostility,

00:40:23.148 --> 00:40:26.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
stay out of the way
and don't touch anything.

00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:28.986 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course.
You won't know I'm here.

00:40:34.092 --> 00:40:37.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, can you tell me
where this convoy's headed?

00:40:37.095 --> 00:40:39.331 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fifty kilometers north of here,

00:40:39.364 --> 00:40:42.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
to the ruins of the old
SEAUn capitol city.

00:40:42.267 --> 00:40:44.236 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's normally a ghost
town, but yesterday

00:40:44.269 --> 00:40:47.172 position:13% line:83% align:start
our advance team delivered
a promising bit of intel.

00:40:47.205 --> 00:40:49.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
The guerrillas have moved in
and made it their new base

00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:50.408 position:30% line:83% align:start
for launching
anti-government attacks.

00:40:50.442 --> 00:40:51.743 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SOLDIER]
Back! Get back!

00:40:51.776 --> 00:40:54.112 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] You guys are leasing
Japanese security Drones

00:40:54.145 --> 00:40:56.481 position:19% line:83% align:start
specifically to patrol
Shambhala, right?

00:40:56.515 --> 00:40:57.582 position:10% line:89% align:start
So why change their mission

00:40:57.616 --> 00:41:00.552 position:21% line:83% align:start
and put them on the
anti-guerrilla beat so far away?

00:41:00.585 --> 00:41:02.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hasn't hunting latent
criminals taught you

00:41:02.454 --> 00:41:05.457 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the best defense
is a good offense?

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.627 position:16% line:83% align:start
This doesn't violate the
spirit of our agreement.

00:41:20.505 --> 00:41:22.440 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS] In our quest

00:41:22.474 --> 00:41:26.511 position:5% line:83% align:start

Float is only the beginning.

00:41:27.546 --> 00:41:30.115 position:5% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS] Eventually, the Sibyl

the Southeast Asian UN.

00:41:33.285 --> 00:41:35.453 position:19% line:83% align:start

if we're able to extinguish

00:41:35.487 --> 00:41:37.622 position:16% line:83% align:start
the guerrilla movements
as quickly as possible,

00:41:37.656 --> 00:41:40.725 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then measure the
Psycho-Passes of every citizen.

the safety on the

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, the cannon fire must
mean their crime coefficients

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.462 position:10% line:83% align:start
are reading higher than the

There's no way that
a Psycho-Pass measured

00:43:37.942 --> 00:43:39.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
have the mental health

Who is she?

00:58:22.994 --> 00:58:25.764 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a long story, but all
you need to know is this:

00:58:25.797 --> 00:58:27.532 position:21% line:89% align:start
she's not our enemy.

00:58:27.566 --> 00:58:30.068 position:13% line:89% align:start
Trust me. She's my guest.

00:58:31.703 --> 00:58:36.374 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hmm. Kogami must have offered
guidance to you, as well.

Guess we're comrades, then.

00:58:38.843 --> 00:58:43.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
My name is Sem. I'm the
leader of this group here.

00:58:43.481 --> 00:58:47.118 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I'm Akane Tsunemori.
Nice to meet you.

00:58:47.152 --> 00:58:51.523 position:24% line:83% align:start
We sustained more
casualties today. I'm sorry.

00:58:51.556 --> 00:58:55.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
No. If it weren't for you,
we'd all be dead.

[KOGAMI]
Hey, how's Gino these days?

00:59:10.408 --> 00:59:13.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
After what happened,
he became an Enforcer.

00:59:14.212 --> 00:59:15.347 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOGAMI]
I see.

00:59:16.314 --> 00:59:17.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] But what are
you doing here, Kogami?

00:59:17.949 --> 00:59:20.752 position:19% line:89% align:start
In a place like this?

00:59:20.785 --> 00:59:23.555 position:13% line:83% align:start
First, I was just lookin'
for somewhere quiet.

00:59:30.862 --> 00:59:32.464 position:27% line:89% align:start
I was exhausted.

00:59:32.497 --> 00:59:35.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
But once I strayed outside
the Sibyl System's reach,

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.803 position:13% line:83% align:start
just couldn't find peace,
no matter where I went.

00:59:38.837 --> 00:59:42.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
Only war and destruction
all across the world.

00:59:42.407 --> 00:59:44.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought that I'd trained
myself pretty well,

00:59:44.342 --> 00:59:48.380 position:10% line:83% align:start
but it opened my eyes... to
just how soft I really was.

00:59:48.413 --> 00:59:51.583 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I learned to survive.
For real this time.

00:59:52.584 --> 00:59:55.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
So then why did you
join these guerrillas?

00:59:57.656 --> 01:00:00.258 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KOGAMI] Not long after I
arrived here in this country,

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:02.594 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hang established his
self-serving regime,

01:00:02.627 --> 01:00:04.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the Drones started
hunting down guerrillas.

01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:11.536 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, I decided I'd teach the
guerrillas how to fight back.

01:00:13.571 --> 01:00:15.940 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of the Drones
are made in Japan.

01:00:15.974 --> 01:00:17.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know what their weaknesses are

01:00:17.442 --> 01:00:20.445 position:16% line:83% align:start
and how to exploit them
to bring 'em down.

01:00:23.648 --> 01:00:24.482 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
But...

01:00:24.516 --> 01:00:25.817 position:24% line:83% align:start
...what is it you
hope to accomplish

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:27.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
by helping these people?

01:00:27.919 --> 01:00:29.888 position:16% line:89% align:start
It may not look it now,

01:00:29.921 --> 01:00:32.891 position:16% line:83% align:start
but we thought we had a
chance to gain the upper hand.

01:00:36.594 --> 01:00:39.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
Although, Hang has bestowed upon
himself the title of Chairman,

01:00:39.698 --> 01:00:41.766 position:21% line:83% align:start
in truth, the guy's
nothing but a dictator,

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.402 position:19% line:89% align:start
just a common warlord.

01:00:44.436 --> 01:00:48.006 position:10% line:83% align:start
In an effort to outmaneuver
all his political rivals,

01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:50.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
he joined forces with
Japan's Sibyl System.

01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:54.612 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:56.781 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was all a smokescreen.

01:00:56.815 --> 01:00:59.884 position:21% line:83% align:start
He never cared about
building a paradise.

01:01:12.464 --> 01:01:14.365 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KOGAMI] With Sibyl's help,
Hang's faction rose

01:01:14.399 --> 01:01:16.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
to become the
predominant military force,

01:01:16.634 --> 01:01:18.937 position:27% line:83% align:start
overwhelming the
other warlords.

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:22.273 position:19% line:83% align:start
We thought this would
ultimately lead to his downfall.

01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:27.378 position:10% line:83% align:start
See, the Sibyl System is an
extreme form of bureaucracy.

01:01:27.412 --> 01:01:30.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
For a dictator, it can
be a total nightmare.

01:01:30.882 --> 01:01:32.951 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sure, he may try to
govern on his own,

01:01:32.984 --> 01:01:35.620 position:10% line:83% align:start
but everything's controlled
by the system,

01:01:35.653 --> 01:01:37.856 position:7% line:89% align:start
leaving him no real authority.

01:01:38.957 --> 01:01:40.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KOGAMI] We figured it
was only a matter of time

01:01:40.759 --> 01:01:43.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
before Hang realized this,
and that when he did,

01:01:44.028 --> 01:01:45.630 position:5% line:89% align:start
he would abandon Shambhala Float

01:01:45.663 --> 01:01:48.533 position:27% line:83% align:start
before they even
finished construction.

At least, that was our opinion
till about a year ago.

01:01:52.504 --> 01:01:55.673 position:7% line:89% align:start
I see. So Hang surprised you.

01:01:57.542 --> 01:01:58.543 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOGAMI]
Yeah.

01:02:00.845 --> 01:02:01.780 position:38% line:83% align:start

He surrendered control

01:02:01.813 --> 01:02:04.549 position:19% line:83% align:start

putting up a fight.

Something between Hang and

01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:49.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
And until I can figure
out just what it is,

I won't back down.

So, then what, is that
your idea of justice?

Operating out there all
on your own as a vigilante,

01:02:58.103 --> 01:02:59.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
bypassing the law

had nothing to do

with those terrorists who
came over to Japan to attack?

[KOGAMI] We may have
had a couple of guys

01:03:22.794 --> 01:03:24.762 position:30% line:83% align:start
who wanted to
retaliate against Japan

01:03:24.796 --> 01:03:27.066 position:10% line:89% align:start
as the birthplace of Sibyl.

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:29.500 position:16% line:83% align:start

You were better than anyone

01:07:55.967 --> 01:07:57.668 position:24% line:83% align:start
at getting inside
Makishima's head

01:07:57.702 --> 01:07:59.937 position:7% line:89% align:start
and predicting his next move.

Would it really be so surprising

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.110 position:13% line:83% align:start
if you shared some of his
talents and characteristics?

01:08:05.144 --> 01:08:07.778 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe, except for back
when I was in Japan,

01:08:07.812 --> 01:08:09.046 position:5% line:89% align:start
my words were never responsible

01:08:09.081 --> 01:08:12.217 position:21% line:83% align:start
for leading anybody
astray, were they?

01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:14.886 position:21% line:83% align:start
So why is everything
different now?

01:08:16.188 --> 01:08:18.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because your situation
is different now.

01:08:20.392 --> 01:08:23.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't know if you even
realize it, Kogami,

01:08:23.295 --> 01:08:25.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
but the position that
you find yourself in here

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:29.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
is a lot like how Shogo
Makishima started out.

01:08:30.335 --> 01:08:31.769 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOGAMI]
Are you saying,

01:08:31.802 --> 01:08:34.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm destined to wind up
like Makishima?

[AKANE]
No.

01:08:36.308 --> 01:08:39.311 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, I think there will
be more and more people

01:08:39.344 --> 01:08:44.048 position:10% line:83% align:start
who will want you to embody
the same traits Makishima did.

01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:46.951 position:13% line:83% align:start
Those who harbor anger and
resentment towards society

01:08:46.984 --> 01:08:50.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
will expect something from you,
and trust in you to lead them.

01:08:50.289 --> 01:08:52.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have such an ability
to draw people in,

01:08:52.924 --> 01:08:56.027 position:7% line:83% align:start
they might put you on the same
pedestal Makishima was on.

On the other hand,

01:09:00.499 --> 01:09:04.102 position:10% line:83% align:start

ambition to control people.

01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:56.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
and have them take
her back to her room.

01:15:56.414 --> 01:15:56.915 position:35% line:89% align:start
But, sir!

01:15:56.948 --> 01:15:57.882 position:41% line:83% align:start
[HANG]
Enough!

01:15:57.916 --> 01:15:59.584 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

01:15:59.618 --> 01:16:02.153 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HANG] Truth be told, Colonel,
I have some serious concerns

01:16:02.187 --> 01:16:03.822 position:24% line:83% align:start
about the ways the
Union Military Police

01:16:03.855 --> 01:16:05.091 position:10% line:89% align:start
have been operating lately.

01:16:05.123 --> 01:16:08.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
And the last time I checked, I'm
still the Commander in Chief.

01:16:08.927 --> 01:16:10.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
[NICHOLAS sighs]

01:16:11.596 --> 01:16:12.864 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS]
Yes, sir.

01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:21.773 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Now, let's see.

01:16:42.894 --> 01:16:43.895 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Mh.

01:17:38.316 --> 01:17:39.317 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

01:17:40.318 --> 01:17:41.986 position:41% line:83% align:start
[YEO]
Excuse me, Miss Tsunemori.

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.888 position:13% line:83% align:start
I saw that you'd returned,
so I was wondering

01:17:43.922 --> 01:17:46.291 position:21% line:83% align:start
if you wanted me to
make you some lunch?

01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:50.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sounds great! Thanks, Miss Yeo.

01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:52.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll eat, right after
my shower's done.

01:17:52.897 --> 01:17:55.433 position:19% line:83% align:start
[YEO] Yes, ma'am. I'll
get started on it now.

01:17:59.804 --> 01:18:02.040 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHION]
Hm? Akane?

01:18:02.074 --> 01:18:03.942 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Hi, Shion.

01:18:03.975 --> 01:18:04.909 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can you hear me?

01:18:04.943 --> 01:18:07.045 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHION]
Yeah, loud and clear.

01:18:07.079 --> 01:18:09.814 position:7% line:83% align:start
Looks like the program I gave
you is working out okay.

01:18:09.848 --> 01:18:12.016 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, what's up?

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:13.685 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it possible to secretly check

01:18:13.718 --> 01:18:16.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
individual Psycho-Pass
diagnostic devices

01:18:16.354 --> 01:18:18.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
installed in Shambhala
Float, one by one,

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:20.558 position:16% line:89% align:start
remotely from the MWPSB?

01:18:20.592 --> 01:18:21.259 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHION]
I guess.

01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:22.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
If we do it via those pill bugs,

01:18:22.927 --> 01:18:24.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I don't see why
it wouldn't work.

01:18:24.863 --> 01:18:26.297 position:7% line:89% align:start
But what do you hope to learn?

01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:27.866 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Sibyl System
is in place there

01:18:27.899 --> 01:18:30.835 position:16% line:83% align:start
and should be operating
fine. What's wrong?

01:18:30.869 --> 01:18:32.871 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] I think that maybe
the system isn't being used

01:18:32.904 --> 01:18:34.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
in a fair and just manner here.

01:18:34.873 --> 01:18:36.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look at the ones in
the special district,

01:18:36.908 --> 01:18:39.544 position:19% line:83% align:start
especially around the
Military Police facilities.

01:18:39.577 --> 01:18:42.514 position:13% line:83% align:start
Check to see how accurate
the cymatic scans they do are.

01:18:42.547 --> 01:18:44.749 position:16% line:83% align:start
And let me know as soon
as you find anything.

01:18:47.018 --> 01:18:48.920 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Detective's intuition"?

01:18:50.388 --> 01:18:52.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, it's a little
more than that.

01:18:52.091 --> 01:18:54.926 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a conclusion based
on logical inferences.

01:18:57.562 --> 01:18:59.430 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHION]
All right. Got it.

01:18:59.464 --> 01:19:01.399 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll see what I can do.

01:19:01.432 --> 01:19:02.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Oh, one more thing.

01:19:02.667 --> 01:19:04.769 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know the collars they use
to monitor latent criminals

01:19:04.803 --> 01:19:07.772 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the Shambhala
Special District?

01:19:07.806 --> 01:19:10.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those are made in
Japan, too, right?

01:19:10.475 --> 01:19:12.577 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, under MWPSB clearance,

01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:14.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
can you access the
code to remove one?

01:19:14.612 --> 01:19:15.847 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHION]
Yeah, no problem.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.351 position:7% line:83% align:start
But could be bad for you. The
Military Police won't be happy.

01:19:20.385 --> 01:19:23.354 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, we are way past the point
of making a difference there.

01:19:23.388 --> 01:19:25.723 position:27% line:83% align:start
Their happiness
doesn't concern me.

01:19:27.025 --> 01:19:29.327 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YEO] Your lunch is
ready, Miss Tsunemori.

01:19:32.397 --> 01:19:33.998 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks, it looks great.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.942 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Don't say anything.

01:19:43.975 --> 01:19:44.976 position:41% line:83% align:start
[YEO]
Huh?

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.814 position:33% line:89% align:start
[YEO gasps]

01:19:49.848 --> 01:19:51.950 position:41% line:83% align:start
[YEO]
My--But how?

01:19:51.983 --> 01:19:55.053 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] Please, remain calm
and listen to me carefully.

01:19:55.087 --> 01:19:59.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm going to need
your... uh... your help--

01:19:59.624 --> 01:20:00.758 position:33% line:89% align:start
[YEO gasps]

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.768 position:21% line:89% align:start
Looks like this is--

01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:28.052 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHION]
Hmm...

01:20:30.622 --> 01:20:32.490 position:41% line:83% align:start
[YEO]
I did just as you said!

01:20:32.523 --> 01:20:36.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll really remove my
brother's collar now, won't you?

01:20:36.128 --> 01:20:38.930 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're entirely
too trusting, my dear.

[AKANE grunts]

01:20:47.939 --> 01:20:49.607 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS]
Don't kill the girl yet.

01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:52.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll arrange for her to die with
our guerrilla military advisor.

01:20:53.011 --> 01:20:55.880 position:19% line:83% align:start
That should avoid any
unnecessary suspicion.

01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:01.486 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] So, it seems like
my assumption was correct.

01:21:01.519 --> 01:21:04.455 position:19% line:83% align:start
You aren't even using
the cymatic scans.

01:21:05.623 --> 01:21:07.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] Somehow you're
circumventing them.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.728 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS]
Oh?

01:21:10.762 --> 01:21:12.997 position:10% line:89% align:start
And what proof do you have?

01:21:13.031 --> 01:21:16.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
You just killed someone.
That's all the proof I need.

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:20.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NICHOLAS] If the Sibyl System
raises no objection to it,

01:21:20.772 --> 01:21:22.707 position:7% line:89% align:start
then an action must be legal.

01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:27.112 position:10% line:89% align:start

You surprised me.

01:22:09.088 --> 01:22:10.888 position:7% line:89% align:start
The guerrilla military advisor

01:22:10.922 --> 01:22:14.025 position:21% line:83% align:start
we've heard so much
about is Japanese.

who'd had their spines ripped

There's no place for
me there anymore.

01:22:29.274 --> 01:22:32.277 position:7% line:83% align:start

[RUTAGANDA]
In a failed state,

01:23:01.005 --> 01:23:04.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
violence, by necessity,
is privatized.

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:07.011 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because a monopoly on
organized, systematic violence

01:23:07.045 --> 01:23:09.214 position:10% line:89% align:start
is the essence of a nation.

01:23:10.982 --> 01:23:12.717 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RUTAGANDA] Once violence
spreads everywhere,

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:15.287 position:24% line:83% align:start
it ceases to serve

01:31:53.471 --> 01:31:55.774 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
What are you guys doing here?

01:31:55.807 --> 01:31:58.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
From the data your
pill bugs collected,

01:31:58.176 --> 01:31:59.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Analyzer pieced
it all together.

01:31:59.844 --> 01:32:03.448 position:13% line:83% align:start
The scanners in this city.
They were illegally altered.

01:32:03.481 --> 01:32:06.084 position:21% line:83% align:start
This place is a nest
of latent criminals.

01:32:07.152 --> 01:32:09.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, how exactly
did they pull it off?

01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:11.156 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Identification
Friend or Foe

01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:13.692 position:16% line:83% align:start
that was originally used
by the SEAUn military.

01:32:13.725 --> 01:32:16.161 position:27% line:83% align:start
They embedded it
in the Hue scan.

01:32:16.194 --> 01:32:19.130 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once somebody's
designated as friendly,

01:32:19.164 --> 01:32:21.399 position:5% line:89% align:start
he's no longer subject to scans.

01:32:21.433 --> 01:32:24.369 position:16% line:83% align:start
And so, as it turns out,
almost every MP officer

01:32:24.402 --> 01:32:27.238 position:16% line:83% align:start
was using this loophole
to fake his Psycho-Pass.

01:32:27.272 --> 01:32:29.474 position:13% line:83% align:start
They could really deceive
the Sibyl System?

01:32:29.507 --> 01:32:31.776 position:24% line:83% align:start
And they did it in
such an obvious way.

01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:34.479 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MIKA] What makes you think
they were deceiving Sibyl?

01:32:34.512 --> 01:32:37.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was purposely
overlooked to set this trap.

01:32:37.449 --> 01:32:39.684 position:10% line:83% align:start
From the start, Sibyl's aim
was the wholesale prosecution

01:32:39.718 --> 01:32:41.620 position:33% line:83% align:start
of the Union
Military Police.

01:32:41.653 --> 01:32:43.622 position:13% line:89% align:start
If you had realized that,

01:32:43.655 --> 01:32:46.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
maybe we wouldn't have had
to go through all this trouble.

01:32:46.291 --> 01:32:48.193 position:30% line:83% align:start
You always do
everything the hard way.

01:32:48.226 --> 01:32:49.728 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't you, Inspector?

01:32:49.761 --> 01:32:51.563 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

01:32:51.596 --> 01:32:52.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIKA] People like them
are so easy to read

01:32:52.964 --> 01:32:54.899 position:16% line:83% align:start
that you shouldn't even
need a cymatic scan

01:32:54.933 --> 01:32:56.635 position:7% line:89% align:start
to know what they're thinking.

01:32:56.668 --> 01:32:58.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
Still, until the
infrastructure was in place

01:32:58.470 --> 01:33:00.872 position:21% line:83% align:start
and ready to operate
the system in SEAUn,

01:33:00.905 --> 01:33:03.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
utilizing them was
the only option.

01:33:03.475 --> 01:33:05.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
But once Shambhala
Float gets completed,

01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:07.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
their usefulness begins
to wear off pretty quickly.

01:33:07.979 --> 01:33:09.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
And all that's left
is to gather proof

01:33:09.547 --> 01:33:12.283 position:27% line:83% align:start
of their devious
scheme and crush them.

01:33:12.317 --> 01:33:14.185 position:24% line:83% align:start
See, tracking down
a fugitive Enforcer

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:16.521 position:27% line:83% align:start
that was just a

01:39:29.827 --> 01:39:31.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
And worse, you conspired
with a traitor

01:39:31.829 --> 01:39:33.765 position:10% line:89% align:start
to assassinate their leader.

01:39:34.832 --> 01:39:37.236 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] That's clearly
an international crime!

01:39:38.203 --> 01:39:40.038 position:33% line:83% align:start
[DOMINATOR]
Strictly speaking.

01:39:40.072 --> 01:39:42.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
There is no such thing
as "domestic affairs"

01:39:42.874 --> 01:39:45.277 position:16% line:89% align:start
in this country anymore.

01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:48.046 position:10% line:89% align:start
Corruption, discrimination,

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
religious and racial
confrontations.

01:39:51.716 --> 01:39:53.584 position:33% line:83% align:start
[DOMINATOR]
As of two years ago,

01:39:53.618 --> 01:39:58.123 position:7% line:83% align:start
SEAUn ceased to be recognized
as a federal nation.

01:39:58.157 --> 01:40:01.993 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] All you cared about
was expanding Sibyl's control!

01:40:02.026 --> 01:40:04.829 position:10% line:83% align:start
[DOMINATOR] Mundane desires
such as seizing territory

01:40:04.862 --> 01:40:07.132 position:16% line:89% align:start
do not exist within us.

01:40:07.166 --> 01:40:11.035 position:10% line:83% align:start
"The greatest happiness for
the greatest amount of people."

01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:16.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the end, it depends entirely
on how you define "greatest."

01:40:16.275 --> 01:40:20.011 position:24% line:83% align:start
You claim that our
endeavor here, is a crime.

01:40:20.044 --> 01:40:23.948 position:19% line:83% align:start
However, a crime is a
deviation from the law.

01:40:25.016 --> 01:40:27.785 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] The law isn't just
some guiding principle.

01:40:27.819 --> 01:40:28.853 position:19% line:89% align:start
It can't be sustained

01:40:28.886 --> 01:40:31.923 position:16% line:83% align:start
without the full support
and consent of the people.

01:40:31.956 --> 01:40:35.260 position:10% line:83% align:start
You never even tried to get
the approval of the citizens,

01:40:35.294 --> 01:40:38.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
when you swooped in and
started governing this place.

01:40:38.363 --> 01:40:40.132 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, all you did
was con a dictator

01:40:40.165 --> 01:40:41.766 position:16% line:89% align:start
into doing your bidding.

01:40:42.767 --> 01:40:45.270 position:16% line:83% align:start
[DOMINATOR] These people
had only two choices:

01:40:45.304 --> 01:40:47.905 position:5% line:89% align:start
Starve to death or be massacred.

01:40:47.939 --> 01:40:50.775 position:10% line:83% align:start
So we needed to take action
as swiftly as possible

01:40:50.808 --> 01:40:54.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
in order to provide them
with peace and refuge.

01:40:54.379 --> 01:40:55.880 position:19% line:89% align:start
All that we did here,

01:40:55.913 --> 01:40:58.850 position:21% line:83% align:start
was choose the most
effective solution for them.

01:41:01.286 --> 01:41:04.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
Chairman Hang. Step down.

01:41:05.157 --> 01:41:07.092 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hold a free and fair election

01:41:07.126 --> 01:41:09.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
to let the people
choose a new leader

01:41:09.861 --> 01:41:12.231 position:24% line:83% align:start
and whether or not
to use the Sibyl System.

01:41:12.264 --> 01:41:15.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
That decision should be
theirs, and theirs alone.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.304 position:5% line:83% align:start
[DOMINATOR] You honestly believe
these people would reject us?

01:41:20.372 --> 01:41:21.839 position:33% line:83% align:start
[DOMINATOR]
That they would ever abandon

01:41:21.873 --> 01:41:24.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
the security of
this utopian city

01:41:24.809 --> 01:41:27.912 position:16% line:83% align:start
after actually grasping
it in their hands?

01:41:29.847 --> 01:41:32.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKANE] The balancing
of freedom and security

01:41:33.017 --> 01:41:36.088 position:10% line:83% align:start
is something that they have
to determine for themselves.

01:41:37.089 --> 01:41:39.757 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKANE]
So that they can embrace the law

01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:42.127 position:7% line:89% align:start
as a positive force to uphold,

01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:45.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
rather than just a set
of rules to be obeyed.

01:41:46.797 --> 01:41:47.965 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HANG, DOMINATOR]
You insist on going through

01:41:47.999 --> 01:41:49.834 position:10% line:89% align:start
the motions of this charade,

01:41:49.867 --> 01:41:51.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
even though the outcome
of a public vote

01:41:51.403 --> 01:41:54.005 position:13% line:89% align:start
would be entirely obvious.

01:41:54.038 --> 01:41:56.974 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't quite understand
your thinking on this.

01:41:58.009 --> 01:42:00.711 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HANG, DOMINATOR] But perhaps
that is precisely why

01:42:00.745 --> 01:42:04.316 position:10% line:83% align:start
our collective consciousness
is so interested in you.

01:42:06.451 --> 01:42:09.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
Choosing how to form
a society, what it's like,

01:42:10.888 --> 01:42:14.493 position:7% line:83% align:start
having a voice in shaping the
government that represents you.

01:42:14.526 --> 01:42:18.297 position:10% line:83% align:start
People have fought and died
to achieve those rights.

The day before yesterday,

01:45:31.289 --> 01:45:33.291 position:27% line:83% align:start
we learned of an

plotted by the commandant of the

01:45:36.994 --> 01:45:39.564 position:16% line:83% align:start
This treasonous activity

about our leadership in
