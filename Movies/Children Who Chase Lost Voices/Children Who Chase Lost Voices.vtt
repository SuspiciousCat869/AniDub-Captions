Hi there!

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:48.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
Meow!

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:50.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi!

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:51.987 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why hello there.

00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:55.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
I got it!

00:02:56.024 --> 00:03:05.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Machine hums]

00:03:05.703 --> 00:03:07.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a strange melody.

00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:38.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I haven't been able to hear</i>
 <i>it again.</i>

00:04:46.675 --> 00:04:48.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good evening!

00:05:00.857 --> 00:05:02.391 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks for watching over me.

00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:05.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll bring you something to eat
later. Okay?

00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:16.539 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mom?

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.274 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're home early today.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Oh.

00:05:20.845 --> 00:05:23.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
Forgot to turn the light off.

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:31.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm home, Daddy.

00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:45.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
How did you get in here?!

00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:03.288 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop it Mimi!

00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:15.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's give thanks.

00:06:27.514 --> 00:06:29.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
That sure was a strange song.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.753 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder if I'll be able to hear
it again.

00:06:32.854 --> 00:06:34.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
Meow.

00:06:36.858 --> 00:06:38.225 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Good night, Mimi.

00:06:53.943 --> 00:06:55.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
A light?

00:06:57.278 --> 00:07:00.114 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe it was my imagination.

00:07:22.038 --> 00:07:24.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Teacher] Next, Miss Yuu Yazaki.

00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:25.075 position:5% line:89% align:start
Keep up the good work.

00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:26.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuu] I will.

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
Next, Miss Asuna Watase.

00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:30.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
Coming.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.583 position:5% line:83% align:start
Asuna has the best score in the
class, once more.

00:07:33.684 --> 00:07:35.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Boy] Asuna's first again?
[Teacher] You've really been...

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.855 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Girl 1] That's our class rep
for you.
[Teacher] ...working hard
haven't you?

00:07:37.955 --> 00:07:39.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, she's a studying machine!

00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:45.529 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Teacher] Now then, before you
go, there's a warning I need to
give you.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
Lately there have been reports
from a number of students,

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:51.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
about some kind of animal near
Obuchi, probably a bear.

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:53.639 position:5% line:83% align:start
My brother told me, he said he
saw it.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.707 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] Just in case, please
go straight home.

00:07:55.807 --> 00:07:57.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
And walk home with a friend that
lives near you.

00:07:57.776 --> 00:08:00.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
[School bell rings]
[Students] Yes, ma'am.

00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:01.580 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Wait up for me!

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.285 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Asuna!

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wanna walk home together?

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:13.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I'd really like to, but I have
to hurry back.

00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:14.994 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks for asking though.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:17.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuu] Sure. Maybe another time?

00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:39.019 position:5% line:89% align:start
5 Kilos of rice please.

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:41.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
5 kilos, coming right up.

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:43.490 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Woman] Are you alright
with that?

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.592 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Just fine, thank you.

00:09:02.277 --> 00:09:03.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a pretty day.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.571 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's so quiet.

00:09:45.455 --> 00:09:47.557 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't hear the birds.

00:09:55.032 --> 00:10:05.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Growling]

00:10:24.363 --> 00:10:26.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
The bear...that's the...

00:10:35.775 --> 00:10:38.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Creature roars]

00:10:46.553 --> 00:10:47.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Stand back.

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:51.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
It'll be okay.

00:10:54.128 --> 00:10:55.462 position:5% line:89% align:start
But...

00:11:14.482 --> 00:11:16.351 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's going to die soon.

00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:52.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't be...

00:11:52.422 --> 00:11:53.757 position:5% line:89% align:start
No!

00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:14.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Train whistle]

[Train whistle]
[Train breaking]

00:12:31.563 --> 00:12:34.134 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shun] Sorry for putting you in
such a rough spot.

00:12:36.336 --> 00:12:37.871 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's over now, we gotta go.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.407 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wait a sec!

00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:41.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
Trust me.

00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:46.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Ah!

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:48.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna screams]

00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:14.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Eerie singing in the air]

00:13:14.642 --> 00:13:16.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shun] I'm sure I came here to
meet you.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:39.202 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're awake, I see.

00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:44.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
The danger has passed, it's safe
for you to go back now.

00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:47.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you... You saved
me, right?

00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:49.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:13:49.946 --> 00:13:53.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it's probably best if you
don't come here anymore.

00:13:58.355 --> 00:13:59.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi?

00:14:17.242 --> 00:14:20.879 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know what I saw! There were
definitely people standing
there on the tracks!

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:22.847 position:5% line:89% align:start
Two kids, about this tall...

00:14:22.947 --> 00:14:24.082 position:5% line:89% align:start
Two kids?

00:14:24.182 --> 00:14:25.183 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Officer] Commander!

00:14:26.285 --> 00:14:27.619 position:5% line:89% align:start
Over here.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.525 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Teacher] Miss Watase?

00:14:32.624 --> 00:14:35.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is Asuna not here today?

00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:38.898 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do hope she's feeling all
right, poor little thing.

00:14:38.998 --> 00:14:40.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, I think you all might have
heard already,

00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:44.538 position:5% line:77% align:start
but that bear was spotted once
again yesterday on the
Obuchi Bridge.

00:14:44.637 --> 00:14:47.907 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Girl 1] Oh so it was true!
[Boy 1] I heard the police
are investigatin'.

00:14:48.007 --> 00:14:50.676 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Girl 2] But I heard it's
already dead.
[Teacher] If you'll pardon
the interruption...

00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:55.515 position:5% line:77% align:start
It might still be near the
routes you take to school, so
take extra-special care.

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:56.650 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am!

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yuu, will you tell Asuna
for me?

00:15:00.253 --> 00:15:01.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:15:01.788 --> 00:15:04.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
Also, the substitute teacher
that'll be filling in for me,

00:15:04.157 --> 00:15:07.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
while I'm on maternity leave
will be coming tomorrow.

00:15:07.562 --> 00:15:09.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is she really pretty?

00:15:09.796 --> 00:15:11.832 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid it's a man.

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:13.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
A guy?

00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:21.376 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] I just have to go.

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:26.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was the bridge right ahead,
I heard...

00:15:26.681 --> 00:15:28.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
How frightful...

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Red lady] I heard they already
started the trains up again.

00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:33.288 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, there's only one every
two hours!

00:15:35.424 --> 00:15:37.459 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Asuna!

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Hello.

00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:40.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a lovely sunny day, yes?

00:15:40.563 --> 00:15:42.398 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Yes... Well...

00:15:43.632 --> 00:15:45.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rice lady] Oh, Mr. Sato...

00:15:45.168 --> 00:15:46.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mr. Sato] Howdy.

00:15:46.503 --> 00:15:47.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rice lady] Hey, did you hear?

00:15:47.736 --> 00:15:50.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
That bear showed up on the
Obuchi Bridge!

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:16.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Officer] It's here!

00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:31.416 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait a second...

00:16:32.684 --> 00:16:33.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
Saplings...

00:16:33.852 --> 00:16:36.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
From the power of vita-aqua?

00:16:39.925 --> 00:16:41.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's crystallizing...

00:16:42.994 --> 00:16:45.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
Someone's come up to
the surface.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
Spread out!

00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:53.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] I figured she would come.

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even though I warned her.

00:16:55.576 --> 00:16:57.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mimi] Meow.

00:16:57.678 --> 00:16:59.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah I know...

00:16:59.178 --> 00:17:02.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be honest, I was kind of
hoping she would come back.

00:17:10.057 --> 00:17:12.292 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought I told you, you
shouldn't come.

00:17:12.392 --> 00:17:13.827 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Yeah, so?

00:17:14.895 --> 00:17:16.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Mimi!

00:17:19.032 --> 00:17:20.235 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why, you traitor...

00:17:20.335 --> 00:17:22.836 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were suppose to only get
along with me!

00:17:22.936 --> 00:17:25.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
You no-good two-timer...

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.975 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] And you...

00:17:27.075 --> 00:17:29.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
This was my place to begin with.

00:17:29.177 --> 00:17:32.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want anyone telling me
not to come here.

00:17:33.815 --> 00:17:36.184 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm the same way.

00:17:36.284 --> 00:17:38.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shun] I came here because I
wanted to.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.156 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Shun, and you are?

00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:44.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna. That's me.

00:17:44.693 --> 00:17:46.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your arm! Your hurt!

00:17:46.462 --> 00:17:48.897 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're bleeding... Is this
from yesterday?

00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:50.532 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
But it's my fault that you...

00:18:00.677 --> 00:18:04.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] You should get it looked
at in the hospital later.

00:18:04.347 --> 00:18:07.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
My mom works there. She'll take
care of you.

00:18:07.384 --> 00:18:09.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like you have
everything you need here.

00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:13.423 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] Yeah. But it's the first
time this has ever come
in handy.

00:18:13.524 --> 00:18:18.061 position:5% line:77% align:start
I kinda wanted my own place,
so I brought things up piece
by piece.

00:18:18.161 --> 00:18:19.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know?

00:18:19.463 --> 00:18:22.466 position:5% line:83% align:start
And this is the best place
for the tuning into the radio.

00:18:22.566 --> 00:18:23.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Radio?

00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:26.237 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, all finished!

00:18:26.337 --> 00:18:27.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you so much.

00:18:29.974 --> 00:18:31.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wanna hear it?

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:39.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] I use this crystal
instead of a diode.

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:43.388 position:5% line:77% align:start
Depending on the weather and
time of day, you can get
different signals.

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.358 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Hey, that stone...

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.592 position:5% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:50.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's some kind of music
program, see?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
Want some?

00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:04.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you, I was hungry.

00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:15.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, awhile back, I tuned
into this melody...

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:18.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
It sounded like no music
I'd ever heard before.

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:23.597 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's weird but it sounded like
what someone's heart would
sound like.

00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:30.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I heard it, I was both
sad and happy at the same time,

00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:34.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I was able to feel like I
was no longer alone...

00:19:35.443 --> 00:19:38.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] It will stay with
me, always...

00:19:38.313 --> 00:19:41.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wish that I...I could hear it
once again.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Shun?

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:07.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey Asuna, you aren't going to
ask me anything?

00:20:07.343 --> 00:20:09.780 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shun] I'm sure you must have
a lot of questions.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Like what that
bear-thing was?

00:20:12.382 --> 00:20:13.283 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Right.

00:20:13.383 --> 00:20:15.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah... But I'm okay for now.

00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:17.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, there's just so much
to ask...

00:20:17.454 --> 00:20:21.691 position:5% line:77% align:start
It'll take too long now, so I
think I'll just come back
here tomorrow.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shun] I came from a different
land named Agartha.

00:20:31.402 --> 00:20:32.637 position:5% line:89% align:start
Agartha...

00:20:32.737 --> 00:20:34.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
A foreign country?

00:20:34.238 --> 00:20:35.273 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:20:35.373 --> 00:20:36.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shun] There was something I
wanted to see,

00:20:36.874 --> 00:20:38.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
and someone I had to meet.

00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:42.513 position:5% line:77% align:start
But now I've accomplished
everything I wanted. I have
no regrets.

00:20:44.048 --> 00:20:45.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] So your wish came true?

00:20:45.684 --> 00:20:49.053 position:5% line:77% align:start
Mhm... Alright, I think you
should go home before it
gets dark.

00:20:49.153 --> 00:20:52.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right... I'll go home after the
cicadas stop chirping.

00:20:56.428 --> 00:20:57.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Asuna...

00:20:58.764 --> 00:21:00.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll give you a blessing.

00:21:06.906 --> 00:21:07.807 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Close your eyes.

00:21:07.907 --> 00:21:09.375 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:20.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
W-was that just a...
k-k-k-kiss?

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Asuna.

00:21:22.288 --> 00:21:24.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
I...all I wish is for you
to live.

00:21:25.024 --> 00:21:26.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's all I've ever wanted
for you...

00:21:27.093 --> 00:21:29.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah... uh...

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry, see you tomorrow!

00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:39.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow, then.

00:22:04.934 --> 00:22:09.405 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Heart beat]

00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:16.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa, what a shock...

00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:18.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun...

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:22.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shun] So she's the one who
heard my final song...

00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:27.391 position:5% line:89% align:start
She called you Mimi, right?

00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:32.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want you to...to lead Asuna to
a better place in my stead.

00:22:32.563 --> 00:22:35.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now at this point, the fear is
almost unbearable...

00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:39.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
But at the same time, there's an
equally powerful happiness.

00:22:44.776 --> 00:22:47.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's like my hand can almost
reach them...

00:23:23.917 --> 00:23:25.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm home, Asuna.

00:23:25.552 --> 00:23:28.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
Welcome home! You must be tired
from the night shift.

00:23:28.788 --> 00:23:30.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah... Two lunches?

00:23:30.423 --> 00:23:33.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Yeah, one's for
a friend!

00:23:33.293 --> 00:23:35.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Mom, you'll eat
breakfast, right?

00:23:35.428 --> 00:23:36.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:38.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe we could eat it together?

00:23:38.298 --> 00:23:40.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you talking about?
You've eaten already, right?

00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:44.204 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can still eat a bit more.
Actually, I'm still kind
of hungry.

00:23:44.305 --> 00:23:47.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
No. You have to make sure
you're not late to school.

00:23:49.644 --> 00:23:53.347 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mrs. Watase] Asuna, why
don't we go out to dinner
somewhere tonight?

00:23:53.447 --> 00:23:55.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have the day off, after all.

00:23:56.051 --> 00:23:57.119 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Really?

00:23:57.218 --> 00:23:58.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then I'll be home before six!

00:23:59.054 --> 00:24:00.522 position:5% line:89% align:start
Six?

00:24:00.622 --> 00:24:02.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Watase] Today's Saturday,
right? Where are you going?

00:24:02.624 --> 00:24:05.260 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] To a friend's place! See
you later!

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Watase] Hey, what happened
to your scarf?

00:24:07.329 --> 00:24:10.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
I lost it. I'll buy another at
the school store!

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:12.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
Have a nice day!

00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
A friend, huh?

00:24:33.857 --> 00:24:42.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Phone rings]

00:24:44.169 --> 00:24:46.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Watase] Are you sure
about that?

00:24:46.203 --> 00:24:49.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, I see. Yes, yes...

00:24:50.008 --> 00:24:51.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, I'll ask her tomorrow.

00:25:01.052 --> 00:25:05.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
[School bell rings]

00:25:16.202 --> 00:25:18.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] And I told him I'd
come today...

00:25:20.439 --> 00:25:22.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe it's because of the rain?

00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:26.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Door opens]

00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:28.581 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] I'm home.

00:25:28.681 --> 00:25:32.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Sorry, Mom... can you
get me a towel?

00:25:32.418 --> 00:25:35.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
My, look at you... you're
sopping wet!

00:25:35.354 --> 00:25:37.090 position:5% line:89% align:start
You didn't bring an umbrella?

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.225 position:5% line:89% align:start
No...

00:25:38.324 --> 00:25:40.427 position:5% line:89% align:start
H-hey, I can dry myself!

00:25:44.931 --> 00:25:46.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Mom?

00:25:50.138 --> 00:25:51.706 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mom? What is it?

00:25:51.806 --> 00:25:55.408 position:5% line:77% align:start
Asuna, the police found a
young boy's body in
the riverbed.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
He had your scarf tied around
his arm.

00:25:59.614 --> 00:26:02.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
When they found him, he
was dead.

00:26:04.619 --> 00:26:07.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's got to be...
someone else...

00:26:07.488 --> 00:26:11.325 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] After all, it's not like
he fell or anything.
[Mrs. Watase] Asuna...

00:26:11.425 --> 00:26:15.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm fine. I'm sure it's a
mistake, don't worry.

00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:19.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since it's raining, let's do
dinner some other time. Okay?

00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:20.736 position:5% line:89% align:start
I-I need to do my homework.

00:26:20.836 --> 00:26:21.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna...

00:26:21.837 --> 00:26:23.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm fine, okay?

00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:50.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun!

00:26:54.104 --> 00:26:56.674 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun!

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Young Asuna] Dad's not coming
back anymore?

00:27:17.762 --> 00:27:19.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is he, Mom?

00:27:26.038 --> 00:27:28.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] To wish for something
like that...

00:27:28.607 --> 00:27:31.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he wouldn't want
that, yes...

00:27:31.944 --> 00:27:36.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dad said that death was a part
of life, after all.

00:27:36.182 --> 00:27:37.516 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even so...

00:27:38.218 --> 00:27:39.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
I...

00:27:48.161 --> 00:27:54.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] And then sadly,
tragicly, his wife died.

00:27:54.568 --> 00:28:01.009 position:5% line:77% align:start
Overcome with grief, Izanagi
decided to travel to the land of
Yomi far underneath the Earth,

00:28:01.109 --> 00:28:05.646 position:5% line:83% align:start
in order to bring his wife,
Izanami, back from the dead.

00:28:05.747 --> 00:28:07.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
After traveling deep beneath
the Earth,

00:28:07.649 --> 00:28:10.585 position:5% line:83% align:start
he was at last reunited with
his wife,

00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:13.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
apon their reunion she
said this:

00:28:13.988 --> 00:28:16.758 position:5% line:83% align:start
"I am a resident of the Land of
the Dead."

00:28:16.858 --> 00:28:22.430 position:5% line:77% align:start
"However, if the God of Yomi
allows it, I can return home
with you."

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
"But for that to happen, there
is one condition."

00:28:25.834 --> 00:28:30.439 position:5% line:77% align:start
"While I am talking with the
god, you must not look at
my body."

00:28:30.539 --> 00:28:33.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
But Izanagi broke that promise.

00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:36.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
He opened the gate to Yomi.

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:41.550 position:5% line:83% align:start
And therefore Izanagi's wife
can no longer return with him.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that the first verse of the
Kojiki Mythology.

00:28:45.889 --> 00:28:51.294 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Morisaki] This myths of those
heading below the Earth to
resurrect loved ones is not
unique to our culture.

00:28:51.395 --> 00:28:52.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
It can be called the land
of Yomi.

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:56.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Romans called it the
underworld, the Greeks; Hades,

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:58.802 position:5% line:89% align:start
Budhism; Shambhala, Agartha...

00:29:04.775 --> 00:29:06.143 position:5% line:89% align:start
Different in name perhaps,

00:29:06.243 --> 00:29:10.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
but all located in the same
space beneath our world.

00:29:10.114 --> 00:29:16.620 position:5% line:77% align:start
People once believed that the
secret to death itself lies
beneath our very feet.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Announcment] Everyone, it is
time to go home from school.

00:29:22.626 --> 00:29:24.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Teacher] Is there something
about Asuna?

00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:26.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] No, she just seems
very serious,

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:28.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I was wondering what kind of
student she was.

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:33.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yes... She's very well
behaved, and a very good girl.

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:35.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
But her father passed away when
she was young,

00:29:35.308 --> 00:29:38.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
and her mother seems to be very
busy with her nursing work.

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:41.646 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do wonder if she's trying too
hard to be good, you know...

00:29:41.748 --> 00:29:43.182 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's too bad.

00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:47.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
And they found that corpse of
the unidentified boy before,

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.987 position:5% line:89% align:start
just terrible.

00:29:48.087 --> 00:29:50.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yuu] Asuna, aren't you
going home?

00:29:50.189 --> 00:29:55.329 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] Yuu... No, I have
something I need to ask
Mr. Morisaki.

00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:57.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yuu] I don't really like him
so much...

00:29:57.597 --> 00:29:59.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
Today's lesson was
kinda scary...

00:29:59.732 --> 00:30:02.503 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] Scary?
[Yuu] You know, I
heard something...

00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:04.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
a rumor that his wife died...

00:30:08.942 --> 00:30:10.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pardon me.

00:30:10.878 --> 00:30:11.745 position:5% line:89% align:start
So?

00:30:11.845 --> 00:30:13.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seems like he went
home already.

00:30:16.117 --> 00:30:16.717 position:5% line:89% align:start
Later!

00:30:16.817 --> 00:30:18.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you tomorrow.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:47.650 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Music box plays]

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Doorbell rings]

00:30:52.255 --> 00:30:53.622 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can I help you?

00:30:53.722 --> 00:30:56.460 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, I'm sorry, but I had
something I wanted to ask you

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
about what you said in class.

00:30:58.895 --> 00:31:01.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, just give me
a moment.

00:31:06.471 --> 00:31:07.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Do you drink coffee?

00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:11.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, yes! If you could put some
milk in it...

00:31:11.842 --> 00:31:13.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:31:13.677 --> 00:31:16.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, I'm sorry for barging in
like this.

00:31:16.514 --> 00:31:18.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
I asked Ms. Ikeda where
you lived.

00:31:18.483 --> 00:31:22.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well now as you can see, you're
not bothering anyone but me.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry my place is not quite
ready for guests.

00:31:24.622 --> 00:31:26.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've just arrived here.

00:31:27.426 --> 00:31:29.627 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what can I do?

00:31:29.727 --> 00:31:32.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
U-um, about what you said
in class today...

00:31:32.464 --> 00:31:35.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] You were listening
very intently, yes...

00:31:35.434 --> 00:31:39.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have someone you want to
bring back from the dead?

00:31:39.238 --> 00:31:42.975 position:5% line:77% align:start
It was you who met the stranger
that came from Agartha
wasn't it?

00:31:45.811 --> 00:31:47.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Take a look at this.

00:31:55.955 --> 00:31:58.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] We call them
"Quetzal Coatl".

00:31:58.391 --> 00:32:02.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
The gatekeepers that guard the
entrances to Agartha.

00:32:02.262 --> 00:32:05.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
Compare that, to
this illustration.

00:32:07.268 --> 00:32:10.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] It looks similar to the
one from before.

00:32:10.171 --> 00:32:14.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a 3,000-year-old statue of
a god from Sumeria.

00:32:14.208 --> 00:32:17.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
Once there were gods just like
this all around the world,

00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:20.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
they were guiding the path
of humanity.

00:32:20.714 --> 00:32:23.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
When it was still in
its infancy.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those are what we call
Quetzal Coatl.

00:32:25.453 --> 00:32:30.292 position:5% line:77% align:start
Eventually humanity grew up,
and the existence of gods was
no longer necessary.

00:32:30.392 --> 00:32:32.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
They hid themselves under the
Earth as gatekeepers.

00:32:33.094 --> 00:32:35.864 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Morisaki] Along with a number
of different clans.
[Asuna] Clans?

00:32:35.964 --> 00:32:40.769 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Morisaki] A small number of
humans went with the Quetzal
Coatl underneath the ground.

00:32:40.869 --> 00:32:43.205 position:5% line:89% align:start
To the Underworld, Agartha.

00:32:43.306 --> 00:32:46.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
There the gods that disappeared
remained with their secrets,

00:32:46.141 --> 00:32:50.413 position:5% line:77% align:start
and it is said to be a place
where any kind of wish can
be fulfilled.

00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:52.381 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even resurrecting the dead!

00:32:54.417 --> 00:32:56.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is Agartha a real place?

00:32:58.421 --> 00:33:01.425 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who knows? It could just be an
old legend.

00:33:01.525 --> 00:33:04.528 position:5% line:77% align:start
I've only been doing researching
all the different theories on
the matter.

00:33:04.628 --> 00:33:06.530 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just a little hobby of mine.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:07.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
But where...

00:33:09.066 --> 00:33:11.435 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should head home. It's
getting dark.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.072 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Thank you.

00:33:16.506 --> 00:33:18.342 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure I was much help...

00:33:18.442 --> 00:33:19.943 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, you were...

00:33:20.043 --> 00:33:24.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mr. Morisaki, I'm sure that
Agartha really exists.

00:33:26.817 --> 00:33:32.056 position:5% line:77% align:start
It'll be night soon. Go straight
home, and don't stray from
the path.

00:33:45.437 --> 00:33:46.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi?!

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.774 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait... Mimi!

00:33:51.877 --> 00:33:53.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
I said wait!

00:33:55.848 --> 00:33:57.916 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi, where are you?

00:34:30.217 --> 00:34:31.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun, Shun!

00:34:31.753 --> 00:34:33.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
I knew it!

00:34:33.554 --> 00:34:35.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're okay!

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:37.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hand off! Who are you?

00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:41.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did he make contact with a
Topsider or something?

00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:42.664 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Shun?

00:34:42.764 --> 00:34:44.299 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] He's gone.

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:46.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just forget everything
that's happened.

00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:56.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
Arch Angel's here? I have to go!

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:04.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
A boy from Agartha? Hand over
the Clavis.

00:35:06.389 --> 00:35:07.957 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who are these men?

00:35:08.057 --> 00:35:09.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] What do they want?

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:14.864 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] Damn it!

00:35:18.602 --> 00:35:20.937 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna screams]

00:35:26.377 --> 00:35:27.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't hit them.

00:35:27.945 --> 00:35:30.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll let them lead us to it.

00:35:43.461 --> 00:35:44.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
That jewel...

00:35:44.796 --> 00:35:48.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] This Clavis? I came to
the surface to get it back.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
This way, they can't get in.

00:35:51.102 --> 00:35:52.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait until morning and then
go home.

00:35:52.671 --> 00:35:53.972 position:5% line:89% align:start
The surface?

00:35:54.072 --> 00:35:56.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
So Agartha really
is underground?

00:35:56.908 --> 00:35:58.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] You've even heard
about that?

00:35:58.878 --> 00:36:01.580 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shun... Could you have lost
your memories?

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.015 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now look...

00:36:05.484 --> 00:36:06.619 position:5% line:89% align:start
In there.

00:36:20.267 --> 00:36:23.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn it! They're coming in!

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, how far are we...

00:36:41.122 --> 00:36:43.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] Hurry up and follow me!
They're coming after us!

00:36:43.691 --> 00:36:45.526 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun, is this cave...

00:36:45.626 --> 00:36:48.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] I told you already!
I'm not Shun!

00:36:48.396 --> 00:36:51.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am under no obligation to save
you, by the way.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then what's the deal? If you're
not Shun, then who are you?

00:36:57.239 --> 00:36:59.842 position:5% line:89% align:start
Quiet. You stay here.

00:36:59.942 --> 00:37:00.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:37:01.009 --> 00:37:02.411 position:5% line:89% align:start
The gatekeeper.

00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:16.926 position:5% line:83% align:start
The gatekeepers once guided
humans long ago.

00:37:17.025 --> 00:37:22.699 position:5% line:77% align:start
But because of the polluted
atmosphere above, most of them
have lost their senses...

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
It'd be great if
they remembered...

00:37:34.043 --> 00:37:34.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Shun!

00:37:34.912 --> 00:37:36.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] Stay back!

00:37:47.926 --> 00:37:49.093 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:37:49.193 --> 00:37:51.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] It's not over yet.
Take the Clavis.

00:37:51.563 --> 00:37:53.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to kill
the gatekeeper.

00:37:53.798 --> 00:37:55.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to put him
to sleep!

00:38:27.935 --> 00:38:28.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun!

00:38:28.869 --> 00:38:30.304 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun!

00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:37.210 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Gunshots]

00:38:42.215 --> 00:38:44.251 position:5% line:89% align:start
This must be the entrance!

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:47.555 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Are you okay?

00:38:49.023 --> 00:38:49.991 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's run...

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:51.292 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] That's a Pakicetus...

00:38:51.392 --> 00:38:53.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
They were supposed to
be extinct.

00:38:55.163 --> 00:38:58.834 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Soldier] What is it?
[Morisaki] An ancient whale from
50 million years ago.

00:38:58.934 --> 00:38:59.835 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kill it.

00:38:59.935 --> 00:39:01.036 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Soldier] We can't do that.

00:39:01.135 --> 00:39:02.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
We have to recover all
the evidence...

00:39:02.403 --> 00:39:03.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] As long as we get
that Clavis,

00:39:03.906 --> 00:39:05.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
there won't be any complaints.

00:39:05.941 --> 00:39:07.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do it.

00:39:07.108 --> 00:39:08.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop!

00:39:17.252 --> 00:39:19.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] Come here with
that Clavis!

00:39:19.956 --> 00:39:21.557 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't, I'll kill
the boy.

00:39:21.658 --> 00:39:22.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] Don't do it.

00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:26.228 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then again, I could just kill
both of you righ there.

00:39:26.663 --> 00:39:28.263 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun...

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:30.433 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll save you when I see
a chance.

00:39:31.134 --> 00:39:32.469 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:39:39.442 --> 00:39:41.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] Don't stop,
keep walking.

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:48.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
Watch over the boy here.

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.221 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Soldier] Is that the gate?

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:51.722 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Most likely.

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:54.425 position:5% line:83% align:start
Neither explosives nor drills
will be effective,

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.160 position:5% line:89% align:start
like at the South Pole.

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:07.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
Touch the Clavis to that light.

00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:12.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] What's the matter?
Do it!

00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:21.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] The Interstitial
Sea...

00:40:21.621 --> 00:40:24.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
Finally, it's within
my grasp...

00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:27.527 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good work, men.

00:40:27.627 --> 00:40:29.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Soldier] Commander, what
are you...

00:40:29.562 --> 00:40:32.532 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] I'll be going alone
from here.

00:40:32.632 --> 00:40:35.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
Give the old men back at Europa
my best wishes.

00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:37.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't move!

00:40:43.242 --> 00:40:44.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shun!

00:40:55.255 --> 00:40:56.825 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the meaning of this?

00:41:00.028 --> 00:41:01.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mr. Morisaki?

00:41:01.663 --> 00:41:03.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] Now that I've come
this far,

00:41:03.164 --> 00:41:04.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have no reason to be
your enemy.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.435 position:5% line:83% align:start
All I want to do is go
to Agartha.

00:41:07.535 --> 00:41:09.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] Agartha is falling
into ruin.

00:41:09.537 --> 00:41:12.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nothing Arch Angel hopes to
find is there.

00:41:12.474 --> 00:41:16.779 position:5% line:77% align:start
I do not seek the secret to
eternal life or the knowledge
of the ancients.

00:41:16.879 --> 00:41:19.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
All I want is to return my wife
to the living.

00:41:23.586 --> 00:41:25.654 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] Do as you wish,
I don't care.

00:41:25.755 --> 00:41:28.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
My only mission was to retrieve
the Clavis.

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:31.594 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] What's your name?

00:41:31.694 --> 00:41:32.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna.

00:41:32.661 --> 00:41:35.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm Shin. Shun's
younger brother.

00:41:35.598 --> 00:41:37.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Shin? Then, Shun is...

00:41:38.034 --> 00:41:39.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] My brother is dead.

00:41:39.569 --> 00:41:42.139 position:5% line:83% align:start
He knew that he couldn't survive
on the surface for long,

00:41:42.239 --> 00:41:44.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
yet he broke the rules and
went anyway.

00:41:45.275 --> 00:41:46.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] I'm leaving now.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can open the exit even
without a Clavis.

00:41:56.821 --> 00:42:00.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry about you getting
involved, Asuna...

00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:01.692 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin...

00:42:18.143 --> 00:42:20.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] I didn't mean to put
you in the middle.

00:42:21.079 --> 00:42:23.249 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Mr. Morisaki, why?

00:42:23.348 --> 00:42:25.450 position:5% line:83% align:start
Have you heard of the name
Arch Angel?

00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:29.421 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Asuna] No...
[Morisaki] It's the only
organization that recognizes
the existence of Agartha.

00:42:29.521 --> 00:42:34.227 position:5% line:77% align:start
It wants the knowledge of the
Underworld in order to lead
humanity on the proper path.

00:42:34.326 --> 00:42:39.599 position:5% line:77% align:start
I am a member, and have been
searching for the entrance to
Agartha for more than ten years.

00:42:39.699 --> 00:42:42.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
But, the people you
were with...

00:42:42.836 --> 00:42:45.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
Arch Angel is nothing more than
a group of empty-headed,

00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:47.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
Gnostics and self
rightgeous scholars.

00:42:47.107 --> 00:42:49.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nothing they believe is of any
interest to me.

00:42:49.809 --> 00:42:53.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
My only goal in finding this
place is to resurrect my wife.

00:42:53.647 --> 00:42:56.483 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to head to Agartha,
and search for a way.

00:42:58.152 --> 00:43:00.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry you were dragged
into this.

00:43:09.597 --> 00:43:11.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's vita-aqua, I knew it.

00:43:13.068 --> 00:43:14.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Mr. Morisaki!

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.208 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mr. Morisaki...

00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:21.476 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm coming too!

00:43:21.576 --> 00:43:22.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
And why's that? Could it be,

00:43:22.978 --> 00:43:25.081 position:5% line:83% align:start
you just want to bring that dead
boy back to life?

00:43:25.181 --> 00:43:26.548 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Well...

00:43:26.648 --> 00:43:28.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't really know...

00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:29.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
But...!

00:43:32.321 --> 00:43:36.726 position:5% line:77% align:start
It may be a dangerous journey,
and I don't know when or if
we'll be able to get back.

00:43:36.826 --> 00:43:37.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take my hand.

00:43:47.403 --> 00:43:49.840 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is an ancient fluid known
as vita-aqua.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it fills your lungs, you
should be able to breathe.

00:43:53.543 --> 00:43:55.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
Agartha should just be below.

00:43:55.812 --> 00:43:57.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um, Mr. Morisaki, wait...

00:43:57.648 --> 00:44:00.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's okay. You can breathe in
the water.

00:44:00.617 --> 00:44:03.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is to bring back
someone precious...

00:44:03.187 --> 00:44:05.522 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make your decision, Asuna!

00:45:27.943 --> 00:45:29.945 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Watase] We'll be able to
meet her soon...

00:45:30.045 --> 00:45:35.083 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mrs. Watase] Yes... I pray that
this child's life will be
a blessing...

00:45:35.183 --> 00:45:41.157 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mr. Watase] Don't worry. Just
by being born, life is already
full of great happiness.

00:45:42.657 --> 00:45:43.993 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right...

00:45:45.294 --> 00:45:47.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] I need to be born soon.

00:46:01.211 --> 00:46:02.545 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stars...

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.184 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi...

00:46:17.561 --> 00:46:19.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Are you awake?

00:46:21.132 --> 00:46:24.269 position:5% line:83% align:start
That little guy popped out of
your backpack.

00:46:24.369 --> 00:46:26.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
You brought it with you?

00:46:26.237 --> 00:46:28.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
No... When did you...

00:46:28.973 --> 00:46:32.811 position:5% line:77% align:start
You might not have the luxury
to take it with you the
whole way.

00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:34.679 position:5% line:89% align:start
With me?

00:46:34.779 --> 00:46:36.182 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Mr. Morisaki, is this...

00:46:36.282 --> 00:46:37.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] It looks like we can
get through,

00:46:37.782 --> 00:46:40.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
those stairs on the other side.
Let's go.

00:46:48.394 --> 00:46:49.429 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something is here?

00:46:49.529 --> 00:46:51.730 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Yes...

00:46:51.831 --> 00:46:54.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
This might be another
gatekeeper.

00:46:55.701 --> 00:46:56.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's looking at us.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.372 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then I guess we'll have to take
it straight on.

00:47:01.274 --> 00:47:02.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi!

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Mimi, come here.
[Morisaki] Asuna!

00:47:23.397 --> 00:47:24.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi!

00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:36.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Asuna, let's go.

00:47:38.213 --> 00:47:41.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
That might be more useful than
I thought.

00:48:05.341 --> 00:48:07.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
So this is Agartha.

00:48:09.513 --> 00:48:11.114 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mr. Morisaki, look!

00:48:15.885 --> 00:48:19.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shakuna Vimana! The flying ark
on which God rides!

00:48:19.723 --> 00:48:21.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just like it was written.

00:48:21.292 --> 00:48:22.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
God...

00:48:26.297 --> 00:48:27.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's...

00:48:27.532 --> 00:48:28.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
A Clavis?

00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:32.237 position:5% line:83% align:start
A fragment of one? But why do
you have that?

00:48:32.337 --> 00:48:36.141 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] It's a crystal for a
radio. A memento from my dad.

00:48:36.241 --> 00:48:37.475 position:5% line:89% align:start
A memento?

00:48:41.146 --> 00:48:44.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] Clavis is Latin
for "key".

00:48:44.182 --> 00:48:47.052 position:5% line:83% align:start
It may end up being of help to
us later.

00:48:47.152 --> 00:48:49.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] Take good care of it.
[Asuna] Right.

00:48:49.488 --> 00:48:51.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] Let's head in the
same direction as that ark.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.162 position:5% line:77% align:start
Whereever that ark is head is
probably where you and I need
to be.

00:49:34.168 --> 00:49:35.303 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here.

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.941 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are traces of villages,
just as you thought!

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:14.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
Although no matter where we go,
they're in ruins.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.748 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] There might still be
some vegetable fields. I'll
go check.

00:50:17.847 --> 00:50:19.416 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come here, Mimi!

00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:39.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
Toward Finis Terra...
The Gate of Life and Death...

00:50:40.004 --> 00:50:41.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mr. Morisaki, look!

00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:46.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Looks like I've found
tonight's dinner...

00:50:46.244 --> 00:50:47.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
See?

00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:52.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
Some potatoes might be
poisonous, just in case...

00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:54.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] I'll remove the poison
with water!

00:50:54.486 --> 00:50:55.854 position:5% line:89% align:start
And also, your clothes...

00:50:55.954 --> 00:50:58.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Yours are pretty dirty
too, you know.

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll wash them afterwards, so
please get changed.

00:51:01.594 --> 00:51:03.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Potatoes, yay!

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:24.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
These are good.

00:51:24.818 --> 00:51:26.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank goodness I found some
some salt,

00:51:26.387 --> 00:51:28.956 position:5% line:83% align:start
that was still left in that
old kitchen.

00:51:36.196 --> 00:51:37.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] I'm surprised.

00:51:39.299 --> 00:51:41.369 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is this journey fun for you?

00:51:41.469 --> 00:51:42.604 position:5% line:89% align:start
I...

00:51:45.874 --> 00:51:48.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whenever I listened to
the radio,

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:53.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
I felt like there was a far-off
world I had to get to somewhere.

00:51:53.948 --> 00:51:59.622 position:5% line:77% align:start
"This is not where I belong.
There is a place I've never
seen before..."

00:51:59.722 --> 00:52:04.293 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then I met a mysterious boy,
and chased him all the
way here...

00:52:04.393 --> 00:52:06.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
And ever since I came
to Agartha,

00:52:06.395 --> 00:52:09.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
my heart has been beating a mile
a minute for some reason...

00:52:10.099 --> 00:52:13.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I'm sure that ahead
of here, something...

00:52:36.727 --> 00:52:38.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:52:38.463 --> 00:52:42.800 position:5% line:77% align:start
Not being able to see the
stars at night makes me
somewhat uneasy.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:47.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
It makes you realize just how
solitary human existence is.

00:52:48.973 --> 00:52:51.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Elder] Shin Canaan Praeses.

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:56.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
As for the recovery of the
Clavis, we laud your service.

00:52:56.882 --> 00:52:59.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you have made a
grave error.

00:52:59.585 --> 00:53:03.455 position:5% line:77% align:start
A man and girl have come from
the surface with Clavis
in hand,

00:53:03.555 --> 00:53:06.024 position:5% line:83% align:start
making pace toward the Gate of
Life and Death.

00:53:06.124 --> 00:53:07.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] But I have the Clavis
right here...

00:53:07.993 --> 00:53:09.995 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Elder] Theirs is a
different fragment.

00:53:10.095 --> 00:53:15.234 position:5% line:77% align:start
You stood there and foolishly
allowed those Topsiders
entrance into Agartha...

00:53:15.334 --> 00:53:17.337 position:5% line:89% align:start
This was a grave error.

00:53:17.437 --> 00:53:19.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
But the task which I was given
was only...

00:53:19.639 --> 00:53:20.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
Out with such excuses!

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do not waste your breath.

00:53:23.042 --> 00:53:25.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
Our days of prosperity are
long past,

00:53:25.278 --> 00:53:27.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
and we are living the long days
of twilight.

00:53:27.948 --> 00:53:33.219 position:5% line:77% align:start
Our wish now is to fade away
into Astral, the endpoint of
life itself.

00:53:33.319 --> 00:53:35.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
But every time a gate
is opened,

00:53:35.288 --> 00:53:38.124 position:5% line:83% align:start
Topsiders come and press in
upon Agartha,

00:53:38.225 --> 00:53:41.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
throwing our peaceful existence
into turmoil...

00:53:50.437 --> 00:53:57.245 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Elder] We shan't ever forget
the suffering we once endured,
be it even for a moment.

00:54:00.282 --> 00:54:02.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
A disheartening pity.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
Facing the coming-of-
age ceremony,

00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:07.289 position:5% line:83% align:start
your eyes are as of yet
not open.

00:54:07.389 --> 00:54:11.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
Unable to peer into the vision
of the Quetzal Coatl...

00:54:11.661 --> 00:54:15.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
Unsuited to sense the breath of
the Clavis!

00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:18.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your brother had natural gifts.

00:54:18.367 --> 00:54:23.941 position:5% line:77% align:start
But his soul was weak, and his
yearning for the surface grew
ever stronger.

00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:28.845 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shin Canaan Preases, I give you
a new task.

00:54:41.692 --> 00:54:42.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

00:54:42.726 --> 00:54:45.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seri! Aren't you in the middle
of a task?

00:54:45.596 --> 00:54:47.531 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just a short break isn't
a problem.

00:54:52.971 --> 00:54:54.906 position:5% line:89% align:start
Seri, about Shun...

00:54:55.006 --> 00:54:56.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:54:56.708 --> 00:54:57.642 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a shame.

00:54:57.742 --> 00:55:00.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
No... Even if the illness
was hastened,

00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:03.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that Shun saw what he
wanted to.

00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:10.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shin... You have another
task, yes?

00:55:10.188 --> 00:55:13.626 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Shin] Yes. I have to find the
Topsiders and confiscate
their Clavis.

00:55:13.726 --> 00:55:14.860 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Seri] But that's...

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] It's not like I was told
I had to kill them.

00:55:17.429 --> 00:55:18.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
But if I have to...

00:55:18.797 --> 00:55:21.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't do such a dangerous
task by yourself!

00:55:21.767 --> 00:55:25.939 position:5% line:77% align:start
After our parents died, the
people of the village
raised us.

00:55:26.039 --> 00:55:27.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have to repay that debt.

00:56:26.334 --> 00:56:27.170 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Eat.

00:56:27.269 --> 00:56:28.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much...

00:56:28.538 --> 00:56:30.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe we should make soup?

00:56:33.042 --> 00:56:34.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here you go.

00:56:38.448 --> 00:56:41.517 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Morisaki] What is it?
[Asuna] You seem to be getting
along all of a sudden.

00:56:41.617 --> 00:56:44.822 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Morisaki] Well, if it comes
down to it, we can use the cat
for food.

00:56:47.624 --> 00:56:49.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm joking.

00:56:55.066 --> 00:57:01.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Mr. Morisaki... It's
like you're my... dad.

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:10.415 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't be silly.

00:57:26.398 --> 00:57:30.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have fever, it's rare, you
never get sick.

00:57:30.836 --> 00:57:34.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Lisa] I thought it was my job
to fall ill all the time.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.842 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Young Morisaki] I'm sorry.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:40.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you feel that way,
can you promise me something?

00:57:40.213 --> 00:57:41.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:57:41.948 --> 00:57:47.387 position:5% line:77% align:start
Even when I'm long gone, promise
me you'll keep on living a
good life?

00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:52.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Lisa, my next mission will be
over soon.

00:57:52.226 --> 00:57:55.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
After I get back, let's go back
to my country together.

00:57:55.428 --> 00:57:57.531 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we do that, then your
illness will definitely...

00:57:57.631 --> 00:57:59.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Lisa] That's not what I asked.

00:57:59.267 --> 00:58:05.606 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen... Everyone on this earth
pass on from this life sometime.

00:58:05.706 --> 00:58:09.710 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Lisa] The only difference is
whether it comes sooner,
or later.

00:58:11.646 --> 00:58:14.482 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'm just going a bit
before you...

00:58:18.386 --> 00:58:21.490 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's no changing that.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.331 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Lisa coughing]

00:58:40.076 --> 00:58:41.611 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Lisa...</i>

00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:45.481 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Don't say that.</i>

00:58:45.582 --> 00:58:49.419 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>You aren't going to leave me,</i>
 <i>and I am never going to leave</i>
 <i>your side.</i>

00:58:56.927 --> 00:59:00.197 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I would never prepare for</i>
 <i>your absence...</i>

00:59:00.297 --> 00:59:01.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
For certain...

00:59:07.538 --> 00:59:09.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
Lisa, are you there? Talk to me.

00:59:09.807 --> 00:59:14.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Um...you seemed like you
were uncomfortable, so I...

00:59:14.279 --> 00:59:18.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] Asuna... Did I
say something?

00:59:18.116 --> 00:59:19.017 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] No...

00:59:20.285 --> 00:59:21.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] A rainbow.

00:59:39.705 --> 00:59:42.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're heading toward the land
where the Izoku dwell.

00:59:45.345 --> 00:59:46.679 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gotta hurry!

01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:01.161 position:5% line:89% align:start
Got it!

01:00:11.839 --> 01:00:18.980 position:5% line:77% align:start
I see... So the scenery that I
would see while listening to the
radio was a part of Agartha...

01:00:24.018 --> 01:00:27.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come. Let's go, Asuna. I know
what it means to say goodbye.

01:02:02.822 --> 01:02:07.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's okay, don't cry. You're
all right.

01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:19.706 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Littl girl crying]

01:02:34.523 --> 01:02:35.757 position:5% line:89% align:start
Any luck?

01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:38.160 position:5% line:89% align:start
What should we do?

01:02:54.743 --> 01:02:56.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? What's wrong?

01:03:21.771 --> 01:03:23.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're gone.

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:38.090 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see the Clavis!

01:03:38.756 --> 01:03:40.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on!

01:03:53.105 --> 01:03:55.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
They can't go out from
the shadows!

01:04:00.812 --> 01:04:02.849 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come here!

01:04:02.949 --> 01:04:05.051 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's okay, come here!

01:04:07.353 --> 01:04:08.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
Climb!

01:04:12.158 --> 01:04:13.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
Climb!

01:04:21.635 --> 01:04:23.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Please, you can do it!

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:31.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
Grab on!

01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:32.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna!

01:04:43.525 --> 01:04:45.026 position:5% line:89% align:start
Quick! Come on!

01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:50.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin is that you?

01:04:50.765 --> 01:04:52.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like you got it right
this time.

01:05:03.212 --> 01:05:05.982 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] This is the nest
of Izoku.

01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:09.586 position:5% line:77% align:start
Come on, they'll devour you
and your so-called
defiled blood.

01:05:09.686 --> 01:05:11.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
We got to get out of here!

01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:13.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shin! How did you know we
were here?

01:05:13.923 --> 01:05:16.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, after we last met, I chased
after you into Agartha!

01:05:16.994 --> 01:05:20.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that's caused me a whole lot
of trouble, thank you!

01:05:20.464 --> 01:05:23.133 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] What? I just wanted to
see you again...
[Shin] Don't talk, just run!

01:05:23.233 --> 01:05:24.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shin] They're coming after you!

01:05:24.602 --> 01:05:26.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] I am running!

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Shin! Shin,
they're coming!

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:39.884 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna, jump!

01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:49.060 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:52.864 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

01:05:53.565 --> 01:05:55.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:56.302 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on!

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:26.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
Asuna, you still have a fragment
of the Clavis, don't you?

01:06:26.266 --> 01:06:28.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
Might want to hand it over
to me.

01:06:54.162 --> 01:06:55.297 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

01:07:09.712 --> 01:07:11.047 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

01:07:18.554 --> 01:07:20.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have to save him.

01:07:48.887 --> 01:07:50.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hold it, little guy!

01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:58.664 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna!

01:08:03.736 --> 01:08:05.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Asuna!

01:08:06.372 --> 01:08:07.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna...

01:08:15.715 --> 01:08:17.049 position:5% line:89% align:start
A horse?

01:08:24.691 --> 01:08:28.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] He told you to give
him the Clavis?

01:08:30.464 --> 01:08:35.670 position:5% line:71% align:start
It doesn't seem like those
things that snatched you off
were planning to give us a
nice welcome.

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
And what'll we do with her?

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.679 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is it?

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:45.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something's over there?

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.515 position:5% line:89% align:start
Downstream?

01:08:50.785 --> 01:08:52.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're covered in sweat!

01:08:57.826 --> 01:08:58.560 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna?

01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:59.428 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

01:08:59.528 --> 01:09:01.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're safe, too?

01:09:02.231 --> 01:09:03.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] Thank goodness.
You're all right...

01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:06.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] Right... We were
swept away...

01:09:07.302 --> 01:09:08.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, I'll get you water.

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:10.807 position:5% line:89% align:start
You! What are you doing here!?

01:09:10.907 --> 01:09:13.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're from Arch Angel!

01:09:13.208 --> 01:09:17.680 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know that you have a Clavis
on you. Leave it here and get
out of Agartha!

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tell me why.

01:09:18.715 --> 01:09:19.816 position:5% line:89% align:start
How should I know?

01:09:19.916 --> 01:09:22.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the job I've been
tasked with!

01:09:22.352 --> 01:09:24.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hand over the Clavis!

01:09:36.332 --> 01:09:39.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, let's go where that
little girl was pointing.

01:09:39.235 --> 01:09:41.805 position:5% line:89% align:start
There might be a village there.

01:09:41.906 --> 01:09:44.341 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm bringing him with us.

01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:47.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do whatever you want.

01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:19.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
There are people!

01:10:19.946 --> 01:10:23.015 position:5% line:89% align:start
The first living village.

01:10:23.115 --> 01:10:25.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's go, but watch yourself.

01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:35.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh dear...

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:37.898 position:5% line:89% align:start
It couldn't be...

01:10:37.998 --> 01:10:39.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Villager 1] They're Topsiders.

01:10:39.266 --> 01:10:41.068 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Villager 2] I can't
believe this.

01:10:41.168 --> 01:10:42.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Villager 3] A bad omen...

01:10:47.174 --> 01:10:49.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone, stand back!

01:10:59.387 --> 01:11:03.993 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's the little mute girl. The
defiled child kidnapped the day
before yesterday.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.526 position:5% line:89% align:start
Halt there!

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.735 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dinah's child, yes?

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:19.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you for bringing our
village's child back.

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:21.944 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you are Topsiders from
the surface.

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:25.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'm afraid our village of
Amaurot cannot accept Topsiders.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:28.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
You will have to turn back.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:33.490 position:5% line:77% align:start
U-um, could you at least take a
look at this person? He's
been injured.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:36.359 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Guard] Those clothes. He's
from Canaan?
[Asuna] I think he has a fever.
He needs your help.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why is someone of Agartha
with those from the surface?

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:40.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
I cannot.

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:41.698 position:5% line:89% align:start
Begone!

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:46.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Grandfather] Wait!

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:50.340 position:5% line:89% align:start
Manna, I'm so happy you're back!

01:11:53.778 --> 01:11:55.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, forgive my
village's rudeness.

01:11:55.946 --> 01:11:59.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not even a word of thanks for
saving my granddaughter?

01:11:59.117 --> 01:12:00.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
Old Master!

01:12:00.618 --> 01:12:03.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
Must I suffer the dishonor of
not even doing that much?

01:12:10.796 --> 01:12:15.934 position:5% line:77% align:start
This way. Bringing you through
the village would cause you to
stand out too much.

01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:25.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
His fever will break soon.

01:12:26.045 --> 01:12:29.749 position:5% line:77% align:start
Although it will be a little
while before he is able to
move again.

01:12:29.849 --> 01:12:33.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
He'll live, so there is no need
for worry.

01:12:33.753 --> 01:12:34.921 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness.

01:12:35.021 --> 01:12:36.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is all thanks to you...

01:12:36.756 --> 01:12:39.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was a wound from the
Izoku, yes?

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:40.760 position:5% line:89% align:start
Izoku?

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Grandfather] They're a
cursed tribe,

01:12:42.228 --> 01:12:44.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
that hates both light
and water...

01:12:44.164 --> 01:12:45.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
But they are part of
the structure,

01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:48.602 position:5% line:83% align:start
that maintains this world in its
current state.

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:52.439 position:5% line:77% align:start
That is why they hate it so
much when the two sides are
mixed together.

01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:54.209 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Morisaki] Mixed together?

01:12:54.308 --> 01:12:56.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, then that child...

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:59.279 position:5% line:89% align:start
Manna's father is a Topsider.

01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:03.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
Things such as that do not
happen often.

01:13:09.424 --> 01:13:11.059 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get out of our village!

01:13:11.159 --> 01:13:13.027 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get out!

01:13:15.296 --> 01:13:17.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Grandfather] I apologize,
Miss...

01:13:17.332 --> 01:13:23.338 position:5% line:77% align:start
But the coming of Topsiders
is not looked upon as a good
omen among my villager.

01:13:23.939 --> 01:13:25.373 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna come on.

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:30.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
For hundred of years, kings and
emperors from the surface,

01:13:30.846 --> 01:13:34.984 position:5% line:83% align:start
came to steal the wealth and
wisdom of Agartha.

01:13:35.085 --> 01:13:40.791 position:5% line:77% align:start
The kings needed Agartha's
knowledge and treasure to rule
over the surface, you see.

01:13:42.058 --> 01:13:45.829 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what they brought in return
were countless wars...

01:13:45.929 --> 01:13:50.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were more glorious than
anywhere on the surface.

01:13:51.067 --> 01:13:55.739 position:5% line:77% align:start
But our cities were all
but destroyed, and our birth
rate dwindled.

01:13:55.839 --> 01:13:59.643 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now there are but a handful of
villages that remain.

01:13:59.743 --> 01:14:02.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
And so we shut the gates with
the Claves,

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:06.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
locking them to prevent anyone
from the surface from entering.

01:14:07.752 --> 01:14:10.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll show you to my archive.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:14.625 position:5% line:77% align:start
Will you help me prepare dinner
there, Miss? If you'd be
so kind?

01:14:14.725 --> 01:14:15.893 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes.

01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:17.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
This way.

01:14:21.266 --> 01:14:22.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi...

01:14:25.103 --> 01:14:26.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
Manna...

01:14:33.179 --> 01:14:34.613 position:5% line:89% align:start
What next, Elder?

01:14:34.713 --> 01:14:36.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Grandfather] Would you cut up
that bigroot for me please?

01:14:36.916 --> 01:14:38.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure.

01:14:38.251 --> 01:14:39.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean this?

01:14:39.252 --> 01:14:40.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes...

01:14:43.556 --> 01:14:47.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
A daikon...
No, Mimi, stop!

01:14:47.393 --> 01:14:52.299 position:5% line:77% align:start
I've never seen a Yadoriko get
along so well with a
Topsider before.

01:14:52.398 --> 01:14:54.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yadoriko? What do you mean,
a cat?

01:14:54.567 --> 01:14:57.704 position:5% line:83% align:start
Animals in which reside
God's children.

01:14:57.805 --> 01:15:00.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
Raised with humans, after they
serve their purpose,

01:15:00.373 --> 01:15:04.745 position:5% line:77% align:start
they become one with the
Quetzal Coatl and live
for eternity.

01:15:04.845 --> 01:15:06.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
God...

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.448 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't it nice to be mistaken,

01:15:07.548 --> 01:15:10.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
for such a wonderful creature
like that, Mimi?

01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:16.024 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now, would you like to give
Manna a bath before dinner
is ready?

01:15:17.424 --> 01:15:18.760 position:5% line:89% align:start
A bath?!

01:15:24.165 --> 01:15:26.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
Baths are amazing...

01:15:31.073 --> 01:15:32.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey Manna, hold it!

01:15:33.875 --> 01:15:35.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mr. Morisaki...

01:15:35.177 --> 01:15:36.645 position:5% line:89% align:start
How do you like this outfit?

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:38.881 position:5% line:89% align:start
I borrowed it from the Elder.

01:15:40.216 --> 01:15:41.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
It doesn't quite suit you.

01:15:55.299 --> 01:15:57.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do why are you crying?

01:15:57.334 --> 01:16:00.404 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because it's so delicious!

01:16:00.537 --> 01:16:05.542 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Morisaki] Elder, if I may, I
was wondering if you could
answer my question from earlier.

01:16:05.642 --> 01:16:08.979 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Grandfather] It is forbidden
to bring back the dead here
in Agartha.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.952 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you're saying that it's
forbidden, that means there
is a way.

01:16:14.052 --> 01:16:19.057 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, life and death are just
part of the flow of something
much bigger.

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:24.162 position:5% line:77% align:start
Those humans who wish to
interrupt that flow shall
not be permitted to do so.

01:16:24.262 --> 01:16:25.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not permitted?

01:16:25.563 --> 01:16:29.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why? Exactly whose permission
must I ask?

01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:32.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
Elder, even we on the surface
know such platitudes.

01:16:32.137 --> 01:16:37.309 position:5% line:77% align:start
I only want to know one thing
where and how one can reunite
with lost loved ones.

01:16:37.409 --> 01:16:38.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's all.

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:47.253 position:5% line:71% align:start
Grieving over the dead is
proper, but to continue to
pity them is erroneous
and unproductive.

01:16:47.354 --> 01:16:52.658 position:5% line:77% align:start
You should not have involved a
girl of such youth in your own
delusional fallacy.

01:16:52.758 --> 01:16:55.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
Asuna came here out of her own
free will!

01:16:55.527 --> 01:16:56.796 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um! I...

01:16:56.896 --> 01:16:59.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
All you do is sit here, staring
up at the gods,

01:16:59.432 --> 01:17:02.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
locked up in this cellar for
2,000 years!

01:17:07.074 --> 01:17:12.079 position:5% line:77% align:start
Miss, would you, I apologize,
but can you look after the
little one for me?

01:17:12.179 --> 01:17:13.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, go.

01:17:13.447 --> 01:17:14.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

01:17:25.092 --> 01:17:28.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those clothes don't suit you
at all.

01:17:28.863 --> 01:17:31.266 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not a nice thing to say!

01:17:33.035 --> 01:17:35.103 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why did you do it?

01:17:35.203 --> 01:17:36.772 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tell me why you saved me?

01:17:36.872 --> 01:17:39.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because you saved me, and I
couldn't just leave you.

01:17:39.975 --> 01:17:43.279 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was only forced to clean up
after my big brother.

01:17:43.379 --> 01:17:44.946 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean Shun?

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin don't!

01:17:47.616 --> 01:17:48.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't force yourself...

01:17:49.052 --> 01:17:52.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know that you can't
stay here anymore.

01:17:52.355 --> 01:17:54.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
Damn it... I should have let the
Izoku kill you,

01:17:54.791 --> 01:17:56.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
then taken your Clavis when I
had the chance.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:01.164 position:5% line:77% align:start
Or even better, I should have
just killed those Arch Angels on
the surface.

01:18:01.597 --> 01:18:03.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
Leave.

01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:04.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin?

01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:06.303 position:5% line:89% align:start
I said leave!

01:18:11.008 --> 01:18:12.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll leave early
tomorrow morning.

01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:15.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
You need to get to bed and
get some sleep.

01:18:17.948 --> 01:18:22.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm terribly sorry. I can't
shelter Topsiders for long.

01:18:22.554 --> 01:18:24.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've said what I could to him.

01:18:24.456 --> 01:18:29.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can stay tonight, at least,
and you can bunk with Manna.

01:18:34.499 --> 01:18:35.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi.

01:18:45.411 --> 01:18:46.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
Brother...

01:18:50.249 --> 01:18:56.155 position:5% line:77% align:start
Everyone set out on each of
their journeys is a cry
for help.

01:18:56.255 --> 01:19:00.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
If only somebody had been able
to stop them...

01:19:09.803 --> 01:19:13.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
This made me feel like my
daughter had returned to me.

01:19:13.773 --> 01:19:15.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Asuna] Elder...

01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:17.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
Manna, take care!

01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:21.047 position:5% line:77% align:start
The boat should get you across
the lake in two days and
one night.

01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:24.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
From there, you will be near
the place you seek.

01:19:24.118 --> 01:19:26.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] You have my thanks
for all that you've done.

01:19:26.521 --> 01:19:27.855 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna.

01:19:31.325 --> 01:19:32.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi, come here.

01:19:32.994 --> 01:19:34.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, we're going...

01:19:36.498 --> 01:19:37.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi?

01:19:37.999 --> 01:19:42.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
I believe the little one has
fulfilled its duty already.

01:19:42.304 --> 01:19:45.874 position:5% line:83% align:start
People cannot decide what the
Yadoriko do, you see.

01:19:45.974 --> 01:19:49.077 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... I thought we'd always
be together!

01:19:49.178 --> 01:19:50.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi!

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.382 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] Mimi!
[Morisaki] Asuna, you just have
to accept it.

01:19:53.483 --> 01:19:55.751 position:5% line:89% align:start
Elder, please...

01:19:57.487 --> 01:19:58.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi!

01:19:59.688 --> 01:20:01.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mr. Morisaki, wait! I still...

01:20:01.723 --> 01:20:03.059 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mimi!

01:20:08.431 --> 01:20:10.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Manna, take care of Mimi!

01:20:10.733 --> 01:20:13.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mimi, listen to what Manna
says, okay?

01:20:15.772 --> 01:20:17.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
Goodbye...

01:20:44.569 --> 01:20:45.937 position:5% line:89% align:start
Teacher...

01:20:46.037 --> 01:20:48.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you remember what you said
in class the other day,

01:20:48.106 --> 01:20:51.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
about the myth of Izanagi
and Izanami?

01:20:51.577 --> 01:20:53.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes...

01:20:53.245 --> 01:20:55.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Asuna] I was curious about
the end,

01:20:55.113 --> 01:20:57.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I read the rest in
the library.

01:20:57.949 --> 01:21:03.956 position:5% line:77% align:start
What Izanagi saw at the bottom
of the Earth was a frightful,
rotten visage of his wife.

01:21:05.524 --> 01:21:11.330 position:5% line:77% align:start
So, do you think it's right to
bring back someone from
the dead?

01:21:11.431 --> 01:21:13.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
Our journey is ending soon.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:19.039 position:5% line:77% align:start
You must decide what you're
looking for at the Gate of Life
and Death.

01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:25.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
A light? People?

01:21:25.345 --> 01:21:26.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
No.

01:21:27.848 --> 01:21:29.182 position:5% line:89% align:start
Izoku!

01:21:29.283 --> 01:21:32.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, they shouldn't be
able to reach us here.

01:21:47.902 --> 01:22:01.950 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Manna crying]

01:22:02.051 --> 01:22:07.256 position:5% line:77% align:start
The part it played in this
world is over, and it is time
for it to pass on to the next.

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:10.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
Cry for it all you can my
little one.

01:22:10.427 --> 01:22:12.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
For her sake, as well...

01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:28.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's that?

01:22:29.012 --> 01:22:31.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
It will be here very soon,
my son.

01:22:39.825 --> 01:22:42.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
Quetzal Coatl! And so ancient...

01:23:04.684 --> 01:23:10.323 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Grandfather] And in that way,
it becomes part of an even
larger part of the cycle
of life...

01:23:12.023 --> 01:23:14.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder if Asuna thinks of it
that way as well?

01:23:15.094 --> 01:23:17.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even though something precious
to her has died...

01:23:17.897 --> 01:23:21.869 position:5% line:77% align:start
Elder, perhaps it is because the
world of Agartha has learned
too much,

01:23:21.968 --> 01:23:24.237 position:5% line:83% align:start
about how short and meaningless
life is...

01:23:24.337 --> 01:23:28.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you think that could be why
it's falling into ruin?

01:23:28.141 --> 01:23:33.614 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your naivete is quite similar
to that of the Topsider man.

01:23:44.024 --> 01:23:46.895 position:5% line:89% align:start
They have longbarrels!

01:23:46.994 --> 01:23:50.598 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Grandfather] Are they going to
stop them, even if they have to
kill them?

01:23:50.698 --> 01:23:53.268 position:5% line:89% align:start
The same task which you bear.

01:23:56.704 --> 01:23:58.273 position:5% line:89% align:start
What will you do?

01:23:58.973 --> 01:24:00.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

01:24:01.376 --> 01:24:02.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I...!

01:24:02.678 --> 01:24:04.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will repay my debt!

01:24:11.687 --> 01:24:14.190 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone has left us now...

01:24:40.116 --> 01:24:41.418 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's over that ridge.

01:24:41.519 --> 01:24:43.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
We must hurry before the Izoku
come out.

01:24:46.891 --> 01:24:47.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna...

01:24:47.959 --> 01:24:50.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute, do you hear that?

01:25:03.341 --> 01:25:05.076 position:5% line:89% align:start
The soldiers from Amaurot!

01:25:07.713 --> 01:25:09.046 position:5% line:89% align:start
Run!

01:25:10.282 --> 01:25:12.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hide! I'll finish this quick.

01:25:15.587 --> 01:25:18.457 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Asuna] Mr. Morisaki!
[Morisaki] They're trying to
kill us now!

01:25:29.903 --> 01:25:30.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin?

01:25:30.837 --> 01:25:31.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mind your own business!

01:25:31.972 --> 01:25:33.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't kill anyone.

01:25:33.339 --> 01:25:35.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
You'll just increase
Agartha's hatred.

01:25:42.917 --> 01:25:46.887 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Guard Captain] The boy from
Canaan? Why do you cover for
the Topsiders?

01:25:46.987 --> 01:25:49.223 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those two saved a girl from
your village.

01:25:49.323 --> 01:25:51.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
You owe them a debt
of gratitude!

01:25:51.492 --> 01:25:52.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Guard Captain] If we leave the
Topsiders be,

01:25:53.093 --> 01:25:55.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
they will become the catalyst
for ruin.

01:25:55.396 --> 01:25:57.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
We cannot allow this root
of evil!

01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:59.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now move!

01:26:10.345 --> 01:26:12.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
My debt's paid now. Both
of you go!

01:26:18.086 --> 01:26:19.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shin!

01:26:38.174 --> 01:26:39.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're not bad.

01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:41.545 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, allow me.

01:26:57.695 --> 01:27:00.431 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the end of this world...
Finis Terra.

01:27:00.531 --> 01:27:03.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Gate of Life and Death
is at the bottom of this cliff.

01:27:09.507 --> 01:27:12.845 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hurry... Don't let his actions
go to waste.

01:27:28.028 --> 01:27:29.294 position:5% line:89% align:start
Lose as much weight as you can.

01:27:29.395 --> 01:27:31.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're climbing down to
the bottom.

01:27:38.303 --> 01:27:39.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way...

01:27:39.506 --> 01:27:41.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't! Isn't there some
other way...

01:27:41.174 --> 01:27:42.409 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] There's no time
for that.

01:27:42.509 --> 01:27:45.012 position:5% line:83% align:start
When the sun sets, the Izoku
will come out.

01:27:45.112 --> 01:27:46.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

01:27:50.117 --> 01:27:51.451 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, for me!

01:28:13.875 --> 01:28:14.943 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna!

01:28:32.128 --> 01:28:33.563 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna.

01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:40.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
Listen to me, Asuna.

01:28:40.937 --> 01:28:44.741 position:5% line:77% align:start
Think about how far you've come,
through a sea, deep into
another world.

01:28:44.841 --> 01:28:47.577 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know you can get past
this cliff.

01:28:47.677 --> 01:28:50.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
Remember why you came
to Agartha!

01:28:50.246 --> 01:28:52.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't, don't you see
this place...

01:28:53.784 --> 01:28:56.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
I... can't...

01:29:14.973 --> 01:29:18.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
Enough of this foolishness. You
have lost your place in Agartha.

01:29:22.547 --> 01:29:25.717 position:5% line:89% align:start
I never had one to begin with!

01:29:28.587 --> 01:29:31.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Morisaki] I understand. It's
okay, Asuna, I'll alone.

01:29:31.824 --> 01:29:36.295 position:5% line:77% align:start
I want you to give me the
Clavis. In exchange, you
take this.

01:29:39.732 --> 01:29:42.434 position:5% line:77% align:start
Go back upstream along the
river, and aim for the
Elder's place.

01:29:42.535 --> 01:29:44.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know that he'll take you in.

01:29:44.137 --> 01:29:47.874 position:5% line:83% align:start
When night falls, enter the
water to escape from the Izoku.

01:29:47.974 --> 01:29:50.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
I believe in you, Asuna. You can
get through this

01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:55.749 position:5% line:77% align:start
It may be a little selfish, but
one of use has to make it back
alive, don't we?

01:30:23.578 --> 01:30:26.114 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Clavis has disappeared
into Finis Terra.

01:30:26.215 --> 01:30:28.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
We can pursue it no further.

01:30:28.317 --> 01:30:33.155 position:5% line:77% align:start
But there is no way for the
Topsiders to survive descending
that cliff.

01:30:33.256 --> 01:30:35.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
Boy, neither Agartha nor
the surface...

01:30:35.624 --> 01:30:39.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
No place can provide you rest
or peace any longer.

01:30:39.929 --> 01:30:43.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have chosen to wander
aimlessly for all eternity.

01:30:43.233 --> 01:30:45.802 position:5% line:89% align:start
Think on that, and repent!

01:30:52.442 --> 01:30:56.913 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Shin] I'm sorry for forcing
you to gallop so far...
Can you stand?

01:31:00.251 --> 01:31:02.452 position:5% line:83% align:start
Where do you think I should
go now?

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.782 position:5% line:89% align:start
A-Asuna...

01:32:56.072 --> 01:32:57.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ruins?

01:33:45.425 --> 01:33:47.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
The defiled...

01:33:47.493 --> 01:33:49.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kill... Devour...

01:33:49.429 --> 01:33:52.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
Defiled... Devour...

01:34:05.446 --> 01:34:07.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Shun] Asuna...

01:34:07.247 --> 01:34:09.049 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll give you a blessing.

01:34:13.487 --> 01:34:16.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mom, what's a blessing?

01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:18.225 position:5% line:89% align:start
A blessing?

01:34:18.325 --> 01:34:20.294 position:5% line:89% align:start
"I'll give you a blessing."

01:34:20.394 --> 01:34:21.929 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did someone say that to you?

01:34:22.029 --> 01:34:23.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

01:34:23.465 --> 01:34:26.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's like how happy I was that
you were born, Asuna.

01:34:26.934 --> 01:34:29.070 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think that's a blessing.

01:34:31.139 --> 01:34:32.307 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Asuna!

01:34:32.407 --> 01:34:33.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
Want to walk home together?

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:34.943 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna!

01:34:35.043 --> 01:34:38.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] I'm sorry about you
getting involved, Asuna.

01:34:40.348 --> 01:34:41.616 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why did you save me?

01:34:41.716 --> 01:34:44.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just how solitary human
existence is...

01:34:44.652 --> 01:34:45.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will repay my debt!

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.189 position:5% line:89% align:start
Asuna!

01:34:47.289 --> 01:34:49.824 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tell me why?

01:34:49.925 --> 01:34:52.928 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shin] Why have you come
to Agartha?

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:02.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
I came...

01:35:02.705 --> 01:35:04.174 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because I was...
