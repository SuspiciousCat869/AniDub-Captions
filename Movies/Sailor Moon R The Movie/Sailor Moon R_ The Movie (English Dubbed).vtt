00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:31.112 position:30% line:89% align:start

 <i>Hey... </i>

00:07:11.293 --> 00:07:13.728 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's been a while, Mamoru.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.202 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's me.

00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:20.169 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:07:20.203 --> 00:07:22.038 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? No...

00:07:22.072 --> 00:07:24.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry I made you wait.

00:07:24.473 --> 00:07:27.312 position:5% line:77% align:start
I feel really bad that it

You what...?

00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:37.957 position:5% line:77% align:start
Come on! You didn't forget
the promise that we made,
did you?

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.124 position:27% line:89% align:start
The promise...?

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:42.729 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's right. The flower
that we promised to each
other.

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:53.876 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry! You can't have him!

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:58.447 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's just that Mamo is my
boyfriend.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.349 position:35% line:89% align:start
Move it.

00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:01.483 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? [gasping]

Hey, you! Where do you think
you're going?!

00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:17.469 position:19% line:77% align:start
You get back here and
apologize to her, you
jerk!

00:08:17.502 --> 00:08:21.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mamoru, I will fulfill our
promise to each other.

00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:28.515 position:33% line:89% align:start

He's gone...

00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:47.804 position:16% line:89% align:start
Fiore...? It can't be!

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mamo, what...?

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:56.548 position:19% line:77% align:start
 <i>And now onto our next</i>
 <i>story... Today at 2 p.m., it</i>
 <i>was discovered that a giant</i>

00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:59.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>asteroid is about to pass by</i>
 <i>close to Earth. </i>

00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:03.256 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>Researchers calculate that</i>
 <i>the massive rock will be</i>
 <i>making its closest approach</i>

00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:05.658 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>tomorrow night at 11:20 p.m.</i>

00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:09.163 position:13% line:77% align:start
However, it will still be
twenty-five hundred and
fifty million kilometers

00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:12.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
away, so it will have no
direct effect on the Earth.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.438 position:10% line:77% align:start
If you have an astronomical
telescope, you can observe
the-

00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:19.642 position:13% line:77% align:start
Seems the observatories on
Earth have finally noticed
it, too.

00:09:19.675 --> 00:09:23.080 position:13% line:77% align:start
The asteroid you mentioned
before? It's not going to
hit Earth,

00:09:23.113 --> 00:09:24.081 position:19% line:89% align:start
so what's your worry?

00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:26.183 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's what we thought at
first as well...

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:27.884 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is there some other
problem?

00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:31.022 position:10% line:83% align:start
Everyone, come here and take
a look at this.

00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:39.331 position:19% line:77% align:start
I used the computer to
perform my own analysis of
that asteroid.

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:42.102 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>It spans over six hundred</i>
 <i>meters. </i>

00:09:42.135 --> 00:09:47.007 position:16% line:77% align:start
That's really big. If it
were to collide with Earth,
it would be a disaster.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.343 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, that's not the issue.

00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:53.482 position:16% line:77% align:start
Considering its size, it
has surprisingly little
mass. Meaning, if it

00:09:53.514 --> 00:09:56.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>fell to Earth, it'd just</i>
 <i>burn up in the atmosphere. </i>

00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:58.086 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then what exactly's the
problem?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.590 position:10% line:77% align:start
We picked up signs of plant
energy coming from the
asteroid.

00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:03.526 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:07.431 position:16% line:77% align:start
 <i>You know... now that you</i>
 <i>mention it... that asteroid</i>
 <i>does kind of look more like</i>

00:10:07.464 --> 00:10:09.700 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>a seed than a rock</i>
 <i>formation. </i>

00:10:09.733 --> 00:10:12.470 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure there's a simple
explanation for all this.

00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:15.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe there's just moss growing
on its surface.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.011 position:16% line:77% align:start
Artemis, I think you're
making a big fuss over
nothing.

00:10:19.045 --> 00:10:20.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's hope so...

00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:22.081 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>Am I overreacting? </i>

00:10:22.114 --> 00:10:23.417 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.685 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:30.224 position:10% line:77% align:start
But he really did look like
more than just a...
"friend."

00:10:30.258 --> 00:10:31.092 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:33.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no way that Mamo
would ever...!

00:10:33.327 --> 00:10:37.598 position:21% line:77% align:start
Mamoru did look very
serious when that guy
showed up.

00:10:37.632 --> 00:10:41.204 position:13% line:83% align:start
And then he suddenly said
that he needed to leave.

00:10:41.237 --> 00:10:46.109 position:13% line:77% align:start
Maybe Mamoru actually does
know that guy we saw at the
botanical garden, after all.

00:10:46.142 --> 00:10:48.578 position:5% line:83% align:start
Usagi, he didn't tell you
anything?

00:10:48.611 --> 00:10:51.315 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? No...

00:10:51.348 --> 00:10:55.020 position:27% line:77% align:start
Come to think of
it, I really don't
know much about Mamo...

00:10:55.053 --> 00:10:56.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
... from the time before
I met him.

00:10:56.755 --> 00:11:00.193 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess Mamoru is popular
with the guys, as well.

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:02.728 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ami, what are you
implying?!

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:07.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's actually
an interesting thought, Ami.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.336 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, this meeting's as good
as over...

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:10.405 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll say...

00:11:10.438 --> 00:11:11.738 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sighing]

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:14.275 position:19% line:77% align:start
No! Of Course not?! I
mean, it's fine, if that's
who you are.

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:16.445 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah. I
totally agree.

 <i>Really?! </i>

00:11:27.558 --> 00:11:30.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
So... are these your
parents, Mamo?

00:11:30.794 --> 00:11:31.695 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:35.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
You grew up alone, without
any family at all?

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:38.570 position:5% line:89% align:start
Were you lonely?

00:11:38.605 --> 00:11:41.707 position:30% line:77% align:start
Doesn't matter
anymore. You're my family
now.

00:11:42.408 --> 00:11:45.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looking back, I think I
needed to be alone...

00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:47.780 position:30% line:83% align:start
... so I could
meet you.

00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:49.049 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:11:53.355 --> 00:11:56.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're right... I am your
family.

00:11:56.825 --> 00:12:01.164 position:5% line:77% align:start
And from now on... I'll
always be here to protect
you.

00:12:02.598 --> 00:12:06.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess you're an expert when it
comes to love, Ami!

00:12:06.103 --> 00:12:08.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
Me? No, I--

00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:11.074 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ami, you're so cute.
Speaking of love,

00:12:11.108 --> 00:12:13.677 position:16% line:77% align:start
did I ever tell you guys
about the guy who broke
my heart?

00:12:56.428 --> 00:13:00.600 position:13% line:77% align:start
Balancing being a student
and a Guardian of justice is
exhausting!

00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:04.770 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, give me a break! Our
meeting went nowhere because
you girls kept chitchatting

00:13:04.804 --> 00:13:05.706 position:5% line:89% align:start

Mako, thanks for making me
my lunch!

00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.680 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sure! You're very welcome.

00:13:15.216 --> 00:13:16.585 position:38% line:89% align:start

Huh?

00:13:23.792 --> 00:13:27.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just sensed an evil aura
nearby...

What?!

All right... Everyone stay

Mm!

00:14:04.907 --> 00:14:08.245 position:5% line:83% align:start

it happening...?

00:51:39.635 --> 00:51:41.071 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a flower...

00:51:41.405 --> 00:51:44.508 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fiore! Don't let her fool
you! If she does-

[crying]

00:51:46.945 --> 00:51:51.383 position:41% line:83% align:start
Fiore!
[screaming]

00:53:00.263 --> 00:53:05.602 position:38% line:89% align:start
Usagi!

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:07.004 position:35% line:89% align:start
Usako...

00:53:10.008 --> 00:53:13.578 position:13% line:83% align:start
I will protect all of you,
no matter what!

[staining]

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please, Legendary Silver
Crystal...

00:53:29.097 --> 00:53:31.633 position:13% line:83% align:start
...bestow more power upon
me...

00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:33.469 position:10% line:89% align:start
Power to protect everyone...

00:53:33.502 --> 00:53:35.637 position:19% line:83% align:start
... so that nobody is
left alone!

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Come on! We have
to go help her!

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:49.253 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can do this if we all
work together!

00:53:49.287 --> 00:53:52.091 position:10% line:89% align:start
Right! We will not die here!

00:53:52.124 --> 00:53:54.159 position:10% line:89% align:start
We'll all return to Earth!

[grunting]

00:54:22.526 --> 00:54:24.128 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh--

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:31.136 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey! If you're going to
play, you have to actually
play, you know!

00:54:31.169 --> 00:54:33.272 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay! Let's have some fun!

00:54:35.774 --> 00:54:37.076 position:35% line:89% align:start
Usagi...

00:54:39.778 --> 00:54:41.014 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sighing]

00:54:41.047 --> 00:54:44.452 position:5% line:77% align:start
I never realized... But
you're actually a super
hard worker.

00:54:44.485 --> 00:54:48.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
Seriously! You only noticed
that now?!

00:54:49.824 --> 00:54:51.092 position:35% line:89% align:start
Usagi...

00:54:54.663 --> 00:54:57.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
That rice ball looks
so good, I can almost--!

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on... Aren't
you afraid of me?

00:54:59.701 --> 00:55:01.237 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, why?

Usagi...

00:55:08.346 --> 00:55:09.514 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't believe it!

00:55:09.548 --> 00:55:13.486 position:5% line:77% align:start
My hero Sailor V is standing
right here in front of
me...!

00:55:13.519 --> 00:55:14.686 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tadah! That's me!

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.423 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:19.692 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Usagi...

00:55:42.252 --> 00:55:47.425 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>That's right... My friends</i>

 <i>me the strength...</i>

00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:49.227 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>... and the courage</i>
 <i>I need.</i>

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.464 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>The Silver Crystal and I can</i>
 <i>grow stronger! </i>

00:55:53.165 --> 00:55:55.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
No one will be alone again!

00:55:55.668 --> 00:55:58.137 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mercury Star Power!

00:55:58.471 --> 00:56:01.274 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mars Star Power!

[straining]

00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:39.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder how they're all
faring up there...

00:56:40.387 --> 00:56:42.922 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just hope they're able to
come back safely...

00:56:42.956 --> 00:56:44.392 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:56:44.425 --> 00:56:48.596 position:10% line:77% align:start
Sailor Moon is like a mother
to us all. I know she'll
protect everyone.

00:56:48.629 --> 00:56:51.433 position:5% line:89% align:start
Chibi-Usa...

00:57:02.446 --> 00:57:08.819 position:10% line:77% align:start
Usagi! Usagi, wake up! Come
on, Usagi! You have to wake
up!

00:57:09.387 --> 00:57:11.890 position:33% line:89% align:start
You liar...

00:57:12.991 --> 00:57:14.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
You said you wouldn't die...

00:57:16.861 --> 00:57:20.966 position:13% line:77% align:start
What's the point of being
saved, if you... aren't with
us?!

00:57:21.668 --> 00:57:25.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on...! Please just open
your eyes, Usagi!

00:57:25.472 --> 00:57:27.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
In the end, we won...

00:57:27.575 --> 00:57:30.578 position:5% line:83% align:start
...but we lost what was most
important to us...

00:57:35.017 --> 00:57:36.485 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Mamoru... </i>

00:57:36.518 --> 00:57:37.587 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:40.790 position:35% line:89% align:start
Fiore...

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:45.028 position:5% line:77% align:start
Thank you. Seems... you and
Sailor Moon have saved me
once again.

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:49.333 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now... I will fulfill the
promise I made to you,
Mamoru...

00:57:50.502 --> 00:57:53.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
 This is the flower of life
that contains my own energy.

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
Give its nectar to Sailor
Moon.

00:58:28.546 --> 00:58:29.714 position:38% line:89% align:start
Guys...

00:58:30.748 --> 00:58:32.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
You see?

00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:36.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
I said... I'd protect all of
you no matter what.

00:58:40.527 --> 00:58:45.733 position:38% line:89% align:start

Usagi!
