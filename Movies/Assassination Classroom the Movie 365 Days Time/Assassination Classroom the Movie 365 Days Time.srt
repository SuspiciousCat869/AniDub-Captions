1
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:24,949
Hello?

2
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:28,040
Nagisa?

3
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:29,283
Whoa. Been a while.

4
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:31,853
Ha! Hey, Karma!

5
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,945
Hold up. How did you...? How did you even get in here?

6
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,810
I thought Isogai had the only key.

7
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:40,018
I could ask you the same thing, couldn't I?

8
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:41,655
Guess we're both guilty.

9
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:43,339
You haven't changed a bit.

10
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:46,021
What're you doing here all by yourself?

11
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,181
Nothing much.

12
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,284
Everybody else is showing up tomorrow.

13
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:54,350
Thought I should set something
up to give 'em all a little scare.

14
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:57,523
Seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up. Heh.

15
00:02:58,607 --> 00:02:59,550
Why not?

16
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:02,106
So you won't be here either?

17
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,385
Whaddya gonna do?

18
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:07,354
Those government agency visits
determine where you'll end up, right?

19
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,442
Aren't your nerves shot?

20
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,266
What, you don't think my acting skills are up to
snuff? Give me some credit. I know how to play the part.

21
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:22,434
They're looking for an ideal candidate
and that's exactly what they're gonna get.

22
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,933
Just a stepping-stone toward the work I really wanna do.

23
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:31,311
I'm not gonna let myself trip over it. Trust me.

24
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,379
I admire your resolve, Karma.

25
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,689
You really are a piece of work.

26
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:49,411
Hey.

27
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:50,078
Uh?

28
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,638
Whaddya say we go exploring?

29
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:40,638
This place hasn't changed much either.

30
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:43,516
You're surprised? We're the ones who bought it.

31
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:47,287
Yeah, but it was totally your idea. Mountain and all.

32
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,535
I didn't want some random nobody screwing things up.

33
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:55,736
Well, I mean,

34
00:04:55,888 --> 00:05:00,596
that, and we could turn a healthy profit by rebranding
this dump as a tourist attraction and reselling.

35
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,428
Koro-sensei, I'm back.

36
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:18,622
Is that...?

37
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,912
Yeah. Looks like he kept his own copy.

38
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:33,679
Really takes you back.

39
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,227
Class 3-E. The End Class.

40
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,997
Known by us misfits as the Assassination Classroom.

41
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,615
Right! Ready!

42
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:53,636
Aim!

43
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,674
Fire!

44
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:19,263
Looking back, that's the day it all started.

45
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,497
Huh? You mean when he took credit for the...?

46
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:24,277
Yeah.

47
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,591
So I'm the one who blew up the moon.

48
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:30,160
Huh?

49
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,536
Next year, I intend to do the same to Planet Earth.

50
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,938
But never mind that now.

51
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:37,875
I'm gonna be your new teacher. Isn't that exciting?

52
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,832
There are so many things wrong with this picture.

53
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,655
It was a strong first impression.

54
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:46,897
Uh, I'm Karasuma, I'm from the Ministry of Defense.

55
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:51,144
What, uh... What I'm about to tell
you we in the business call "classified."

56
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,816
Aw, hell. I'll just come right out with it.

57
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:59,602
I'm gonna need you to kill this
thing for the sake of mankind.

58
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,326
We were all like, "Seriously?

59
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,489
What's this thing doing in our class?"

60
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,260
Threw us for a loop.

61
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,224
What were the chances, right?

62
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,718
Suddenly we were government-sanctioned assassins.

63
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:12,705
I'd call that a promotion.

64
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,303
We only had a year.

65
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,301
The target was our teacher.

66
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:25,665
What do you say we hit the books and make
the final year of your lives a productive one?

67
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:28,222
Yeah.

68
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,983
And not only could he move at the speed of sound,
a straight-up nuclear blast wouldn't tickle him.

69
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:34,310
Crazy.

70
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,111
He had his weak points, though.

71
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:38,682
'Course, they turned out to be part of his charm.

72
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:42,838
Even with this handicap, I'm too fast for you!

73
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,195
Only in your dreams do you have
any hope of getting the deed done!

74
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:46,968
Oh.

75
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:51,946
Kill him! Ah!

76
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,915
Ah! Wait, wait, wait!

77
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,815
This wasn't part of the deal! Easy!

78
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:58,765
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

79
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,707
Well, your notes are bound to come in handy at some point.

80
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:04,426
Right! That's why I'm jotting everything down.

81
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,933
I'd even go so far as to say we had our pick.

82
00:09:02,261 --> 00:09:04,708
Kind of strange he wound up having so many, though.

83
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,206
'S just how the Octopus was.

84
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,338
Yeah. He really put himself
on the line to try to teach us.

85
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:14,480
It seemed to be what he lived for.

86
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,253
That promise, right? Heh.

87
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,697
Teaching was his passion.

88
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,589
Nothing was more important to him.

89
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,186
There's no denying that, huh?

90
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:23,594
Still, you gotta admit,

91
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,028
his methods were a little unorthodox.

92
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:30,488
Nagisa. 'Sup?

93
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:33,900
It's been a while.

94
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:38,501
Karma. You're back?

95
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:47,097
I come back from suspension and find
out I've got a cephalopod for a teacher.

96
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:48,323
Kinda awkward.

97
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,884
Like you didn't take the assassination thing in stride.

98
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:54,147
Oh, come on.

99
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:57,182
No way you can be this big of a pushover.

100
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,023
Don't get me wrong: I loved our assignment.

101
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:03,123
Killing our teacher? Come on.

102
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:05,880
You definitely threw yourself into it.

103
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,367
More than we did, anyway.

104
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:08,915
I don't know about that.

105
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:12,474
I can't be the only kid who's ever
wanted to throw their teacher under the bus.

106
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:13,737
Literally, I mean.

107
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,023
They play favorites, abuse authority,

108
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,343
always covering their asses.

109
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,665
Not all of 'em, no, but a lot.

110
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,579
See, at that point, I'd had my
fair share of crappy teachers.

111
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,951
If at first I thought the Octopus was in that league,

112
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,384
who could really blame me?

113
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,196
I feel I've taken exceptionally good care of you today.

114
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:37,522
Hmph.

115
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,751
Just so we're on the same page here,

116
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,340
you pretty much consider
yourself a teacher above all else?

117
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:45,703
That's right.

118
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,733
Cool.

119
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,630
And you wouldn't think twice about putting
your life on the line to save a student.

120
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:54,370
What sort of teacher would I be if I did?

121
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:57,166
That's awesome. Good to know.

122
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,727
So... I can kill you.

123
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,341
Knew there had to be a way.

124
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,874
What's it gonna be, Teach?

125
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:11,130
You gonna swoop down to save me
and get blasted in the process?

126
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,750
Or you gonna be the sort of
teacher who lets one of your kids die?

127
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:18,997
But you're absolutely in the right. Not a question.

128
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,629
And I stand by you.

129
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,864
I'm not the bad guy here.

130
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:27,379
All I did was put a bully in his
place. Little jerk had it comin'.

131
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,083
Are you out of your mind or just stupid?

132
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:35,339
What possessed you to think attacking your class's
star pupil like a mad dog was something I'd let slide?

133
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:37,378
This young man happens to have a future!

134
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,166
If this interferes with his exams, it's on my head!

135
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:42,926
He said he'd stand by me.

136
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:46,039
So much for that, I guess.

137
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,668
Damn... I'm totally gonna die.

138
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,140
I've been willing to turn a
blind eye on account of your grades,

139
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:55,537
but you've tried my patience once too often.

140
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,241
This is it. This is how it's gonna go down.

141
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,359
Son of a bitch screwed me over.

142
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:07,571
So that's it. He's dead to me now.

143
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,027
What are you waiting for, Koro-sensei?

144
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,133
Let's do this!

145
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:15,547
You either die for real, or I kill your reputation.

146
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,896
Well done!

147
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:25,290
A splendidly premeditated assassination attempt.

148
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:26,351
Full marks.

149
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,293
Neat, huh?

150
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:30,832
I knew your body couldn't take being
plucked out of freefall at the speed of sound,

151
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,373
and had I moved any slower, you would've shot me.

152
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:37,063
What a tangled, and sticky, web we weave, eh?

153
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,076
What the hell?

154
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:40,199
Is there anything these tentacles aren't capable of?

155
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:41,644
Can't shoot me now, can you?

156
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,332
Oh, and for future reference,

157
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,944
students do not die on my watch.

158
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:50,117
Ever.

159
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:53,456
Take that to heart for the next time you jump.

160
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:03,379
I got nothin'. Un-friggin'-believable.

161
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,787
He won't die. The teacher in him especially.

162
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,385
It took some weapons-grade strategizing
on his part to bring me around.

163
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:17,175
And to think he pulled it off at Mach 20. Heh.

164
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:21,009
He was the most involved teacher we'd ever had.

165
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:24,195
Always looking out for us, even though we wanted him dead.

166
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,461
Okie-dokie. Last but not least.

167
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:31,924
So have you decided on a prospective career, Nagisa m'boy?

168
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:36,083
Sir, I... I think...

169
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:40,219
Well, uh... I think I have a talent for killing people.

170
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:44,165
We all know I don't have any other strengths.

171
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,903
So, I mean, what else can I reasonably shoot for, right?

172
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,102
Koro-sensei, should I...?

173
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:56,017
Should I become an assassin?

174
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:02,055
Please, sir. What path should
I follow? 'Cause I don't know.

175
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:06,707
It's a pleasure to meet you.

176
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:09,411
I'm Nagisa's mother, Ms. Hiromi Shiota.

177
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,807
Yes, yes. Please, have a seat. Good to see you.

178
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:16,790
Trekking up the mountain is
quite a journey; you must be tired.

179
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,204
Might I offer you a refreshing beverage?

180
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,223
If I may say so, madam, you're quite stunning.

181
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:25,577
I see where Nagisa gets his looks.

182
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:27,273
Why, thank you!

183
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,624
You know, if only this one had been born a girl,

184
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,582
I'd have groomed her to be my ideal!

185
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:32,949
Not quite sure I follow you.

186
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:38,578
Well, you see, I wasn't allowed to wear my hair long,
and a girl is ever so much prettier with flowing locks.

187
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,448
Oh, Nagisa. What I wouldn't give to
have had such lovely, full-bodied hair.

188
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:47,076
I was so mad when he started tying it back
for school this year, but it looked so good,

189
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,910
I just had to let it slide, as
long as he wouldn't cut it off.

190
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,367
Ah, but we're here to discuss his future. We
can't afford to discourage them at this age.

191
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:58,423
Children are such impressionable
creatures, wouldn't you agree?

192
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:04,540
So I've come here, with all due respect, to
talk about what we can do to get him out of E Class.

193
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,018
And I trust you spoke with Nagisa on the matter?

194
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:10,023
Oh, he's too young to understand
what's at stake, believe me.

195
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:14,624
And at any rate, it's my job as a parent to
steer him clear of the mistakes I made at his age.

196
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:15,360
Mom.

197
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:16,715
I don't...

198
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,832
Hush up now, sweetheart.

199
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:19,523
The adults are talking.

200
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,482
Yes, well...

201
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:29,469
I believe I'm starting to get a clearer picture
of how Nagisa became the person he is today.

202
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:31,690
Uh!

203
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:32,774
Yes.

204
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:35,106
High schools, colleges, and hairstyles,

205
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,231
ma'am, forgive me for saying so,

206
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:39,946
are decidedly not a parent's prerogative!

207
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,274
I'm sorry. Nagisa must be permitted to live his own life.

208
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:47,564
You'll get nowhere foisting your complexes onto him.

209
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,021
Ms. Shiota, let me be perfectly clear.

210
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:52,790
Unless Nagisa so desires,

211
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:55,193
he will not be allowed to leave E Class.

212
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,752
What the hell is your problem?!

213
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,498
Since when does a teacher talk like that to a parent?!

214
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:05,175
How dare you! "Foisting my complexes onto him"?

215
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:07,753
Of course! That explains your attitude at home lately!

216
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,690
This bald idiot's been giving you ideas!

217
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:10,828
Well, watch this!

218
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,621
When I'm done with you, your eyes will be wide open!

219
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:17,940
Koro-sensei.

220
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:18,668
Hmm.

221
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:21,190
That was a bit more tactless than I'd planned.

222
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:25,800
Still, though... there's a lesson to be learned here.

223
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,025
You need to communicate your intentions
more clearly from now on, speak your mind.

224
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:40,128
All obstacles must be removed.

225
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:43,161
It's time I gave you a new outlook on life.

226
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,441
Nagisa.

227
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:55,241
Mom?

228
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:58,046
This is where it all started going downhill.

229
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:59,998
When you started disobeying me.

230
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,231
This place turned you into a monster.

231
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,259
Burn it to the ground with your own hands.

232
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,148
Get your life back on track.

233
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,066
I don't want to!

234
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,096
I brought you into this world, Nagisa!

235
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,436
I scraped to send you to cram school, then private school!

236
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,574
You have no idea what it cost me!

237
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,062
I do everything for you!

238
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:21,609
Every night dinner's on the table,
no matter how exhausted I am from work!

239
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,516
Does E Class do that for you?

240
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:26,135
I made you who you are!

241
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:29,630
You owe me! You will do what I tell you!

242
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:35,196
You need to communicate your intentions
more clearly from now on, speak your mind.

243
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:38,420
Back then, my life was a game.

244
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,513
I was trapped in round two of the Mom RPG.

245
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,923
Yeah, not a real good place to be stuck.

246
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:47,588
Still, our class made me realize I had special talents.

247
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:51,349
A gift. Assassination was kind of like my calling.

248
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:53,655
What was I supposed to do?

249
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:57,501
Where's a junior high nobody supposed
to go with a skillset like that?

250
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:02,315
Mom and I were in a stalemate.

251
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,099
Too caught up in our drama to move forward.

252
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,703
But that night...

253
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,416
Mom.

254
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,910
Believe it or not,

255
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:14,536
I'm giving this class everything I've got.

256
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:17,663
Before I graduate, I'll get results.

257
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:21,838
And when I do, I'm cutting my hair,

258
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:25,304
and paying back every scrap you've spent on me.

259
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,807
If you can't find it in your heart to forgive me...

260
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,140
...then I'll graduate again.

261
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:33,206
From you.

262
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:47,149
Mom. I'm grateful that you had me.

263
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,435
Grateful that you raised me.

264
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,262
It may be asking a lot,

265
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,455
but if you can just be happy that you have a child

266
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,111
that, all things considered, turned out relatively okay,

267
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:01,826
that's all I need to be happy.

268
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:07,163
Who are you, Nagisa? What in the world have you done?

269
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:11,290
Certain unsavory types have made
this their after-hours hangout.

270
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:14,381
I recommend you give the area a wide birth at night.

271
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:15,713
Now, then, ma'am,

272
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,259
Nagisa has quite a bit of growing left to do, I agree.

273
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,383
What he needs more than anything is a loving mother.

274
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:25,711
Don't take his stubbornness so personally.

275
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,750
Every little birdie needs to leave the nest at some point.

276
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,285
That's the way of things.

277
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,106
Weird as it sounds,

278
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:37,402
Koro-sensei made it possible for us
to talk things over like mother and son.

279
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,444
No kidding?

280
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:39,860
That's when I decided

281
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:43,539
whatever path I chose, she wouldn't have to worry.

282
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,889
So, uh,

283
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:48,551
about all the unpleasantness the other evening.

284
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:52,538
Looking back on it now, I always knew.

285
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:54,655
My boy's grown up.

286
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,812
He's ready to cut the apron strings.

287
00:19:57,815 --> 00:19:59,936
That business about graduating from me,

288
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:01,200
you meant every word.

289
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:05,939
I don't know where you found the strength to
say it, but somewhere along the way, you got tough.

290
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,925
Just, please, for right now,

291
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,720
stay with me a little longer, till you're of age.

292
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,661
That's all I'm asking.

293
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,758
The world'll be yours soon enough.

294
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,476
I'm not ready to let go of my baby just yet, Nagisa.

295
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,478
Whatever else I may be, I'm still your mother.

296
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:34,078
It was a crazy year, looking back.

297
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:36,937
I felt like a knot slowly coming undone.

298
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:39,599
Something inside was breaking free.

299
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:42,317
I'd never trusted authority figures.

300
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:45,337
With the Octopus always in our business, though,

301
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,874
well, I guess I loosened up a little.

302
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:49,167
Yeah.

303
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,484
Koro-sensei had his flaws, but somehow
they came off like part of the plan.

304
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:55,618
Remember how awkward he could be?

305
00:20:56,418 --> 00:21:00,390
Still, even at his weirdest, you knew he genuinely cared.

306
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:02,983
True enough, I suppose.

307
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,665
But there were some things he never saw coming.

308
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,679
Like Kayano.

309
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,887
Blew me away.

310
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,030
Who'd have thought she had tentacles?

311
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:28,270
Talk about flying under the radar.

312
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,581
Let no one say she wasn't a first-rate actress.

313
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:34,947
I can't imagine how she kept it together for so long.

314
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,223
The pain must've been unbearable.

315
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,218
You'd have never been able to tell, though.

316
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:41,682
None of us had a clue.

317
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:45,181
She was obsessed. Hell bent.

318
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:48,067
Nothing would stand in the way of her revenge.

319
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,453
Right, for her sister's death.

320
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:52,504
Poor Miss Yukimura.

321
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:56,000
It wasn't Koro-sensei's fault.

322
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:59,493
Maybe not, but she died protecting him.

323
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,770
That's why he promised to teach us.

324
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:04,789
He was an experiment.

325
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:08,310
A highly developed life form created by a madman.

326
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:12,531
He said in a year he'd do to the
Earth what he'd done to the moon.

327
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,610
But in reality, it was just a
countdown to his own annihilation.

328
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,900
He was a killing machine living on borrowed time.

329
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:23,617
Wasn't he supposed to be quite
the looker in his former life?

330
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,867
Supposedly.

331
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,342
Not that he ever backed it up with pictures or anything.

332
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:31,364
Miss Yukimura was smitten
enough to give him that awful tie.

333
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,170
But if that's her taste.

334
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:34,925
Yeah, maybe so.

335
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:38,332
Makes me sad, thinking about her.

336
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:41,523
Reminds me that we never really had to kill Koro-sensei.

337
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,737
Man, I was royally pissed when you tried
to walk back the assassination agreement.

338
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:47,710
That was a rough one.

339
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:49,869
Far as I was concerned,

340
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:52,489
you were undoing the whole point of the class.

341
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:59,287
I'm not even sure it's possible.

342
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:03,174
But instead of killing Koro-sensei,

343
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:05,014
I think we should try to save him.

344
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:08,111
Save him?

345
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:12,976
By like, finding a way to keep him
from self-detonating come March, or what?

346
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:14,801
Where do we start?

347
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,993
Well, I don't know. Yet. But...

348
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,440
Totally! I'm game!

349
00:23:21,523 --> 00:23:25,161
Koro-sensei's way too good of a
bug-hunting buddy to let explode!

350
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:26,899
Kurahashi.

351
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:28,424
Thank you for bringing it up.

352
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,284
If you hadn't said something, I would've.

353
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:32,619
Saving him's the least we can do.

354
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,247
So you're on board?

355
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,124
But I'm against it.

356
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:40,736
We get wantin' to save him and all,

357
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,582
but how do we know it's even doable?

358
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:43,796
Well, I...

359
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:45,829
Wow. Listen to you.

360
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:48,619
Getting a tad full of yourself there, chief.

361
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:52,319
Granted, you're the most gifted one in our class.

362
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:53,657
But seriously,

363
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:57,012
we should just up and scrap the whole assassination plan?

364
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:59,112
What about the underdogs?

365
00:23:59,174 --> 00:24:03,387
Those of us who work ourselves sick just
to squeak by on what little talent we have,

366
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:04,856
how're we supposed to feel?

367
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:09,044
You're like a hot chick tellin' her homely
friends there's no point trying to find a man.

368
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:12,767
Of course you don't have a problem with
changing the rules, you've already won the game.

369
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:15,302
That-That's not what I'm trying to say.

370
00:24:15,974 --> 00:24:20,607
Besides, I'm not the gifted one. Between
you an' me, you're the better assassin.

371
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:24,123
Okay, hearing you talk like
that just pisses me off even more.

372
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:26,114
You know what your problem is, Nagisa?

373
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:29,804
You've got no respect for how hard
this is for everyone who isn't you.

374
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,182
Whoa, whoa! Where is this coming from?

375
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:34,007
I'm just telling you how I feel!

376
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,112
Do you have an axe to grind with Koro-sensei or something?

377
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:40,624
He took us to the movies! He's made learning fun!

378
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:41,820
That's my point!

379
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:43,512
Why do you think he bothered? Huh?

380
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:46,638
He didn't want us to end up like a
bunch of whiney, half-assed jerks!

381
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:47,947
And look at you!

382
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:52,457
Assassinating him is what this entire class is
based on. You're just trying to find a loophole!

383
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,732
You wanna undermine what Koro-sensei's done?

384
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:58,279
Or do you have the mind and the body of a ten-year-old?

385
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:00,621
Hm?

386
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,695
Huh. What's with that look?

387
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:09,680
Aw, the itty-bitty mouse wanna roar?

388
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,620
Feel like he could take on a lion?

389
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:13,431
No, I...

390
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:15,857
Got somethin' to say?

391
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:18,607
Kick my ass for once and you can say whatever you like.

392
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,734
Oh, don't be shy. What're you afraid
of? Let's settle this like men. C'mon!

393
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:32,690
I am not...

394
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,095
...a whiney, half-assed jerk!

395
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:40,514
You little!

396
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:41,900
Knock it off!

397
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,767
What the hell are the two of you trying to prove?

398
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:48,092
Okay. I don't think I can hold him back.

399
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,295
Damn it, Karma! Will you chill out already?

400
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,749
"A good old-fashioned schoolyard fight?

401
00:25:57,832 --> 00:25:59,209
Outstanding!"

402
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:01,234
I can't really do the voice.

403
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:01,944
No kidding.

404
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:06,456
The whole class was split right down the middle.

405
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:12,679
Yep, Koro-sensei arranged a battle royale to settle
whether or not we should go through with killing him.

406
00:26:13,212 --> 00:26:16,034
One side for. One against.

407
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:18,043
Both had their arguments.

408
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:20,290
Both cared about him in their own way.

409
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:22,053
Yeah, but even if we'd wanted to,

410
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:23,870
saving him was a pipe dream.

411
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,471
At the time, I thought it was a reckless idea.

412
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,442
I hated everything about it.

413
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:29,633
I know.

414
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,381
But I'd have done anything to save his life.

415
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,975
You got carried away.

416
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:38,530
Your emotions made you lose sight of the bigger picture.

417
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:39,463
Admit it.

418
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:41,485
No. You're wrong.

419
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:42,490
Am I?

420
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:53,847
Ever since we met as first-years,

421
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:56,824
to put is simply, I've looked up to him.

422
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:01,000
He did whatever he pleased, without fear.

423
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,647
And he was absolutely brilliant.

424
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:09,674
All of a sudden, we were hanging
out and I felt six feet tall.

425
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:12,195
That was halfway through our first year.

426
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:18,642
But it wasn't long before I learned
that all good things come to an end.

427
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:23,914
He could do whatever he pleased because
he had the strength to back himself up.

428
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,566
Not a place I was ever gonna be.

429
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:30,412
He must've gotten bored sharing the stage with a Nobody.

430
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,041
By the time they suspended him, we'd
gone back to being just classmates.

431
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:43,429
He's always been a harmless little mouse.

432
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:47,254
A guy with my rep has to be
on high alert around most folks.

433
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:48,876
Not with him, though.

434
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:50,931
Looking back on it now,

435
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:53,747
I'm the one who put the distance between us.

436
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:57,584
Even then, there was something
about him that made me nervous.

437
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:02,363
I could put my guard down around him.

438
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,720
But for some reason, he had me on edge.

439
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:09,470
I couldn't deal.

440
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,221
Before long, we'd drifted apart.

441
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,646
And here we are.

442
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,858
A couple of third-years in a class on
assassination, staring each other down.

443
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:21,029
This is it.

444
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:24,450
The only way to get our point across is to win.

445
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:27,542
You are so going down!

446
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:00,167
Now!

447
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,853
I've got this!

448
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,042
Heh!

449
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:14,264
I'll knock you on your ass and take
my sweet time with the final blow!

450
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,378
Aw, that's all you've got?

451
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:34,389
Holy crap. He's taking Nagisa's attacks on purpose.

452
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,470
Karma is first and foremost a combat assassin.

453
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:41,340
He relishes process: The bargaining, the strategy.

454
00:29:41,473 --> 00:29:45,119
Only when he's gone through the
moves will he deal the decisive blow.

455
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,834
Nagisa, on the other hand, is a pure assassin.

456
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,333
Single-mindedly searching for the
one strike that will secure victory.

457
00:29:51,386 --> 00:29:53,497
Karma has trained himself to take a beating.

458
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:56,582
Hit after hit, he'll stand his
ground and give as good as he gets.

459
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,220
Should he hold out indefinitely,

460
00:29:58,253 --> 00:30:01,443
Nagisa will have no honorable choice but to accept defeat.

461
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:25,983
Let's be real.

462
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:29,346
There'll never be another place like this. Not ever.

463
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,581
No one else is gonna let me be honest about how I feel.

464
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:34,131
But I will kill him.

465
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,624
'Cause, like it or not, it's the right thing to do.

466
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:52,766
What the...?

467
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:56,148
That's the last ounce of strength he's got.

468
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:58,387
He bit his tongue to keep from dropping!

469
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,034
Go for it, Nagisa.

470
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,340
Come at me with all that natural talent I never had.

471
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,259
I'll break you over my knee like a twig.

472
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:09,576
This game is mine.

473
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:12,066
It's all channeled into that blade.

474
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:14,554
Dodge and his bloodlust will dissolve.

475
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,927
What the...? What's he doing?

476
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,706
You are going to hear me out!

477
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:30,624
The element of surprise.

478
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:33,729
Nagisa sacrificed his greatest
skill to create a red herring,

479
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,071
opting to finish with a martial arts move.

480
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:37,591
All to make a simple point:

481
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:39,841
Karma's own specialty has, in the end,

482
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:41,521
been turned against him.

483
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,196
Exactly like I tried to do to him.

484
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:49,262
Playing by my terms, he's making it
impossible for anyone to contest the outcome.

485
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:51,568
Ugh. Damn it.

486
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:54,005
At this rate, I'm toast!

487
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,540
He's got a knife!

488
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:02,587
Oh, no!

489
00:32:09,748 --> 00:32:11,378
No, I can't fight.

490
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:14,357
I'm probably way too big of chicken to even try.

491
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:17,769
Uh, unless it was absolutely a matter of life and death.

492
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:22,441
I give up.

493
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,168
Uncle. Uncle.

494
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,696
You win, Nagisa. Good job.

495
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:30,526
Are you listening to me?

496
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:31,585
That's enough!

497
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,129
Red Team has surrendered.

498
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:35,903
Game over. Blue Team is the winner!

499
00:32:36,981 --> 00:32:39,042
Yeah!

500
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:45,251
I actually... won? I beat Karma?

501
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,797
'Fore you start doin' a little victory
dance, let's make one thing perfectly clear.

502
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:51,931
You left your back wide open to attack.

503
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:54,306
I just couldn't bring myself to stab you.

504
00:32:55,124 --> 00:32:58,131
Talk about being stuck between a rock and hard place.

505
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,844
No one would've been satisfied with me winning that way.

506
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,805
Can't believe you managed to get
the drop on me with martial arts.

507
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:09,023
Seriously, dude, who'd have ever thought
I'd be beaten at my own game like that?

508
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,723
You killed me.

509
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,284
Right, you wanna save Koro-sensei?

510
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:16,024
Talk, I'm listenin'.

511
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,269
Are you really? No joke?

512
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:23,759
Quit staring at me like that.
You look like mousetrap cheese.

513
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,239
I've seen fewer bruises on a week-old peach.

514
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,642
Wow, even in defeat, you can't
bear to waste a single insult, huh?

515
00:33:30,873 --> 00:33:31,984
Good ol' Karma.

516
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:33,981
Please.

517
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,049
Look, why don't we drop all the back-and-forth?

518
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:41,769
I'm really not feelin' it after that fight.

519
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:45,653
So, what? We talk to each other like human beings?

520
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,014
Feels kinda weird after all this time.

521
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,182
Fine. I'll start us off.

522
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:54,605
Give me your hand, old friend.

523
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,721
Thanks, Karma. Old friend.

524
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:08,868
True feelings tend to bubble up when
under pressure from a big decision.

525
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:11,116
Often as not, there's conflict.

526
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:15,274
But look, in the end, harmony reigns.

527
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:18,058
Because these boys and girls have fought in earnest,

528
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:21,324
they've come to see and appreciate one's true feelings.

529
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:23,998
Only because I didn't want to paralyze you.

530
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:28,101
Sometimes conflict can be the best
opportunity to strengthen a friendship.

531
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,521
Is that another lesson?

532
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,622
Without strife, we can't grow or learn a damn thing?

533
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,343
You're the first person I ever fought like that.

534
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:41,360
I wasn't sure I'd be able to do it.

535
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,600
I got you pretty riled up.

536
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:46,091
Guess in the end it taught you a lot about yourself.

537
00:34:46,523 --> 00:34:47,152
Yeah.

538
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:48,086
You know,

539
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:51,104
that fight forced us to be honest with each other.

540
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:54,083
That dam was gonna break sooner or later, trust me.

541
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,776
I've tangled with my share,

542
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:59,893
but hands down, the one 'tween us?

543
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,157
That was the pinnacle.

544
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,919
Still, we were just dumb kids. There's no denying it.

545
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,211
Yes!

546
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:11,241
Consider this the Assassination
Classroom's out-of-season research project!

547
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:15,522
Ground control to Major Tom: The ISS has been hijacked!

548
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,476
Things took a turn.

549
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:20,960
The class came around to the idea of saving Koro-sensei.

550
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,622
Man, the lengths we went to.

551
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:26,540
Ever think a bunch of junior high kids
would resort to hijacking a space station?

552
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,771
Not in my wildest dreams.

553
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:31,707
Never thought I'd fly faster than Koro-sensei, either.

554
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:35,031
For one shining moment, we surpassed our teacher.

555
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,269
There's never been a better school trip.

556
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:38,649
Right?

557
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:40,486
Once you've been in outer space,

558
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,671
there's not much on Earth that can rattle you.

559
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:44,809
Ain't that the truth.

560
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:48,089
The data changed everything.

561
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,929
The odds of Koro-sensei exploding?

562
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:53,821
A perfectly acceptable 1%.

563
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:56,811
Might as well have been zero for all we cared.

564
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,465
Life was good.

565
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:01,253
Our happy ending seemed right around the corner.

566
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:02,628
Except...

567
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:08,500
No matter how many assassination techniques
we'd mastered, we were still just kids.

568
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:12,681
The "Powers That Be" weren't about
to leave saving the world up to us.

569
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,611
We were basically pawns.

570
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:18,026
The government was using E Class just to buy time.

571
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:20,478
I'll never forget what happened that night.

572
00:36:28,277 --> 00:36:31,225
I take it that was the last of
the career counseling sessions?

573
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:32,259
Mmm-hmm.

574
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:35,492
My, such exciting prospects these children have.

575
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,259
The only task that remains is
editing the E Class yearbook.

576
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,061
Seems I'll be spending my nights here for a while.

577
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:43,247
Oh yeah?

578
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,061
Mew?

579
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:49,369
Write about yourself.

580
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:50,847
You should preserve your wisdom.

581
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,653
There's no getting around it.

582
00:36:57,709 --> 00:36:59,981
Unconventional as this class has been,

583
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:01,410
we've all learned something.

584
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:04,291
The students. Me.

585
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:12,666
Report.

586
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,959
Yes, sir. He's in the classroom by himself.

587
00:37:16,815 --> 00:37:19,138
He'll be there for the foreseeable future.

588
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,084
Well done, Special Agent Karasuma.

589
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:23,717
You heard the man.

590
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:28,766
March 6th. Commence with the assassination.

591
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,862
What in heaven's name was that?

592
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,398
My tentacles!

593
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:35,712
Since he has the poor manners to be alive,

594
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:38,712
he'll likely hedge his bets and make a run for it.

595
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:41,741
But no matter. We're ready.

596
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:45,204
Tonight will be a night of surprises.

597
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:12,551
What the...?

598
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:14,598
What's all the light?

599
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,299
We were so naïve.

600
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:22,364
Somehow we got it in our heads
this would all end peacefully.

601
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,299
The government left nothing to chance.

602
00:39:25,814 --> 00:39:27,521
They had everything in place.

603
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,966
Right down to the smallest, most horrible detail.

604
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,218
Buff, buff, shine, shine.

605
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:35,623
Make is sparkle, make it gleam. That's the way!

606
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:40,208
Nothing like cleaning to pass the time!.

607
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:45,386
It's a bit lonely, yes.

608
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,192
But there's no point worrying at this late in the game.

609
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:53,871
Of course, if I had one wish...

610
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:00,020
...I'd like to see them again.

611
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,177
Just one last time.

612
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:19,590
I'm up a creek.

613
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:22,520
At least that's what everyone's thinking right now.

614
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:28,909
Alas, I'm a super-being capable
of moving at Mach 20 speed.

615
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:31,905
Fortunate, given how much I have left to do.

616
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:42,945
I can't bring myself to choose!

617
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:44,031
That does it!

618
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:47,536
The E Class yearbook will have to be super-sized!

619
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,202
The Spear of Heaven will be
fully charged in about three hours.

620
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:11,494
Shame that magnificent bastard'll
be obliterated so completely.

621
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,791
Seems a waste of good test samples.

622
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,017
The things we do in the name of world peace.

623
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,523
Do the kids have a chance? Can they pull it off?

624
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,626
Report.

625
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:24,306
There's an intruder on the mountain, sir.

626
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:26,386
Someone's gotten past the police line.

627
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,830
It's more than one!

628
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:36,400
This is a nightmare!

629
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:38,203
I can't get a visual on how many!

630
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:39,774
Think you can mess with us?

631
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:48,443
Way to go. Good teamwork, you three.

632
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:55,717
What the hell?

633
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,640
We've got a sniper!

634
00:43:58,665 --> 00:44:01,430
Our position is compromised, send reinforcements...!

635
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:06,378
This squad's been neutralized, we're good.

636
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:07,498
Nice.

637
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:15,279
Squads C and D are MIA!

638
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:16,550
Status report, now!

639
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:19,127
All right, Okajima, I'm there.

640
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:21,585
About another 50 meters.

641
00:44:23,106 --> 00:44:25,549
Oh, God! How many of them are there?

642
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:33,503
Hey! Lemme down!

643
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:42,175
Huh?

644
00:44:48,194 --> 00:44:49,003
Karma!

645
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:00,331
Nagisa.

646
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:07,697
Heads up! The guy's still moving!

647
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:08,882
Stupid teenagers...

648
00:45:09,654 --> 00:45:11,998
Hey, dumbasses! What do you think you're doin'?

649
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:15,287
Finish what you started, instead of
high-fiveing each other like losers!

650
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:28,354
I thought that sounded like you.

651
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:30,294
Koro-sensei.

652
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,968
You've come so far. Look at you.

653
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,490
The laser's almost charged up.

654
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:49,549
So it would seem.

655
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:54,228
I imagine they'll probably try firing
the killing shot just shy of midnight.

656
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:57,994
We have to leave! Let's try to find a way out of here!

657
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,379
Oh, I know! You could take us as hostages or something!

658
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:04,212
I'm sorry, children.

659
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:06,218
There's no stopping this now.

660
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:09,137
Too many people are aware of my existence.

661
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,778
You knew it'd come to this eventually.

662
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:14,452
You knew it all along.

663
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:17,689
Even if I don't explode, the cat's out of the bag.

664
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:21,822
We'd be fools to think the world would
accept the existence of something like me.

665
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:24,610
Sooner or later, they'll want me out of the picture.

666
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,989
It's a perfectly reasonably reaction.

667
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:29,624
So time's up, is that it?

668
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,203
Mew?

669
00:46:31,023 --> 00:46:33,138
The risk is still less than 1%!

670
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:36,352
And I don't care what other people
say, I'll take those odds any day!

671
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:39,922
We've been a helluva lot closer to you
than any of the jerks runnin' this show.

672
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:41,709
They have an obligation to hear us out!

673
00:46:41,762 --> 00:46:43,997
Like we're just gonna take it? Bullshit!

674
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:46,632
Next government suit crosses my path...

675
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,253
Terasaka. All of you.

676
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:54,304
Permit me to give you a word of advice.

677
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:57,065
In life, we travel upstream,

678
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,818
thrashing against the mighty current of society.

679
00:46:59,928 --> 00:47:01,150
More often than not,

680
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:03,280
things simply won't pan out as you'd wished.

681
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:04,861
Don't apportion blame.

682
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,469
Society is in a circumstance of its own.

683
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:10,130
Resist the temptation to renounce it.

684
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:15,389
Believe me, your time and energy
are far better channeled elsewhere.

685
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:18,406
When hardship prevails, say "that's life,"

686
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:22,613
and marshal your dignity toward navigating
the disappointment as best you can.

687
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:25,488
When the water calms, ask yourself:

688
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:32,413
If society tosses me about like a piece of driftwood,
is it wiser to stay the course, or find another way?

689
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:36,536
If E Class has taught you
nothing else, take this to heart.

690
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:38,941
In the Assassination Classroom,

691
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:42,138
you don't have to face hardships head-on.

692
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:44,980
You can run. You can hide.

693
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,865
Launch a sneak attack if it's not against the rules.

694
00:47:49,058 --> 00:47:51,985
Avail yourself of unconventional methods.

695
00:47:52,443 --> 00:47:55,777
Whatever you choose, above all else, be determined.

696
00:47:55,848 --> 00:47:57,870
Don't give frustration the last word.

697
00:47:57,956 --> 00:48:01,129
The beauty of trial and error is that there's always hope.

698
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:02,375
Never forget.

699
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:04,930
When the moment calls for a decisive strike,

700
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,705
you are an assassin!

701
00:48:08,023 --> 00:48:11,330
Ugh. Unbelievable. Of all the times to lecture.

702
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:13,491
Thank you.

703
00:48:14,193 --> 00:48:17,575
Your rescue efforts move me
more than you could possibly know.

704
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:21,341
I'm embarrassed to admit that
I've been holding back tears.

705
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,708
Aren't I a mess?

706
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:30,649
By the way, Nakamura.

707
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:34,845
I couldn't help but notice how delicately
you carried yourself during the last battle.

708
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:38,609
And, uh, do I smell something sweet, by chance?

709
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:40,775
Your ears are as sharp as your nose.

710
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:44,192
It's been exactly one year to
the day since the moon blew up.

711
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:46,327
And if I remember correctly,

712
00:48:46,404 --> 00:48:49,431
Miss Yukimura designated today as your birthday.

713
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:55,017
Yeah, it's no big deal, but I mean, if you wanna shower
me with praise for getting it here intact, then I...

714
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:55,756
Uh, hey!

715
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:56,589
Sorry,

716
00:48:56,614 --> 00:48:59,790
but this is my first taste of sweet in a week!

717
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:01,599
Don't you dare get your drool on it!

718
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:02,994
Ugh. So gross.

719
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:04,345
All right, guys: Let's sing!

720
00:49:05,082 --> 00:49:06,225
And go!

721
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:10,640
Happy birthday to you!

722
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:11,673
Happy birthday to you!

723
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:15,100
Dude, do we even Happy birthday to
you! ...have the rights to this song?

724
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:21,809
Happy birthday, dear Koro-sensei.

725
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:28,640
Happy birthday to you!

726
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:31,468
My wish already came true.

727
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,326
C'mon! Blow out the candle!

728
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,065
There's just the...

729
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,727
A far greater reward than I could ever deserve.

730
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,492
And many more.

731
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:57,470
Shiro!

732
00:49:57,653 --> 00:49:58,907
Yanagisawa.

733
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,705
The hour is upon us.

734
00:50:00,815 --> 00:50:04,638
So then, permit me to give you the
gift of the world's cruelest death.

735
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:06,727
Hello, there.

736
00:50:07,097 --> 00:50:10,071
You do know who I am, don't you, sir?

737
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,761
Shame you never really knew me.

738
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:28,456
Maybe another time.

739
00:50:28,787 --> 00:50:30,075
It's been fun, though.

740
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,737
I thought if I could pass my skills on to an apprentice,

741
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:35,989
the scope of my work would broaden.

742
00:50:36,398 --> 00:50:40,379
And, well, he volunteered so
eagerly, how could I not accept?

743
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:42,814
Here was a boy who coveted power.

744
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:46,342
So power I taught him, in spades.

745
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,315
To inspire loyalty,

746
00:50:48,437 --> 00:50:51,316
I emphasized the chasm between our respective gifts.

747
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:54,649
Hm.

748
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:56,241
Not terribly effective.

749
00:50:56,698 --> 00:50:59,176
Unless you want the blood spilt to be your own,

750
00:50:59,283 --> 00:51:01,626
master the method I actually taught you.

751
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,358
I shouldn't have been so hard on him.

752
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:15,187
Truly, I shudder to think how much I didn't know.

753
00:51:16,884 --> 00:51:18,592
He wanted your approval.

754
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,089
Everything he did was just to get your attention.

755
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,102
Believe me.

756
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,173
I'm sorry.

757
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,183
You were the first student I took under my wing.

758
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:30,147
And I never gave you credit.

759
00:51:33,743 --> 00:51:34,531
Die!

760
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:35,459
Run!

761
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:10,670
Listen to me, class.

762
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:14,580
There's something I neglected
to mention in my earlier lesson.

763
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:19,780
A clever assassin may avoid confrontation for a while,

764
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:23,264
but sooner or later, the fight will come.

765
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:24,611
And when it does,

766
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:27,607
every last ounce of strength will be put to the test.

767
00:52:28,998 --> 00:52:30,361
In my case...

768
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:33,278
...that would be now!

769
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:42,699
You just won't let go of this
fantasy of being an educator, will you?

770
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,560
Deranged little guinea pig.

771
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:48,296
Answer me this, teacher!

772
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:52,505
Why do you suppose we chose this of
all moments to launch our final offensive?

773
00:52:56,357 --> 00:52:58,195
You will protect them, right?

774
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:00,475
That is what a teacher's meant to do.

775
00:53:10,538 --> 00:53:12,508
What the hell's goin' on? Where are the children?

776
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,905
Are you all right, sir?

777
00:53:27,915 --> 00:53:29,081
Koro-sensei!

778
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:30,460
Koro-sensei, no!

779
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:32,006
Koro-sensei...

780
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:40,242
Coral the guinea pig with his precious
students and this was all but a forgone conclusion.

781
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:43,377
Sorry, boys and girls: You chose poorly.

782
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:47,997
Showing up here tonight only increased
the likelihood of his dying by our hands.

783
00:53:51,473 --> 00:53:52,906
How does it feel?

784
00:53:53,404 --> 00:53:59,039
Watching your students quake with despair as
they realize how much of a hindrance they've been?

785
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:03,809
Do you understand now?

786
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:06,468
They are your greatest weakness!

787
00:54:08,299 --> 00:54:11,805
He's absolutely right. It... It's...

788
00:54:14,623 --> 00:54:16,764
That is preposterous!

789
00:54:20,774 --> 00:54:23,791
You're a fool if you think I'll
believe it's that cut and dry!

790
00:54:23,992 --> 00:54:27,003
These children, they've risked life and limb to save me.

791
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:30,690
What they've gone through just to
be here tonight is extraordinary!

792
00:54:30,902 --> 00:54:34,110
Their determination. Their unflappable spirit.

793
00:54:34,195 --> 00:54:37,548
Students like these are the
greatest gift a teacher could ask for!

794
00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:41,350
They are not a hindrance! They are not a weakness!

795
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:42,932
They are my class!

796
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:46,184
And I am proud of each and every one of them!

797
00:54:47,732 --> 00:54:50,665
Call it what you will, but when the chips are down,

798
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:53,623
I will give my life to protect them!

799
00:54:55,565 --> 00:54:57,592
Yes, that's all fine and good.

800
00:54:58,206 --> 00:54:59,810
Now, then: Let's continue.

801
00:54:59,835 --> 00:55:01,501
Where were we? Yes, of course!

802
00:55:01,526 --> 00:55:03,450
Mind that you pay close attention.

803
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:06,465
Idiot!

804
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:07,632
What the...?

805
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:11,679
Make a run for it, sir!

806
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:15,577
Find a place to hide; you need
to recover. I'll buy you some time!

807
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,472
Kayano what are you doing?

808
00:55:23,702 --> 00:55:24,935
Ah-ha.

809
00:55:25,273 --> 00:55:29,565
Even with the tentacles excised,
your kinetic vision remains.

810
00:55:30,616 --> 00:55:33,070
No, Kayano! Stop this at once!

811
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,736
It was all my fault.

812
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:37,800
I brought us down.

813
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,727
Because of me, everyone had to face the truth.

814
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:44,526
We'd been like a family and I ruined it.

815
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:48,981
So, please, just let me do this.

816
00:55:49,623 --> 00:55:51,776
As your student, I owe you one.

817
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,732
You can't put this on yourself, Kayano!

818
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:56,539
Sooner or later, we all would've had to face reality!

819
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:58,616
Your actions simply made us take stock and...

820
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:08,715
Don't worry, Koro-sensei.

821
00:56:10,174 --> 00:56:11,341
I've got this.

822
00:56:11,482 --> 00:56:15,715
All I have to do is try. My sister taught me that.

823
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:17,695
So did you!

824
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:56,206
Unbelievable!

825
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,658
What are the odds of having both
sisters die right in front of me?

826
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:04,746
Tragic ends must run in the family, eh? Ha!

827
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:08,575
Can you imagine if I'd kept her around as a back-up wife?

828
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:10,843
Too bad for me.

829
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,629
It looks like I have a thing
for women destined to be impaled.

830
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:28,866
There it is!

831
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,939
Oh, but you are a devastating creature when
your emotions twist past the point of endurance.

832
00:57:34,981 --> 00:57:38,419
Black indicates well-nigh unimaginable power.

833
00:57:38,565 --> 00:57:43,050
At last your true colors are on full, glorious display!

834
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:47,601
But alas, considerable though
your power may be in this form,

835
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:53,354
the new and improved you will negate it effortlessly.

836
00:57:53,456 --> 00:57:54,800
Thank you for playing.

837
00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:57,562
Behold his final attack.

838
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:08,609
We need to get out of here!

839
00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:10,941
Are you for real?

840
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:13,601
C'mon! We're wasting time! He's distracted!

841
00:58:13,732 --> 00:58:16,427
If we stick around, it'll only make things worse!

842
00:58:16,558 --> 00:58:17,998
You can't be serious!

843
00:58:18,023 --> 00:58:21,414
Living to fight another day is a
perfectly reasonable battle tactic!

844
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,255
What? A white light?

845
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:58,447
But he... His tentacles are still black!

846
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,065
No.

847
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:02,243
He's gone back to yellow.

848
00:59:02,424 --> 00:59:04,109
Nuh-uh, that's red!

849
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:05,793
He's green!

850
00:59:06,565 --> 00:59:07,537
And blue!

851
00:59:08,815 --> 00:59:09,790
And white!

852
00:59:10,774 --> 00:59:11,914
Every color.

853
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:17,526
Every emotion. Every element of my past.

854
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:19,454
My entire life...

855
00:59:20,312 --> 00:59:24,966
...mixed together into pure white energy!

856
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:27,460
Treasured pupil,

857
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:32,121
may your graduation... help you find peace.

858
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,143
Shit! No, no!

859
00:59:41,398 --> 00:59:44,095
The barrier liquefies tentacles!

860
00:59:44,996 --> 00:59:48,815
Damn you!

861
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,676
What are these flowers for?

862
00:59:59,899 --> 01:00:01,948
I just thought they looked pretty is all.

863
01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:04,682
Figured making arrangements might, I don't know,

864
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:06,496
come in handy one day or something.

865
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:09,956
Sorry, master. I can move them.

866
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:11,785
Hm...

867
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:19,250
No. Leave them here.

868
01:00:19,857 --> 01:00:23,233
You've got a keen eye. Nicely done.

869
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,880
You really mean that, sir?

870
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:27,270
I can make a fresh bouquet every morning!

871
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,329
I suppose you could,

872
01:00:29,778 --> 01:00:31,719
but I'd rather you study chemistry.

873
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:35,245
With what you know now, you'd be lucky to kill a mosquito.

874
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,694
If I'd only seen that smile,

875
01:00:43,315 --> 01:00:46,781
I might've led the poor boy
down an entirely different path.

876
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:04,349
The tentacles spoke to me,

877
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,411
asked me what I wanted.

878
01:01:09,306 --> 01:01:12,496
And I said, to be acknowledged by you.

879
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:15,120
To be like you.

880
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,532
To be like you.

881
01:01:20,074 --> 01:01:21,446
But you are.

882
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:23,866
You are and you always have been.

883
01:01:24,398 --> 01:01:26,012
More than you understood.

884
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,867
If by chance we meet again, on the other side,

885
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,268
let's pick up where we left off.

886
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:53,993
The fight was over,

887
01:01:54,654 --> 01:01:56,755
but none of us were shouting for joy.

888
01:02:06,076 --> 01:02:09,544
Koro-sensei, Kayano's...

889
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:14,300
Oh, Kaede.

890
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:18,301
Why don't we lay her down?

891
01:02:18,493 --> 01:02:20,832
Not so fast. One moment, please.

892
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:24,753
Sorry, I'd rather her cells not
come into contact with the soil.

893
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:30,402
Huh? What is that?

894
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,977
You're looking at Kayano's blood and somatic cells.

895
01:02:34,328 --> 01:02:37,180
I gathered as much as I could
before she fell to the ground,

896
01:02:37,293 --> 01:02:40,936
and stored them in a sterile membrane
of compressed air for safekeeping.

897
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,577
I set a few tentacles aside for protecting you.

898
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:48,011
Of the rest, I used some for fighting and some for this.

899
01:02:49,244 --> 01:02:50,536
Okie-dokie, then.

900
01:02:50,626 --> 01:02:53,328
Time to string these cells together one by one.

901
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:56,717
Faster. And more accurately.

902
01:02:58,690 --> 01:02:59,821
You see, class,

903
01:02:59,992 --> 01:03:02,383
I've been improving my skills for some months now.

904
01:03:02,836 --> 01:03:05,294
If what happened to Aguri repeated itself,

905
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:07,868
I was adamant about being prepared.

906
01:03:09,523 --> 01:03:11,752
Now, some cells couldn't be recovered,

907
01:03:11,857 --> 01:03:13,815
so I'll leave strategic gaps.

908
01:03:13,878 --> 01:03:16,419
Those I'll fill with tiny bits of mucus.

909
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:21,660
In a few days, what cells are there will have
regenerated in sufficient quantities to replace them.

910
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,849
I'm a little low on blood. Type AB donors, if you please.

911
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:33,745
I think the wound's starting to close up!

912
01:03:34,315 --> 01:03:38,115
He didn't use a single stitch.
Didn't leave so much as a mark!

913
01:03:41,649 --> 01:03:44,780
In a moment, her heart will start
beating and she'll come back to life.

914
01:03:45,899 --> 01:03:48,736
I didn't mention this earlier
for fear of sounding ghoulish,

915
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:50,832
but if ever your bodies were torn to shreds,

916
01:03:50,896 --> 01:03:54,286
I was ready and able to put
them back in order piece by piece.

917
01:03:54,328 --> 01:03:56,938
The ultimate student-teacher relationship, really.

918
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:02,512
Because it requires, above all else,

919
01:04:02,662 --> 01:04:04,620
that I properly acknowledge you.

920
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:24,063
What did you...? You saved me again, didn't you?

921
01:04:26,306 --> 01:04:28,413
As many times as necessary.

922
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:31,640
After all, your sister would've done the same.

923
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,623
The important thing

924
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:42,291
is that you not make the same mistake twice.

925
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:46,811
Aguri, thank you for giving me this past year.

926
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:51,485
Such a beautiful gift.

927
01:04:52,144 --> 01:04:54,404
I hope against hope I've been worthy of it.

928
01:05:06,008 --> 01:05:07,753
As we watched him collapse,

929
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,635
we couldn't shake the impression.

930
01:05:10,357 --> 01:05:13,174
He looked spent, but happy.

931
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:15,770
Come now.

932
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:20,756
What kind of assassin let's a target
linger indefinitely on the brink?

933
01:05:22,912 --> 01:05:24,313
Don't you understand?

934
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:27,280
At this point, we're just running out the clock.

935
01:05:29,828 --> 01:05:31,226
I'm sorry, children.

936
01:05:32,748 --> 01:05:34,920
All good things must come to an end.

937
01:05:36,026 --> 01:05:39,412
That's life. That's the nature of the classroom.

938
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:44,046
The red light from above began to swell,

939
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:49,116
indicating eloquently, cruelly, that the hour had come.

940
01:05:51,662 --> 01:05:55,239
It hurt, but we didn't have a second to waste.

941
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:58,305
Guys.

942
01:06:00,078 --> 01:06:02,486
We have to make a decision one way or the other.

943
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:10,235
We could stay out of it.

944
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:13,012
Leave Koro-sensei's fate up to them.

945
01:06:18,368 --> 01:06:19,361
Let's take a vote.

946
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,927
Who here doesn't want to kill him?

947
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:37,789
All right, thank you. Hands down.

948
01:06:40,605 --> 01:06:41,872
Who wants to kill him?

949
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:00,866
They were a part of us.

950
01:07:01,388 --> 01:07:05,522
Our guns. Our knives. Our teacher.

951
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,623
This is it. This is our answer.

952
01:07:19,844 --> 01:07:24,673
We're assassins. Our target... is our teacher.

953
01:07:30,017 --> 01:07:32,919
These were the nonnegotiable terms of our bond.

954
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,900
The only way to graduate with honor.

955
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:39,979
We knew what had to be done, and it hurt.

956
01:07:57,947 --> 01:08:00,030
You can't move if we're all pinning you down,

957
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:01,144
that right, sir?

958
01:08:01,757 --> 01:08:03,921
Precisely, Nakamura my dear.

959
01:08:04,062 --> 01:08:07,968
Though I can't help but feel you're
being a tad bit lax on that grip.

960
01:08:13,077 --> 01:08:15,244
We didn't give much thought to why.

961
01:08:16,056 --> 01:08:18,510
Just tried to focus on the task at hand.

962
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:25,448
He'd praised us. Scolded us. Nurtured us. All year.

963
01:08:25,678 --> 01:08:27,943
And here we were holding him down,

964
01:08:28,273 --> 01:08:30,353
clutching for all we were worth.

965
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:36,216
Your heart, it's... it's under your tie, you said?

966
01:08:37,549 --> 01:08:39,453
Which one of us is gonna...?

967
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:51,642
Guys, please.

968
01:08:55,528 --> 01:08:57,640
Let me. I'll do it.

969
01:09:04,847 --> 01:09:06,758
Sure, I got no beef with that.

970
01:09:07,866 --> 01:09:11,048
Well, you are the head of the
class, so I suppose it makes sense.

971
01:09:28,322 --> 01:09:29,060
Sir...

972
01:09:37,787 --> 01:09:38,970
It's all right.

973
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:41,454
You can actually stab through the tie.

974
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:47,781
There's been a hole in it since
the day it was... given to me.

975
01:09:48,273 --> 01:09:52,973
I decided to leave it like
that. For... sentimental reasons.

976
01:09:57,774 --> 01:09:59,667
Ah, before you proceed,

977
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:02,928
let me say farewell to my fellow educators.

978
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:06,529
Miss Irina, are you sure you won't join in?

979
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:09,470
I'd hate for you to miss out on the bounty.

980
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,460
No thank you. I'd really rather not.

981
01:10:14,981 --> 01:10:17,277
Who gives a damn? It's only money.

982
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:20,143
What I've learned in this class is more valuable.

983
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:22,371
It isn't about me.

984
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,463
It's about the bond you share with these kids.

985
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:29,853
Indeed.

986
01:10:31,065 --> 01:10:32,319
Mr. Karasuma.

987
01:10:33,482 --> 01:10:34,503
I thank you.

988
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:38,242
You've had a hand in molding these
children into what they've become.

989
01:10:38,899 --> 01:10:40,025
If you please,

990
01:10:40,228 --> 01:10:42,905
continue to guide them on their way after I'm gone.

991
01:10:43,497 --> 01:10:44,481
Of course.

992
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,082
You've given me no end of trouble over the past year.

993
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:50,636
But, even so, it's been a year I'll never forget.

994
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:55,528
Rest in peace, Koro-sensei.

995
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,265
Quite.

996
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:05,478
Okie-dokie, class. It's about that time.

997
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:08,873
There so much more I could say, but alas,

998
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:11,281
I'll be lucky to squeeze in what I can.

999
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,757
In lieu of tearful goodbyes, if you'll indulge me...

1000
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:20,747
...I'd like to call roll, one final time.

1001
01:11:23,106 --> 01:11:25,912
When you hear your name called, please say "here."

1002
01:11:26,409 --> 01:11:29,634
Look me squarely in the eye and answer in a loud voice.

1003
01:11:30,148 --> 01:11:31,738
Once we've gone through everyone,

1004
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:33,819
you may commence with the assassination.

1005
01:11:35,023 --> 01:11:35,762
Wait!

1006
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:38,370
Please tell me that you're all present and accounted for!

1007
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:41,378
I don't want the last thing I do
to be marking one of you absent!

1008
01:11:41,403 --> 01:11:42,630
Get on with it!

1009
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:48,490
Very well, then.

1010
01:11:50,993 --> 01:11:52,407
Karma Akabane.

1011
01:11:53,846 --> 01:11:54,306
Here.

1012
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:01,884
Yuma Isogai.

1013
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:03,307
Here.

1014
01:12:09,306 --> 01:12:11,390
Taiga Okajima.

1015
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:12,356
Here.

1016
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,869
Hinata Okano.

1017
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:29,362
Manami Okuda.

1018
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:31,104
Yes, sir! Here!

1019
01:12:36,315 --> 01:12:38,244
Meg Kataoka.

1020
01:12:39,023 --> 01:12:39,610
Here.

1021
01:12:45,347 --> 01:12:47,186
Kaede Kayano.

1022
01:12:47,857 --> 01:12:48,514
Here.

1023
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:56,427
Yukiko Kanzaki.

1024
01:12:56,536 --> 01:12:57,214
Here.

1025
01:13:03,023 --> 01:13:04,996
Justice Kimura.

1026
01:13:05,494 --> 01:13:06,262
Here!

1027
01:13:12,023 --> 01:13:14,156
Hinano Kurahashi.

1028
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:15,156
Here!

1029
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,897
Nagisa Shiota.

1030
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:24,790
Here.

1031
01:13:30,426 --> 01:13:32,668
My sweet, young assassins...

1032
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:39,228
Sosuke Sugaya.

1033
01:13:39,418 --> 01:13:40,088
Here.

1034
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:47,053
As you ready yourselves

1035
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,039
to snuff out a life...

1036
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,675
Tomohito Sugino.

1037
01:13:55,122 --> 01:13:55,722
Here.

1038
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:05,679
...you understand better than
anyone the value of what's lost.

1039
01:14:08,565 --> 01:14:10,981
Kotaro Takebayashi.

1040
01:14:11,286 --> 01:14:12,081
Here.

1041
01:14:17,732 --> 01:14:19,608
Ryunosuke Chiba.

1042
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,654
Here.

1043
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:27,436
Because you've studied...

1044
01:14:31,456 --> 01:14:33,532
Ryoma Terasaka.

1045
01:14:33,863 --> 01:14:34,632
Yo.

1046
01:14:39,887 --> 01:14:40,931
Fretted...

1047
01:14:44,774 --> 01:14:46,275
Rio Nakamura.

1048
01:14:46,926 --> 01:14:47,748
You know it.

1049
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:55,317
Turned it over and over in your mind...

1050
01:14:59,236 --> 01:15:01,104
Kirara Hazama.

1051
01:15:01,611 --> 01:15:02,443
Here, sir.

1052
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:10,163
Rinka Hayami.

1053
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:11,017
Here.

1054
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,444
And in the process,

1055
01:15:17,656 --> 01:15:19,321
without even realizing it,

1056
01:15:20,062 --> 01:15:21,620
given that life meaning.

1057
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,034
Sumire Hara.

1058
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:27,927
Here.

1059
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:35,290
It's been a privilege watching you grow.

1060
01:15:39,195 --> 01:15:41,128
Yuzuki Fuwa.

1061
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,012
Here!

1062
01:15:47,306 --> 01:15:51,405
But the best part was growing right alongside you.

1063
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,938
Hiroto Maehara.

1064
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:05,669
Koki Mimura.

1065
01:16:07,023 --> 01:16:07,755
Here.

1066
01:16:12,315 --> 01:16:13,431
So please...

1067
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:20,067
Takuya Muramatsu.

1068
01:16:20,394 --> 01:16:20,893
Yeah.

1069
01:16:25,867 --> 01:16:27,418
...in this moment...

1070
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:33,407
Toka Yada.

1071
01:16:34,212 --> 01:16:35,014
Here!

1072
01:16:40,014 --> 01:16:42,425
...let me be the finest expression

1073
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:44,513
of your bloodlust.

1074
01:16:48,332 --> 01:16:50,331
Taisei Yoshida.

1075
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:51,251
Here!

1076
01:16:56,685 --> 01:17:01,342
If I die knowing I've helped these
28 souls find a brighter future...

1077
01:17:04,527 --> 01:17:07,332
Autonomous Intelligence Fixed Artillery,

1078
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:08,146
Ritsu.

1079
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:09,086
Here.

1080
01:17:14,374 --> 01:17:17,044
...I die exquisitely happy.

1081
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:23,820
Itona Horibe.

1082
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:25,026
Here.

1083
01:17:30,732 --> 01:17:32,299
All things considered,

1084
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:35,649
I'd say it's been an exceptionally fun year.

1085
01:17:42,609 --> 01:17:45,322
I say this with all sincerity.

1086
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:49,114
It's a privilege to be assassinated by you.

1087
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:53,544
As a fellow spirit, from one traveler to another,

1088
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:56,790
give a yell for all life...

1089
01:17:59,682 --> 01:18:01,093
...and strike.

1090
01:18:12,775 --> 01:18:16,906
This is it. This is the part where I kill him.

1091
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,652
I'm shaking.

1092
01:18:35,187 --> 01:18:36,902
Why can't I stop shaking?

1093
01:19:05,835 --> 01:19:08,632
Don't kill me with anguish in your heart, Nagisa.

1094
01:19:10,027 --> 01:19:11,767
Nice deep breath.

1095
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:13,306
Give us a smile.

1096
01:20:10,315 --> 01:20:14,625
Goo-Goodbye... Koro-sensei.

1097
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:21,633
Goodbye, Nagisa.

1098
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,307
The bare minimum,

1099
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:28,716
that's all I could bring myself to say.

1100
01:20:29,774 --> 01:20:32,205
Gratitude. Regret.

1101
01:20:32,642 --> 01:20:35,225
I put everything I felt into that blade.

1102
01:20:36,106 --> 01:20:37,977
Like I was channeling my soul.

1103
01:20:39,337 --> 01:20:46,030
With every fiber of my being,
I thanked him... with my knife.

1104
01:21:07,523 --> 01:21:09,290
As his life ebbed away,

1105
01:21:09,341 --> 01:21:12,662
it was as if he were saying, "Congratulations."

1106
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,112
Very soon, it would be midnight.

1107
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:30,291
Graduation day at Kunugigaoka.

1108
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:34,810
We'd finished the year a little early.

1109
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:37,940
Time to turn our sights on what lay ahead.

1110
01:24:05,584 --> 01:24:06,602
Now then,

1111
01:24:06,963 --> 01:24:09,757
where are we on what you'd like to be when you grow up?

1112
01:24:09,986 --> 01:24:11,283
Any progress?

1113
01:24:12,899 --> 01:24:14,282
Well, actually,

1114
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,486
I think I want to be a teacher, sir.

1115
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,787
Granted, I can't get up to Mach 20.

1116
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,059
I'm not exactly, you know, invincible,

1117
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:27,395
and my brain doesn't have the processing power of yours,

1118
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:32,039
but still, I want to mold young minds like you.

1119
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:36,851
Excellent. I think we've got it.

1120
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,942
A bureaucrat, eh? Interesting choice.

1121
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:54,124
If I may say so, administrative duties seem rather, um,

1122
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:56,463
restrained for someone of your temperament.

1123
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:59,013
Well, remember the last quake?

1124
01:24:59,118 --> 01:25:01,577
How the politicians were completely useless?

1125
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,723
I won't disagree with you on that.

1126
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:06,388
The country should've been paralyzed, but it wasn't.

1127
01:25:06,413 --> 01:25:07,840
Everything kept functioning.

1128
01:25:08,357 --> 01:25:09,668
Who do we have to thank?

1129
01:25:09,767 --> 01:25:13,527
Behind every talking head at a podium
is some bureaucrat pulling strings.

1130
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,586
That's what real power's all about.

1131
01:25:16,357 --> 01:25:17,607
Does that make sense?

1132
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:19,687
You know, I take it back.

1133
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:21,242
That's a good fit for you.

1134
01:25:27,315 --> 01:25:28,174
Hey, Karma.

1135
01:25:28,476 --> 01:25:28,967
Hm?

1136
01:25:30,049 --> 01:25:32,259
It's a nice day. Let's get some fresh air.

1137
01:25:36,482 --> 01:25:37,237
Why not?

1138
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:46,586
"Assassination."

1139
01:25:47,202 --> 01:25:49,834
Adding that to the curriculum was life-changing.

1140
01:25:50,499 --> 01:25:53,706
Think of all the incredible
experiences we had because of it.

1141
01:25:54,104 --> 01:25:54,839
Yeah.

1142
01:25:56,081 --> 01:25:57,833
Where would I be if I'd never met him?

1143
01:25:58,447 --> 01:26:02,037
It's not every day a teacher inspires
you to follow in their footsteps.

1144
01:26:03,438 --> 01:26:05,136
Koro-sensei was special.

1145
01:26:05,836 --> 01:26:07,333
He made me who I am.

1146
01:26:09,065 --> 01:26:10,257
Look at us now,

1147
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:12,940
working hard to forge our own path in life.

1148
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,042
All because of that one year.

1149
01:26:15,649 --> 01:26:17,550
Pretty crazy when you think about it.

1150
01:26:18,038 --> 01:26:18,823
I know.

1151
01:26:19,623 --> 01:26:22,200
We turned out exactly as the Octopus wanted.

1152
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:23,815
Heh.

1153
01:27:01,368 --> 01:27:02,237
Karma.

1154
01:27:04,247 --> 01:27:05,160
Aw, c'mon.

1155
01:27:05,185 --> 01:27:07,367
They're cleaning this place tomorrow anyway, right?

1156
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:09,431
Yeah. Without you.

1157
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,608
Makes me sad.

1158
01:27:17,976 --> 01:27:20,765
I kinda get the feeling he'd
be proud to see what we've done.

1159
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,759
Been nice if he could'a stuck around. Just sayin'.

1160
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:43,947
Huh?

1161
01:27:58,926 --> 01:28:00,841
Don't mind if I borrow this, do you?

1162
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:10,983
Wherever you are, Teach. Give 'em hell.

1163
01:28:15,148 --> 01:28:16,217
But of course!

1164
01:28:16,785 --> 01:28:17,857
Same to you.

1165
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:20,576
Dumbass.

1166
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:23,640
Come on, Nagisa. We should go.

1167
01:28:34,861 --> 01:28:36,900
Hey! What're you doing?

1168
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:38,884
Hurry. I'm lockin' up.

1169
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,512
Hang on, I'm coming!

1170
01:29:14,595 --> 01:29:16,868
Hm. Memories.

1171
01:29:17,772 --> 01:29:22,117
This was Class 3-E: The Assassination Classroom.

1172
01:29:22,973 --> 01:29:26,549
The bell is silent. Life goes on.

1173
01:30:48,114 --> 01:30:48,861
Huh.

1174
01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:52,307
Gotta say, I'm likin' the looks of my new wallet.

1175
01:31:50,484 --> 01:31:51,998
Nice try, tough guy.

1176
01:31:53,535 --> 01:31:54,971
Better luck next time.

1177
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:07,413
All right, people.

1178
01:32:08,495 --> 01:32:10,113
Let's get started, shall we?
