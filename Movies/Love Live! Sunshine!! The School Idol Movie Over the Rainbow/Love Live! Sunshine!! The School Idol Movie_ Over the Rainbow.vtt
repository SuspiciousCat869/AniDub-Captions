Uh! That's right.

Ah. So, what are we gonna do?

00:08:11.212 --> 00:08:13.014 position:16% line:89% align:start
We could always ask Mari.

a place we could use.

Huh?

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:25.960 position:5% line:83% align:start

work out if we rely on others.

00:08:26.094 --> 00:08:27.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
There are only six
of us here now.

00:08:27.796 --> 00:08:32.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
We have to learn to
solve our own problems.

out the new school campus.

Since we'll be
starting there soon.

It's so far away.

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:00.094 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RIKO] Judging by the
number of students,

00:09:00.228 --> 00:09:02.930 position:24% line:83% align:start
I bet it's a rather
large school.

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:04.432 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Weird.

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:07.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is there really a
school way out here?

What?

00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:20.615 position:24% line:89% align:start

the right address?

Yeah! See?

00:09:25.353 --> 00:09:27.488 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's right here in the message

associated with the

Yeah, that's what I heard,

00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:51.012 position:27% line:83% align:start
so it's being run
as a branch school,

00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:52.647 position:10% line:89% align:start
at least for the time being.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
The building you saw earlier is
actually an old primary school

00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:57.418 position:7% line:83% align:start
that they're borrowing because
it was no longer in use.

It's the "new" campus
for the Uranohoshi girls.

the point of bein' transferred

00:10:03.157 --> 00:10:05.293 position:24% line:83% align:start
to a school that's
closin' down, zura?

What happens when the
middle schoolers graduate?

00:10:07.762 --> 00:10:09.263 position:30% line:83% align:start
Will they be in
the same building?

Right.

never introduced you.

Everyone, this is

school at the main campus?

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:16.042 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI] Mm-hm! Sure do!
Back before I even

00:14:16.177 --> 00:14:18.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
registered there, I had actually
asked You to apply with me.

00:14:19.112 --> 00:14:21.081 position:19% line:83% align:start
But she turned me down,
said she wanted to go

00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:22.382 position:27% line:83% align:start
to the same high
school as Chika.

Huh? You sure I said that?

No need to be embarrassed.

U-Uh. For real?

00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:36.763 position:13% line:89% align:start
No need to be embarrassed.

[GIRLS laugh]

00:14:38.665 --> 00:14:42.168 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI] Chika, Ruby,
Hanamaru, and Yoshiko.

00:14:42.302 --> 00:14:45.305 position:10% line:83% align:start
You loves Aqours so much, so
it's no surprise that she talked

00:14:45.438 --> 00:14:47.974 position:16% line:83% align:start
about you whenever we had
the chance to meet up.

00:14:48.108 --> 00:14:51.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
I always got the feeling
that being in Aqours

00:14:51.911 --> 00:14:54.547 position:13% line:83% align:start
is something that's pretty
important to you, huh?

00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:56.315 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Okay, well now I can't help

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:58.485 position:7% line:89% align:start
but feel a little embarrassed.

00:14:58.618 --> 00:15:00.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's the You we know and love.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.722 position:24% line:83% align:start
Always so up front
with her emotions.

00:15:02.856 --> 00:15:05.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why am I feeling
attacked right now?

00:15:05.425 --> 00:15:07.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, do you know about
the branch school?

00:15:07.994 --> 00:15:09.195 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ahh...

00:15:09.328 --> 00:15:12.397 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tsuki? Can you tell us
what happened?

00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:15.702 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI]
Well, here's the thing.

00:15:15.835 --> 00:15:17.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our school's known
for club activities.

00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:21.406 position:7% line:83% align:start
And some clubs have even got to
compete at a national level.

00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:23.243 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
Hm? Okay?

00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:25.478 position:27% line:83% align:start
When we combined
with Uranohoshi,

00:15:25.612 --> 00:15:27.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
some thought the clubs might get

00:15:27.213 --> 00:15:30.583 position:21% line:83% align:start
watered down because
of the extra students.

00:15:30.717 --> 00:15:33.820 position:13% line:83% align:start
And our parents were afraid
it would cause trouble.

00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:35.121 position:38% line:89% align:start
For real?

00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:37.257 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's like the dumbest
thing I've ever heard!

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:38.725 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI]
I know, right?

00:15:38.858 --> 00:15:40.627 position:16% line:83% align:start
The students and teachers
tried to tell our parents

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.029 position:7% line:89% align:start
that everything would be fine,

00:15:43.163 --> 00:15:44.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
but they asked what
we'd do if the clubs

00:15:44.864 --> 00:15:48.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
happened to fail and if
we'd take responsibility.

00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:50.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's not much you can
do in that situation.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.404 position:5% line:89% align:start
It sounds tough no matter what.

00:15:52.538 --> 00:15:53.640 position:33% line:89% align:start
[YOU grunts]

00:15:53.773 --> 00:15:55.407 position:10% line:89% align:start
And that's why we were trying

00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:57.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
to figure out how we
should approach it.

00:15:57.944 --> 00:15:59.344 position:33% line:89% align:start
All-out war.

00:15:59.478 --> 00:16:01.748 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I highly doubt that.

00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:03.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need to address
their concerns.

00:16:03.883 --> 00:16:06.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're worried about
clubs and whether or not

00:16:06.186 --> 00:16:09.655 position:7% line:83% align:start
the Uranohoshi students will be
active participants in them.

00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:12.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI] So, we just need to
prove to them that your school

00:16:12.292 --> 00:16:14.326 position:7% line:89% align:start
has its own club achievements.

00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:15.694 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUBY]
Do we, though?

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:19.032 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU]
That's a tall order to fill.

00:16:19.165 --> 00:16:22.802 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
A club that's done super well?

00:16:24.469 --> 00:16:28.707 position:19% line:89% align:start
[gasps] We do have one.

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:33.246 position:16% line:83% align:start
I heard it won a national
competition recently, right?

00:16:33.378 --> 00:16:35.714 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh. Huh?

00:16:35.849 --> 00:16:38.184 position:7% line:83% align:start
[YOU] Don't forget, our school
idol club is considered

00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:40.954 position:19% line:83% align:start
top notch, even by our
new school's standards.

00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:43.655 position:30% line:83% align:start
We'll show them
just how active we are.

00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:45.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once they see us,
they won't have a choice.

00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:47.826 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure they'll
change their minds!

00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:50.263 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Great idea!

00:16:50.395 --> 00:16:51.363 position:44% line:83% align:start

I know!

00:16:51.496 --> 00:16:53.266 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, we're doing a live?

00:16:53.398 --> 00:16:54.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
And I know just the date!

00:16:55.068 --> 00:16:56.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our school has an event
coming up next week

00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:59.339 position:10% line:89% align:start
that would be perfect for it!

00:16:59.504 --> 00:17:01.074 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU]
It's... It's...

00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:03.343 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's the future, zura!

00:17:03.475 --> 00:17:07.180 position:10% line:83% align:start

have to go into that big school?

00:17:07.313 --> 00:17:09.648 position:27% line:89% align:start
So funny, right?

00:17:09.781 --> 00:17:11.917 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh great! Old foes.

00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:14.120 position:27% line:83% align:start
They've come from
the past to haunt me!

00:17:14.254 --> 00:17:15.721 position:38% line:89% align:start
Old foes?

00:17:15.854 --> 00:17:18.657 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think she means her
classmates from middle school.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.261 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no way I'm letting
you back out now.

sorta, huge, zura.

[YOSHIKO]
What are you freaking about?

00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:43.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Love Live competition stage
was a hundred times this size!

00:17:43.582 --> 00:17:45.117 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's nothing to--

00:20:11.562 --> 00:20:14.266 position:13% line:83% align:start

[laughs]

00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:30.941 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, I've been thinking.

00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:34.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
About our School Idol Club, and
how it's pretty misunderstood.

00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:37.148 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since we're always
smiling up on stage,

00:21:37.281 --> 00:21:39.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
I feel like we appear
frivolous to people.

00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:42.153 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because we look like we're
having a lot of fun,

00:21:42.286 --> 00:21:44.955 position:10% line:83% align:start
it probably seems like we're
just playing around.

00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:46.857 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
You think so?

00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:49.894 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the truth is, we dance
while we're singing.

00:21:50.027 --> 00:21:52.631 position:19% line:83% align:start
And if people knew how
much work all that was

00:21:52.763 --> 00:21:54.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
then I doubt they'd
enjoy watching us.

00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:59.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
We simply can't show them
that side of being an idol.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.840 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess not giving up is
the only way to do that.

00:22:02.973 --> 00:22:04.609 position:10% line:89% align:start
Everyone's trying their best.

00:22:04.742 --> 00:22:07.311 position:30% line:83% align:start
Even the former
Uranohoshi students.

00:22:07.444 --> 00:22:10.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
And being school idols
means that we can't lose out

00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:15.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
to the established clubs.
We have to do our best, too.

00:22:15.719 --> 00:22:19.089 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know that,
but I'm still struggling.

00:22:24.395 --> 00:22:25.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA] I don't know how
to make this work

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.532 position:16% line:89% align:start
with just the six of us.

00:22:28.667 --> 00:22:31.268 position:16% line:83% align:start
When Mari, Kanan, and Dia
graduated they told us

00:22:31.402 --> 00:22:34.805 position:24% line:83% align:start
to continue Aqours.
I agreed without thinking.

00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:38.776 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was like, "Let's do this!"
and thought we could handle it,

00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:41.045 position:21% line:83% align:start
but then when it was
time to perform,

00:22:41.178 --> 00:22:43.080 position:13% line:89% align:start
it felt weird without them.

00:22:43.214 --> 00:22:45.783 position:19% line:83% align:start
When we were on stage,
it finally hit me.

00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:48.118 position:27% line:89% align:start
I could feel it.

00:22:50.254 --> 00:22:53.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're gone. There's
no more Mari or Kanan.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.961 position:7% line:89% align:start
No more Dia, it's just us now.

00:22:57.094 --> 00:22:59.930 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm not so sure
about the new Aqours,

00:23:00.064 --> 00:23:04.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
because without them,
we aren't Aqours.

00:23:05.102 --> 00:23:07.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
Moving forward, what'll you do?

00:23:07.838 --> 00:23:10.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because at this rate,
Uranohoshi and School Idols

So, tell me.

00:24:50.341 --> 00:24:51.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
We ever decide where
we're gonna practice?

a bunch of places,

we'll have to practice here.

We practiced on this

we saw "Aqours"

What brings you here?

00:25:33.717 --> 00:25:34.951 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
I e-mailed them.

00:25:35.084 --> 00:25:36.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
They said they were
gonna be in Tokyo,

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:38.888 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I invited them to come
watch us practice.

It's fine.

In fact, Leah was excited
to come and watch.

but could we get your opinions?

[SARAH]
Sure.

00:26:13.689 --> 00:26:15.558 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's it, huh?

00:26:15.691 --> 00:26:17.193 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, how were we?

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:19.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm going to be honest.
I'm sure that's what you want,

00:26:19.729 --> 00:26:21.631 position:21% line:83% align:start
or you wouldn't have
asked us to watch.

[GIRLS grunt]

00:26:23.466 --> 00:26:26.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
Here's the thing.
If Love Live had points,

00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:29.038 position:19% line:83% align:start
then scoring 100 would
make you the winner.

00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:32.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your score right now...
is a 30. No, wait.

00:26:32.775 --> 00:26:35.244 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's probably closer
to the 20-point mark.

00:26:35.378 --> 00:26:36.646 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO]
That low?

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:39.048 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RUBY] But that's not
even close to 100.

00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:42.351 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SARAH] Ask yourselves, was it
the third years in your group

00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:44.387 position:13% line:89% align:start
who made you shine so much?

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.256 position:19% line:83% align:start
Was it Kanan's dancing
and natural rhythm?

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.958 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mari's singing ability?

00:26:49.091 --> 00:26:52.061 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or Dia's brilliant
stage presence?

00:26:52.195 --> 00:26:55.164 position:19% line:83% align:start
Were those three what
gave Aqours its spark?

00:26:55.298 --> 00:26:58.134 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's an important question.

00:26:58.267 --> 00:26:59.735 position:13% line:89% align:start
Without the three of them,

00:26:59.869 --> 00:27:02.238 position:13% line:83% align:start
it feels like you're more
anxious and less composed.

00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:05.641 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's true. It's as if you've
lost all your confidence.

to recruit some members,

00:31:14.322 --> 00:31:15.890 position:33% line:83% align:start
[RUBY yelps]
A show?

00:31:16.024 --> 00:31:19.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hadn't even thought about what
our next concert will be like!

00:31:19.427 --> 00:31:22.130 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YOU] It does seem weird that
no one has heard from them,

00:31:22.263 --> 00:31:23.698 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can't help but worry.

00:31:23.832 --> 00:31:26.735 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
What should we do?

00:31:30.672 --> 00:31:33.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SARAH] I think you
should go look for them.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.213 position:30% line:83% align:start
Actually, I had
thought this earlier--

00:31:38.346 --> 00:31:40.749 position:27% line:83% align:start
during your show.
You need a new spark,

00:31:40.882 --> 00:31:42.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I think Mari and
the others can help.

00:31:42.984 --> 00:31:45.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, at least once you
find them, that is.

00:31:45.653 --> 00:31:47.088 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
But...

00:31:47.222 --> 00:31:48.523 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just trust me.

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:50.625 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know this is a new
direction for all of you.

00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:53.360 position:16% line:83% align:start
But that's why it's good
to reflect on the past.

00:31:53.495 --> 00:31:56.765 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you can focus on the future.

00:31:56.898 --> 00:31:58.365 position:33% line:89% align:start
[RUBY grunts]

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.008 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
Chika.

00:32:07.142 --> 00:32:09.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think Sarah might have
a really good point.

00:32:09.644 --> 00:32:12.279 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can practice for our
shows wherever we are.

00:32:12.412 --> 00:32:14.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not like we
haven't done it before.

00:32:14.949 --> 00:32:17.652 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Don't worry. We can do it!

00:32:21.956 --> 00:32:24.358 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay then! Let's go!

00:32:24.491 --> 00:32:27.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MARI'S MOM laughs]
Yay! Yay!

00:32:27.595 --> 00:32:30.397 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>Grazie mille, bella!</i>

00:32:30.531 --> 00:32:32.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh. So, where did
the three of them go?

00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:35.335 position:7% line:83% align:start
It must be fun since it's their
special graduation trip.

00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:39.007 position:7% line:83% align:start
A practice ground to the North?
Or a new land in the South?

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.307 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.709 position:41% line:89% align:start
You do?

00:32:41.843 --> 00:32:43.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MARI'S MOM] It's not as
mysterious as all that.

00:32:43.912 --> 00:32:47.816 position:10% line:83% align:start
They're visiting the country
that our ancestors are from.

00:32:47.949 --> 00:32:49.217 position:27% line:89% align:start
You don't mean...

00:32:49.349 --> 00:32:51.085 position:27% line:89% align:start
I think she does.

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:53.021 position:33% line:89% align:start
[GIRLS gasp]

00:32:53.154 --> 00:32:57.158 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's Italy! Whoo!

00:32:57.292 --> 00:32:59.294 position:33% line:89% align:start
[AQOURS gasp]

00:32:59.426 --> 00:33:02.764 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO]
Yohane... Go!

00:33:02.897 --> 00:33:04.098 position:33% line:89% align:start
[coin clinks]

00:33:16.878 --> 00:33:19.047 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO]
A brand new land.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:23.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
Behold as Yohane... descends!

00:33:27.288 --> 00:33:28.223 position:35% line:89% align:start
We're here!

00:33:28.355 --> 00:33:30.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pistachio gelato's yummy, zura!

00:33:30.757 --> 00:33:32.026 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO]
Already?

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.493 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU] It also comes
in chocolate flavor!

00:33:33.627 --> 00:33:34.929 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUBY]
Do you want some, Yoshiko?

00:33:35.063 --> 00:33:37.798 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO] Of course!
Oh, but what if it messes

00:33:37.932 --> 00:33:40.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
with my stomach or something
since I've never had it?

00:33:41.002 --> 00:33:42.669 position:30% line:89% align:start
Meh, worth it!

00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:43.770 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:33:43.904 --> 00:33:45.572 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
Have you heard from them?

00:33:45.706 --> 00:33:47.841 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's no word from my sis.

00:33:47.975 --> 00:33:51.445 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and nothing from Kanan
or Mari either. All I have is

00:33:51.578 --> 00:33:54.148 position:16% line:83% align:start
this picture they sent me
when they first got here.

00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:55.749 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you think?

00:33:55.883 --> 00:33:57.818 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Hm... I guess we have no choice

00:33:57.951 --> 00:33:59.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
but to head to that
location, right?

00:33:59.953 --> 00:34:01.922 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI]
Hey, that's not far from here!

00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:03.191 position:21% line:89% align:start
You know this place?

00:34:03.324 --> 00:34:04.725 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Yep! In fact,

00:34:04.858 --> 00:34:06.994 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsuki lived in Italy
when she was younger.

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.196 position:27% line:89% align:start
Pretty cool, huh?

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:09.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be your guide.

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you ladies have any
questions, I'm happy to help!

00:34:12.666 --> 00:34:15.002 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now... Can I get an aye-aye?

00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:17.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hold up, isn't that
supposed to be my line?

00:34:17.671 --> 00:34:19.539 position:33% line:89% align:start
[GIRLS laugh]

00:34:20.941 --> 00:34:22.509 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
This is amazing!

00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:24.578 position:30% line:83% align:start
The river goes
through the whole city!

00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:26.480 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI] Yeah, the town is
full of different canals,

00:34:26.613 --> 00:34:27.881 position:10% line:89% align:start
you can take a boat anywhere!

00:34:28.015 --> 00:34:30.417 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not so great if you
drive a car, though.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.452 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
How fascinating!

00:34:32.586 --> 00:34:36.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jeez. This city's so confusing.

00:34:36.391 --> 00:34:37.591 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:34:40.427 --> 00:34:42.930 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RUBY whimpers]

00:34:53.006 --> 00:34:53.941 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI]
Here we are!

00:34:54.074 --> 00:34:56.643 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:34:56.777 --> 00:34:58.545 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm scared, Hanamaru!

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:00.348 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU]
There, there.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.549 position:30% line:89% align:start
It looks right.

00:35:04.151 --> 00:35:06.954 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
This has to be the same place.

00:35:07.087 --> 00:35:09.456 position:30% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:11.825 position:33% line:89% align:start
What the...?

00:35:19.399 --> 00:35:21.935 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Should we answer it?

00:35:30.577 --> 00:35:32.478 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
Tsuki?

00:35:34.381 --> 00:35:35.248 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI]
"Bovolo."

00:35:35.382 --> 00:35:36.650 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUBY]
Huh?

00:35:36.783 --> 00:35:40.220 position:30% line:83% align:start
The voice said,
"Contarini del Bovolo."

00:35:41.989 --> 00:35:43.256 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO]
I don't know.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.524 position:16% line:83% align:start
Something just seems off
about this whole thing.

00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:48.762 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh! What if it's all a set-up?

00:35:48.895 --> 00:35:52.265 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU]
I'm sure it's fine, zura.

00:35:52.399 --> 00:35:53.333 position:38% line:89% align:start
This way?

00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:55.102 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI]
I think so.

00:35:55.969 --> 00:35:57.771 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:35:57.904 --> 00:36:01.241 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh?! Check it out!

00:36:03.977 --> 00:36:05.145 position:38% line:89% align:start
So cool!

00:36:05.278 --> 00:36:07.247 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's as if we've travelled
back to the Middle Ages!

00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:11.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
The place we're going is at
the top of that building.

00:36:11.684 --> 00:36:13.253 position:33% line:83% align:start
[RUBY gasps]
Sis!

00:36:13.387 --> 00:36:15.255 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's Mari! And Kanan!

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:18.458 position:33% line:89% align:start
[GIRLS laugh]

00:36:18.591 --> 00:36:20.827 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness.

00:36:21.627 --> 00:36:24.831 position:30% line:89% align:start
[GIRLS panting]

00:36:29.535 --> 00:36:33.706 position:10% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Whoa. It's you, sis!

00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:37.777 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUBY]
You...

00:36:37.911 --> 00:36:42.082 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're... You're okay!

00:36:42.215 --> 00:36:44.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't believe you
really came to Italy.

00:36:44.817 --> 00:36:46.119 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's so far from home.

00:36:46.253 --> 00:36:48.121 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUBY]
Of course! Of course.

00:36:48.255 --> 00:36:49.389 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a relief.

00:36:49.523 --> 00:36:51.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
Were the three of you
together this whole time?

00:36:51.258 --> 00:36:54.027 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sì, naturally!
Why wouldn't we be?

00:36:54.161 --> 00:36:57.030 position:19% line:83% align:start
So does that mean you
girls weren't missing?

00:36:57.164 --> 00:37:00.067 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Missing? You mean us?

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:00.866 position:33% line:89% align:start
[RUBY grunts]

00:37:01.001 --> 00:37:02.235 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
I knew it!

00:37:02.369 --> 00:37:04.904 position:30% line:83% align:start
Mama is the one
who sent them here!

00:37:05.038 --> 00:37:07.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KANAN] What exactly did
Mari's mom say to you

00:37:07.407 --> 00:37:08.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
before you came to Italy?

00:37:08.574 --> 00:37:10.143 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
Nothing much.

00:37:10.277 --> 00:37:11.744 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA] She mostly just talked
about how you'd gone missing

00:37:11.877 --> 00:37:13.746 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that she was very
worried about you.

00:37:13.879 --> 00:37:15.748 position:44% line:83% align:start
[DIA]
Oh? And who's that?

00:37:15.881 --> 00:37:18.684 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nice to meet you!
Name's Tsuki Watanabe.

00:37:18.818 --> 00:37:20.619 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm actually You's cousin.

00:37:20.753 --> 00:37:23.223 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ahoy there girls!

00:37:23.356 --> 00:37:24.957 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
She's bella!

00:37:25.092 --> 00:37:25.691 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:37:25.825 --> 00:37:27.127 position:21% line:89% align:start
She is You's cousin.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.128 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Hm?

00:37:28.261 --> 00:37:31.331 position:27% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU groans]
Those stairs.

00:37:31.465 --> 00:37:34.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm dyin', go on without me.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hanamaru!

00:37:35.935 --> 00:37:37.437 position:30% line:89% align:start
Rest in peace!

00:37:37.571 --> 00:37:39.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
Back up, isn't it strange Mari's
mother would say we're missing?

00:37:40.106 --> 00:37:43.075 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think we can assume that
means we're being used as bait.

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.411 position:38% line:89% align:start
As bait?

00:37:44.544 --> 00:37:46.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sì. I'm afraid this
whole thing was a trap.

00:37:46.446 --> 00:37:48.881 position:7% line:83% align:start
If we'd known you were coming,
we would have made contact.

00:37:49.014 --> 00:37:51.951 position:10% line:89% align:start
Looks like this was a set up.

00:37:52.084 --> 00:37:55.555 position:21% line:83% align:start
[DIA] A trap to lure

What?!

[RIKO]
So you girls going missing

00:37:58.425 --> 00:37:59.725 position:10% line:89% align:start
was nothing more than a lie?

00:37:59.859 --> 00:38:01.727 position:41% line:83% align:start

Huh...?

 <i>Ma dite...</i>

Sorry, You. Forgive me!

No! Don't!

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.419 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, don't zura.

00:38:29.688 --> 00:38:30.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
She's definitely...

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:33.359 position:7% line:89% align:start
...related to You, am I right?

00:38:35.828 --> 00:38:37.129 position:41% line:83% align:start
[DIA]
Sorry!

00:38:37.263 --> 00:38:39.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MARI] We can't tell you
the details right now!

00:38:39.698 --> 00:38:42.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is just a hunch,
but I think Mari and the others

00:38:42.935 --> 00:38:44.837 position:30% line:83% align:start
may be runnin'
away from her mom.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.473 position:33% line:89% align:start
You think so?

00:38:46.606 --> 00:38:47.806 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's go after them!

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.241 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
That's impossible,

00:38:49.375 --> 00:38:52.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
we have no idea where
they might be going!

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.214 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
What's this?

00:38:55.347 --> 00:38:58.417 position:7% line:83% align:start

00:39:02.354 --> 00:39:03.355 position:35% line:89% align:start
The fallen?

00:39:03.489 --> 00:39:04.957 position:19% line:89% align:start
Giovanni? In that case,

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have a pretty good idea
the place it's talking about.

00:39:07.793 --> 00:39:10.362 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wait. Tell me more
about these fallen.

00:39:10.496 --> 00:39:12.031 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RIKO grumbles]

00:39:12.164 --> 00:39:13.933 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI] There's a city in Italy
whose patron saint is Giovanni,

00:39:14.066 --> 00:39:15.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
AKA John or Johannes!

00:39:15.768 --> 00:39:17.336 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
We'll go to my secret spot.

00:39:17.469 --> 00:39:19.838 position:7% line:83% align:start
How long do you think we should
keep running away like this?

00:39:19.972 --> 00:39:21.173 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KANAN]
Don't like it?

00:39:21.307 --> 00:39:23.642 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm not saying
that I hate it.

00:39:23.776 --> 00:39:25.377 position:13% line:89% align:start
This really takes me back.

00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:28.581 position:7% line:83% align:start
Kinda reminds me of being kids
and sneaking Mari out to play.

00:39:28.714 --> 00:39:29.982 position:44% line:83% align:start
[DIA]
I agree.

00:39:30.115 --> 00:39:32.518 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess some things never
change, huh, Mari?

00:39:32.651 --> 00:39:35.354 position:30% line:89% align:start
True, let's go!

00:39:35.487 --> 00:39:36.322 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KANAN]
'Kay.

00:39:36.455 --> 00:39:38.824 position:19% line:89% align:start
Time for an adventure!

00:41:39.611 --> 00:41:42.648 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's the spot! Yeah.

00:41:42.781 --> 00:41:44.550 position:38% line:89% align:start
[inhales]

00:41:44.683 --> 00:41:46.851 position:10% line:89% align:start
What a beautiful house, Mari!

00:41:46.984 --> 00:41:48.986 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's your family's, am I right?

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.922 position:13% line:89% align:start
It must be nice to be rich.

00:41:51.055 --> 00:41:53.492 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
Sì! I'd definitely agree!

00:41:53.625 --> 00:41:57.862 position:10% line:83% align:start
But this isn't my place, I'm
just borrowing it from a friend.

00:41:57.995 --> 00:42:02.266 position:10% line:83% align:start
Though, my family does have a
vacation casa kinda close by.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.168 position:27% line:89% align:start
And right now...

Why did you meet with everyone?

00:42:15.714 --> 00:42:18.383 position:10% line:83% align:start
Was this all part of a bigger
plan or something?

00:42:18.516 --> 00:42:20.985 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh! I knew when we
made our great escape

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:22.588 position:24% line:83% align:start
they would probably
suspect we went to

00:42:22.721 --> 00:42:26.491 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Ohara vacation home
that's in a different town.

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:29.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah, this was just to
buy you some time.

00:42:29.394 --> 00:42:31.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
[DIA] Does that mean Chika
won't be able to find us?

00:42:31.597 --> 00:42:33.064 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
Hm... I left them a little hint

00:42:33.197 --> 00:42:34.700 position:24% line:83% align:start
to our whereabouts
in the uniform.

00:42:34.833 --> 00:42:37.368 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's a good chance they
could figure it out in time.

00:42:37.502 --> 00:42:40.839 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KANAN] Yeah, well, they
did come all this way.

00:42:40.972 --> 00:42:43.241 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thanks to your mom, of course.

00:42:43.374 --> 00:42:46.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
They'd be better off
forgetting about us.

00:42:46.177 --> 00:42:47.713 position:5% line:89% align:start
Like, shouldn't they be focusing

00:42:47.846 --> 00:42:50.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
on making the new
Aqours a success?

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:56.220 position:44% line:83% align:start
[DIA]
Maybe they're not just here

00:42:56.354 --> 00:42:59.190 position:33% line:83% align:start
because your
mother sent them.

00:43:00.826 --> 00:43:02.260 position:44% line:83% align:start
[DIA]
It could be

00:43:02.393 --> 00:43:05.430 position:10% line:83% align:start
they have something important
to discuss with us.

00:43:08.299 --> 00:43:10.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
[sighs] We're in
Florence at last!

Johannes, Yohane.

00:43:12.036 --> 00:43:13.438 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
What should we do?

00:43:13.571 --> 00:43:15.640 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU] Sample the local
cuisine, of course!

00:43:15.773 --> 00:43:17.141 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GIRLS]
Sounds good!

00:43:17.275 --> 00:43:18.576 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
Hm...

00:43:27.018 --> 00:43:28.953 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's <i>molto buono</i> , zura!

00:43:29.086 --> 00:43:30.555 position:27% line:89% align:start
What did you say?

00:43:30.688 --> 00:43:32.523 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU] That's how you say
"really good" in Italian!

00:43:32.657 --> 00:43:34.058 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm glad we figured
out Mari's clue,

00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:35.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I'm not sure what
the next step is.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.129 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and Florence is
still a pretty big place.

00:43:38.262 --> 00:43:41.699 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wonder if they plan on
contacting us or something?

00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:42.934 position:21% line:89% align:start
What if they're here?

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.402 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wouldn't they text?

00:43:44.535 --> 00:43:46.304 position:27% line:89% align:start
Maybe they can't?

00:43:46.437 --> 00:43:48.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
That could be why.
If they use their phones,

00:43:48.806 --> 00:43:51.409 position:21% line:83% align:start
then Mari's mom could
probably track their location.

00:43:51.542 --> 00:43:53.511 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
Good point.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.683 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TSUKI]
Here, sorry it took so long!

00:43:58.816 --> 00:43:59.684 position:16% line:89% align:start
Whoa! What is this thing?

00:43:59.817 --> 00:44:01.185 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's huge!

00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:03.654 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a dish called
"Bistecca alla Fiorentina."

00:44:03.788 --> 00:44:04.988 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's quite popular.

00:44:05.122 --> 00:44:08.493 position:27% line:83% align:start

I can't wait to try it!

Here, Yoshiko!

00:44:10.094 --> 00:44:13.164 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? Where's Yoshiko?

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:19.303 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yoshiko! I mean, Yohane!

00:44:19.437 --> 00:44:20.371 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
She's gone?

00:44:20.505 --> 00:44:22.038 position:10% line:89% align:start
We don't have time for this.

00:44:22.173 --> 00:44:24.175 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now we have to find a fallen
angel on top of everything else!

00:44:24.308 --> 00:44:25.877 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wonder where she went?

00:44:26.009 --> 00:44:28.011 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, good question.

00:44:28.144 --> 00:44:29.079 position:41% line:83% align:start

Johannes.

00:44:48.366 --> 00:44:50.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YOU] What is this place?
It's awesome!

00:44:50.935 --> 00:44:51.903 position:41% line:83% align:start

It's the Duomo.

Whatty-what-now?

And this is Piazza San Giovanni.

[RIKO]
Giovanni like Johannes!

00:44:57.942 --> 00:44:59.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wow, having such
a large structure

00:44:59.577 --> 00:45:01.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the middle of
the city is amazing.

00:45:01.946 --> 00:45:05.483 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RIKO] But never mind that!
We have to find Yoshiko!

00:45:05.616 --> 00:45:07.652 position:41% line:83% align:start

Where could she be?

Our good friend is missing.

00:45:12.222 --> 00:45:14.190 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's right around
the same age as us.

00:45:14.324 --> 00:45:16.192 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, and around
the same height, too.

00:45:16.326 --> 00:45:18.295 position:16% line:89% align:start
She can be rather noisy.

00:45:18.429 --> 00:45:22.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
And she tells everyone
she's a fallen angel, zura.

00:45:22.265 --> 00:45:23.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO]
I understand.

00:45:23.868 --> 00:45:26.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
It sounds like she's a
very free and noble spirit.

[GIRLS gasp]

I'm Yohane!

how worried we were?

It's so weird.

00:45:41.652 --> 00:45:44.855 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, calm yourself,

I'm not the Fallen Angel,

00:46:14.719 --> 00:46:17.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's the cupola.

Well, to put it all
rather simply,

00:49:07.957 --> 00:49:09.893 position:30% line:83% align:start
there's been an
offer of marriage.

00:49:10.026 --> 00:49:13.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
[MARI] And what's worse, it's to
some boy I've never even met!

00:49:13.428 --> 00:49:15.531 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUBY]
Why though?

00:49:15.665 --> 00:49:18.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because she wants to
take away Mari's freedom.

[GIRLS gasp]

00:49:20.236 --> 00:49:23.472 position:16% line:83% align:start
She means Mari's mother.
When we first met Mari

00:49:23.605 --> 00:49:26.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
as children, her mother
wasn't very fond of us.

00:49:26.475 --> 00:49:29.679 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KANAN] Up until that point,
Mari was always well-behaved.

00:49:29.813 --> 00:49:31.580 position:10% line:89% align:start
But after getting to know us

00:49:31.714 --> 00:49:34.918 position:27% line:83% align:start
she evolved into
more of a free spirit.

00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:37.854 position:10% line:83% align:start
[DIA] Mari decided to return
to Uranohoshi on her own,

00:49:37.987 --> 00:49:40.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then took up the
position of chairwoman.

00:49:40.622 --> 00:49:42.491 position:7% line:89% align:start
When it comes to school idols,

00:49:42.624 --> 00:49:45.094 position:30% line:83% align:start
let's just say
her mom isn't a fan.

00:49:45.228 --> 00:49:46.562 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's too bad.

00:49:46.695 --> 00:49:49.598 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, what was the point
of this trip, then?

00:49:49.731 --> 00:49:51.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
You see, I wanted
Mama to understand

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.569 position:27% line:83% align:start
my feelings, so I
wrote her a letter.

00:49:53.702 --> 00:49:55.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
I told her how I am a
different girl than I was

00:49:55.839 --> 00:49:58.707 position:10% line:83% align:start
when I was a kid. And that if
she won't let me be free,

00:49:58.842 --> 00:50:01.510 position:10% line:89% align:start
then I won't be coming home.

00:50:01.643 --> 00:50:03.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is all just you rebelling?

00:50:03.378 --> 00:50:06.249 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, the problem is we never
thought her mom would actually

00:50:06.381 --> 00:50:07.951 position:24% line:89% align:start
chase us to Italy.

00:50:08.084 --> 00:50:12.454 position:10% line:83% align:start

Now. Let's take a deep breath.

00:51:16.252 --> 00:51:17.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hiding out in a place like this.

00:51:17.786 --> 00:51:19.621 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let me guess,
it was "Hug's" idea?

00:51:19.755 --> 00:51:23.326 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MARI] Nuh-uh! This whole
thing is all your fault!

00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:25.328 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're being too strict!

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.062 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I wish I had
been stricter!

00:51:27.195 --> 00:51:28.730 position:16% line:89% align:start
Maybe then you'd behave!

00:51:28.864 --> 00:51:30.832 position:7% line:83% align:start
Remember how you ran away from
home in Elementary school?

00:51:30.966 --> 00:51:33.669 position:10% line:83% align:start
And how you quit school here
so you could go back to Japan

00:51:33.802 --> 00:51:35.704 position:13% line:89% align:start
to try and save Uranohoshi?

00:51:35.837 --> 00:51:38.740 position:10% line:83% align:start
I only put up with it because
your father insisted,

00:51:38.874 --> 00:51:41.243 position:16% line:89% align:start
but look at the results!

00:51:41.377 --> 00:51:42.544 position:33% line:89% align:start
What of them?

00:51:42.678 --> 00:51:43.946 position:33% line:83% align:start
[MARI'S MOM]
As if you don't know.

00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:46.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
All of your gallivanting
has resulted in failure!

00:51:46.949 --> 00:51:49.351 position:19% line:83% align:start
Failure to prevent your
school from closing,

00:51:49.484 --> 00:51:52.721 position:7% line:83% align:start
and forfeiting your opportunity
to graduate overseas!

00:51:52.854 --> 00:51:55.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
Really? What about my
achievements as a school idol?

00:51:56.091 --> 00:51:58.927 position:27% line:83% align:start
We won Love Live!
Do you know how hard that was?

00:51:59.061 --> 00:52:00.862 position:38% line:89% align:start
So what?

00:52:01.763 --> 00:52:04.599 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please. School idols
are completely worthless.

00:52:04.733 --> 00:52:08.337 position:7% line:89% align:start
Those achievements? Who cares?

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:09.671 position:27% line:89% align:start
They're useless.

00:52:09.805 --> 00:52:13.642 position:24% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Useless...?

00:52:13.775 --> 00:52:15.310 position:33% line:89% align:start
[DIA grunts]

00:52:16.111 --> 00:52:18.747 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
She's doesn't understand.

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.949 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right. Which is why we
thought it would be better

00:52:21.083 --> 00:52:23.552 position:27% line:83% align:start
for Mari to make
her own decisions.

00:52:23.685 --> 00:52:24.987 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's enough!

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
Besides, Mari will
do what I tell her!

00:52:27.723 --> 00:52:29.224 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
Idols aren't worthless!

00:52:29.358 --> 00:52:31.126 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? What?

00:52:31.259 --> 00:52:35.697 position:16% line:83% align:start
School idols are special.
They're not worthless!

00:52:35.831 --> 00:52:39.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
Listen, all I need is the
chance to prove it to you.

00:52:39.368 --> 00:52:42.738 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can show you that idols are
capable of great things!

00:52:42.871 --> 00:52:45.741 position:16% line:89% align:start
Give me this opportunity.

00:52:45.874 --> 00:52:48.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you do that, I promise
we'll prove that school idols

00:52:49.044 --> 00:52:50.779 position:24% line:83% align:start
have the ability to
touch peoples' hearts.

00:52:50.912 --> 00:52:53.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then will you acknowledge
my feelings, Mama?

00:52:53.681 --> 00:52:55.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
Refuse the marriage offer.

00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:57.452 position:24% line:83% align:start
Allow Mari to make
her own choices,

00:52:57.585 --> 00:53:00.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
including who she
spends her time with.

00:53:09.297 --> 00:53:11.233 position:33% line:89% align:start
As you wish.

00:53:11.366 --> 00:53:12.968 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mama?

00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:18.173 position:10% line:83% align:start
However, should you fail, you
will do as I say, young lady.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.688 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

00:53:34.822 --> 00:53:36.391 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SARAH]
Leah?

00:53:36.525 --> 00:53:40.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just got a message from
Chika and the rest of Aqours.

00:53:40.228 --> 00:53:41.530 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get this.

00:53:41.662 --> 00:53:44.665 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're going to do a live
performance in Italy and...

00:53:49.371 --> 00:53:50.838 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LEAH]
Sorry, but...

00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:55.210 position:27% line:83% align:start
I kinda wanna be
alone right now.

00:53:55.343 --> 00:53:56.877 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:54:03.717 --> 00:54:05.087 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Buongiorno!

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.889 position:24% line:83% align:start
But "good evening"
is "Buonasera." 'Kay?

00:54:10.358 --> 00:54:12.260 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's <i>ottimo</i> !

00:54:12.394 --> 00:54:14.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where are you putting
all that food?

00:54:14.429 --> 00:54:17.865 position:13% line:83% align:start
No way the human stomach is
capable of holding that much.

00:54:17.998 --> 00:54:19.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
Unless you're not human.

00:54:19.967 --> 00:54:24.638 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU] Try the lasagna,
zura! Say, "aah!"

00:54:24.772 --> 00:54:26.308 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:54:26.441 --> 00:54:28.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, have we decided everything?

00:54:28.376 --> 00:54:30.811 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What do you mean?

00:54:30.945 --> 00:54:32.713 position:5% line:89% align:start
Our show! Where are we doing it?

00:54:32.847 --> 00:54:34.282 position:19% line:89% align:start
Today was so much fun!

00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:36.817 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't believe we got see
so many awesome sights.

00:54:36.951 --> 00:54:41.122 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know! With you all here
I'm <i>molto eccitata</i> !

00:54:41.256 --> 00:54:43.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is anyone listening to me?
We have to figure out where

00:54:43.724 --> 00:54:46.093 position:16% line:83% align:start
to perform so we can show
your mom how great idols are!

00:54:46.227 --> 00:54:49.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're the reason we even
made that deal! Sheesh!

00:54:49.263 --> 00:54:51.765 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, we hear you,
calm down, Dia.

00:54:51.899 --> 00:54:53.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everything we saw today
was beautiful, but,

00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:55.337 position:16% line:89% align:start
we need a crowded place.

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:57.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
Obviously those would
be the best spots,

00:54:57.372 --> 00:54:59.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
though a stage wouldn't
be a bad idea, either.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.410 position:27% line:83% align:start
For sure. I loved
the Trevi Fountain.

00:55:02.544 --> 00:55:03.878 position:13% line:89% align:start
The stairs were nice, too.

00:55:04.011 --> 00:55:06.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
Kinda makes me wish we
could use all of 'em!

00:55:06.414 --> 00:55:08.416 position:44% line:83% align:start
[DIA]
That's a tall order to fill.

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:09.817 position:13% line:89% align:start
We could use the colosseum!

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.587 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll help, too!
I can take video!

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.622 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
Thanks, Tsuki!

00:55:13.754 --> 00:55:15.122 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
Sounds bene!

00:55:15.256 --> 00:55:16.857 position:21% line:83% align:start
We should be able to
gather a huge crowd there.

00:55:16.991 --> 00:55:18.426 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KANAN]
Glad we got that settled.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.060 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
Me, too.

00:55:20.194 --> 00:55:22.396 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU] Wait, not so fast.
Give us a moment.

00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:23.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
We may be first years,

00:55:24.131 --> 00:55:26.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
but we have something
important we'd like to say.

00:55:28.836 --> 00:55:30.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you don't mind,
we want to be the ones

00:55:30.471 --> 00:55:32.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
to pick the venue
for our performance.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.908 position:44% line:83% align:start
[DIA]
Huh?

00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:35.610 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're tired of sitting around.

00:55:35.743 --> 00:55:38.412 position:10% line:83% align:start
In the past, we've always let
the older members of Aqours

00:55:38.547 --> 00:55:40.147 position:16% line:89% align:start
take care of everything.

00:55:40.281 --> 00:55:41.348 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not anymore!

00:55:41.482 --> 00:55:44.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
We would like you to
trust us with this show.

00:55:46.187 --> 00:55:50.191 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO groans]
My stomach is dangerously full!

00:55:50.324 --> 00:55:52.893 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
And who's fault is that exactly?

00:55:53.027 --> 00:55:54.461 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU]
Good night, zura.

00:55:54.595 --> 00:55:57.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
[YOSHIKO] You could act a little
more concerned, gosh!

00:55:57.998 --> 00:55:58.866 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sorry, girls.

00:55:58.999 --> 00:56:00.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:56:00.734 --> 00:56:03.304 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KANAN] Mari ran her mouth and
got you involved in our mess.

00:56:03.437 --> 00:56:06.675 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MARI] Hey. I just got
caught up in the moment!

00:56:06.807 --> 00:56:08.776 position:44% line:83% align:start
[YOU]
Like we'd expect anything less.

00:56:08.909 --> 00:56:10.144 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
For real.

00:56:10.277 --> 00:56:11.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
Look, if you girls
decide to back out,

00:56:11.712 --> 00:56:13.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
then we'd definitely understand

00:56:13.314 --> 00:56:15.449 position:7% line:83% align:start
and can come up with something
to perform on our own.

00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:16.617 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's cool.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:17.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
Mm-mm. We're good.

00:56:17.751 --> 00:56:19.220 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:56:19.353 --> 00:56:21.589 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, to be honest I think
we're all happy about it.

00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:22.790 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
Really?

00:56:22.923 --> 00:56:24.491 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
Mm. The thing is...

00:56:24.625 --> 00:56:26.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
...we came here for us.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
It wasn't just because Mari's
mom offered to fund the trip.

00:56:29.762 --> 00:56:33.867 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YOU] You see. This sort of
involves everyone in our group.

00:56:34.001 --> 00:56:36.003 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been feeling
kinda worried.

00:56:36.136 --> 00:56:39.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA] It's like...
an unsettled feeling.

00:56:39.673 --> 00:56:41.909 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're still not sure
about the new Aqours.

00:56:42.042 --> 00:56:44.878 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hold up, new Aqours?

00:56:45.012 --> 00:56:47.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
We honestly tried our best
to figure everything out

00:56:47.881 --> 00:56:50.484 position:7% line:89% align:start
by ourselves, but we couldn't.

00:56:50.618 --> 00:56:52.052 position:5% line:89% align:start
But that's where Sarah came in.

00:56:52.186 --> 00:56:55.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
She suggested meeting up
with you and talking about it.

00:56:55.422 --> 00:56:56.889 position:21% line:89% align:start
Makes perfect sense.

00:56:57.024 --> 00:57:00.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you think, Kanan?
Any ideas?

00:57:00.594 --> 00:57:03.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just that I agree with
what you already said.

00:57:03.197 --> 00:57:04.465 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
Hm?

00:57:04.598 --> 00:57:06.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KANAN] You need to find
the answer on your own.

00:57:06.667 --> 00:57:08.102 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
I agree.

00:57:08.235 --> 00:57:10.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
It won't mean as much if we
just tell you what to do.

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:12.539 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, true.

00:57:12.673 --> 00:57:16.243 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KANAN]
Chika.

00:57:16.377 --> 00:57:19.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look, our hearts will
always be with you.

00:57:19.812 --> 00:57:22.949 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mari's heart... Dia's heart...

00:57:23.083 --> 00:57:24.917 position:21% line:89% align:start
And mine, of course.

00:57:25.052 --> 00:57:26.819 position:19% line:89% align:start
That will never change.

00:57:26.953 --> 00:57:28.589 position:41% line:89% align:start
Never?

[RIKO] Silly dog, can't you
just listen to me this once?

You're really in the zone.

01:06:54.384 --> 01:06:57.454 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh...? Yeah, sorry.

01:07:00.724 --> 01:07:03.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess that my muse
just came to me.

01:07:03.861 --> 01:07:06.897 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I suddenly knew
how we needed to start.

01:07:07.031 --> 01:07:09.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
You mean starting over
with six members?

01:07:09.533 --> 01:07:12.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Y'know, I used
to think starting over

01:07:12.836 --> 01:07:15.340 position:27% line:83% align:start
meant you had to
go back to zero.

01:07:15.472 --> 01:07:18.276 position:27% line:83% align:start
Zero's a typical
starting place after all,

01:07:18.408 --> 01:07:19.476 position:27% line:89% align:start
so it made sense.

01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:20.878 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
But not anymore?

01:07:21.011 --> 01:07:23.780 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
No. It's different.

01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:27.318 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we started over then we
would lose all the experiences

01:07:27.451 --> 01:07:29.187 position:16% line:89% align:start
that made us who we are.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.688 position:10% line:89% align:start
And that doesn't make sense!

01:07:31.822 --> 01:07:35.826 position:7% line:83% align:start
Everything we've done together
is still in our hearts.

01:07:35.959 --> 01:07:39.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not one single thing
has disappeared.

01:07:42.466 --> 01:07:44.134 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
And when I think of it that way,

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:46.737 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know we can do this.

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:49.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm looking forward
to your lyrics.

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:50.774 position:13% line:89% align:start
Compose a good song, 'kay?

01:07:50.908 --> 01:07:51.642 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

01:07:51.775 --> 01:07:53.076 position:19% line:89% align:start
To be honest with you,

01:07:53.211 --> 01:07:56.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
I feel like my composing's
better than ever.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.884 position:5% line:83% align:start
While we were in Italy, I tried
to listen to all kinds of music.

01:08:01.018 --> 01:08:02.686 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CHIKA]
That sounds like you.

01:08:02.819 --> 01:08:04.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RIKO] We're not the only
ones working hard.

01:08:04.922 --> 01:08:06.924 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ruby and Hanamaru
went to the fabric store

01:08:07.057 --> 01:08:10.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
so they could help design
our new costumes.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
You and Yoshiko even
learned a brand-new dance

01:08:12.629 --> 01:08:16.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
choreography so they
could show it to us.

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:17.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's awesome.

01:08:17.567 --> 01:08:19.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
The girls in Aqours are amazing.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure are! What's it like to lead
such a cool group of girls?

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.841 position:27% line:89% align:start
Great, honestly!

What's up?

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.282 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your friend Kanan
is on the phone.

Huh?!

01:08:38.588 --> 01:08:39.957 position:19% line:89% align:start
You mean Leah wants...

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.426 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
...to join Aqours?

01:08:41.558 --> 01:08:43.226 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GIRLS]
Seriously?

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
Does that mean she'll
transfer to our school?

01:08:45.429 --> 01:08:46.730 position:38% line:89% align:start
I guess.

01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:48.665 position:16% line:89% align:start
Depending on the process,

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:50.867 position:16% line:83% align:start
the application could be
completed in the spring,

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:53.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
and she would be able to
attend school with you.

01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:55.639 position:13% line:89% align:start
You do all know each other.

01:08:55.772 --> 01:08:58.041 position:21% line:83% align:start
So is that what Leah
said she wants to do?

01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:01.144 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nuh-uh. We heard
all this from Sarah.

01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:03.714 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's right, she's worried
and thinks this may be Leah's

01:09:03.847 --> 01:09:05.983 position:19% line:89% align:start
best course of action.

01:09:06.116 --> 01:09:08.652 position:13% line:83% align:start
Though, to be fair, I think
she only called us because

01:09:08.785 --> 01:09:11.054 position:19% line:83% align:start
she wanted our opinion
as fellow graduates.

01:09:11.188 --> 01:09:12.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're really happy
that Sarah feels like

01:09:13.056 --> 01:09:16.693 position:13% line:83% align:start
she can confide in us, but
since it also involves Aqours,

01:09:16.827 --> 01:09:19.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
we wanted to talk
to you girls too.

01:09:19.629 --> 01:09:21.064 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's a tough call.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:23.166 position:27% line:89% align:start
Leah joining us?

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.403 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can already imagine it.

01:09:26.535 --> 01:09:27.471 position:27% line:89% align:start
[YOSHIKO groans]

01:09:27.603 --> 01:09:29.339 position:13% line:89% align:start
Jeez. You call that a step?

01:09:29.473 --> 01:09:33.576 position:16% line:83% align:start
This isn't a game! Get it
right or else... Yoshiko!

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't call me Yoshiko,
the name is Yohane!

01:09:36.612 --> 01:09:39.182 position:10% line:89% align:start
Who are you talkin' to, zura?

01:09:39.316 --> 01:09:40.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you think?

01:09:40.751 --> 01:09:43.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't particularly
mind or anything.

01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:44.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean, we've talked about this.

01:09:45.122 --> 01:09:48.792 position:7% line:83% align:start
Aqours' success isn't dependent
on how many members it has.

01:09:48.925 --> 01:09:50.460 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's true.

01:09:50.593 --> 01:09:53.230 position:13% line:83% align:start
Leah's a friend, and she's
competed in Love Live before.

01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:56.199 position:27% line:83% align:start
That being said,
it still makes me uneasy.

01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:58.435 position:16% line:83% align:start
Only 'cause you're afraid
that Leah might be able

01:09:58.567 --> 01:10:02.272 position:24% line:83% align:start
to contribute more
than you, zura.

01:10:02.406 --> 01:10:05.075 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right, so then.

01:10:05.208 --> 01:10:06.076 position:38% line:89% align:start
I oppose.

[CHIKA gasps]

It's just...

01:10:09.312 --> 01:10:11.882 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't think this is
what Leah really wants.

01:10:12.015 --> 01:10:13.950 position:16% line:89% align:start
She could join our group,

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:17.487 position:10% line:83% align:start
but that's not going to solve
any of her problems.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.389 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why do you feel that way?

01:10:19.523 --> 01:10:20.856 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUBY]
Because...

01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:23.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
After their last show,
Saint Snow dissolved.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.496 position:24% line:83% align:start
And then Leah tried
to start a new group.

01:10:26.629 --> 01:10:27.930 position:10% line:89% align:start
I feel she wants to preserve

01:10:28.065 --> 01:10:30.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
the memory of performing
with her sister.

01:10:30.766 --> 01:10:32.469 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why she did those things.

01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:36.373 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which is why... I don't think
she wants to join Aqours.

01:10:36.506 --> 01:10:37.706 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

01:10:39.376 --> 01:10:41.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RUBY] As someone who has
sung with her sister,

01:10:41.677 --> 01:10:45.082 position:24% line:83% align:start
I truly understand
how she feels.

My sis and the others
are not gone.

We may not sing on
the same stage anymore,

01:10:53.323 --> 01:10:55.724 position:16% line:89% align:start
but we're still together.

[CHIKA]
Together?

01:11:00.062 --> 01:11:02.332 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RUBY] I guess Leah just
hasn't had the chance

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:04.900 position:21% line:89% align:start
to realize that yet.

01:11:07.069 --> 01:11:09.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RUBY] She has to do
something to fill the void

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:11.974 position:16% line:83% align:start
left by Sarah's departure
from the group.

01:11:12.108 --> 01:11:16.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right now she's trying her
best to recreate Saint Snow.

01:11:16.745 --> 01:11:18.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it's only because
they didn't win.

01:11:18.647 --> 01:11:21.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
They lost Love Live,
despite all their hard work.

01:11:21.984 --> 01:11:25.688 position:19% line:83% align:start

she let Sarah down.

Thanks.

Huh?

No, it doesn't.

Yeah. We've got your back.

No matter what,
that'll never change.

It might be difficult,

her dream come true.

Wow, this is a surprise.

All nine of us.

the bus stop's no longer here.

01:26:40.098 --> 01:26:41.665 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RIKO]
Now that the school's closed,

there's not much
of a need for it.

This place feels so nostalgic.

yesterday that we were all here.

01:26:57.149 --> 01:27:00.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
[DIA] We took this path
every single day.

[KANAN]
It's strange,

01:27:02.421 --> 01:27:05.123 position:19% line:83% align:start

It's not that surprising,

01:27:11.929 --> 01:27:13.864 position:30% line:83% align:start
considering all
that happened here.

01:27:13.999 --> 01:27:16.268 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was always so busy
and full of life.

01:27:16.401 --> 01:27:19.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
What you mean to say is it
was noisy, isn't that right?

Well sure, says the noisiest

Whatever!

Last I checked you're not
exactly quiet either, Zuramaru!

01:27:27.145 --> 01:27:29.780 position:41% line:83% align:start

We had so much fun.

Hey. Why did we come here?

01:27:39.757 --> 01:27:42.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh. I just felt like it,
I suppose.

Don't worry.

01:28:03.714 --> 01:28:05.883 position:24% line:89% align:start
It won't disappear.

01:28:06.016 --> 01:28:09.321 position:30% line:83% align:start
Not Uranohoshi

01:28:09.454 --> 01:28:11.389 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or the playground.

01:28:11.523 --> 01:28:14.292 position:13% line:89% align:start
The library... The roof...

01:28:14.426 --> 01:28:15.693 position:30% line:89% align:start
The club room.

01:28:15.826 --> 01:28:18.530 position:19% line:83% align:start
Definitely not the sea
and sandy beaches.

01:28:18.662 --> 01:28:20.131 position:33% line:89% align:start
The bus stop.

[CHIKA]
Or Aqours.

01:28:37.214 --> 01:28:39.216 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's go home.

01:28:42.186 --> 01:28:44.889 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything we love,
that's special and dear to us--

01:28:45.022 --> 01:28:47.258 position:16% line:89% align:start
it's not going anywhere.

01:28:47.391 --> 01:28:51.061 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm positive.
It won't ever become zero.

01:28:51.195 --> 01:28:53.030 position:13% line:89% align:start
We'll carry it all with us,

01:28:53.164 --> 01:28:54.965 position:19% line:89% align:start
as a part of ourselves.

No matter where we go in life,

01:28:57.368 --> 01:29:01.238 position:19% line:83% align:start
the memories we've made
will always remain.

01:29:01.372 --> 01:29:04.275 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's why...

...when we start,
it's never from zero.

01:29:18.422 --> 01:29:21.626 position:10% line:83% align:start

forward, one step at a time.

01:29:21.792 --> 01:29:23.961 position:19% line:89% align:start
Always climbing higher.

That's true.

going backwards...

[YOSHIKO]
...we're not.

01:29:32.236 --> 01:29:36.140 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because our accomplishments
move us forward.

Everything will work out.

In my heart,
I truly believe that!

01:29:42.213 --> 01:29:46.217 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HANAMARU] There are days
when reality is harsh.

our dreams don't come true,

but that's okay!

01:29:56.493 --> 01:30:02.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
