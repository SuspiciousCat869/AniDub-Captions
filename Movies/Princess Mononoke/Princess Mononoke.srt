1
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:53,144
In the ancient times, the land
lay covered with deep forests,

2
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:59,405
where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:05,230
Back then, man and beast lived in harmony.

4
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:10,535
But, as time went by, most of
the great forests were destroyed.

5
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:15,295
Those that remains were guarded by gigantic beasts,

6
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,290
who owed their legends to the Great Forest Spirit.

7
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:23,541
for those of the days of gods and of demons.

8
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:50,652
PRINCESS MONONOKE

9
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,999
Yakul! Come on, boy!

10
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:08,615
Girls.

11
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:09,521
Ashitaka!

12
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:11,012
There is something strange going on.

13
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:12,182
You have to hurry.

14
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:14,538
The wise woman wants everybody
back to the village at once.

15
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:15,853
We just came from Ji-San.

16
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,669
Did he see something?

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,226
Yes, in the forest something is wrong.

18
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:19,223
The birds have all gone!

19
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,443
And the animals, too!

20
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:22,390
I'll go to the watchtower to check with Ji-San.

21
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,496
Now you three hurry back home and be quick about it.

22
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:25,304
All right!

23
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:26,341
Be careful!

24
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:03,664
Something's there.

25
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,145
Ji-San, did you see it too?

26
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,934
I did. It isn't human.

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,550
The wise woman's calling everyone back to the village.

28
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:20,338
There, look!

29
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:51,799
It's some kind of demon!

30
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,471
A demon?

31
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:14,862
Run, Yakul, run!

32
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,410
It's headed for the village. I must stop it.

33
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,731
Prince Ashitaka, wait!

34
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,553
Be careful, the thing is cursed! Don't let it touch you!

35
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:49,942
Here, Yakul!

36
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:16,116
Calm your fury, oh mighty Lord!

37
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:20,519
Whatever you may be, god or
demon, please, leave us in peace!

38
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:38,198
A monster!

39
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:38,731
Come on!

40
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,032
Go back!

41
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,212
Please leave our village alone!

42
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,353
Stop, please, stop!

43
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:51,648
Get on!

44
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:54,425
Kaya!

45
00:05:58,462 --> 00:05:58,984
Run!

46
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:00,842
Come on, hurry!

47
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:48,691
He killed it!

48
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:49,944
Ashitaka!

49
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,174
Fetch the wise woman!

50
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,711
Don't put out the fire yet!

51
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,169
Ashitaka!

52
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:58,789
Are you alright?

53
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:01,027
Kaya, don't touch it! This wound is evil.

54
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:02,178
The prince has been hurt.

55
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,400
Where is the wise woman?

56
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,284
There she comes.

57
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,273
You must keep away from him! All of you.

58
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:07,451
Everyone stay back!

59
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:08,572
What shall we do?

60
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:10,896
Take this and pour it over his wound, child.

61
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,616
Slowly.

62
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,921
Nameless god of rage and hate,

63
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,241
I bow before you.

64
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:38,076
A mound will be raised and funeral rites
performed on this ground where you have fallen.

65
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,434
Pass on in peace and bear us no hatred.

66
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:44,616
Disgusting little creatures,

67
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,531
soon all of you will feel my hate

68
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:52,492
and suffer as I have suffered.

69
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:32,622
I'm afraid this is very bad.

70
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:37,081
The stones tell me the Boar-God came from far to the west.

71
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:41,241
He had some kind of a poison inside him, driving him mad.

72
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:45,364
A poisonous hatred that consumed his heart and flesh

73
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,507
and turned him into a demon-monster.

74
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,354
Prince Ashitaka.

75
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:51,112
Yes?

76
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:53,884
Show everyone your right arm.

77
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:03,670
What's it mean?

78
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:05,944
My Prince,

79
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:09,860
are you prepared to learn what fate
the stones have foretold you?

80
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,597
Yes. I was prepared the moment I let my arrow fly.

81
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:20,117
The infection will spread throughout
your whole body, bone and flesh alike.

82
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:22,193
It will cause you great pain, then kill you.

83
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,935
Is there no way we can stop it?

84
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:30,417
Prince got that wound by defending our village
and saving our lives!

85
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,330
Do we just sit and watch him die?

86
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,936
You cannot alter your fate, my Prince.

87
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:40,207
However, you can rise to meet it, If you choose.

88
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,609
Look at this.

89
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,312
This iron ball was found in the boar's body.

90
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:48,626
This is what hurt him so.

91
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:53,040
It shattered his bones and burned its way deep inside him.

92
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:56,604
This is what turned him into a demon.

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,369
There is evil at work in the land to
the west, Prince Ashitaka.

94
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,255
It's your fate to go there and
see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.

95
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:10,812
You may find a way to lift the curse, you understand?

96
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:11,640
Yes.

97
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:15,953
We are the last of the Emishi.

98
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:19,882
It's five hundred years since
the Emperor destroyed our tribe

99
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:23,500
and drove the remnants of our people to the east.

100
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,142
Some managed to survive here for all these years.

101
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:31,994
But the blood of our tribe has grown
weaker and thinner with each generation.

102
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:37,548
Now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us, never to return.

103
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:41,472
Sometimes I think the gods are laughing at us.

104
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:57,996
Our laws forbid us from watching you go, Ashitaka.

105
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:02,071
Whatever comes to pass now, you are dead to us forever.

106
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:05,295
Farewell.

107
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,523
Ashitaka.

108
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,963
Kaya, what are you doing here? You know it's forbidden.

109
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:36,867
Do you think I care about that?

110
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:39,715
I came to give you this so you won't
forget your little sister.

111
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,614
Your crystal dagger?

112
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:46,901
Kaya, I can't take this.

113
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,161
Please keep it with you, brother, to protect you.

114
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:51,909
You must take it. I want you to have it.

115
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:54,225
So you won't forget.

116
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,983
Kaya, you know I could never forget you.

117
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:27,792
A battle?

118
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:32,393
No. A massacre.

119
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:34,921
Where are you going? Come on.

120
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:35,907
Get you, coward!

121
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,492
They're unarmed! Move in!

122
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:41,277
Look, up there on the hill!

123
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,122
It's a warrior!

124
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:44,930
Good! His head is mine.

125
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:56,617
You, stop!

126
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:06,853
My arm! What's happening to me?

127
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:07,547
Stop him!

128
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:10,327
Hurry! Stop him before he gets away!

129
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,130
Let me pass! I'm warning you!

130
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:28,523
A demon?

131
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,104
The mark's getting bigger.

132
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,039
Well, look over there.

133
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,659
Who's there?

134
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,186
I've never seen him before.

135
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,081
Are you selling soup or donkey piss?

136
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,319
There he is now.

137
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:11,801
Will this be enough?

138
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,210
Hey there. What are you trying to pull? This isn't money.

139
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:17,299
Give me back my rice, you little thief!

140
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,882
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?

141
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:20,715
Go ahead.

142
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:23,609
My God!

143
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,960
But this is a lump of pure gold, you silly woman!

144
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:31,512
However, if it's money you want, I'll pay for
the rice and take this nugget off your hands.

145
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:32,187
What do you say?

146
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,085
My good people.

147
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,897
Is there a money changer who
could tell us how much this is worth?

148
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:38,265
No? All right.

149
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:42,421
Now, I'm just a monk, but I'd
say three bags of rice at least.

150
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,319
That's right. Maybe even more.

151
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,242
Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going?

152
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:48,118
Where are you going? Give me my gold!

153
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,850
Hey!

154
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,978
What's your hurry? You can't just rush off now.

155
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:51,901
If only just mess.

156
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,776
We have got your rice and everything is fine.

157
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,651
You are a man of few words. I understand.

158
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,008
Well. Don't you even think of thanking me.

159
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,256
It was my pleasure.

160
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,599
In fact, I should be thanking you. Really.

161
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:05,596
You see, I was caught in that battle.

162
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:08,050
I saw what you did to that
samurai. You fight like a demon.

163
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,388
Where did you learn to fight like that?

164
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:12,745
I see you noticed we're being followed.

165
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,145
That's what we get for waving that gold nugget around.

166
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:18,395
They'll wait till we're asleep
and then they'll slit our throats.

167
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:22,794
What do you say we give them a long
demonstration of how fast we can run, huh?

168
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:37,278
So, the demon-monster turned out to be a giant boar.

169
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,709
I followed its trail westward through the mountains

170
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:42,606
to where the samurai were attacking
those villagers, but then...

171
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:45,301
You lost it. That's life. See this place here?

172
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:50,083
When I came here last, a few years
back, this was a lovely little village.

173
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:54,274
But then there must have been a flood
or a landslide, or a fire.

174
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,838
The only sure thing is that everybody is dead.

175
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,080
These days, there are angry ghosts all around us.

176
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:06,322
Dead from wars, sickness, starvation, and nobody cares.

177
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,973
So you say you're under a curse, so what?

178
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,298
So's the whole damn world.

179
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:20,602
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

180
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:23,811
Samurai thugs. You win some, you lose some.

181
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:25,170
Here, hand me your bowl.

182
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:28,649
My point is, everybody dies, boy. Some now, some later.

183
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,523
From brothel girl to emperor.

184
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:36,210
I've heard them say that the Emperor
has promised an entire hill of gold

185
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:38,174
to anyone who can help him live forever.

186
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:41,295
Beautiful bowl. I've seen one other like it.

187
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,728
Have you ever heard of the Emishi people?

188
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:45,617
They were said to ride red elks.

189
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:47,977
They also used stone arrowheads, just like you.

190
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,628
Of course they were wiped out five hundred years ago.

191
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,346
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone where are you from.

192
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,331
Anyway, I've got much bigger fish to fry.

193
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,598
Have you ever come across anything like this before?

194
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:10,966
Never have.

195
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,659
It came from the giant boar. It was inside him.

196
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,606
I'm sure it was that little ball of iron that killed him.

197
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:29,516
There's a place high in the
mountains far to the west of here.

198
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:31,395
It's where the Spirit of The Forest dwells,

199
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,815
and it's a dangerous place for humans.

200
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,537
To enter there is certain death.

201
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,943
The Spirit of The Forest?

202
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,702
I've been told that the beasts there are all
giants, just as they were at the dawn of time.

203
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:17,773
See you there, my friend.

204
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,793
Come on.

205
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:39,817
Moving.

206
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:46,554
March them on.

207
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:48,996
Give him a pushing.

208
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:54,024
The sooner we get this rice home,
the sooner we eat. Let's move!

209
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,766
Coming this way! Wolves!

210
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,148
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay
calm! Take up your positions.

211
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,482
Keep your powder dry.

212
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,892
Make sure you wait for them to come within range.

213
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,871
Ready? And fire!

214
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:42,270
Second round, fire!

215
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:42,897
Fire.

216
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,365
That was it? They weren't so big.

217
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:54,859
They're just pups. Wait till you see their mother.

218
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:02,778
It's Moro!

219
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,441
Come on.

220
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:25,707
We killed her!

221
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:29,294
You forget she is a god. It will take more than that.

222
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,150
She certainly did some damage.

223
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,390
We move out now.

224
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,727
What about the men she pushed over the cliff?

225
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,585
They're dead. Let's get the living home.

226
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:05,407
Still breathing.

227
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,065
Hang on!

228
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,649
My name is Ashitaka!

229
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,982
I've traveled far from lands to the east.

230
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:18,511
Are you ancient gods? And have I come at last to
the realm of the Spirit of The Forest?

231
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:35,628
Go away!

232
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:45,216
Help!

233
00:23:55,837 --> 00:23:56,668
A Kodama!

234
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:58,646
I never thought I'd see one of them here.

235
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:03,809
Easy, there. You don't want to make
your injuries worse, do you?

236
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,747
He's a tree spirit. He brings good luck.

237
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:12,674
It's a sign this forest is healthy.

238
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:14,994
But they'll lead their lord and master right to us!

239
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,592
Who do you mean? Those wolves I just saw?

240
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,015
No, I mean a real monster, like a huge enormous deer...

241
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:23,617
It's said it has human face
sometime. And at night they say...

242
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:25,186
Where did it go?

243
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,908
Look! Reinforcements were doomed.

244
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:34,674
If Yakul is not afraid, we
have nothing to worry about here.

245
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:39,693
Would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest? Little one.

246
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:54,432
Sir, I really think we should turn around now.

247
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:57,626
I wonder did I mention that no human
has ever made it through the woods alive?

248
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:59,533
There's a lovely trail back across the river.

249
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:01,783
The current is too swift for us to get across

250
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:03,762
and your friend's injuries are very bad.

251
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,001
If we don't get him back soon, he doesn't stand a chance.

252
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:14,860
Hey! Little fellow, are you showing
us the way or getting us more lost?

253
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:33,059
Please, sir. I'm pretty sure
they're not trying to help us get home.

254
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,258
My God, there's thousands of them!

255
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:58,418
Look at that, it must be their mother. A fine old tree.

256
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:14,491
This place is magical.

257
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:42,061
The tracks of those wolves and the girl with them!

258
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,826
This place must be where the four of them live.

259
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,320
Sir, I think maybe we took a wrong turn somewhere.

260
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,551
This is a place for gods and demons!

261
00:26:49,662 --> 00:26:51,753
I think we're safe. We'll rest a bit.

262
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:04,939
More tracks?

263
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,299
Whatever made these made them recently.

264
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:10,901
Sir! What's going on? Are you all right?

265
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:45,897
Sir, what just happened there?

266
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:47,936
You went white as a sheet all of a sudden.

267
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:50,071
I warned you about this place.

268
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,447
Did you see anything just then?

269
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,082
Like what?

270
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:53,891
Forget it.

271
00:28:55,878 --> 00:28:58,499
Hang on just a little longer. You're almost home.

272
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,135
I failed her.

273
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:04,905
It's gone.

274
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:08,106
Whatever it was.

275
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:14,049
That's strange. Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.

276
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:17,226
My arm! It doesn't hurt!

277
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:20,222
It's healed.

278
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:21,968
No! It's still broken.

279
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:31,700
Sir, you were right! We made
it back home, just like you said.

280
00:30:04,025 --> 00:30:05,160
It's a fortress!

281
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:07,059
It's Lady Eboshi's Iron Town.

282
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,011
We make iron here from the ore in the sand.

283
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,994
Hey, there! Hello! It's me!

284
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:14,082
Look there.

285
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:17,641
Someone's come out of the woods!

286
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:18,968
Is it the wolf-girl?

287
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:22,644
Look! It's me, Kohroku, the ox driver!

288
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:25,491
It's Kohroku. He is alive!

289
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:26,866
Kohroku is alive!

290
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:30,042
It's true. Kohroku is still alive.

291
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:36,381
Quiet! Stop that noise! I'm trying to
tally these accounts, so shut up!

292
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:38,740
Haven't you heard? Kohroku has come back from the dead!

293
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:40,107
What?

294
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:53,951
This is unbelievable!

295
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,427
Where are the others? Kohroku.

296
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:57,047
Yes. It's my son was with you.

297
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:59,629
I'm afraid we're the only ones who made it.

298
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:04,533
It's never the gods that die.

299
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:05,971
Stand aside.

300
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:10,087
That man in the weird costume, sir,
who do you think he could be?

301
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,904
He's obviously an outsider.

302
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,724
Be careful with there.

303
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:16,437
Listen to me! This stranger saved our lives!

304
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:18,348
He carried the rifleman all the way back here.

305
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:19,845
You should be grateful to him!

306
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:22,631
Hey, watch the arm!

307
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:28,496
Hold it right there!

308
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:43,892
I'm very grateful to you for bringing
these men back to us, stranger.

309
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,739
But something doesn't smell right.

310
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:49,772
You got back here almost as fast as we
did, and through the Forbidden Forest!

311
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:52,462
On top of that, you did it with two badly injured men

312
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,439
and you want me to believe that you...

313
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,457
Kohroku! You're alive!

314
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:57,973
Toki, my love!

315
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:01,987
That's just great.

316
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,982
How are you gonna drive the ox
now, all banged up and mangled?

317
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:05,888
But, my little flower...

318
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:07,731
You scared me half to death!

319
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:11,116
Don't you "little flower" me!
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

320
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,390
Then maybe I could have found a real husband!

321
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:15,201
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?

322
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,033
Toki, save your sweet nothings for some other time!

323
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:22,502
As for you, Gonza, a fine captain of the guard you are,

324
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:25,663
always strutting and throwing your
weight around once the danger is over!

325
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:27,689
You never do a lick of work around here.

326
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,309
That's unfair and untrue.

327
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,812
Thanks, stranger.

328
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:33,639
My husband is an idiot but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

329
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:34,736
That's a relief.

330
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,504
I was starting to think I'd done
something wrong by bringing him back home.

331
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:45,478
Say, why don't you take the mask off,
I bet you're really handsome.

332
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:46,756
<i>Gonza!</i>

333
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:51,666
Bring the stranger to me later.
I would like to thank him personally.

334
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:53,303
Kohroku.

335
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:54,893
Yes?

336
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:57,532
I'm happy you're back and I apologize.

337
00:32:58,303 --> 00:32:58,834
Okay.

338
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:01,599
Milady, you really shouldn't tell him things like that.

339
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:03,657
If you're too nice, he will walk all over you.

340
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:05,489
I hope you'll forgive me too, Toki.

341
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:08,284
I was responsible, I should never have let it happen.

342
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:10,979
That's all right, Milady, if you hadn't been there

343
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:14,517
the wolves would have eaten everyone
and we'd have to find ourselves a new husbands.

344
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:19,497
Get some rest, traveler. I will see you this evening.

345
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,488
You're not handsome, you're gorgeous!

346
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:57,805
There! You know they have to fight
off wolves to get this rice through.

347
00:33:57,832 --> 00:33:59,229
Just dish it out!

348
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:01,701
Is he there?

349
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:02,328
There he is!

350
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:02,803
Where he is?

351
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:03,930
Over there, it's him.

352
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,630
Toki was right, he is handsome!

353
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:07,871
Yeah, not bad.

354
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,061
But he's so young!

355
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:10,792
That never stopped you before!

356
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:14,558
Quiet out there! We lost some good men today!

357
00:34:14,582 --> 00:34:17,108
Yeah. There's lots of gorgeous men in here, honey!

358
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:19,029
I've seen cattle that looked better.

359
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:22,008
Listen, stranger, why don't you come over to our place?

360
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,233
You don't want to stay in this stinky old barn.

361
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:28,048
Walk woman. We risked our lives to bring
you the rice you're all eating tonight.

362
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:29,225
So, watch your mouth.

363
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:32,171
And who made the iron that
paid for the rice? Tell me that.

364
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,976
Yeah, we're pumping those
bellows while you pigs are in bed.

365
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,653
Actually, if it's not too much trouble, ladies,
I would like to see where you work.

366
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:39,777
You would?

367
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,509
We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

368
00:34:41,524 --> 00:34:42,800
And wash your head.

369
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:47,653
Don't be a stranger! Don't forget
now, we'll be waiting for you!

370
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:51,015
It's best not to pay them any mind, you know.

371
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:55,272
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten,
that's why they're like that.

372
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:58,150
Well they say that happy women make a happy village.

373
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:01,419
Happy? These kind of women, working here?

374
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:04,856
Women like that, it's a disgrace! They defile the iron.

375
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:09,229
The Lady Eboshi goes around buying the
contract of every brothel girl she can find.

376
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:11,436
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.

377
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:13,458
And you got rice on your chin, old man.

378
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,337
That's true! Everything here has turned
upside down since she showed up.

379
00:35:17,353 --> 00:35:20,343
That's right. She's not even
afraid of the gods, that woman.

380
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:22,807
Why, you should have seen the way she dealt with Nago.

381
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,650
Am I right?

382
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:24,444
Who's Nago?

383
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,717
Who's Nago? The gigantic boar-god.
He used to rule this whole forest.

384
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,331
We couldn't even get near the mountains with him around.

385
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:35,761
Nothing to do but sit around our backsides
for months, staring at a bunch of angry boars.

386
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:39,268
See, the iron in the sand under this
town had all been dug out.

387
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:41,611
So the we tried to get at the iron under the mountain

388
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:43,706
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

389
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:47,981
The problem was before we could dig for
the iron, we had to clear away the forest.

390
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:50,337
And that's what made the boar angry.

391
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,279
He's feeling no pain!

392
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:14,722
Then one day, Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and their rifles.

393
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:43,580
Young man, what's wrong?

394
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:48,442
Is something hurting your arm?

395
00:36:49,385 --> 00:36:51,764
No. I was just thinking about the boar-god.

396
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:55,470
I was thinking how he must have died filled with hate.

397
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,561
Forgive me for keeping you waiting, stranger.

398
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:06,104
That's good iron.

399
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:09,274
We were running behind with tomorrow's shipment.

400
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,992
Let's have a rest. You may tell the others.

401
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:15,714
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:19,926
Some think you're a spy for the wolf-girl
or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

403
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,883
There are a lot of people out
there with their eyes on this iron.

404
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:26,575
Why are you here, if you don't mind my asking?

405
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:34,537
I believe you'll recognize this.

406
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:37,484
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,

407
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:40,630
rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.

408
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,410
I fought with him, and for that I was
cursed with this mark on my arm.

409
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,138
And soon, it will kill me.

410
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,919
Where is it you come from?

411
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:50,300
I've never seen a red elk glide like that before.

412
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:54,361
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

413
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:58,356
Answer Milady's question or I'll cut you in half!

414
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:01,678
What do you plan to do? What exactly are you here for?

415
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,601
To see with eyes unclouded by hate.

416
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:07,554
Eyes unclouded?

417
00:38:13,163 --> 00:38:16,557
That explains it. Come, I'll show you all my secrets.

418
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,210
Is that wise, Milady?

419
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:19,751
Gonza, take over for me.

420
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:24,021
This is my garden. None of the
townspeople dare to come here.

421
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:26,901
Follow me if you wish to learn my secret.

422
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,254
Good evening.

423
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:47,229
We've only just finished it, Milady.

424
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:49,476
It's still too heavy.

425
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,067
Perhaps if you didn't hold it so delicately?

426
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,449
Milady, if we make them any lighter, they'll fall apart.

427
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:57,373
I trust you to figure that.

428
00:39:57,493 --> 00:39:59,614
They're not for me, they're for the other women here.

429
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,332
That will be something to see!

430
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:05,914
This is the latest rifle that
I've asked these people to design.

431
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:08,515
The ones we brought here turned out to be too heavy.

432
00:40:09,094 --> 00:40:12,858
These will kill forest monsters and
pierce the thickest samurai armor.

433
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,401
You'd better watch out there, young man.

434
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:17,403
The Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world!

435
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:20,881
I'm sorry to have to push you all so
hard. I'll have wine sent down later.

436
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:22,995
That would be nice!

437
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:27,817
First you steal the boar's forest from
him, then transform him into a demon.

438
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:32,196
Now you're making even deadlier weapons. How
much for hate and pain do you think we need?

439
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,463
Yes. I'm the one who shot the boar.

440
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,508
I'm sorry that you suffer. I truly am.

441
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,871
That brainless pig! I'm the one he
should have put a curse on, not you!

442
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,491
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

443
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:05,208
If it would lift the curse, I'd let it tear you apart.

444
00:41:05,954 --> 00:41:08,083
But even that wouldn't end the killing now, would it?

445
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:11,269
No, it wouldn't. You would have
to kill all of us to be at peace.

446
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,860
Milady, Osa has something to say.

447
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:22,328
Forgive me, Milady, but you must not
make light of the boy's strength.

448
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:29,405
Young man, like you, I know what rage
feels like, and grief, and helplessness.

449
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:33,633
But you must not take your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

450
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:39,296
She's the only one who saw us as human beings.

451
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,966
We are lepers. The world hates and fears us,

452
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:49,098
but she, she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us...

453
00:41:51,284 --> 00:41:51,609
Osa.

454
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:57,365
Life is suffering. It is hard. The world is cursed.

455
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,170
But still, you find reasons to keep living.

456
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,101
I'm sorry. I'm making no sense.

457
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,161
They just keep coming back.

458
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,950
Every night they're out there planting trees.

459
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:30,693
Trying to turn the mountain into a forest again.

460
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:34,235
Stay here. Help me kill the Forest Spirit., Ashitaka.

461
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:37,635
You would do that? Kill the very heart of the forest?

462
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:39,219
Without that ancient god,

463
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:41,799
the animals here would be
nothing but dumb beasts once more.

464
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:44,827
When the forest has been cleared and the wolves wiped out,

465
00:42:44,843 --> 00:42:47,647
this desolate place will be the richest land in the world.

466
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,126
And Princess Mononoke will become human.

467
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:52,168
Princess Mononoke?

468
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:55,562
Princess of the spirits of
ghouls, beasts and ancient gods.

469
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:58,491
The wolves stole her soul and now she lives to kill me.

470
00:43:03,395 --> 00:43:07,081
The legends say the blood of the
Great Forest Spirit. can heal anything.

471
00:43:07,692 --> 00:43:10,163
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers.

472
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:12,746
It might even be able to lift your curse, Ashitaka.

473
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:14,033
Milady?

474
00:43:15,457 --> 00:43:17,435
How does the action feel to you, better?

475
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:20,467
Smooth as silk. The perfect thing for ruling the world.

476
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,955
But still too heavy for the girls.

477
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,153
All right.

478
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:53,825
Well, look who's here.

479
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:56,202
Evening. All right if I work the bellows for a while?

480
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:58,084
Well, I guess so.

481
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:01,914
Excuse me. May I try it?

482
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:05,450
It's okay. Might as well let him try.

483
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,377
When you get tired, I'll take over for you.

484
00:44:20,486 --> 00:44:21,924
Well, that won't be long.

485
00:44:22,654 --> 00:44:24,985
Whops, you'd better keep that come and shut tight, girl.

486
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:29,102
I'm impressed. But you'll never keep that pace up.

487
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,034
It's hard work, isn't it?

488
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,076
You bet. And our shifts are four days long.

489
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:36,921
You must lead hard lives here.

490
00:44:36,937 --> 00:44:41,235
I suppose, yeah. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city, huh?

491
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:45,025
Yeah, here we get to eat as much as
we want, and the men don't bother us.

492
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,669
Unless we want them to.

493
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,751
No! But You can't leave tomorrow!

494
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:34,805
Couldn't you stay a little longer?

495
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,297
You can stay and work here!

496
00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:39,993
Thank you all, but there's someone
I have to find out there in the forest.

497
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:46,880
She's here.

498
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:55,628
The wolves are coming! It's the wolf-princess!

499
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:30,127
Hurry!

500
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:35,384
Stop!

501
00:46:36,638 --> 00:46:38,639
Wait! I don't want to fight you. I'm a friend!

502
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:41,675
Here. She's over here!

503
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:43,387
She is on the roof.

504
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:45,483
Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

505
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:57,828
Keep stoking those fires!

506
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:00,647
Riflemen to the stockade!
We've got her right where we want her.

507
00:47:00,786 --> 00:47:04,032
A weapon for every man! Everyone defends Iron Town!

508
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,922
Toki, she's on the roof!

509
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,830
Now don't get excited. Keep those bellows working.

510
00:47:08,985 --> 00:47:11,586
Whatever happens, we can't let those fires go out.

511
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:12,856
Is she alone?

512
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:13,683
Yes.

513
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:15,535
She can't escape, we have her cornered.

514
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,974
We know she means to kill you this time.

515
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:20,080
We'll see about that. Come on!

516
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,204
Make room for the lady.

517
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:33,724
Can you hear me, princess of beasts?
If it's me you want, here I am.

518
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:37,289
If you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed,

519
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:40,346
well, there are two women down here I'd like you to meet.

520
00:47:40,362 --> 00:47:43,732
They want revenge as well,
for husbands killed by your wolves.

521
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:47,194
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband is dead because of you.

522
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,643
There she is.

523
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:01,648
Everybody out of the way!

524
00:48:01,953 --> 00:48:03,663
Riflemen, get ready to fire!

525
00:48:11,528 --> 00:48:13,523
It's a trap. No, wait!

526
00:48:14,414 --> 00:48:18,335
Princess of the wolf-gods, don't go
down there! Go back to the forest!

527
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:25,400
Listen to me, please, don't throw your life away!

528
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:26,710
Shall I stop him?

529
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:28,894
Leave him be. Let him do as he likes.

530
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,692
She's down! We got her!

531
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:53,462
Stay back.

532
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:57,238
Cut off a wolf's head and he still has the power to bite.

533
00:48:57,753 --> 00:48:58,301
What?

534
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,542
Take aim where she falls.

535
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:01,170
Right.

536
00:49:19,701 --> 00:49:20,575
Open fire!

537
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:31,742
No! Stay back!

538
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:36,522
What the devil was that?

539
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:40,963
Wake up!

540
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:47,684
No!

541
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:07,797
Skin her!

542
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:08,996
Kill her! Milady!

543
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:17,355
Are you all right sir? Can I help you?

544
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:18,458
Fine. I'm fine.

545
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:28,926
Get away from me! Be gone!

546
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:29,616
Yes, Sir.

547
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:35,990
Traitor!

548
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:38,831
You're a spy for the wolves, aren't you?

549
00:50:41,027 --> 00:50:42,028
Stay back!

550
00:50:46,231 --> 00:50:47,019
Step aside.

551
00:51:04,954 --> 00:51:06,623
What do you think you're doing, boy?

552
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,788
Stay your hand, the girl's life is now mine.

553
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:12,903
I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife for you.

554
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:16,484
There is a demon inside of you. It's inside both of you.

555
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:24,337
Look, everyone! This is what hatred looks like.

556
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:26,466
This is what it does when it catches hold of you.

557
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:30,048
It's eating me alive. And very soon now, it will kill me.

558
00:51:30,471 --> 00:51:32,789
Fear and anger only make it grow faster.

559
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,912
I'm getting a little bored of
this curse of yours, Ashitaka.

560
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,757
Let me just cut the damn thing off!

561
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,134
Milady Eboshi.

562
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,684
Someone come here and take her from me.

563
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:51,693
Milady!

564
00:51:54,763 --> 00:51:57,049
Don't worry, she's just stunned. She'll be all right.

565
00:52:02,326 --> 00:52:04,850
As for me, I'm leaving. And I'm taking the wolf-girl.

566
00:52:05,315 --> 00:52:08,876
No, you're not! Nobody treats Lady Eboshi like that.

567
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,349
Move and I fire!

568
00:52:25,037 --> 00:52:26,104
Kiyo, what are you doing?

569
00:52:32,331 --> 00:52:33,773
How can he still be walking?

570
00:52:40,278 --> 00:52:41,232
Is she all right?

571
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:42,575
Yes, Milady is safe, sir.

572
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:47,101
Someone bring me my gun! Riflemen
to the square, now, on the double!

573
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,996
Then they're not getting out of here alive.

574
00:52:50,332 --> 00:52:51,382
Toki, come here!

575
00:52:57,402 --> 00:52:58,119
What's happened?

576
00:53:13,397 --> 00:53:15,154
Sir, I can't let you pass.

577
00:53:15,905 --> 00:53:18,234
The gate's been ordered shut. It can't be opened!

578
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,949
Turn back, please!

579
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:25,845
We're grateful to you for bringing those men back to us.

580
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,261
We don't want to hurt you.

581
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:28,007
Please!

582
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:30,056
I walked in through this gate this morning.

583
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:32,042
Now I'm going to leave the same way.

584
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:36,836
Don't be a fool. It takes ten men to open this gate.

585
00:53:45,157 --> 00:53:46,722
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.

586
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:57,543
It's opening.

587
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:05,739
Out of the way!

588
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,291
The wolves are attacking!

589
00:54:12,158 --> 00:54:12,824
Flint!

590
00:54:13,022 --> 00:54:15,630
She's all right. Your princess is safe with me.

591
00:54:18,418 --> 00:54:19,634
Stay and I will bring her.

592
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:20,587
Come on, Yakul.

593
00:54:26,194 --> 00:54:27,283
You have my thanks.

594
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:35,904
Good luck, stranger.

595
00:54:59,253 --> 00:54:59,959
Stop it!

596
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:03,461
Leave him, he's mine!

597
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:16,593
His own people shot him.

598
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:18,650
He's dying.

599
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:26,106
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive!

600
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:30,507
I did not want them to kill you, that's why.

601
00:55:30,835 --> 00:55:35,166
I'm not afraid to die. I do anything
to get your humans out of my forest.

602
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:38,336
I knew that from the very first moment I saw you.

603
00:55:38,674 --> 00:55:42,069
And I'm not afraid of you, I
should kill you for saving her.

604
00:55:45,645 --> 00:55:49,172
That woman is evil. And there is
no one can stop me from killing her.

605
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:49,770
No.

606
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:51,563
Live.

607
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,558
That's enough! I'm not listening to you anymore.

608
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:57,960
You're beautiful.

609
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,487
What is it, San? Want me to crunch his face off?

610
00:56:14,656 --> 00:56:15,657
The ape tribe.

611
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:19,029
All right, what do you want here?

612
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:24,803
Apes! How dare you show such disrespect to the wolf clan!

613
00:56:25,637 --> 00:56:27,799
This is our forest.

614
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,659
The human, give him to us.

615
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,000
Give us the human and go.

616
00:56:33,398 --> 00:56:36,068
You go, before my fangs find you.

617
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:37,760
We will not go.

618
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:40,363
We will eat the human.

619
00:56:40,627 --> 00:56:44,089
Yes, let us eat the man-creature.

620
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:48,657
Are you crazy? Just what happened
to make the ape tribe change this way?

621
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:50,994
Since when do apes eat the flesh of a man?

622
00:56:51,445 --> 00:56:55,068
If we eat the human we will steal his strength

623
00:56:55,124 --> 00:56:57,951
and we will drive the other humans away.

624
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,811
Give us the man-creature.

625
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:03,920
Stop this! You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

626
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:06,358
All that will do is make you into something else.

627
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:08,409
Something even worse than human.

628
00:57:08,811 --> 00:57:12,069
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.

629
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,438
The forest does not come back.

630
00:57:14,643 --> 00:57:18,299
If we kill the humans, we will save the forest.

631
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:20,497
You mustn't give up. He'll find a way.

632
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:22,287
the Forest Spirit. is with us.

633
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:25,029
Go on planting your trees and someday we'll beat them.

634
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:29,963
the Forest Spirit. will not fight. We will all die.

635
00:57:30,282 --> 00:57:33,251
Wolf-girl does not care. She is human.

636
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,773
Enough! I'll bite your head off, you chattering ape!

637
00:57:38,033 --> 00:57:40,252
Stop! Wait! Come back!

638
00:57:40,894 --> 00:57:42,339
Leave them alone.

639
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,526
Don't worry about them. It's all right.

640
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:56,713
You go on ahead now. I'll stay
here and deal with the human.

641
00:57:56,796 --> 00:57:58,025
What about the elk?

642
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:59,858
Yes.

643
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:01,758
Can we eat him?

644
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,771
No, you may not. Go home!

645
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:15,432
Come over here! Don't worry, I'm a friend.

646
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:19,555
Don't be shy, now. I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.

647
00:58:20,908 --> 00:58:21,431
Please.

648
01:00:14,941 --> 01:00:18,884
You are very wise. You know better
than to set foot on this island, don't you?

649
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:21,584
I smell like a human.

650
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,520
You can go wherever you want to. You're free now.

651
01:02:08,436 --> 01:02:09,124
Finally!

652
01:02:09,819 --> 01:02:11,753
There he is! Come and see. Hurry!

653
01:02:12,935 --> 01:02:14,771
Quick, you idiots! It's the Night Walker.

654
01:02:15,104 --> 01:02:18,729
He's the reason we've been sitting around
in these stinking animal skins, you know.

655
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:21,710
But sir, we can't. It's a sin to look at it.

656
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:24,491
And you call yourself the greatest hunter in the west!

657
01:02:24,643 --> 01:02:27,562
Look, we've got a letter of pardon from the Emperor.

658
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:30,600
Forgiving us for cutting off the
head of the Great Forest Spirit...

659
01:02:36,264 --> 01:02:38,942
The legends tell us that when day becomes night,

660
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,699
the Forest Spirit. turns into the Night Walker.

661
01:02:42,297 --> 01:02:44,145
And at sunrise, it changes back.

662
01:02:44,435 --> 01:02:46,672
Look! See there? It's happening.

663
01:04:09,749 --> 01:04:10,963
Take a look. Master Jigo.

664
01:04:11,104 --> 01:04:11,589
What is it?

665
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:14,099
Over there.

666
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,861
Look! There must be hundreds of them.

667
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:31,949
These boars are not from this region.

668
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:35,388
They must have been traveling for
months to get all the way up here.

669
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:44,614
That one is Okkoto!

670
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:47,511
It can't be! They say he died a hundred years ago.

671
01:04:47,714 --> 01:04:50,396
It's him all right! I know those old tusks!

672
01:04:50,571 --> 01:04:52,811
And it looks like he brought along his whole tribe.

673
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:58,263
He's seen us, let's get out of here.

674
01:05:11,264 --> 01:05:13,489
Come on, you cowards! Move, quickly!

675
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,117
The bullet wound is gone!

676
01:06:19,221 --> 01:06:19,869
Yakul!

677
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:28,578
The mark is still there.

678
01:06:43,888 --> 01:06:46,451
Finally, you're awake. You really should thank Yakul.

679
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:48,102
He hasn't left your side this whole time.

680
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,708
How do you know his name is Yakul?

681
01:06:52,538 --> 01:06:54,617
He told me. And he told me about you.

682
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,920
About your village, your people and your forest.

683
01:06:58,437 --> 01:07:01,829
the Forest Spirit. brought you back
to life again. He wants you to live.

684
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:07,598
I had the strangest dream. There was a golden creature.

685
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:08,724
Eat this.

686
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:15,504
Chew.

687
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:48,703
We're here to kill the humans and save the forest.

688
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,332
Why are there humans here, Moro?

689
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,677
Humans are everywhere these days.

690
01:08:53,998 --> 01:08:56,648
Go back to your own mountain. Kill them there.

691
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:59,523
The girl is San, my daughter.

692
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:03,169
We will kill them here! We will save this forest.

693
01:09:03,233 --> 01:09:06,071
What is that other human doing here?

694
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:09,383
He was shot. And then the Great Spirit healed his wound.

695
01:09:09,454 --> 01:09:11,083
This man is not our enemy.

696
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:13,473
the Forest Spirit. saved him?

697
01:09:14,172 --> 01:09:16,856
Saved the life of that loathsome runt?

698
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:19,075
Why didn't he save Nago?

699
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:23,101
Is he not the guardian of the forest? Why?

700
01:09:23,946 --> 01:09:27,825
the Forest Spirit. gives life and takes life away.

701
01:09:27,952 --> 01:09:32,097
Life and death are his alone.
Or have you boars forgotten that?

702
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:36,706
You lie! You must have begged
the Forest Spirit. to save his life.

703
01:09:36,888 --> 01:09:38,915
But you didn't beg for Nago, did you?

704
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,998
Nago was afraid to die.

705
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:45,422
Now I, too, carry within my
breast a poisoned human bullet.

706
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,472
Nago fled, and the darkness took him.

707
01:09:48,972 --> 01:09:51,681
I remain and contemplate my death.

708
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,755
Mother, please ask the Forest Spirit. to save you.

709
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,678
I have lived long enough, San.

710
01:09:57,355 --> 01:10:00,563
Soon the Forest Spirit. will let me rest forever.

711
01:10:00,775 --> 01:10:04,362
All these years you've defended
the Forest Spirit.. He must save you.

712
01:10:04,671 --> 01:10:08,794
You are not fooling us! Nago was beautiful and strong.

713
01:10:08,977 --> 01:10:10,757
He would not have run from anything!

714
01:10:11,099 --> 01:10:13,095
You wolves must have eaten him.

715
01:10:13,257 --> 01:10:13,910
Quiet!

716
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:16,286
Watch what you say, you filthy pig!

717
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:19,051
Gods of the mountain, please listen to me.

718
01:10:19,976 --> 01:10:23,187
Nago died far from here, and I was the one who killed him.

719
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,733
He had become some kind of demon.

720
01:10:25,876 --> 01:10:27,996
One day, he attacked our village.

721
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:32,209
If you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me.

722
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:41,845
I came here to beg the Forest
Spirit to lift Nago's curse from me.

723
01:10:42,886 --> 01:10:46,539
He healed the bullet wound in my
side, but the demon mark remains.

724
01:10:48,188 --> 01:10:51,759
First it will tear my soul
apart, and then it will kill me.

725
01:10:57,015 --> 01:11:00,948
Okkoto. Finally, a boar who will listen to reason.

726
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:07,384
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!

727
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:08,995
Please, you mustn't eat him.

728
01:11:12,275 --> 01:11:14,619
You are Moro's human child, aren't you?

729
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:16,202
I've heard of you.

730
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:18,478
You're blind!

731
01:11:18,561 --> 01:11:21,872
Stand back. I will not eat him.

732
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,564
It's all right, San.

733
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:27,856
Milord Okkoto, what I said
about Nago's death was the truth.

734
01:11:40,931 --> 01:11:44,187
I believe you, and I thank you for it, young one.

735
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:49,942
I'm only grieved and ashamed that
such a demon has come from our tribe.

736
01:11:52,727 --> 01:11:56,771
Oh mighty Lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

737
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:03,653
Leave this forest, or the next
time we meet, I'll have to kill you.

738
01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:08,361
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

739
01:12:08,849 --> 01:12:10,485
Look on my tribe, Moro.

740
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:13,950
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

741
01:12:14,814 --> 01:12:17,453
We will soon be nothing but squealing game

742
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:20,139
that the humans hunt for their meat.

743
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:22,917
You'd risk everything on one last battle?

744
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:25,375
That's just what the humans want.

745
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,354
I do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.

746
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:31,833
Even if every one of us dies,

747
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:35,319
it will be a battle the humans will never forget.

748
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:02,642
the Forest Spirit.!

749
01:13:19,109 --> 01:13:22,088
Come on. Keep your oxen together. Hurry!

750
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,857
Get ready now. A little bit closer...

751
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:28,897
Fire!

752
01:13:32,956 --> 01:13:34,963
My arm!

753
01:13:35,338 --> 01:13:36,697
Reload. Fire!

754
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:37,739
Attack!

755
01:13:43,906 --> 01:13:44,627
Ready?

756
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:55,276
Well, I see somebody is going
to have to go play the peacemaker.

757
01:13:55,578 --> 01:13:57,739
Take our riflemen and hide behind the cliffs.

758
01:13:58,035 --> 01:13:58,654
Yes sir.

759
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,100
Let's go.

760
01:14:01,512 --> 01:14:02,956
Stay there until I send for you.

761
01:14:05,196 --> 01:14:08,632
Come on. Let's keep the oxen moving.
We have to get back to Iron Town.

762
01:14:19,606 --> 01:14:21,892
There they are, coming around the pass!

763
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:28,314
The hunters are ready, sir.

764
01:14:28,345 --> 01:14:30,378
Excellent. Well done, my boy.

765
01:14:30,886 --> 01:14:33,968
Go and spread the word. We'll be moving out presently.

766
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:34,571
Yes, sir.

767
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:40,005
Greetings, Jigo.

768
01:14:40,221 --> 01:14:42,851
Well, I've got the Emperor breathing down my neck

769
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,457
and you're busy playing war with Lord Asano.

770
01:14:45,576 --> 01:14:49,063
And you would have nothing to do with
Lord Asano being here now, would you?

771
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:52,074
Of course not. Whatever made you think that?

772
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:54,856
He'll call a truce If I give him half my iron.

773
01:14:54,872 --> 01:14:57,342
Is that right? He's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

774
01:14:57,413 --> 01:14:59,821
But all the same, you might as well let him have his iron.

775
01:15:00,145 --> 01:15:03,761
Listen Eboshi, the boars are gathering for battle,
and you know what that means.

776
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,193
You made me a promise.

777
01:15:05,248 --> 01:15:07,442
Now once you get me the head of the Forest Spirit.,

778
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:10,205
then we can come back and destroy Lord Asano together.

779
01:15:10,608 --> 01:15:14,199
Watch out, Milady, there are some horsemen coming, get in!

780
01:15:19,295 --> 01:15:22,226
Well, speak of the devil. A messenger from Lord Asano.

781
01:15:22,377 --> 01:15:24,695
We have guests. Mind your manners, ladies.

782
01:15:24,742 --> 01:15:25,696
We will.

783
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:29,430
Welcome back, Milady!

784
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,373
Wait, won't you even talk to the man?

785
01:15:38,006 --> 01:15:40,825
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Iron Town.

786
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:43,852
I bring a message to you from my Lord Asano.

787
01:15:44,176 --> 01:15:46,179
You have fought valiantly and well.

788
01:15:46,765 --> 01:15:49,318
Now open your gates, that we may speak with you.

789
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:52,025
We can hear you just fine from down there!

790
01:15:52,126 --> 01:15:55,323
Milady took this mountain away from
the gods, the boars and the beasts!

791
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:57,826
And now that it's worth something, you want it!

792
01:15:57,881 --> 01:15:58,812
You won't get it!

793
01:15:58,828 --> 01:16:00,018
The brazen impudence!

794
01:16:00,034 --> 01:16:02,194
You ladies need to be taught some respect.

795
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:03,801
"Respect"? What's that?

796
01:16:03,832 --> 01:16:07,048
We haven't had any respect since the day we were born!

797
01:16:08,745 --> 01:16:10,848
You want some of our iron? Here you go!

798
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:21,716
They are really something!

799
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:25,108
They'll fight forest gods or
samurai, it doesn't matter to them.

800
01:16:25,478 --> 01:16:28,834
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

801
01:16:29,186 --> 01:16:30,980
We're not taking orders from any others.

802
01:16:30,996 --> 01:16:32,920
Impressive for a piece of paper.

803
01:16:33,142 --> 01:16:36,391
Well, you know it's gonna be all
the best hunters and trappers around.

804
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,504
Remember, my dear lady, we're
after a god, not just a beast.

805
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,101
Girls, come here.

806
01:16:41,184 --> 01:16:42,519
Yes, Milady, what is it?

807
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,602
Do you have any idea who this paper has come from?

808
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,601
From the Emperor himself.

809
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:48,754
That's nice. who's he?

810
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,153
Is she supposed to be important?

811
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:52,152
I'm serious. Who's he?

812
01:16:52,177 --> 01:16:52,893
Should we know?

813
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:54,782
Yes, they're really something.

814
01:16:56,661 --> 01:16:57,262
Thank you.

815
01:16:57,277 --> 01:16:58,112
Yes, Milady.

816
01:16:59,423 --> 01:17:01,753
Every day that we cut trees and dig for iron,

817
01:17:01,769 --> 01:17:03,760
the forest and its creatures grow weaker.

818
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,333
My way. There is no loss of life, Jigo.

819
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,996
Listen, you owe me and I've come to collect.

820
01:17:09,137 --> 01:17:10,880
When you needed riflemen, I sent them.

821
01:17:10,937 --> 01:17:13,413
And without those riflemen, you lose Iron Town.

822
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,268
I'm sorry, did that sound like a threat?

823
01:17:16,613 --> 01:17:18,787
Don't tell me the Emperor believes that wives' tale

824
01:17:18,937 --> 01:17:21,819
about the Great Spirit's head granting immortality.

825
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:24,512
I'm sure I don't know what the Emperor believes.

826
01:17:24,528 --> 01:17:27,537
I'm just a humble monk. I'm just trying to get by.

827
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:30,305
I keep my promises.

828
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:32,259
Anyway, we have fought the boars before.

829
01:17:32,275 --> 01:17:34,968
They are much easier to kill than Moro and her wolf cubs.

830
01:17:35,666 --> 01:17:39,753
So you can call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff, Jigo.

831
01:17:43,035 --> 01:17:46,101
So, I've been found out! Just one more thing, Milady.

832
01:17:46,604 --> 01:17:48,803
Did a stranger come through here, by any chance?

833
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:52,702
He's a young man riding a great big red elk.

834
01:17:53,358 --> 01:17:54,994
Came and went.

835
01:18:13,938 --> 01:18:16,075
A bad-looking bunch, if you ask me.

836
01:18:16,084 --> 01:18:19,323
Those men are no ordinary hunters. They're killers.

837
01:18:19,419 --> 01:18:20,251
Killers?

838
01:18:20,937 --> 01:18:23,019
Milady, at least let some of us go with you!

839
01:18:23,035 --> 01:18:24,528
You can't trust these men, they're strangers!

840
01:18:24,543 --> 01:18:25,069
That's right.

841
01:18:25,084 --> 01:18:27,982
What if something goes wrong and
we're stuck here? We can't help you!

842
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:30,550
You said yourself we're better shots than the men are.

843
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:33,632
That's precisely why I want you all here in Iron Town.

844
01:18:34,087 --> 01:18:37,317
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

845
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:41,243
Once the Forest Spirit. is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

846
01:18:41,529 --> 01:18:43,818
Will Jigo be satisfied with the creature's head

847
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:46,216
or will he be after my ironworks as well?

848
01:18:46,962 --> 01:18:49,100
Jigo's riflemen might turn on us.

849
01:18:49,116 --> 01:18:52,333
And if that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

850
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:54,599
Remember, you can't trust men.

851
01:18:55,686 --> 01:18:59,486
Don't worry about Her Ladyship.
I'll be right at her side, protecting her.

852
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:01,393
That's what we're afraid of.

853
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:01,996
What?

854
01:19:02,134 --> 01:19:04,307
Even if you were a woman, you'd still be an idiot.

855
01:19:09,371 --> 01:19:14,318
In the moonlight I felt your heart.

856
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:19,848
Quiver like a bowstring's pulse.

857
01:19:20,157 --> 01:19:26,141
In the moon's pale light you looked at me.

858
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:31,183
Nobody knows your heart.

859
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:36,626
When the sun has gone I see you.

860
01:19:38,303 --> 01:19:42,340
Beautiful and haunting, but cold.

861
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:49,065
Like a blade of knife, so shine, so sweet.

862
01:19:49,545 --> 01:19:54,227
Nobody knows your heart.

863
01:19:55,296 --> 01:20:00,358
All of your sorrow, grief and pain.

864
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:06,705
Locked away in the forests of the night.

865
01:20:06,872 --> 01:20:13,274
Your secret heart belongs to the world.

866
01:20:13,378 --> 01:20:15,049
And the things that cry in the dark.

867
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:17,231
You know, you could always jump, boy.

868
01:20:18,017 --> 01:20:18,918
End it all.

869
01:20:20,405 --> 01:20:22,485
As soon as your strength returns,

870
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:25,573
the mark will spread and destroy you.

871
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:28,935
It feels like I must have been asleep for weeks.

872
01:20:29,205 --> 01:20:32,510
I had a dream that San was by my side, nursing me.

873
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:35,782
I was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep.

874
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,064
Then I would have bitten your head off to silence you.

875
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,708
It's a beautiful forest.

876
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,466
Are Okkoto and the boars on the move yet?

877
01:20:43,808 --> 01:20:46,669
Yes, the boars are marching.

878
01:20:47,287 --> 01:20:51,007
The trees cry out as they die, but you cannot hear them.

879
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:55,367
I live here. I listen to the pain of the forest

880
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:57,671
and feel the ache of the bullet in my chest.

881
01:20:58,124 --> 01:21:00,691
And I dream of the day when I will finally

882
01:21:00,707 --> 01:21:03,287
crunch that gun-woman’s head in my jaws.

883
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,990
Moro, why can't the humans and the forest live together?

884
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:09,215
Why can't we stop this fighting now?

885
01:21:09,462 --> 01:21:12,093
The humans are gathering for the final battle.

886
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,762
The flames of their guns will burn us all.

887
01:21:14,852 --> 01:21:18,018
And what happens to San? What's
your plan, to let her die with you?

888
01:21:18,668 --> 01:21:22,737
Typical. Selfish. You think like a human.

889
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:25,790
San is my daughter. She is of the wolf tribe.

890
01:21:26,052 --> 01:21:28,554
When the forest dies, so does she.

891
01:21:28,785 --> 01:21:31,747
You must set her free! She's not a wolf, she's human.

892
01:21:31,884 --> 01:21:32,853
Silence, boy!

893
01:21:33,599 --> 01:21:35,831
How dare you speak to a god like that?

894
01:21:36,982 --> 01:21:39,891
I caught her human parents defiling my forest.

895
01:21:40,137 --> 01:21:42,837
They threw their baby at my feet as they ran away.

896
01:21:43,456 --> 01:21:46,366
Instead of eating her, I raised her as my own.

897
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:53,093
Now my poor, ugly, beautiful
daughter is neither human, nor wolf.

898
01:21:53,355 --> 01:21:54,763
How could you help her?

899
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:57,712
I don't know. But at least we might find a way to live.

900
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:05,482
How? Will you join forces with San and fight the humans?

901
01:22:05,506 --> 01:22:07,937
No. All that would do is cause more hatred.

902
01:22:08,976 --> 01:22:11,228
There is nothing you can do, boy.

903
01:22:11,244 --> 01:22:13,745
Soon the demon mark will spread and kill you.

904
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:15,896
Now leave this place at sunrise.

905
01:22:16,721 --> 01:22:19,141
Return and I shall kill you.

906
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:34,427
You're feeling all right?

907
01:22:36,853 --> 01:22:39,726
I'm fine, thanks to you and the Forest Spirit..

908
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:28,388
Right.

909
01:23:40,861 --> 01:23:42,657
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.

910
01:23:47,968 --> 01:23:50,340
I guess my legs are still pretty weak.

911
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:24,868
It's so quiet. I wonder where our
friends the little Kodama went.

912
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:34,410
I can smell the ironworks.

913
01:24:41,264 --> 01:24:42,776
Thanks for showing us the way!

914
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,603
I have another favor to ask.

915
01:24:46,888 --> 01:24:49,250
Will you please give this to San for me?

916
01:24:57,668 --> 01:24:58,846
Let's go.

917
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,780
It stinks! It burns my eyes.

918
01:25:33,024 --> 01:25:36,754
That's what they want.
They're trying to kill our sense of smell.

919
01:25:37,554 --> 01:25:39,050
It's that damn woman again.

920
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,894
She knows we're out here.

921
01:25:50,093 --> 01:25:52,669
It's a trap, and a stupid one.

922
01:25:52,767 --> 01:25:53,375
What?

923
01:25:53,863 --> 01:25:56,476
They're trying to lure the boars out of the forest.

924
01:25:58,098 --> 01:25:59,860
The humans are planning something.

925
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:02,733
Then we have to find Okkoto while
there's still time to stop him!

926
01:26:02,905 --> 01:26:04,240
Or else, they'll all be killed!

927
01:26:04,322 --> 01:26:06,888
Okkoto is too stubborn. He won't listen.

928
01:26:07,124 --> 01:26:09,951
None of them will. They may even know it's a trap.

929
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:13,857
The boars are a proud race. The last one left alive

930
01:26:13,906 --> 01:26:16,369
will still be charging blindly forward.

931
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:25,506
Why chop the trees down?

932
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,903
To make them angry, which makes them stupid.

933
01:26:30,277 --> 01:26:31,821
Mother, I have to go.

934
01:26:32,382 --> 01:26:36,793
Okkoto is blind, I must be his eyes. You understand?

935
01:26:37,746 --> 01:26:39,152
Do as you must.

936
01:26:40,214 --> 01:26:43,793
You know, that boy wanted to share his life with you.

937
01:26:44,019 --> 01:26:45,020
I hate him.

938
01:26:45,036 --> 01:26:46,320
I hate all humans.

939
01:26:58,098 --> 01:27:00,127
From Ashitaka? For me?

940
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:05,394
Pretty.

941
01:27:06,372 --> 01:27:07,745
You two, stay with San.

942
01:27:08,444 --> 01:27:10,604
I must go to the Forest Spirit..

943
01:27:11,318 --> 01:27:12,480
Right. Let's go.

944
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:35,069
The Moro tribe has come to fight with you.

945
01:27:35,258 --> 01:27:37,269
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?

946
01:27:39,925 --> 01:27:40,926
Good luck, my friend!

947
01:29:06,789 --> 01:29:07,891
It's coming from Iron Town.

948
01:29:13,933 --> 01:29:14,650
Let's go!

949
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:20,424
Halt! Who goes there?

950
01:29:20,612 --> 01:29:21,547
Samurai again!

951
01:29:23,552 --> 01:29:24,763
Halt, I said!

952
01:29:25,721 --> 01:29:26,654
Out of the way!

953
01:29:43,471 --> 01:29:45,170
What the devil was that thing?

954
01:29:49,335 --> 01:29:51,302
Don't waste your arrows. He's knocking them away.

955
01:29:51,381 --> 01:29:52,558
He is a dead man anyway.

956
01:29:52,607 --> 01:29:53,380
Cease fire.

957
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,599
Cease fire.

958
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,288
Toki, come and look!

959
01:30:19,631 --> 01:30:21,304
It can't be. It's Ashitakal.

960
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,487
So it's not a ghost.

961
01:30:22,806 --> 01:30:24,981
Ashitaka!

962
01:30:24,996 --> 01:30:25,718
Toki!

963
01:30:25,943 --> 01:30:26,943
Are you all right?

964
01:30:27,591 --> 01:30:28,652
We're all right.

965
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:33,461
Lord Asano and his samurai thought they'd
try and ambush us while our men were away.

966
01:30:33,556 --> 01:30:35,018
Thought we'd just roll over.

967
01:30:35,034 --> 01:30:36,987
We show them here did.

968
01:30:37,186 --> 01:30:38,463
Where's Lady Eboshi?

969
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:42,047
She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the Forest Spirit...

970
01:30:42,063 --> 01:30:45,327
We're cut off here, we can't
even get a message to Lady Eboshi.

971
01:30:45,626 --> 01:30:48,173
The Forest Spirit.That explains the explosions.

972
01:30:48,993 --> 01:30:51,224
Sir, I've still got your bow and arrows.

973
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,773
Aren't you gonna tell him you've
got his cloak and saddle, too?

974
01:30:54,048 --> 01:30:54,543
I do?

975
01:30:54,559 --> 01:30:55,712
You're useless!

976
01:30:56,372 --> 01:30:57,586
Many thanks, Kohroku!

977
01:30:57,906 --> 01:30:59,312
I'll try and bring you some help.

978
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:00,737
Can you hold out?

979
01:31:01,007 --> 01:31:03,889
Don't worry. We can always pour hot iron on them.

980
01:31:04,217 --> 01:31:05,913
Bring back Lady Eboshi!

981
01:31:05,928 --> 01:31:07,239
And don't take too long!

982
01:31:13,096 --> 01:31:15,931
I missed. They're bringing boats across the river.

983
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:19,913
Go and get Lady Eboshi. We'll
hold them off as long as we can!

984
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:23,892
I'll be back, I promise!

985
01:31:27,127 --> 01:31:28,285
We'll be here!

986
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:33,887
Get him! Stop that man!

987
01:31:43,299 --> 01:31:45,852
Looks like they're gonna try to cut us off. Run, Yakul!

988
01:32:00,888 --> 01:32:02,039
Yow two, go that way.

989
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:30,444
Burning animal flesh.

990
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:37,314
Yakul!

991
01:33:16,444 --> 01:33:17,862
Stay back!

992
01:33:30,832 --> 01:33:31,775
Show me your wound.

993
01:33:34,372 --> 01:33:37,188
You'll have to stay here. Wait
for me. I'll come back for you.

994
01:33:39,908 --> 01:33:41,076
I said, stay!

995
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:53,802
We're almost there, my friend.

996
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:39,702
Who goes there?

997
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:44,197
My orders are, no outsiders permitted here.

998
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:46,493
All right, but I just came from Iron Town.

999
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,435
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where I can find her.

1000
01:34:49,701 --> 01:34:51,559
The Eboshi woman is not here.

1001
01:34:51,639 --> 01:34:53,910
Give me the message, I'll make sure she gets it.

1002
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:56,508
I must speak with her. Now, where is she?

1003
01:34:56,975 --> 01:34:58,526
It's really you?

1004
01:34:59,102 --> 01:35:00,710
You're still alive, lad?

1005
01:35:00,874 --> 01:35:02,738
It looks like you men had a worse time than I did.

1006
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:04,644
We've been burying our friends all day.

1007
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:05,804
It was horrible!

1008
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:08,171
Iron Town has come under attack.

1009
01:35:08,347 --> 01:35:08,940
What?

1010
01:35:09,462 --> 01:35:12,021
The women and the lepers have
fallen back to the inner wall.

1011
01:35:12,252 --> 01:35:13,498
We haven't got a lot of time.

1012
01:35:13,743 --> 01:35:15,133
Those samurai bastards!

1013
01:35:15,149 --> 01:35:17,794
Asano must have just been
waiting for us to leave Iron Town.

1014
01:35:17,869 --> 01:35:19,591
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

1015
01:35:20,163 --> 01:35:22,409
She's off hunting down the Forest Spirit..

1016
01:35:22,651 --> 01:35:24,729
Then someone has to stop her. Call her back!

1017
01:35:24,745 --> 01:35:27,342
If you're all done, I want you out of here.

1018
01:35:27,358 --> 01:35:29,002
The rest of you, keep digging!

1019
01:35:29,018 --> 01:35:30,634
Wait! What about Iron Town?

1020
01:35:30,649 --> 01:35:32,387
That's right! It's our home!

1021
01:35:32,537 --> 01:35:35,224
What do they expect us to do, just abandon Iron Town?

1022
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,370
You heard the boy, we haven't a moment to lose!

1023
01:35:37,386 --> 01:35:39,045
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!

1024
01:35:39,061 --> 01:35:43,068
The forest is too big. No messenger
would have a chance of finding her.

1025
01:35:43,084 --> 01:35:46,085
One of your hunters could find her!
What else are they good for?

1026
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:48,851
Lady Eboshi is just being used by Jigo.

1027
01:35:49,272 --> 01:35:50,018
Tell me something.

1028
01:35:50,034 --> 01:35:52,378
When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

1029
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:54,944
Did you see San, the wolf-girl?

1030
01:35:55,094 --> 01:35:58,781
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

1031
01:35:58,797 --> 01:36:00,498
She was there. I saw her.

1032
01:36:00,746 --> 01:36:03,484
I was right in the front line,
I saw everything, everything!

1033
01:36:04,318 --> 01:36:05,065
What happened?

1034
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:09,681
I'm not sure. Everything started
happening so fast! It was a nightmare!

1035
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:13,120
Jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.

1036
01:36:13,555 --> 01:36:15,973
They didn't tell us about live landmines under our feet

1037
01:36:16,183 --> 01:36:18,198
or the grenades coming in on top of us.

1038
01:37:10,768 --> 01:37:12,036
Where is she? Where's San?

1039
01:37:16,507 --> 01:37:19,027
Take it easy, I'm trying to get you out!

1040
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:25,764
There's a wolf over there. Hurry!

1041
01:37:26,557 --> 01:37:28,059
Young master, what are you doing?

1042
01:37:32,355 --> 01:37:33,085
What's going on?

1043
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:33,703
Move!

1044
01:37:34,273 --> 01:37:35,696
What do you think you're doing?

1045
01:37:35,925 --> 01:37:40,502
I've got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf is gonna help me find her.

1046
01:37:40,835 --> 01:37:43,315
You're on their side, aren't you, boy?

1047
01:37:43,497 --> 01:37:44,682
Stand aside!

1048
01:37:45,631 --> 01:37:47,103
What's more important to all of you?

1049
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,257
The head of the Forest Spirit, or saving your town?

1050
01:37:50,026 --> 01:37:51,299
Those darts are poison!

1051
01:37:57,324 --> 01:37:58,346
That's enough now!

1052
01:38:05,073 --> 01:38:07,701
Come on, let's get this thing
off of them, all together now!

1053
01:38:17,847 --> 01:38:18,461
Look out!

1054
01:38:30,477 --> 01:38:31,649
After you've come through the swamp,

1055
01:38:31,834 --> 01:38:33,448
take cover by the lake until we get there.

1056
01:38:33,499 --> 01:38:34,146
Right!

1057
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:37,140
Be careful. Those riflemen with Milady belong to Jigo.

1058
01:38:37,156 --> 01:38:39,906
Take these. Where I'm going, they won't be of any use.

1059
01:38:42,687 --> 01:38:43,847
You go with them, Yakul.

1060
01:38:44,415 --> 01:38:45,180
Look after him.

1061
01:38:49,682 --> 01:38:52,156
Find San! That's where we'll find Eboshi.

1062
01:39:03,457 --> 01:39:07,142
Come on, keep moving, straight
ahead. Today, we finish this.

1063
01:39:10,536 --> 01:39:11,028
Sir.

1064
01:39:11,417 --> 01:39:11,870
Yes?

1065
01:39:12,116 --> 01:39:13,323
Have you spotted them?

1066
01:39:13,706 --> 01:39:16,071
Okkoto is badly wounded, but he and the wolf-girl

1067
01:39:16,087 --> 01:39:18,247
are making their way to the realm of the Forest Spirit..

1068
01:39:18,803 --> 01:39:21,264
So, they're going to beg him for his help, are they?

1069
01:39:21,496 --> 01:39:22,275
Keep after them.

1070
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:25,158
But stay out of sight, or you'll
frighten the Forest Spirit. away.

1071
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:26,978
Yes, sir. I understand.

1072
01:39:28,582 --> 01:39:30,903
That was boar's blood painted on his face, wasn't it?

1073
01:39:32,156 --> 01:39:34,909
A little trade secret. Don't want to smell human.

1074
01:39:41,591 --> 01:39:43,672
We're almost to the pool of the Forest Spirit..

1075
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:45,707
Just a little farther, keep going.

1076
01:40:03,881 --> 01:40:04,654
What was that?

1077
01:40:08,581 --> 01:40:11,176
Okkoto, there's something wrong! We have to keep moving.

1078
01:40:12,014 --> 01:40:13,338
Something is out there.

1079
01:40:13,734 --> 01:40:16,587
But what? There's so much blood
in the air, I can't smell it.

1080
01:40:21,478 --> 01:40:22,983
I should have known it was you!

1081
01:40:23,012 --> 01:40:24,246
You did this!

1082
01:40:24,798 --> 01:40:27,218
Because of you, the forest will die!

1083
01:40:27,343 --> 01:40:29,988
You're wrong! We've both been fighting to save it.

1084
01:40:30,004 --> 01:40:31,652
This is the thanks you give us?

1085
01:40:31,668 --> 01:40:33,637
You bring bad things.

1086
01:40:33,855 --> 01:40:36,710
Bad things coming, neither human nor animal.

1087
01:40:36,868 --> 01:40:39,025
What do you mean, neither human nor animal?

1088
01:40:46,037 --> 01:40:46,884
They're coming!

1089
01:40:46,899 --> 01:40:48,439
It's the end for us.

1090
01:41:07,611 --> 01:41:08,946
They're warriors.

1091
01:41:12,074 --> 01:41:13,339
They've come back.

1092
01:41:15,066 --> 01:41:16,302
My warriors!

1093
01:41:18,089 --> 01:41:20,433
They have come back to me from the land of the dead.

1094
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:26,011
Forward, my warriors!

1095
01:41:26,027 --> 01:41:26,853
Okkoto listen.

1096
01:41:26,869 --> 01:41:29,468
Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit.!

1097
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:39,763
No, Lord Okkoto, your warriors haven't come back to you!

1098
01:41:44,841 --> 01:41:48,639
Those are humans wearing the skins
of your warriors to hide their scent!

1099
01:41:49,094 --> 01:41:50,007
It's a trick!

1100
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:54,358
Don't you understand? It's just a human trick

1101
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:56,995
to get us to lead them to the Forest Spirit..

1102
01:42:00,759 --> 01:42:02,002
Come out, Forest Spirit!

1103
01:42:02,788 --> 01:42:04,385
If you are truly master here,

1104
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:09,452
give my warriors the power to slay
the humans and be victorious!

1105
01:42:09,619 --> 01:42:12,760
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please! You've got to listen.

1106
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:16,191
San, they're all around us. Okkoto's done for, leave him!

1107
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,743
No! I won't let him turn into a demon, like Nago did.

1108
01:42:20,233 --> 01:42:23,595
Tell Mother that the humans are
setting a trap for the Forest Spirit..

1109
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:25,256
She'll know what to do.

1110
01:42:28,452 --> 01:42:31,813
You'll have to hurry, or it
could mean the end of all of us!

1111
01:42:32,698 --> 01:42:33,607
Go on now.

1112
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,409
Stay back or you die!

1113
01:42:54,772 --> 01:42:57,509
And then this whole forest will see just what you are.

1114
01:43:08,758 --> 01:43:09,783
Ashitaka?

1115
01:43:24,669 --> 01:43:25,701
I burn.

1116
01:43:27,277 --> 01:43:29,895
There are flames growing inside of me!

1117
01:43:32,477 --> 01:43:35,820
You must fight it! Don't let yourself become a demon.

1118
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:38,347
Lord Okkoto!

1119
01:43:42,265 --> 01:43:42,773
What is it?

1120
01:43:46,736 --> 01:43:47,403
Is it San?

1121
01:43:47,684 --> 01:43:48,712
She's in danger.

1122
01:43:48,862 --> 01:43:49,482
Let's go!

1123
01:44:17,801 --> 01:44:18,560
Fire!

1124
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:31,159
No! I don't want to become a demon.

1125
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,112
Please, stop, Okkoto!

1126
01:44:44,006 --> 01:44:45,993
You're too slow. Get on!

1127
01:45:00,401 --> 01:45:01,022
A wolf!

1128
01:45:05,017 --> 01:45:05,601
Eboshi!

1129
01:45:12,664 --> 01:45:13,692
You keep going!

1130
01:45:15,235 --> 01:45:17,451
Eboshi! I have something to say!

1131
01:45:17,774 --> 01:45:18,715
Hold your fire!

1132
01:45:18,997 --> 01:45:20,097
What is it you want?

1133
01:45:20,374 --> 01:45:22,797
Lord Asano's samurai have attacked Iron Town!

1134
01:45:23,092 --> 01:45:25,848
The women are outnumbered,
they can't hold them up for long!

1135
01:45:26,032 --> 01:45:27,855
Forget about the Forest Spirit..

1136
01:45:28,175 --> 01:45:30,233
Your men are already heading back to Iron Town

1137
01:45:30,249 --> 01:45:31,743
but they need you to lead them.

1138
01:45:32,668 --> 01:45:34,714
What proof is there this isn't a lie?

1139
01:45:35,011 --> 01:45:38,758
Lie? Don't be ridiculous. What reason do I have to lie?

1140
01:45:39,073 --> 01:45:40,919
So it's, "Don't kill the forest gods?"

1141
01:45:40,968 --> 01:45:42,985
Now you want us to kill samurai instead?

1142
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:47,060
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace.

1143
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:51,490
Just whose side is he on anyway?

1144
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,036
Shouldn't we go back?

1145
01:45:53,412 --> 01:45:56,228
The women are on their own now.
I've done all I can for them.

1146
01:45:56,365 --> 01:45:58,329
They can take care of themselves.

1147
01:46:00,543 --> 01:46:02,388
There's the pool Kohroku told us about.

1148
01:46:02,692 --> 01:46:04,319
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

1149
01:46:04,948 --> 01:46:07,519
It's the moment of truth, boys. So keep your eyes peeled.

1150
01:46:08,034 --> 01:46:09,583
Why do we need that woman, sir?

1151
01:46:10,056 --> 01:46:13,436
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do the dirty work.

1152
01:46:40,461 --> 01:46:41,663
Moro, what happened to you?

1153
01:46:42,298 --> 01:46:45,055
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

1154
01:46:46,241 --> 01:46:47,618
San!

1155
01:46:50,644 --> 01:46:51,979
San!

1156
01:46:54,865 --> 01:46:56,423
Ashitaka!

1157
01:47:01,901 --> 01:47:04,544
Okkoto! Turned into a demon!

1158
01:47:12,822 --> 01:47:13,830
Leave, boy.

1159
01:47:14,903 --> 01:47:17,375
Fight me, and the Forest Spirit. will never come.

1160
01:47:22,293 --> 01:47:25,011
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

1161
01:47:29,024 --> 01:47:31,842
Oh mighty Lord, let me have the girl, I beg of you.

1162
01:47:32,005 --> 01:47:33,242
Please, let her go.

1163
01:47:33,936 --> 01:47:35,556
San, are you there?

1164
01:47:35,736 --> 01:47:37,571
It's me, Ashitaka!

1165
01:47:42,637 --> 01:47:43,805
San!

1166
01:47:51,883 --> 01:47:52,696
Kill him.

1167
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:00,107
Stop him, he'll ruin everything!

1168
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:25,113
San!

1169
01:48:28,345 --> 01:48:29,005
San!

1170
01:48:32,236 --> 01:48:33,248
Ashitaka!

1171
01:48:37,859 --> 01:48:38,860
San!

1172
01:48:39,414 --> 01:48:40,656
Ashitaka!

1173
01:48:48,163 --> 01:48:50,808
Here I was, saving the last of my strength

1174
01:48:50,824 --> 01:48:54,408
to bite off that damn woman's head. But I must save San.

1175
01:48:54,739 --> 01:48:56,895
Close ranks! Use your grenades!

1176
01:49:15,597 --> 01:49:18,685
Don't touch him. He's no longer a god.

1177
01:49:27,843 --> 01:49:30,169
You can't even speak, can you?

1178
01:49:31,128 --> 01:49:33,911
Well done, man. Now fall back
and get the wounded out of here.

1179
01:49:34,114 --> 01:49:34,752
Go on.

1180
01:49:37,489 --> 01:49:38,857
What a revolting spectacle.

1181
01:49:48,151 --> 01:49:48,928
It's him.

1182
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:03,433
Give me back my daughter, demon!

1183
01:50:24,885 --> 01:50:25,895
Ashitaka.

1184
01:50:26,948 --> 01:50:28,982
Can you save the girl you love?

1185
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:41,435
the Forest Spirit!

1186
01:50:52,101 --> 01:50:53,668
Eboshi, hold your fire!

1187
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,200
Eboshi!

1188
01:51:08,622 --> 01:51:10,750
Your enemy is not the Forest Spirit.

1189
01:51:11,986 --> 01:51:13,355
But that should have killed it!

1190
01:51:13,371 --> 01:51:15,039
He's a god, it will take more than one shot.

1191
01:51:25,103 --> 01:51:25,597
San!

1192
01:51:35,364 --> 01:51:36,260
Don't die!

1193
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:07,719
I don't get it! The great forest
spirit took their lives away.

1194
01:52:27,603 --> 01:52:29,373
Quick! He's starting to change.

1195
01:52:29,737 --> 01:52:31,304
Now watch closely, everyone.

1196
01:52:31,713 --> 01:52:33,623
I'm going to show you how to kill a god.

1197
01:52:34,585 --> 01:52:36,206
A god of life and death.

1198
01:52:37,109 --> 01:52:38,811
The trick is not to fear him.

1199
01:52:55,962 --> 01:52:56,856
No, stop!

1200
01:53:00,304 --> 01:53:01,129
Eboshi!

1201
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,877
You will die!

1202
01:53:26,271 --> 01:53:28,561
She did it! Quickly, go get the head!

1203
01:54:07,719 --> 01:54:10,064
Quick, Jigo! Bring me that box of yours.

1204
01:54:11,098 --> 01:54:12,256
The porters are all dead.

1205
01:54:12,462 --> 01:54:13,845
Hurry, hurry!

1206
01:54:15,838 --> 01:54:17,784
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body.

1207
01:54:17,877 --> 01:54:19,614
It will suck the life out of you!

1208
01:54:23,074 --> 01:54:25,897
Here it is. One head, as promised!

1209
01:54:27,923 --> 01:54:28,866
Watch out!

1210
01:54:34,642 --> 01:54:35,297
Milady!

1211
01:54:35,889 --> 01:54:38,619
I told you a wolf's head can still bite.

1212
01:54:38,703 --> 01:54:39,539
Come on!

1213
01:54:40,412 --> 01:54:42,432
We've got to get out of here. Hurry!

1214
01:54:42,488 --> 01:54:43,323
It's coming, sir!

1215
01:54:47,115 --> 01:54:47,827
Run!

1216
01:55:05,067 --> 01:55:06,521
Gonza, we've got to get to the island!

1217
01:55:06,537 --> 01:55:08,052
Island? I can't swim!

1218
01:55:08,068 --> 01:55:09,171
Then walk along the bottom.

1219
01:55:37,941 --> 01:55:39,776
Give her to me. I'll cut her throat!

1220
01:55:40,116 --> 01:55:42,866
Your clan has been avenged. Your mother saw to that.

1221
01:55:43,988 --> 01:55:45,068
Lady Eboshi!

1222
01:55:45,083 --> 01:55:45,781
Help me.

1223
01:55:50,082 --> 01:55:51,465
Don't waste your sympathy.

1224
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:55,300
I promised Toki that I'd bring you back to Iron Town.

1225
01:56:01,691 --> 01:56:02,652
He's searching for his head.

1226
01:56:03,201 --> 01:56:04,168
We can't stay here.

1227
01:56:04,507 --> 01:56:07,058
San! You have got to help us.

1228
01:56:07,074 --> 01:56:10,085
No! You're on their side, you always were!

1229
01:56:10,101 --> 01:56:12,429
Take that damned woman and just go away!

1230
01:56:14,288 --> 01:56:14,701
San.

1231
01:56:15,083 --> 01:56:17,972
Never! I hate all of you, humans!

1232
01:56:18,313 --> 01:56:21,982
Yes, I'm human, San. And so are you.

1233
01:56:21,998 --> 01:56:24,047
Stop it! I'm a wolf, you hear?

1234
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:25,988
San.

1235
01:56:26,177 --> 01:56:27,337
Stay back!

1236
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:36,760
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.

1237
01:56:43,436 --> 01:56:47,401
It's over. Everything is over. The forest is dead.

1238
01:56:56,943 --> 01:57:00,110
Nothing is over. The two of us are still alive.

1239
01:57:00,468 --> 01:57:01,678
Now, will you help me, San?

1240
01:57:27,227 --> 01:57:29,330
Come back! Help us!

1241
01:57:29,690 --> 01:57:31,261
A little crisis and they panic.

1242
01:57:36,308 --> 01:57:37,909
What are you doing? This way!

1243
01:57:42,631 --> 01:57:44,240
Look! The head is moving.

1244
01:57:47,692 --> 01:57:49,000
It's calling him to us!

1245
01:58:32,104 --> 01:58:33,115
There you go, Toki.

1246
01:58:33,338 --> 01:58:34,403
It shouldn't jam any more.

1247
01:58:34,798 --> 01:58:35,366
Thanks.

1248
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:37,231
It's awfully quiet.

1249
01:58:37,423 --> 01:58:39,295
Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1250
01:58:40,409 --> 01:58:42,887
I wonder if that young man ever found Lady Eboshi.

1251
01:58:43,152 --> 01:58:45,420
Don't worry about him, he found her all right!

1252
01:58:45,656 --> 01:58:47,948
They'll be marching over that hill any minute now.

1253
01:58:50,532 --> 01:58:52,992
Big dope! Don't ask me why I love him.

1254
01:58:53,414 --> 01:58:54,333
Hey, Kohroku!

1255
01:58:54,891 --> 01:58:57,067
Let him sleep, Toki. While he can.

1256
01:59:07,315 --> 01:59:07,827
What's that?

1257
01:59:07,843 --> 01:59:08,630
I don't know.

1258
01:59:08,907 --> 01:59:10,122
But I don't like it.

1259
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:24,439
It's the Night Walker!

1260
01:59:38,608 --> 01:59:40,477
Everybody, hold your positions!

1261
01:59:41,182 --> 01:59:42,736
Toki, it's coming right at us!

1262
01:59:42,752 --> 01:59:44,347
Run! We gotta go!

1263
01:59:44,559 --> 01:59:48,161
No! We promised Lady Eboshi we would defend Iron Town.

1264
01:59:54,832 --> 01:59:56,540
Look, over there! He's come back!

1265
02:00:01,953 --> 02:00:02,920
Get everyone out!

1266
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:06,916
The Great Spirit's head has
been cut off, and he wants it back!

1267
02:00:07,225 --> 02:00:09,903
If that black ooze touches you, you're dead!

1268
02:00:10,117 --> 02:00:12,913
Run for the lake, the water will slow it down.

1269
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:16,426
Lady Eboshi and the men are on
their way from the other side.

1270
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:19,868
I'm going to try to return
his head before he kills us all.

1271
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:20,813
Hurry!

1272
02:00:21,494 --> 02:00:22,244
It's too fast!

1273
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:22,998
What we gonna do now?

1274
02:00:23,236 --> 02:00:24,223
It will kill us all!

1275
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:25,002
We'll never get out of town.

1276
02:00:25,018 --> 02:00:26,208
That's enough!

1277
02:00:26,896 --> 02:00:29,140
Get everyone down to the lake and stay calm.

1278
02:00:29,345 --> 02:00:31,283
We can carry the sick and the wounded.

1279
02:00:40,623 --> 02:00:42,272
Not that way! Stop!

1280
02:01:00,011 --> 02:01:01,130
There it goes.

1281
02:01:06,688 --> 02:01:09,198
We're done for. Once the forge burns, that's it.

1282
02:01:09,214 --> 02:01:10,483
That will be the end of Iron Town.

1283
02:01:10,725 --> 02:01:14,152
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now let's go!

1284
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:33,357
There they are!

1285
02:01:46,391 --> 02:01:47,014
Go!

1286
02:01:48,086 --> 02:01:49,189
Stop right there.

1287
02:01:51,524 --> 02:01:53,882
You're both alive. How nice.

1288
02:01:53,898 --> 02:01:55,566
I'm giving the creature back its head.

1289
02:01:55,784 --> 02:01:57,354
Put the box down and back away.

1290
02:01:57,485 --> 02:02:00,062
Give the head back now? Come on, boy, don't be silly.

1291
02:02:00,221 --> 02:02:01,900
Now, when the sun is about to come up?

1292
02:02:02,051 --> 02:02:05,562
Look, he's a brainless, swollen,
life-sucking god of death.

1293
02:02:05,585 --> 02:02:07,968
But at sunrise, he'll vanish like a bad dream.

1294
02:02:07,984 --> 02:02:10,319
Sir, it's coming. We've got to get out of here!

1295
02:02:10,431 --> 02:02:13,695
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1296
02:02:13,711 --> 02:02:15,340
But I might actually get it.

1297
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:16,835
Don't force me to kill you.

1298
02:02:17,345 --> 02:02:19,846
Oh dear. You make it sound so very easy.

1299
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:21,076
You really ought to

1300
02:02:21,092 --> 02:02:22,062
relax!

1301
02:02:28,528 --> 02:02:29,523
Get going!

1302
02:02:49,295 --> 02:02:50,597
Ashitaka!

1303
02:02:50,613 --> 02:02:51,208
I got it!

1304
02:02:53,436 --> 02:02:55,824
Everything is under control.

1305
02:02:58,903 --> 02:02:59,742
This is bad.

1306
02:03:02,345 --> 02:03:03,880
Master, we're surrounded!

1307
02:03:04,946 --> 02:03:06,750
Come on, sun! Rise!

1308
02:03:06,766 --> 02:03:07,654
Open the box!

1309
02:03:07,829 --> 02:03:10,403
Don't you see? It's too late for that now.

1310
02:03:10,419 --> 02:03:12,477
Why are you wasting your breath talking to him?

1311
02:03:12,894 --> 02:03:14,424
Human hands must return it.

1312
02:03:19,289 --> 02:03:20,636
Don't say I didn't warn you!

1313
02:03:33,456 --> 02:03:35,272
Forest Spirit!

1314
02:03:35,688 --> 02:03:37,956
I give you back your head!

1315
02:03:38,504 --> 02:03:40,964
Take it, and be at peace!

1316
02:03:50,951 --> 02:03:52,848
Well, that got its attention all right.

1317
02:04:23,846 --> 02:04:25,094
I think it's over.

1318
02:04:25,466 --> 02:04:26,592
Look, it's the men!

1319
02:04:27,635 --> 02:04:29,313
The men, the men are back.

1320
02:04:29,544 --> 02:04:33,339
I really can't believe we made it!
I never thought I'd live to see home again.

1321
02:04:39,349 --> 02:04:40,217
Milady!

1322
02:04:40,233 --> 02:04:40,755
You are here.

1323
02:04:40,771 --> 02:04:43,114
Be careful, Her Ladyship has been injured.

1324
02:05:11,151 --> 02:05:13,283
Look! It's falling on Iron Town.

1325
02:05:19,024 --> 02:05:21,748
Hang on tight, everybody! Don't let go!

1326
02:06:29,645 --> 02:06:32,042
I didn't know the Forest Spirit made the flowers grow.

1327
02:07:03,165 --> 02:07:04,949
San! San! Look!

1328
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:38,365
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

1329
02:07:39,535 --> 02:07:41,383
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1330
02:07:41,956 --> 02:07:43,680
Never. He's life itself.

1331
02:07:43,968 --> 02:07:47,633
He's not dead. He's here right
now, trying to tell us something.

1332
02:07:48,586 --> 02:07:50,700
That it's time for both of us to live.

1333
02:07:58,657 --> 02:08:00,529
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me.

1334
02:08:00,612 --> 02:08:02,706
But I can't forgive the humans for what they've done.

1335
02:08:03,096 --> 02:08:03,897
I understand.

1336
02:08:04,228 --> 02:08:07,001
You'll live in the forest, and
I'll go help them rebuild Iron Town.

1337
02:08:07,492 --> 02:08:08,618
I'll always be near.

1338
02:08:09,904 --> 02:08:12,412
Yakul and I will come and visit
you whenever we can, all right?

1339
02:08:24,156 --> 02:08:28,022
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little wolf-girl helped save us all.

1340
02:08:29,082 --> 02:08:32,234
Ashitaka! Can someone find him? I need to thank him.

1341
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:34,976
We're going to start all over again.

1342
02:08:35,418 --> 02:08:37,129
This time, we'll build a better town.

1343
02:08:38,243 --> 02:08:41,744
Well, I give up. You can't win against fools.
