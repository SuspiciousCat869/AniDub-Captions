hoarded almost all the food
and wood in the village.

157
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,220
[LIZARDMAN PRIEST]
They refused to slay any goblins

158
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,100
until they were
furnished with supplies.

159
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,310
Which gave the people
living here little choice.

160
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,850
Though perhaps the party's
need truly was that great.

161
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,140
Do you think they needed
supplies that badly?

162
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,350
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Hunting goblins can take time.

163
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,760
Well, time isn't something
we have much of right now.

164
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,850
We don't know what
the nest is like,

165
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,970
or how many we're facing.

166
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,310
[HIGH ELF ARCHER]
And there's a chance that

167
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,310
the adventurers are still alive.

168
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,890
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It is possible.

169
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,390
But from the sound of it, the
last time any of them were seen,

170
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,220
they didn't seem to be
holding up very well.

171
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,140
The most likely place for
a goblin nest is here.

172
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,510
If we knew their strategy,

173
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,970
it might help us
come up with our own.

174
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
They stocked up on
wood and food.

175
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,930
The question is why.

176
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,760
[GOBLIN SLAYER] Simple. They're
trying to starve them out.

177
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,180
[HIGH ELF ARCHER]
Hey. Orcbolg!

178
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,720
You said you would explain
the arrow, so let's hear it.

179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,600
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I rigged it
so the shaft would fall off,

180
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,350
leaving the tip
embedded in the flesh.

181
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,640
[HIGH ELF ARCHER]
So?

182
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,760
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
The tip was poisoned.

183
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,350
Unless that goblin digs it out,
his flesh will rot,

184
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,970
and sickness will
spread through the nest.

185
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,560
It won't eliminate
all of them at once,

186
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,970
but it's better than nothing.

187
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,310
[HIGH ELF ARCHER] I don't
think I'll ever understand

188
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,720
what goes through
that head of yours.

189
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,850
I'm freezing.

190
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,640
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It's almost dusk.

191
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,890
Once we've warmed up,
we're going in.

192
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,100
I'd never imagined that a place
this cold might actually exist.

Quit whining and start drinking,
it'll warm you right up.

Hey, let's talk
about you, Lizardman.

195
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,890
You said your ultimate goal's
to become a dragon, right?

196
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,970
Indeed, that is correct.

197
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,310
Well I'll tell you what.

198

You go become a powerful
immortal, and once you do,

199
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,180
I'll stop by and visit every so
often to help you pass the time.

200
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,310
[HIGH ELF ARCHER] I mean, you'll
basically live forever, right?

201
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,510
That's got to get
boring after a while.

202
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,890
You'd probably go crazy
without any friends.

203
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,010
[LIZARDMAN PRIEST]
Hmm. Interesting.

A dragon who can
tell daring tales

of his adventures
slaying goblins.

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,470
A dragon who is visited by his
erstwhile companion, the elf.

207
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
And the best part is,
you'd be a dragon

209
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,640
What a fascinating
reputation to cultivate.

210
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,140
I was thinking the same thing.

211
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,430
But perhaps for now we
ought to focus our energy

on the matter at hand.

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Careful.

214

There are spears
hidden in the water.

215

Really? Spears? That's tricky.

216

[PRIESTESS]
A pit trap?

enough for that?

Who knows.

219

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I don't see any totems so far.

220
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,560
Um, so, does that mean
there's no shaman in the nest?

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Not sure, but I don't like it.

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,930
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Strange.

311
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,720
It doesn't appear
to be a goblin totem.

312
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,510
[PRIESTESS]
I think it's... the green moon.

313
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,100
It's the sign belonging to the
deity who has dominion over it,

314
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,350
the God of Wisdom.

315
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,810
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
The green moon?

316
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,310
You mean where
the goblins come from?

317
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,600
[PRIESTESS]
Mm.

318
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
This god would heal goblins?

319
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,810
Teach them miracles?

320
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,140
It's possible. The God
of Wisdom is eccentric,

321
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,350
but maybe it was
a dark elf instead,

322
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,760
or a high-ranking priest
of the evil sect.

323
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,810
What? That sounds like
wishful thinking.

324
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,470
If someone controlled
a bunch of goblins

325
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,720
but only used them
to steal stuff,

326
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,970
then they wouldn't
be any smarter

327
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,510
than the goblins themselves.

328
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,140
Let's see.

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,720
Whatever we're up against not
only thinks like the goblins,

heals them as well.

It also attacks people and
seems to be a follower of evil.

332
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,600
That sounds a lot like...

333
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,060
No, it just couldn't be.

334
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,680
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It's a goblin paladin.

335

[NOBLE FENCER]
Just think about it.

336
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,890
We know the goblins have
been attacking the village

337
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,640
when they're low on food.

338
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,510
So we'll wait here
for a few days,

339
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,970
and then ambush
the stupid creatures

340
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,850
when they make a run for it.

341
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,510
All right, sounds like
a pretty solid idea to me.

342
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,810
Yeah, if you really think
that's all it's gonna take,

then no arguments here.

344
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,350
It's a good enough plan,

345
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,600
but if we get hit by a blizzard
out here without shelter,

346
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,100

I mean, she is
our leader, isn't she?

349
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,640
You see, it's working perfectly.

We'll get them all

Maybe they're getting
a little more cautious.

their thinking for them.

for eating all that snow.

Still, it's the only
source of water we have,

and pretty soon there won't be
any firewood left to melt it.

We need to think of something,
or we're done here.

We can afford to stick it out
for a little bit longer.

Will the hostages be all right

625
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,510
if we leave them for now?

626
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,760
[LIZARDMAN PRIEST]
It is probably safer than

627
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,970
taking them with us.

628
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,720
Interesting knife.
What is that thing made of?

629
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,930
It's Aluminum--

630
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,720
The blade itself was
forged from a red gem

631
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,310
and then tempered
with lightning.

632
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,060
Wouldn't mind
taking a closer look.

633
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,260
Huh? So, tell me,
where are we gonna start out?

634
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,970
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
We should head to their armory.

635
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,760
But first, how many spells
and miracles do we have left?

636
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,470
Let's see. I have
three miracles remaining,

637
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,310
and the other two
spellcasters have

638
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,060
four and three between
the two of them.

639
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,390
That's a total of ten.

640
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,510
You forgot to include
our newest party member.

641
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,640
Two spells.

642
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,850
So that means we have
12 all together.

643
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,930
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yes, but we should save

644
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,260
our two lightning attacks
as last resorts.

645
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,600
[NOBLE FENCER] We will kill
these goblins, won't we?

646
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,100
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
If all goes well, yes.

647
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,970
We're counting on you
to help us do it.

648
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm with you.

649
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,640
[GOBLIN SLAYER] Why did you
give her the torch to carry?

650
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,810
I think it must be hard to not
have an important role to play,

651
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,720
so I gave her a job.

652
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,760
Didn't you notice?

653
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,470
When I handed it over,
she seemed bashful.

654
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,100
[GOBLIN SLAYER] This isn't
quite what I was expecting

655
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,430
out of an armory.

656
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,640
Well, this is a
dwarven fortress.

657
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,680
Maybe they're digging for ore.

658
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,890
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Even if they are,

659
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,010
would the goblins be
able to forge metal?

660
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,180
Whatever the case,

661
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,180
I'll make fast work
of their armaments.

662
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,260
Lend me a hand, girlie.

663
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,810
Hope you're strong.

664
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,430
We're going to carry
some of these tools with us.

665
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,760
Beard-cutter is a master at
destroying his weapons.

666
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,970
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I merely use them effectively.

667
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,760
[giggles]

668
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,350
You're not going to get
very far with just a dagger,

669
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,260
so I suggest you find
yourself something

670
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,390
more suitable for
the fight ahead.

671
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,560
I don't need another blade.

672
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,310
That so? Well,
to each his own I guess.

673
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,600
And now that I know
your preference in weapon,

674
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,720
I feel like I know you
a little better.

675
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,890
Speaking your mind
and being honest

676
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,600
is the foundation
of friendship. Right?

677
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Shall I?

678
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,350
Are we ready to
continue with our plan?

679
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,810
Be my guest.

680
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,510
O great ancestors who
sleep far beneath the rock.

681
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,760
Take these objects in hand and
show them the burden of time.

682
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,890
[PRIESTESS]
Was that a prayer of decay?

683
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,310
[LIZARDMAN PRIEST] Indeed. Now
we have loosed the prisoners

684
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,430
from their dungeon and
destroyed their weapons.

685
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,560
Our strategy is working.

686
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,510
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yes.

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
We've miscalculated.

691
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,890
This is a goblin
coronation ceremony.

692
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,260
[PRIESTESS gasps] And a
coronation requires a priest.

693
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,850
So they'll need a shaman!

Let's split up.

These two and I
will act as decoys.

in the dungeons.

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Then let's move out.

00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,010
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Here. I found it.

942
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,680
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I managed
to get your sword back.

943
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,810
You've done well.

944
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,680
Your parents will be proud.

945
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:09,220
[GOBLIN SLAYER] Has anyone ever
told you that you cry a lot?

946
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:15,970
[NOBLE FENCER crying]

947
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,600
[GUILD GIRL]
We survived yet another year.

948
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,810
Let us praise the
Gods of Fate and Chance,

949
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,510
and of Order and Chaos!

950
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,970
Mugs high!

951
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,390
[GUILD HALL]
Cheers! Happy New Year!

952
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,890
Happy New Year.

953
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,970
Time flies when
you're in high demand.

954
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,350
I guess, sure.

955
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,640
[SPEARMAN]
Me and my spear took down

956
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,760
some ferocious
monsters this year.

957
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,930
I'm talking premium quests.

958
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,850
So that goblin-obsessed
freak has got nothing on me.

959
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,890
Well of course you did.

960
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:56,810
You worked so very hard.
You and that spear.

961
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,430
So what're you gonna do now?

962
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,680
I need some time to
catch up with my parents.

963
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,220
They've been worried about me,
and we have much to discuss.

964
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,970
I'd also like to make graves
for my fallen comrades.

965
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,970
When I've finished doing
all of that... Who knows?

966
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,220
That's a smart plan.

967
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,760
If there's one thing
I've learned,

968
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,390
it's always good to take care
of your friends and family.

969
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,220
Sweet nectar of the gods!

970
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,140
If only Sir Goblin Slayer could
have joined us in this feast!

971
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,600
No kidding, I never
get a chance to drink

972
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,350
with ol' Beard-cutter and I know

973
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,970
the merrymaking
would be legendary.

974
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,260
[LIZARDMAN PRIEST] We must
respect fate's machinations,

975
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,060
even when our
desires are not met

976
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,430
or our preferred drinking
partners are absent.

977
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,810
There's no way to
thank any of you enough.

978
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,560
But I'll make sure
to write often.

979
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,850
Yes, please! Don't lose touch.

980
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,350
You should contact me
any time you feel like it.

981
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,600
I promise I'll always get
back to you as soon as I can.

982
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,890
Great. Thank you.

983
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,640
I will. I swear.

984
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,470
Oh, write some to me, too!

985
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,470
I've always dreamed of
having a special friend

986
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,560
I can send letters
back and forth with.

987
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,060
[COW GIRL sighs] Maybe I'll
start mailing out messages, too.

988
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,560
I spend almost all of
my time working on the farm,

989
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,220
so I never get the
chance to make friends

990
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,140
with other girls my age.

991
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,430
[GUILD GIRL]
To be honest with you,

992
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,890
working at a guild
isn't much better.

993
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,060
Where did Goblin Slayer
run off to now?

994
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,390
Uh...

995
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,220
Don't tell me.

996
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,720
You want to keep your childhood
friend all to yourself.

997
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,680
[giggles] I'd be lying if I
said that I loved the idea

998
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,060
of sharing him with others.

999
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,890
But I guess I'm feeling
kind of generous this year.

1000
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,930
[GUILD GIRL chuckles] How nice
of you. Plus, it's only fair.

1001
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,180
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I know you're there.

1002
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,260
So do you keep watch every year
while the others celebrate?

1003
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,010
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Don't ask foolish questions.

1004
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,890
Right. I should have known.

1005
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,640
[GOBLIN SLAYER] They could
try to attack on New Year's.

1006
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,760
[PRIESTESS]
Here, they sent this for you.

1007
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:55,930
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see.

1008
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,680
Wow, a whole camp
set up and everything.

1009
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,470
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I've spent ten years of my life

1010
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,600
slaying goblins.
And in that time,

1011
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,260
I've wondered if the
goblins have evolved.

1012
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,720
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Tell me.

1013
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,060
Do you know what the paladin
was doing in the mountains?

1014
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,510
I don't.

1015
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,060
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Refining metal.

1016
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,260
That can't be.

1017
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,010
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
The dwarven fortress.

1018
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,310
Mining tools.

1019
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,430
That girl's aluminum sword.

1020
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:23,060
And ore that was
forged with lightning.

1021
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,850
There's only one
possible conclusion.

1022
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,970
I need to do whatever
I can to destroy them.

1023
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,760
I can't let my guard down.

1024
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:34,180
[sighs] Honestly.

1025
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,350
All you ever talk
about is goblins.

1026
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:42,680
It's like you never even
think about any other subject.

1027
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,760
You care so much
about killing them.

1028
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,510
They're far more important
to you than your friends.

1029
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,640
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Not true.

1030
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,470
You sure about that? Huh?

1031
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,350
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I'm not one
for big, noisy crowds,

1032
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:58,560
but I am glad to know
everyone else is having fun.

1033
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,680
It's always smarter to have
someone watching your back.

1034
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,430
I'll stay and help you.

1035
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,140
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It's cold out.

1036
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,970
[PRIESTESS]
Yes, I know.

1037
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,100
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see.

1038
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,810
Now that we're of the same mind,

1039
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,350
let's have some dinner and keep
the town safe until morning.

1040
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:19,680
[GOBLIN SLAYER] Right.
Oh, there was one other thing.

1041
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,350
What is it?

1042
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,810
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I hope you'll
continue to help me out

1043
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,060
in the new year.

1044
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,890
[PRIESTESS giggles]
