I think
I overdid it a bit.

35
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,560
This was supposed to be
a non-contact sparring.
But I had no

36
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,463
choice because you used
the forbidden skill.

37
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,568
Remember. The Old Master
has forbidden the Dark Hadou.

This could get

But, Master,

49
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,381
I just don’t
understand why.

50
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,950
How many times do I
have to tell you

51
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,353
you cannot use
the Dark Hadou!

52
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,655
I still
don’t understand.
It’s senseless.

53
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,458
To mindlessly follow
this path that’s laid out

54
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,960
as if our predecessors’
teaching is absolute?

55
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,529
I don’t agree.

56
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,031
No matter the sacrifice
or bloodshed,

57
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,000
it’s courage,

58
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,669
courage to tread
a thorny trail

59
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,971
should be the goal
of every martial
arts master.

60
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,910
Is that all
you have to say?

00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,448

[grunts]

63
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,653

Oh, no.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,323
It’s only arrogance.

but father wants
what’s best for you.

71
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,044
I know that.
But...

72
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:17,784
...I have my own path
to follow.

73
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,553
I really wanted Master
to understand.

Damn. Not again.

00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,467
Again? What is it?

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,536
Are you feeling
sick or something?

81
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,537
It’s nothing.

Just stay away.

84
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,779
From his appearance,
he must

85
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,049
have secretly been
using the Dark Hadou.

86
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,017
I am sorry.

87
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,821
Don’t be a fool.

88
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,557
It is nothing
that you need
to apologize for.

89
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,791
Right.

90
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,127
To be quite honest
with you,

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,995
I had been truly hoping

92
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,665
that this day would
never come to pass.

93
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,834
But now it has arrived.

94
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,836
The bad karma

95
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,938
which is flowing
in our bodies,

96
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,541
it is bad karma,
indeed.

97
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,442
Yes, Master.

98
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,045
We cannot leave him
alone any longer.

99
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,046
It’s unthinkable.

100
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,880
Understood.

101
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,584
We have absolutely
no other choice now.

102
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,786
But if I fail
at this task,

103
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,088
the consequences
will be unacceptable.

104
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,826
Gouken, you
are going to end

105

would you do

this is the path
you choose?

Would you like

I can come back later

I have to
deliver this.

174
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,918
I see.

175
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,988
Then...I must
be going now.

176
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,107
[crow caws distantly]

177
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,313
This place has not
changed one bit.

178
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,849
It’s just like
it was back then.

179
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,151
[eerie wind blows]

180
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,854
Huh? What?

00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,156
[loud splintering]

182
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,928
Hey. What the hell
is going on?

183
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,970
[gasps]

184
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,806
I can’t...believe...

185
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,907
my eyes.

186
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,980
You. You killed
old Master Gouken!

187
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,214
Damn you!

188
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,054
[snorts]
What’s this about?

189
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,889
Tryin’
to challenge me, huh?

190
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,525
Let’s go! Just say when!

191
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,961
[no audible dialogue]

192
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,300
Huh? Wait!

[birds screech,

194
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,738
Mmhh. Wha...

195
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,481
I guess I was dreaming.

196
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,126
[clinking]
Mmm-- Huh? Uhh?

197
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,437
[sizzling]
Huh?

198
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,438
[man cackling]

199
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,806
What?
[man cackling]

200
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,442
Heh heh heh!
You did a pretty
good job

201
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,378
of sensing me,
but you still have
a long way to go.

202
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,381
I’d say some more training
would do you a lot of good.

203
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,382
Training?

204
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,951
Who are you?

205
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,186
Me? I’m
just an old monk.

206
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,856
So. Do you intend
on fighting that man?

207
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,324
Huh?

208
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,326
To thank you
for the lunch,

209
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,828
how about I give you
a little bit of instruction?

210
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,531
Yee-aah!
Huh?

211
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,832
Aah! Yeah.

212
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,833
Yeah.

213
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,502
Huh. Not bad...

214
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,036
for an old guy.

215
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,071
Street fight
is your preference?

216
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,875
Here you go!
Ooh!

217
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,343
[grunting]

218
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,414
What’s the matter, kid?
You’re not even fighting back.

219
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,285
Or perhaps you’re
just not capable.

220
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,520
[chuckles]

221
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,523
All right!
That’s it!

222
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,892
I don’t waste time
fighting old men like you!

223
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,361
Come on! You’re
nothing but talk,
young fella!

224
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,595
T-hutt!

225
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,397
Damn it! Uhh!

226
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,167
Okay, now
I’m mad, grandpa!
Hyah!

227
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,236
A-ha! Getting

228
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,971
a little motivated,
are you?

229
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,374
[shouting in Japanese]

230
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,210
Huh? He knows
the same style as me!

231
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,179
[chuckles]
Pretty good lunge.

232
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,880
Huhh!

233
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,148
Here I am.

[groaning]

That’s it! You're
finished, grandpa.

238
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,559
You might
as well give up.
This is the end.

239
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,261
I got you
in this hold.
You’re paralyzed.

240
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,096
Are you quite sure
I’m paralyzed?

241
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,097
What?

242
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,232

[groans]

00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,239
Uhh!

245
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,107
Heh heh heh heh--
Mmm?

246
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,312
I’ve been easy on you
because of your advanced
age,

247
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,313
but now...

248
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,216
Oh, using
the Dark Hadou.

249
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,319
Bad idea to rely
strictly on that.
How immature.

250
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,188
Prepare yourself,
grandpa!

251
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,256
Hadouken!

252
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,491
Whoop!

253
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,526
Here you go.

254
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,493
Huh?

255
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,461
Ohh...

256
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,031
Nothin’ to it.
[chuckles]

257
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,499
Here. I’ll send it
back.

258
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,935
[gasps] Ohh!

259
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,637
[groans painfully]

260
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,105
[moans]

Ooh!
Uhh!

263
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,648
Here.

264
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,717
Uhh-- Huh?

265
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,152
Well, junior, have
you had enough?

266
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,556
Yeah.
I give up, grandpa.

267
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,224
You sure did
beat me, all right.

268
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,361
Even my Hadouken was
ineffective against you.

269
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,030
Are you shocked
to have been defeated

270
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,698
by an old thief
like me

271
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,201
with all
my experience?

272
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,636
Hey, I like you.

273
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,604
Come on
over to my place.

274
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,306
Huh?

275
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,110
Well, what’s the matter?

276
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,444
Aren’t you going
to eat anything?

277
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,712
You must be hungry.

278
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,149
Grandpa.

279
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,985
We had a tough fight
just minutes ago,

280
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,323
and now we’re sitting
here in your dining room
having a meal peacefully.

281
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,092
So, why did you
bring me here,
grandpa?

282
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,094
Come on. Now, aren’t
you going to eat?

283
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,597
Nnngg...Of course
I’m going to.

284
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,501
But I just keep wondering
about who you are, grandpa.

285
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,336
I mean, what is
your story for real?

286
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,273
I’m just a monk.

287
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,075
Plain and simple,
Ryu.
Hmm.

288
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,544
This is
my granddaughter
Fuka.

289
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,679
[gasps]

290
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,113
Oh, it’s you!

291
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,115
Oh, hello.

292
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,551
What? Do you two
know each other?

293
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,087
Yep. Sort of.

294
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,789
Um, Grandfather,

295
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,291
is this the apprentice
you told me about?

296
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,292
Wha?

297
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,327
That’s right.

298
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,028
Today is his first day.

299
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,697
Now, be sure
to treat him well.

300
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,099
Wait! I haven’t
said one word

301
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,169
about an apprenticeship
with you or anybody else.

302
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,439
What’s your hesitation?
Come on. I’d like
to propose a toast.

303
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,108
Me? I can’t drink.

304
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,409
Nonsense. Drink up.

305
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,412
[chuckles] Well,
enjoy yourselves.

306
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,780
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

307
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,550
What do you think?
Isn’t she a nice girl?

308
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,818
Uh, oh, yeah.

309
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,386
Do you like her?

310
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,387
Uh, sure.

311
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,722
Well, then,
that’s it!

312
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,191
You want to marry
Fuka, don’t you?

313
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,192
[coughs]

314
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,693
Ouch.

315
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,096
What are you
talking about?

316
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,665
I’m old now.
I’m anxious to see
my granddaughter

317
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,668
in her hour of glory.
Great-grandchildren,
too.

318
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,103
You’re kidding me.

319
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,704
Really,
Grandfather!

320
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,573
Enough is enough!

321
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,675
Give the poor guy
a break.

322
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,678
Look. Now she’s upset.

323
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,347
By the way...

324
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,417
what are you
training for
specifically?

325
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,719
Uh, well...I don’t
really wanna...

326
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,754
Tell me, Ryu.

327
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,155
I, um...

328
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,324
Still undecided, eh? Huh?

329
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,427
You’re searching
for something.

330
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,530
The path to a so-called
true martial arts master.

331
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,098
How could you
know that?

332
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,566
If you like,
you can stay here

333
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,235
till you find
what you’re looking for.

334
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,271
I’ll take
good care of you.

335
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,807
Grandpa, why are you
so concerned about me?

336
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,877
[chuckles]
By the way, Ryu,

337
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,414
the man
that you encountered
earlier today--

338
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,550
that man
was a true demon,
wasn’t he?

339
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,220
Gouki.

340
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,460
I remember seeing him
when I was still a kid,

341
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,163
when I was just starting
to understand about the world.

342
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,134
I don’t remember
where or when
I first saw him.

343
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,538
I was fascinated...
but scared more
than anything else.

344
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,806
[soft growl]

345
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,142
Those huge hands
that he had.

346
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,812
Come to think of it,
it must be my fate

347
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,182
to fight that man.
That must be it.

348
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,889
Interesting how
things work out.

349
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,560
I ended up staying
at this old man’s house
for a while.

350
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,562
Life there was fun.

351
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,431
But I couldn’t find
answers about myself

352
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,302
or about my impending
battle with that monster.

353
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,704
And yet,
time seemed to fly.

354
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,340
[grunting]

355
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,609
[grunting continues]

356
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,511
Ohh...Ohhh!

357
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:35,848
Uhh...

358
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,584
[Grandpa
chuckles]

359
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,885
[groaning]
[stretching
sound]

360
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,853
[groans]

361
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,664
Good morning
to you.

362
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,468
How can I be out here
shopping like this

363
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,203
instead of
preparing myself?

364
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,508
That man
killed a master.

365
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,210
He actually killed him
with one blow.

366
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,548
I know the Master
has forbidden me

367
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,251
to fight that man
under any circumstances.

368
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,555
But what is it
that I really want to do?

369
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,791
Sorry about this.

370
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,260
Huh? Oh.

371
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,362
You’re busy
with your training,

372
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,464
and here I made you
come shopping with me.

373
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,233
Oh. Uh...no.
Not a problem.

374
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,737
Um...what about
mackerel today?

375
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,005
That sounds good.

376
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,374
[crow caws distantly]
[gong]

377
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,812
Shopping took a little longer
than expected, didn’t it?

378
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,481
Yeah.

379
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,850
So, have you
been practicing
martial arts

380
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,318
since you
were little?

381
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,388
Yes. But I really
started getting serious

382
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,323
when I began training
under Master Gouken.

383
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,261
And what about
your parents?

384
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,397
They died
when I was little.

385
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,566
I’m sorry
I brought it up.

386
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,734
No. You don’t
need to worry.

387
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,370
To be honest,
I don’t remember
anything.

388
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,505
[gong]

389
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,675
I know
that I was left

390
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,276
to be raised
at a temple

391
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,378
when I was just a baby,
and I have nothing more

392
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,347
than vague memories
of that time.

393
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,685
Eventually,
I left that temple.

394
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,789
And...
did you run away?

395
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,391
Run away? Yeah.

396
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,660
I couldn’t bear
the loneliness.

397
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,697
I was out of control
and did reckless things
back then.

398
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,635
Then I started training
under Master Gouken.

399
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,904
Life was more structured
and more serene.

400
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,475
Until that day...

401
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,977
when that man
appeared again.

402
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,882
It was raining that day.

403
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,086
Do you remember
the rain, Gouken?

404
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,456
You’ll pay!

405
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,091
No, Ryu.

406
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,760
[strained breathing]

407
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,595
[rapid, short breaths]

408
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,796
[Ryu]
But...

409
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,732
[struggles to breathe]
But....

410
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,535
Ryu.

411
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,803
What is it?

412
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,473
What, Fuka?

413
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,909
Ryu, why do you feel

414
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,778
that you have to
fight such a man?

415
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,580
[snickers]
You know,

416
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,116
my father was
a martial arts
master, too.

417
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,117
Yeah?

418
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,818
Yes, just like you.

419
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:27,886
My father
wanted to become

420
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,988
a true
martial arts master.

421
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,125
And he trained
under my grandfather.

422
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,461
One day there was
a big match.

423
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,931
My father died
in that battle.

424
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,737
[sniffles]
Don’t mind me.

425
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,906
[sniffles]
I’m sorry.

426
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,909
It’s all right.

427
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:51,910
[woman screams]

428
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,878
Huh?

429
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,915
You’re Ryu!

430
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,417
Oh, my!

431
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,652
You...are...

432
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,722
I found you!
At last!

433
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,690
Ohh...

434
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,763
[muttering]

435
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:12,764
Mmm...mmm...

436
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,633
What
an appetite!

437
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,635
Uhh. Mmm.
[gulps]

438
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,403
Now I’m fine.

439
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,673
I could hardly
believe it when
you passed out.

440
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,108
That’s because it took
a while to get here,

441
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,510
and I hardly
ate or drank
the whole time.

442
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,779
Where was it
that you traveled from?

443
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,614
I started
in Tokyo.

444
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,650
Tokyo?
Tokyo?

445
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,720
I really wanted
to find you, Ryu.
Yeah?

446
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,689
Wanted to find Ryu?
Hmm. Me?

447
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,925
You must be
exhausted.

448
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,694
No, no.
Wait a minute.

449
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,563
What I would like
to know is,

450
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,598
who was it who told you
to look for me here?

451
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,033
Ken told me.

452
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,937
Ken did?
Are you telling me
that you know Ken?

453
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,106
Yes. I met him
in Tokyo.

454
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,707
Ken told me that
he was coming here

455
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,909
for the anniversary
of the Master’s death.

456
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,949
Um...

457
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,150
Ryu?
Yeah?

458
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,418
Please.

459
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,888
I want you to fight
a match with me!

460
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:10,856
What?

461
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,960
What in the world
are you talking about?

462
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,862
Ever since I saw you,

463
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,165
I knew you weren’t just
a regular street fighter.

464
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,869
I knew you were
a true fighter,

465
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,572
and I’ve been
training extra hard
for this opportunity.

466
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,841
That’s what
I’m talkin' about.

467
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,944
[Grandpa]
Ha ha ha! She’s expecting
great things of you, Ryu.

468
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,047
What is a true
fighter, anyway?

469
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,051
I am not a true fighter.

470
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,889
I haven’t come close
to that level yet.

471
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,261
I have to fight...

472
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:53,799
or I’m afraid
I’ll never be content.

473
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,767
All right,
let’s do it.
Huh?

474
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,235
It’ll be
a learning
experience.

475
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,603
[excited breath]

476
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,206
All right!

477
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,040
[laughs excitedly]

478
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,951
Let’s go!

479
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,687
I’m ready for you!

480
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,631
[panting]

481
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,933
Uh...

482
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,202
[shouting in Japanese]

483
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,039
Huhh!
Yahh!

484
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,810
[grunting,
breathing hard]

485
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,813
Ryu, you’re
holding back on me.

486
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:42,848
Huh?
You’re not using

487
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,250
all of your ability.

488
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,152
But why?

489
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,553
’Cause you think I'm weak?

490
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,588
That’s an insult!

491
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,755
Uhhh!

492
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,759
Huhh!
Uhh! Uhh!

493
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,161
[sobs]

494
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,196
Sakura!

495
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,097
[shakily]
I’m all right.

496
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,634
Ryu. Again.

497
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,635
Please.

498
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,036
[Ryu]
This girl.

499
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,072
She stands up to me
with all her strength,

500
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,641
knowing she’s
no match for me.

501
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,109
[Sakura coughs,
gasps]

502
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,913
[Sakura grunting]

503
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,182
[fight grunts]

504
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,150
She’s right.

505
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,653
There’s no question.
I really do
want to fight.

506
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,958
I’m going to fight
that man!

507
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,628
[Sakura shouts, groans]

508
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,196
[grunts, sighs]

509
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,001
[sighs, breathes slowly]

510
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,974
Mmhh...

511
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,211
[grunts painfully]

512
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,655
Thank you very much.

513
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,658
It was a very good
lesson for me.

514
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,227
No. I thank you.

515
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,795
I’m the one
who learned here.

516
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,763
Hmm?

517
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,167
It’s obvious.

518
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,102
No matter
the consequences,

519
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,139
I just want
to fight that man.

520
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,341
I have to fight.

521
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,944
Or I can never find
what I’m looking for.

522
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,081
[steam hissing,
water splashing]

523
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,053
[sighs]

524
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,988
That’s great.

525
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,825
[sighing]

526
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,994
[both laugh]

527
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,096
[splat]

528
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,202
I see. Then you’re
not his real granddaughter,
Fuka?

529
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,072
Well, no. I know
that we’re distant
relatives, though.

530
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,240
So you’ve had
a tough life.

531
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,876
Not really.
I mean...

532
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,878
some people think so,
but at least

533
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,680
I had my grandpa around.

534
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:59,217
Grandpa is such
a funny man,
isn’t he?

535
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,054
But he seems so old.
I wonder how old he is.

536
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,124
Well, he’s been
the same ever since
I can remember.

537
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,360
I guess he must be
over 90.

538
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,362
Wow! That’s amazing!

539
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,163
Yeah, and he is healthy,

540
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,399
and he really
is young at heart.

541
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,800
Hey!

542
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,105
Wahh!

543
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,808
Oh, Grandfather!

544
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,977
He really is
funny, huh?

545
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,312
Oh.

546
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:31,449
Fuka, you know,
I think Ryu
actually enjoys it.

547
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,450
What?

548
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,752
To fight.

549
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,957
I wonder if he is
going to fight.

550
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,975
[sighs]
It’s morning.

551
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,978
Those clouds
look pretty bad.

552
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,780
Probably a storm
comin’ in.

553
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,420
Are you leaving,
Ryu?

554
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,355
Grandpa.

555
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,193
[chuckles]
Apparently, you are.
You are leaving.

556
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,128
You’ve made up your mind.

557
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:54,032
Go to the old
castle ruins
behind Gotuku Temple.

558
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,901
He will most certainly
appear there.

559
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,204
Accept your fate, Ryu.

560
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,172
[rain falling]

561
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,481
[yawning]

562
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,448
Good morning,
Fuka.

563
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,088
Oh. It’s raining.

564
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,859
Have you seen
Ryu yet?

565
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,194
He left early...
before dawn.

566
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,162
Huh?

567
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,468
[panting]

568
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,343
Go back, Ken Masters.

569
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,879
Who the hell
are you, old man?

570
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,515
You cannot get involved
in this battle.

571
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,517
This is the fate
of those two.

572
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,352
Maybe so.

573
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,188
But what does this
have to do with you,
huh?

574
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,924
Sorry. I have to reach
Ryu,

575
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,527
and anybody who gets in my way
is gonna regret it.

576
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,494
You got that?

577
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,644
[blow delivered]
Uhhhh!

578
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,213
Hmm. Not as good
as you claim.

579
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,548
Let go!

580
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,584
Grandpa, I can’t
let him go through
with this.

581
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,553
Ryu is fine.

582
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,656
He doesn’t need
a guardian anymore.
Uhh!

583
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,391
What are you saying?

584
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,294
You know, I followed Ryu
all the way out here to--

585
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,462
You are a pupil
of Gouken, right?

586
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,131
So?

587
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,133
I know why you’re here.

588
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,167
Huh?

589
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,937
To prevent
Ryu’s Dark Hadou

590
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,072
from being awakened
by those two

591
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,941
when they fight
each other,

592
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,578
and to prevent
another tragedy
from happening.

593
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,681
Gouken had a kind
heart and soul.

594
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,418
You. Who the hell are you?

595
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,486
[rumbling]

596
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,422
[steam hissing]

597
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,189
Master.

598
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:11,302
[roars softly]

599
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,504
[growls]

600
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,505
[grunting]

601
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,506
[Ken]
How can you say that

602
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,575
Ryu’s Dark Hadou
won’t awaken?

603
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,278
Do you have any idea

604
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,580
what the Dark Hadou
really is, old man?

605
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,383
Yes. The Dark Hadou

606
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:29,020
has the power to destroy
every living thing
in this world.

607
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,461
Long ago,
there lived a people

608
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,665
with a natural ability
to fight with titanic force.

609
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,233
Hadouken!

610
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,704
Hadou--
Aaahhh!

611
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,306
[grunts]

612
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,107
[grunts]

613
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,109
[growls]

614
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,979
[Grandpa]
Many of these people

615
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,249
were used by those
who ruled at the time.

616
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,718
Their sole purpose
was to fight.

617
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,587
[growling]
Aah!

618
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,664
But they did not deserve
to be used for such evil.

619
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:19,304
Now, one day,
a horrible event
took place.

620
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,738
Huhh!

621
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,074
The days
of consecutive killing

622
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,109
began to awaken
the devil

623
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,078
that lay dormant
within them.

624
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,213
Once the devil
is awakened,

625
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,650
it is said to consume
not only the person’s body

626
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,320
but that person’s
entire being!

627
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:41,392
Ken, that is
the true identity
of the Dark Hadou.

628
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,394
And those two
have inherited

629
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,330
the contaminated
bloodline!

630
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,266
[chuckles softly]

631
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,568
Unfortunately,
the cycle of bad karma

632
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,103
has not been broken.

633
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,441
Huh?

634
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,579
What power!

635
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,349
My skills...

636
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,617
don’t work at all
against him.

637
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,388
Gouken!

638
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,725
I was not wrong
to walk the path
of a fighter.

639
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,728
The fact that Ryu is here
proves I’m right!

640
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,496
[grunting]

641
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,498
[gasps]

642
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,466
Aah!

643
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,475
Fuka. What is this?

644
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,145
Uh...huh?

645
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,486
Ryu.

646
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,188
[growling]

647
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,764
He’s so strong!

648
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,800
My blocking arm
is starting to feel numb.

649
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,603
But I know I can win if I--

650
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,738
The hell with being
a true fighter!

651
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,807
What on earth
is the difference,
anyway?

652
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,576
Damn!

653
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,578
Damn!

654
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,313
Damn!!
Uhh!

655
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,204
Aaahh! Aah!

656
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,855
[roaring]

657
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,791
Yes! That’s right, Ryu.

658
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,228
That is
the power coursing
within our blood.

659
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,564
The wakeup call
of a true fighter!

660
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,432
[growls]

661
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,441
Oh, what is this?

662
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,440
[gasps]

663
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,216
[gasps]

664
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,511
The detestable events
of the past

665
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,946
all relate to the blood

666
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,582
flowing through the veins
of those people.

667
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,318
This evil blood
ultimately causes men

668
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,487
to destroy
not only their enemies,

669
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,756
but also their allies,
their loved ones,

670
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:32,890
and themselves.

671
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,411
Hoohh!

672
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,413
[growling] Hoohh!

673
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,926
Come on, Ryu.

674
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,062
All you want
is to be strong.

675
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,598
That is
our miserable fate.

676
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,714
What’s this?

677
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,681
Uhh.

678
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,421
Fuka.

679
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,457
But, uh...

680
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,760
Ryu, your path to become
a true fighter

681
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,429
has been obscured.

682
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,099
Through your reverence
for your teacher,

683
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,936
you’ve forsaken
your natural thirst
to be strong.

684
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,472
You’re wrong.
It’s made me strong.

685
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,541
[growling]

686
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,709
Die, you!

687
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:09,487
Uhh!

688
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,794
[growling]

689
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,763
[growling]

690
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,412
Uhh...

691
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,696
The one...

692
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,131
who became...

693
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:29,667
...strong.

694
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,470
Uhh.

695
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,404
[splat]

696
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,539
Uhh...

697
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,409
Uhh...

698
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,485
So...

699
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,620
this is the end...

700
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,155
Gouken.

701
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,190
The end of the one
who was swallowed up.

702
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,113
[thud]

703
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,882
My name is Gouki!

704
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,786
The one who became strong...

705
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:26,023
someday...someday,
I intend to fight you again.

706
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,737
[Grandpa]
It was a long time ago.

707
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,840
A man left a newborn child
in my care.

708
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,643
He said the mother had died.

709
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:50,014
He said she died
shortly after giving birth
to the baby boy.

710
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,117
Before he left,
the man made me promise

711
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,022
not to let the child
follow in the father’s
path. That child

712
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,625
was away from me
for a brief moment.
But...

713
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,627
[grunts]

714
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,567
Go now.

715
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,806
I kept the promise

716
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,642
that I made to you
that day...

717
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,643
Gouken.

718
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,681
I’m tired.

719
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,585
I wonder why it feels
as if I’ve lived too long.

720
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,957
[wind roars]

721
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,231
[birds twittering peacefully]

722
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,044
[deep rumbling]

723
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,793
