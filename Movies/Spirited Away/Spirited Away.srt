1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,431
I'll miss you, Chihiro.

2
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,565
Your best friend, Rumi.

3
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:20,854
Chihiro, Chihiro, we're almost there.

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,196
This really is in the middle of nowhere.

5
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:28,188
I'm gonna have to go to the next town to shop.

6
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,279
We'll just have to learn to like it.

7
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:35,413
Look, Chihiro, there's your new school.

8
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:36,490
Looks great, doesn't it?

9
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:39,562
It doesn't look so bad.

10
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:50,750
It's gonna stink, I liked my old school.

11
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:54,888
Mom!

12
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,826
My flowers are dying.

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,059
I told you not to smother them like that.

14
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,215
We'll put them in water when we get to our new home.

15
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,573
1 finally get a bouquet, and it's a goodbye present.

16
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:07,629
That's depressing.

17
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:09,621
Daddy bought you a rose for your birthday.

18
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:10,809
Don't you remember?

19
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:11,960
Yeah, one.

20
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:14,003
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,752
Hold on to your card, I'm opening the window.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,503
And quit whining, it's fun to move to a new place.

23
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:21,643
It's an adventure.

24
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:57,702
Wait.

25
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,045
Did I take the wrong turn?

26
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:02,682
This can't be right.

27
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:04,494
Look, there's our house.

28
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:05,430
Huh?

29
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,704
It's that blue one on the end.

30
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:09,396
Oh, you're right.

31
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,050
I must have missed the turnoff.

32
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,782
This road should get us there.

33
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:16,664
Honey don't take a shortcut, you always get us lost.

34
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:18,517
Trust me, it's gonna work.

35
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,910
What are those stones?

36
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:21,783
They look like little houses.

37
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:22,870
They're shrines.

38
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:25,491
Some people think little spirits live there.

39
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:32,407
Dad, I think we're lost.

40
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,987
We're fine, I've got four-wheel drive.

41
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,465
Sit down, please, sweetie.

42
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:56,515
Honey, honey, honey!

43
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:59,391
Slow down! You're gonna kill us.

44
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:01,934
What's that?

45
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:18,230
What's this old building?

46
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,192
It looks like an entrance.

47
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,388
Honey, get back in the car, we're going to be late.

48
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,293
Chihiro.

49
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:29,345
Oh, for heaven's sake.

50
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:31,371
This building is not old. It's fake.

51
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:33,897
These stones are just made of plaster.

52
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,749
The wind is pulling us in.

53
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:47,133
What is it?

54
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:49,645
Come on, let's go in. I wanna
see what's on the other side.

55
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:51,097
I'm not going.

56
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,425
It gives me the creeps.

57
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:54,871
Don't be such a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.

58
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:56,371
Let's just take a look.

59
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:59,233
The movers will get to our house before we do.

60
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,568
It's all right, they've got the keys.

61
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,920
They can start without us.

62
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:04,453
All right just a quick look.

63
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:06,262
Forget it, I'm not going.

64
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:08,942
Come on, you guys.

65
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,100
Let's get out of here.

66
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,150
Come on, honey.

67
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:12,125
It'll be fun.

68
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:13,365
I'm not going!

69
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,092
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

70
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:27,953
But, Mom!

71
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,966
Wait for me!

72
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,578
Everybody, watch your step.

73
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,849
Chihiro, don't cling like that, you'll make me trip.

74
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,623
What is this place?

75
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,235
Oh, do you hear that?

76
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:27,802
It sounds like a train.

77
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,582
We must be near a train station.

78
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,131
Come on. Let's go check it out.

79
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,262
What are those weird buildings?

80
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,508
I knew it.

81
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:14,248
It's an abandoned theme park.

82
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:14,835
See?

83
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,245
They built them everywhere in the early '90s.

84
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:22,765
Then the economy went bad, and they all went bankrupt.

85
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,862
This must be one of them.

86
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:28,557
Where are you going, you said just a quick look!

87
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:30,177
Now let's go back.

88
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:34,685
Hey!

89
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:47,562
Did you hear that building, it was moaning.

90
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:48,858
It's just the wind.

91
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,399
Oh, what a beautiful place.

92
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:54,244
We should have brought our lunch.
Then we could have had a picnic.

93
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,187
Look, they were planning to put a river here.

94
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:01,125
Hmm?

95
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:05,643
Hey, you smell that?

96
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:08,878
Something smells delicious.

97
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,207
Yeah, and I'm starving.

98
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,788
Maybe this theme park is still in business, let's go.

99
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:14,639
Chihiro, hurry it up.

100
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,639
Wait a minute.

101
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:39,434
Over there.

102
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:50,843
This way.

103
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,295
How strange.

104
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:58,908
They're all restaurants.

105
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:00,783
Where is everybody?

106
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:05,096
Ah, there it is.

107
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:11,414
Hey, I found it!

108
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:24,149
Hey, you gotta see this, in here.

109
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
Ah, look at this.

110
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:32,434
Hello in there, does anybody work here?

111
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,351
Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.

112
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:35,199
Mm-mmm.

113
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:36,416
Anybody?

114
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:44,354
Don't worry, honey we can pay the bill when they get back.

115
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:45,655
Good plan.

116
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,381
Hey, that looks great.

117
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,024
I wonder what this is called.

118
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,475
Oh, it's delicious, Chihiro, you have to taste this.

119
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,333
I don't want any, we're gonna get in trouble.

120
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:58,899
Let's just get out of here.

121
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:01,846
Don't worry, you've got Daddy here.

122
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,689
He's got credit cards and cash.

123
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,912
Chihiro, you have to try this it's so tender.

124
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:11,638
Mm-mmm.

125
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:13,755
Mustard?

126
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,755
Thank you.

127
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:28,026
Come on, you guys you can't!

128
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:38,822
That's weird.

129
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:50,989
It's a bathhouse.

130
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,380
There's the train.

131
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,824
You shouldn't be here, get out of here now!

132
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,190
What?

133
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,325
It's almost night.

134
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,142
Leave, before it gets dark.

135
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,205
They're lighting the lamps.

136
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:32,229
Get out of here.

137
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:33,286
You've gotta get across the river.

138
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,492
Go, I'll distract them!

139
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:50,369
What's up with him?

140
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:00,353
Mom!

141
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,029
Dad!

142
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:02,434
Come on!

143
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:03,422
Quit eating!

144
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,056
Let's get out of here!

145
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:35,636
Mom, Dad, where are you?

146
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:46,045
Mommy!

147
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,546
Water?

148
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:23,871
What?

149
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:25,231
I'm dreaming!

150
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:26,119
I'm dreaming!

151
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,511
Come on wake up, wake up!

152
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:33,268
Wake up.

153
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:43,168
It's just a dream, it's just a dream, go away.

154
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:44,293
Away.

155
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,186
Disappear.

156
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,888
I'm see-through!

157
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,004
It's just a bad dream.

158
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,098
Ah!

159
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:33,915
Oh!

160
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,691
Don't be afraid, I just wanna help you.

161
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:59,300
No, no, no!

162
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:01,263
Open your mouth and eat this.

163
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,219
You have to eat some food from
this world, or else you'll disappear.

164
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:05,132
No!

165
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:12,148
Don't worry it won't turn you into a pig.

166
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:15,993
Chew it and swallow.

167
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,545
There you go, you're all better.

168
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:28,134
See for yourself.

169
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,979
I'm okay.

170
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:38,836
You see?

171
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,568
Now, come with me.

172
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:41,846
Where are my mom and dad?

173
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,769
They, didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

174
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:46,665
You can't see them now, but you will.

175
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:51,481
Don't move.

176
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:12,575
That bird's looking for you, you've gotta get out of here.

177
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,277
Ah! My legs! I can't stand up.

178
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,176
Help! What do I do?

179
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,322
Calm down, take a deep breath.

180
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:28,409
In the name of the wind and water within thee, unbind her.

181
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:29,427
Get up.

182
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:02,790
Welcome.

183
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:03,925
Welcome.

184
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,268
Always nice to see you, welcome back.

185
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:08,758
Welcome.

186
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:10,025
Welcome.

187
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:12,282
Welcome back!

188
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:14,825
You have to hold your breath while we cross the bridge.

189
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,193
Even the tiniest breath will break the spell,

190
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:20,783
and then everyone will see you.

191
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:25,669
Welcome back.

192
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:27,671
I'm scared.

193
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,372
Now just stay calm.

194
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:32,836
Welcome, welcome! Always nice to see you.

195
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,631
Welcome back, welcome, welcome.

196
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:37,045
I'm back from my mission.

197
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,992
Welcome.

198
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:39,842
Welcome back, Master Haku.

199
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:41,175
Take a deep breath.

200
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:43,719
Hold it.

201
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,856
Welcome, welcome!

202
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:05,640
Welcome back, good to see you.

203
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:07,029
Hang on.

204
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:07,856
Almost there.

205
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:10,358
Master Haku!

206
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,622
Where have you been?

207
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:15,506
Wha, a human?

208
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:17,661
Let's go!

209
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,343
Huh, hah, huh?

210
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:35,790
Master Haku!

211
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,806
Oh, Master Haku?

212
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,116
it stinks up the place!

213
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,236
They know you're here.

214
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:44,870
I'm sorry, I took a breath.

215
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,246
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

216
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:49,684
Listen carefully to what ll tell you to do.

217
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,813
You can't stay here, they'll find you,

218
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,785
and you'll never get to rescue your parents.

219
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:55,606
I'll create a diversion while you escape.

220
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:58,282
No don't leave me, I don't wanna be alone.

221
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,389
You don't have any choice,

222
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,762
if you want to help your parents.

223
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:03,684
This is what you have to do.

224
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,339
They did turn into pigs, I wasn't dreaming.

225
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:09,182
Don't worry.

226
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:13,741
Now, when things quiet down, go out through the back gate.

227
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:17,531
Go all the way down the stairs
until you reach the boiler room,

228
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,819
where they stoke the fires.

229
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,903
There you'll find Kamaji, the boiler man.

230
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:25,149
Kamaji?

231
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:27,750
Tell him you want to work here.

232
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:30,498
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

233
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:34,403
If you don't get a job, Yubaba
will turn you into an animal.

234
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:35,670
Yubaba.

235
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,459
Huh?

236
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:38,927
You'll see she's the witch who rules the bathhouse.

237
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:42,328
Kamaji will try to turn you
away or trick you into leaving,

238
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:44,210
but just keep asking for work.

239
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,403
It'll be hard work, but you'll be able to stay here.

240
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:49,604
Then, even Yubaba can't harm you.

241
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:51,186
Master Haku?

242
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:52,807
Master Haku, where are you?

243
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:57,066
I have to go and don't forget, Chihiro, I'm your friend.

244
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,242
How did you know my name's Chihiro?

245
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,554
I've known you since you were very small.

246
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:04,866
Good luck, and whatever you do, don't make a sound.

247
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:06,511
Master Haku?

248
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:08,068
Calm down, I'm coming.

249
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:12,392
Master Haku, Yubaba wants to see you.

250
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:15,766
I know, it's about my mission, right?

251
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:27,399
Uh, hello, excuse me.

252
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,321
Uh, hello?

253
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:45,070
Uh, hello are you Kamaji?

254
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:46,175
Eh?

255
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,421
Haku told me to come here and ask you for work.

256
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:56,654
Could you give me a job please?

257
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,471
Four bath tokens at once.

258
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:07,655
Come on get to work, you little runts.

259
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:10,861
Yeah, I'm Kamaji,

260
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:13,663
slave to the boiler that heats the baths.

261
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:16,146
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

262
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:19,523
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

263
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,528
I don't need any help.

264
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,583
The place is full of soot, l'll just cast a spell on them

265
00:25:24,615 --> 00:25:27,044
and I've got all the workers I need.

266
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:43,381
Oh sorry.

267
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:48,442
Wait, just a second.

268
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:01,972
Out of the way.

269
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:57,088
What should I do with this?

270
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:05,953
Should ll leave it here?

271
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,971
Finish what you started, human.

272
00:28:08,283 --> 00:28:12,198
Hey, you runts, you wanna turn back into soot?

273
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,892
And you, back off, you can't just take someone else's job.

274
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:18,062
If they don't work, the spell wears off.

275
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,532
They turn back into soot.

276
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:23,042
There's no work for you here, got it, try somewhere else!

277
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,721
You soot balls got a problem, now get back to work!

278
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:40,028
Chow time, what's going on?

279
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:41,632
Are you guys fighting again?

280
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:44,630
Where's your other bowl?

281
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:46,124
From yesterday?

282
00:28:47,054 --> 00:28:49,126
I keep telling you to leave it out, Kamaji.

283
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:51,437
Meal time take a break!

284
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:08,510
A human!

285
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,957
You're in trouble.

286
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,997
You're the one everyone's looking for.

287
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:14,954
She's my granddaughter.

288
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:15,867
Granddaughter?

289
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:18,792
She said she wants to work here,

290
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:20,978
but I've got all the help I need.

291
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,661
Would you take her to see Yubaba?

292
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,384
She's a tough little girl.

293
00:29:24,786 --> 00:29:26,252
I think she can handle it.

294
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:29,270
No way, I'm not gonna risk my life.

295
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:33,379
What if I give you this roasted newt, hmm?

296
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:35,079
It's a good one.

297
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,894
If you want a job, you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.

298
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:42,428
She's the head honcho here.

299
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:44,368
Give me that.

300
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:46,909
Come on little girl, you better follow me.

301
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:55,908
Can't you even manage a yes, ma'am or a thank you?

302
00:29:56,114 --> 00:29:56,697
Yes, ma'am.

303
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,645
What a dope.

304
00:29:57,827 --> 00:29:58,351
Hurry up.

305
00:29:58,883 --> 00:29:59,423
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:05,406
You don't need your shoes or your socks. Just leave 'em.

307
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:06,009
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:30:12,003 --> 00:30:13,534
Thank the boiler man, you idiot.

309
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,766
You know, he's really sticking his neck out for you.

310
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:19,673
Thank you, Mr. Boiler Man!

311
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:22,797
Good luck.

312
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:36,015
We have to go all the way to the
top floor. That's where Yubaba lives.

313
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:51,089
Get over here.

314
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,174
You wanna lose your nose?

315
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,099
More appetizers.

316
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,179
Not spicy enough.

317
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:24,775
We're halfway there just stay close.

318
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,069
Okay.

319
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,116
Here we go.

320
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:36,618
The Radish Spirit.

321
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,506
Sorry, sir this elevator doesn't go any higher.

322
00:31:44,515 --> 00:31:46,654
You'll have to take another one, thank you.

323
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:10,187
He's following us.

324
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:11,594
Just don't look at him.

325
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,120
Step out to the right, please, gentlemen.

326
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,858
Your rooms are right this way.

327
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:40,004
Hmm, Lin?

328
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,632
What?

329
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:44,659
What's that smell?

330
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:48,140
It's human you smell just like a human.

331
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:49,331
Oh, really?

332
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:52,414
Where's it coming from, Lin, come on.

333
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:55,218
You're hiding something, aren't you?

334
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:58,141
Show it to me.

335
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,651
Is this what you smell?

336
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:01,368
Roasted...

337
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:02,346
newt!

338
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,703
No way, frog, I'm saving every last bite for myself.

339
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,549
Please, just a little bit, just give me a leg.

340
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:13,253
If you wanna go up, pull the lever on your right.

341
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:17,201
Gimme, gimme, gimme, how could you be so cruel?

342
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,982
Can't you share?

343
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:24,433
Let me please suck on the tail, please!

344
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,424
Let me just...

345
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,337
Aren't you even going to knock?

346
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:04,466
You're the most pathetic little girl I've ever seen.

347
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:16,558
Well, come in.

348
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:22,041
I said, come in.

349
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,208
Quiet down you're making a racket.

350
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:14,263
Excuse me, I was wondering if you could give me a job?

351
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:25,578
I don't want to hear such a stupid request.

352
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:29,185
You're just a stinking, useless weakling.

353
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:33,364
And this is certainly no place for humans.

354
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:37,663
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

355
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:41,123
It's where they come to replenish themselves.

356
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:45,542
And you humans always make a mess of things.

357
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:49,856
Like your parents, who gobbled up
the food of the spirits like pigs.

358
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:51,762
They got what they deserved.

359
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:54,520
And you should be punished too.

360
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,656
You could be a piglet.

361
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,718
Or, maybe you'd prefer a lump of coal?

362
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:17,115
l can see you shaking.

363
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:19,673
Actually, I'm impressed you made it this far.

364
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:22,310
But I'm sure you didn't do it on your own.

365
00:37:23,788 --> 00:37:25,654
Let's thank whoever helped you.

366
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,359
Just who was it dear, why don't you tell me?

367
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,317
Please! Can't you give me a job?

368
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:36,888
Don't start that again.

369
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,581
Please, l just want to work.

370
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:43,810
Don't say that!

371
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:50,650
Why in world do you think l should give you a job?

372
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:57,443
Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled
crybaby, and you have no manners.

373
00:37:57,974 --> 00:38:00,605
This is a high-class place I'm running here.

374
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:03,887
So there's no job for you, now get out.

375
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:06,349
I've got all the lazy bums I need.

376
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:12,723
Or maybe I'll give you the most difficult job I've got,

377
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:19,310
and work you until you breathe your very last breath.

378
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:35,079
Oh, dear, you woke up the baby.

379
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:37,116
Mommy's here.

380
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:38,837
Be a good boy now.

381
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,473
Why are you still here, I told you to leave.

382
00:38:41,673 --> 00:38:43,569
I want you to give me a job, please!

383
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,718
Quiet down you're scaring the baby!

384
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:49,276
Hi, sweetie.

385
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,522
Don't be angry.

386
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,668
That's a good boy.

387
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:56,672
I'm not leaving till you give me a job.

388
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:59,549
Okay okay, just be quiet.

389
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:04,442
Here comes Mommy, I'm coming to get you.

390
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:26,926
That's your contract.

391
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:31,416
Sign your name away, and I'll put you to work.

392
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:37,518
If ll hear one little complaint out of you,
you'll be joining your parents in the pigpen.

393
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,726
So I, do I sign my name here?

394
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,507
Just sign it, do you want the job or not?

395
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:50,177
I can't believe I took that oath.

396
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:53,869
To give a job to anyone who asks.

397
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:59,058
Ridiculous, I hate being so nice all the time!

398
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,300
Are you done yet?

399
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:09,887
So, your name's Chihiro?

400
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:10,816
Yes, ma'am.

401
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,952
What a pretty name.

402
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:25,299
And it belongs to me now.

403
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:29,161
From now on, your name is Sen, you got that?

404
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,661
Answer me, Sen!

405
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:31,694
Yes, ma'am.

406
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:33,783
You called for me?

407
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,918
This girl signed a contract.

408
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:39,274
Set her up with a job.

409
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:40,680
Right.

410
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:42,935
What's your name?

411
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:46,624
What, Chih, oh, it's Sen.

412
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:47,874
Okay, Sen.

413
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:48,964
Follow me.

414
00:40:57,815 --> 00:40:59,287
Haku, uh...

415
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,204
Don't talk to me, and address me as Master Haku.

416
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:22,168
I don't care if Yubaba gets angry with us.

417
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,232
We're not taking humans.

418
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,083
She's already under contract.

419
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,967
What?

420
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:28,641
I promise to work very hard.

421
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,738
We are not gonna take her in our department.

422
00:41:30,814 --> 00:41:32,234
She'll stink up the whole place.

423
00:41:32,296 --> 00:41:33,083
We don't want her.

424
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:35,711
Three days of eating our food, and her smell will go away.

425
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:39,898
And if she doesn't work hard, roast her, boil her,

426
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:41,402
do whatever you want.

427
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,205
Now get back to work.

428
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:44,182
Where is Lin?

429
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:46,898
What, don't you dump her on me.

430
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:48,789
You said you wanted an assistant.

431
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:50,004
That's perfect.

432
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,090
Give the girl to Lin.

433
00:41:51,115 --> 00:41:52,323
Oh, great.

434
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,318
Sen, get going.

435
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:53,937
Right.

436
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:56,353
Why are you picking on me?

437
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:57,778
You owe me one, Haku.

438
00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:58,736
You hear me?

439
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:00,318
Have a nice day.

440
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:01,404
Hmm.

441
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:03,820
Come on.

442
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,433
I can't believe you pulled it off.

443
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:15,093
Huh?

444
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,318
You're such a dope, l was really worried.

445
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:20,338
Now, keep on your toes, and if you need anything, ask me.

446
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:20,897
Okay?

447
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:23,149
Okay.

448
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:24,714
Hmm? What's wrong?

449
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,457
I don't feel so good.

450
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:34,361
So, this is our room.

451
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:37,515
A little food and some sleep and you'll be fine.

452
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:41,836
Here's your apron.

453
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:43,052
You have to wash it yourself.

454
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:44,135
Your pants.

455
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:46,357
You're so puny.

456
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:48,971
Way too big.

457
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:52,959
Lin, you know Haku?

458
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:54,017
What about him?

459
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:56,242
There aren't two of him here, are there?

460
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,173
Two Hakus? I can barely stand one.

461
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,128
Too big.

462
00:43:01,342 --> 00:43:04,447
He's Yubaba's henchman, don't trust anything he says.

463
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,240
Hmm..

464
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:08,698
Let's see..

465
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:12,227
Ah!

466
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,635
Here we go

467
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:15,883
wh-what's wrong with you?

468
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:17,741
Are you feeling okay?

469
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:20,348
Quiet down.

470
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:21,374
What's your problem?

471
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:23,939
It's the new girl, she doesn't feel so good.

472
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:57,434
Meet me at the bridge

473
00:44:57,767 --> 00:44:59,467
I'll take you to your parents.

474
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,016
My shoes are gone.

475
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:52,334
Huh?

476
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:00,843
Thank you.

477
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:10,746
Follow me.

478
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,849
We don't have much time.

479
00:47:22,064 --> 00:47:24,756
If you're found here, you'll
be turned into a pig yourself.

480
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:30,485
You must never come here without me.

481
00:47:30,826 --> 00:47:31,548
Understand?

482
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
I understand.

483
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:55,969
Mom, Dad, are you all right?

484
00:47:55,994 --> 00:47:59,094
It's me, Sen, hey, wake up!

485
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,526
Mom!

486
00:48:00,689 --> 00:48:01,793
Dad!

487
00:48:04,963 --> 00:48:07,029
What's wrong with them, are they sick?

488
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,937
No, they ate too much, they're sleeping it off.

489
00:48:10,164 --> 00:48:11,950
They don't remember being human.

490
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:15,148
So look hard. It's up to you
to remember which ones they are.

491
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:24,621
Don't you worry, I promise I'll get you out of
here. So just don't get any fatter or they'll eat you!

492
00:48:33,273 --> 00:48:34,227
Here are your clothes.

493
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:35,442
Hide them.

494
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:39,230
I thought they'd been thrown away.

495
00:48:39,485 --> 00:48:41,122
You'll need them to get home.

496
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:49,100
My goodbye card's still here.

497
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:52,320
Chihiro..

498
00:48:52,938 --> 00:48:54,045
Chihiro.

499
00:48:54,785 --> 00:48:56,001
That's my name, isn't it?

500
00:48:57,203 --> 00:48:59,927
That's how Yubaba controls you, by stealing your name.

501
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:02,197
So hold on to that card, keep it hidden.

502
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,574
And while you're here, you must call yourself Sen.

503
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:06,514
I can't believe I forgot my name.

504
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:08,104
She almost took it from me.

505
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:11,910
If you completely forget it,
you'll never find your way home.

506
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:15,267
I've tried everything to remember mine.

507
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:17,208
You can't remember your name?

508
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:20,916
No, but for some reason, I remember yours.

509
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:25,899
Here you go, eat this, you must be hungry.

510
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:27,518
No.

511
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:30,856
I put a spell on it so it'll give you back your strength.

512
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:32,496
Just eat it.

513
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:10,660
Have some more, you'll be all right.

514
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:25,334
I've got to go now, I'll be back to help you soon.

515
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,972
Just stay out of trouble.

516
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:30,015
Thank you Haku, you're a good friend.

517
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,212
Haku.

518
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:51,321
He's a dragon?

519
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,599
Where were you Sen, I was really worried.

520
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:08,727
I'm sorry.

521
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:19,181
Out of my way.

522
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,547
Gee, Sen!

523
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:34,835
Haven't you ever worked a day in your life?

524
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:37,810
Lin and Sen, you get the big tub today.

525
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:38,429
What?

526
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:40,078
Hey, that's frog work.

527
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:42,646
Orders from the top, so quit your complaining!

528
00:53:03,938 --> 00:53:06,144
Hello, aren't you getting wet out there?

529
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:11,366
Sen, hurry up.

530
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:12,622
Coming.

531
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:14,711
I'll leave the door open for you.

532
00:53:42,274 --> 00:53:43,901
Heard you got the big tub, Lin.

533
00:53:43,926 --> 00:53:45,045
Leave me alone.

534
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,433
Those jerks, they haven't cleaned this tub in months.

535
00:54:03,621 --> 00:54:06,373
We only use this tub for our really filthy guests.

536
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:10,887
Uh, Disgusting, this sludge is so
caked on, it'll take days to scrub off.

537
00:54:11,256 --> 00:54:14,092
Lin, Sen, you've got some customers on the way.

538
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:14,608
Wait!

539
00:54:14,633 --> 00:54:17,509
Give us a minute, this is clearly harassment.

540
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:19,442
We'll have to soak it off.

541
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:21,702
Get an herbal soak token from the foreman.

542
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:22,365
what?

543
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,210
An herbal soak token.

544
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:28,060
All right.

545
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:31,697
Hey, Lin, what's a foreman?

546
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:35,068
Hmm..

547
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,632
Something's coming, I wonder what?

548
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:50,501
What useless scum is sleeking around in the rain?

549
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:17,899
I can't waste a token on you.

550
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,764
Relax, good morning.

551
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:20,982
Enjoy.

552
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:22,205
Have a nice bath.

553
00:55:22,316 --> 00:55:23,635
For the Radish Spirit.

554
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:25,693
One sulfur soak.

555
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:28,846
Why are you still standing here, scrub it yourself.

556
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:30,832
I'm not giving you a token.

557
00:55:30,975 --> 00:55:32,383
Relax, good morning.

558
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,321
I said scrub it yourself.

559
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,228
But ll was told it has to have an herbal soak.

560
00:55:37,686 --> 00:55:39,342
Well, that's too bad.

561
00:55:39,432 --> 00:55:40,882
Mugwort bath?

562
00:55:41,436 --> 00:55:43,558
Relax and enjoy it.

563
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,547
Emm?

564
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:53,719
Foreman speaking.

565
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:54,963
Oh! Yes.

566
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:56,687
What!

567
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:58,349
Thank you very much.

568
00:55:58,546 --> 00:55:59,483
Get back here!

569
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:00,020
Hey!

570
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:01,221
Wait a minute.

571
00:56:01,246 --> 00:56:02,325
What's going on?

572
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,015
Nothing, everything's fine.

573
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:05,641
We have an intruder.

574
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,762
Is it a human?

575
00:56:06,857 --> 00:56:08,231
I'm not quite sure.

576
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:09,987
Figure it out and report back.

577
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,324
Wow, Sen, you got a really good one.

578
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:14,230
Clip this on, then let go.

579
00:56:16,202 --> 00:56:18,838
It goes straight to Kamaji, then he sends us our water.

580
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:27,472
You pull on this to start the
water flowing, give it a try.

581
00:56:36,316 --> 00:56:37,976
Uh, you're such a klutz.

582
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:39,341
Yuck!

583
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:40,408
What's in this water?

584
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:43,355
Dried worm salt, it's supposed to be good for you.

585
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:46,755
And with water this murky, you
can't see all the sludge in the tub.

586
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:51,165
Yank it again when the bath is full, it'll stop.

587
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,026
You can let go of the rope
now, I'll get us some breakfast.

588
00:56:55,336 --> 00:56:56,503
Okay.

589
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:27,798
Uh, sir the bath's not ready yet.

590
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,744
There're so many.

591
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:37,650
Uh, uh, uh...

592
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:39,739
What and they're all for me?

593
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:42,067
Uh, uh...

594
00:57:42,854 --> 00:57:45,164
Thanks, but I don't need any more.

595
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,822
Uh...

596
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:48,640
No.

597
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,005
I only need one.

598
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:05,337
Oh, Yubaba.

599
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:06,767
It's a stink spirit.

600
00:58:07,071 --> 00:58:09,097
And apparently, it's an extra smelly one.

601
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:11,386
He, he's headed straight for the bridge.

602
00:58:11,812 --> 00:58:12,482
Go away.

603
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,356
That's enough.

604
00:58:13,412 --> 00:58:15,572
No no, we're closed, go away!

605
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,661
No, hey, we're not open.

606
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:20,061
Go, please, go, leave us.

607
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,360
Hmm.

608
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:27,377
Something's fishy. That doesn't
seem like a stink spirit to me.

609
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:28,918
But we have no choice.

610
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,334
Go greet him.

611
00:58:30,454 --> 00:58:34,249
Just give him a bath and get
him out of here as fast as you can.

612
00:58:34,602 --> 00:58:37,348
Everybody go back to your rooms.

613
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,271
Repeat, back to your rooms.

614
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:42,321
Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.

615
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:43,319
Yes, sir.

616
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,809
Sen, don't mess this up.

617
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,836
Take this guest to the big tub and take care of him.

618
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:49,994
But, but I...

619
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:52,260
No buts, or I'll turn you into coal.

620
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,307
You hear me?

621
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:54,783
Ah it's here.

622
00:59:05,582 --> 00:59:07,957
Hands down, you'll insult our guest.

623
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:19,729
Look about you customer, welcome to our baths.

624
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,816
Oh, it's money.

625
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:27,269
<i>Sen, take the nice customer's money.</i>

626
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:28,246
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:40,338
Don't make him wait, get him to the bath.

628
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:42,958
This way.

629
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:00,732
Get out of my way!

630
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,367
Sen!

631
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:12,209
Our food!

632
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,400
Open the windows, all of them!

633
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:15,281
Right away.

634
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:58,476
What?

635
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:00,189
Just a minute, sir.

636
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:07,135
Disgusting

637
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:09,025
I don't think it's very funny.

638
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,742
Let's see what she'll do next.

639
01:01:15,288 --> 01:01:17,684
Look, she wants to refill the tub.

640
01:01:17,709 --> 01:01:20,911
Oh dear, she's gonna waste all our good water!

641
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:24,121
Ah.

642
01:01:27,636 --> 01:01:28,179
Emm.

643
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:35,703
Hmm, who gave her all the bath tokens?

644
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,680
Don't look at me, I didn't do it.

645
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:22,721
Oh, no that's our best herbal formula!

646
01:02:48,395 --> 01:02:49,395
Sen!

647
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,577
Sen, where are you?

648
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:52,029
Over here!

649
01:02:52,804 --> 01:02:54,735
Don't worry, stay, stay right where you are.

650
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,027
I'm coming to help you.

651
01:02:56,479 --> 01:02:58,482
You're gonna be fine, I won't let him hurt you.

652
01:02:58,593 --> 01:03:02,479
I think he needs help, it feels
like there's a thorn in his side.

653
01:03:02,527 --> 01:03:03,545
A thorn?

654
01:03:03,997 --> 01:03:05,221
It won't come out!

655
01:03:05,325 --> 01:03:08,320
What's that, he has a thorn, hmm...

656
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:10,776
get the step down there.

657
01:03:10,983 --> 01:03:11,343
Hmm?

658
01:03:11,368 --> 01:03:12,054
Step on it.

659
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,230
Frog, get downstairs.

660
01:03:14,522 --> 01:03:14,912
You!

661
01:03:14,937 --> 01:03:15,484
All of you!

662
01:03:15,509 --> 01:03:16,540
Listen to me.

663
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:19,591
That's no stink spirit we have on our hands...

664
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:23,259
Grab onto this rope.

665
01:03:23,284 --> 01:03:24,149
Wait!

666
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,442
Mmm.

667
01:03:33,821 --> 01:03:34,821
Hold on tight.

668
01:03:35,214 --> 01:03:35,878
Got it.

669
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:37,054
Hurry up, now.

670
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:38,183
Get in there!

671
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,891
Everyone get in there and help them.

672
01:03:40,376 --> 01:03:42,181
We've got it tied on!

673
01:03:43,363 --> 01:03:46,255
Everyone, ready on my command.

674
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,781
And...

675
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:50,028
Heave!

676
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:52,070
And, heave!

677
01:03:52,382 --> 01:03:53,080
Heave!

678
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:54,905
And, heave!

679
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:55,896
Heave!

680
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,240
And, heave!

681
01:03:57,265 --> 01:03:58,605
Heave!

682
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:02,088
And heave!

683
01:04:04,237 --> 01:04:05,584
A bicycle?

684
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,100
Thought so.

685
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:09,381
Get ready, now!

686
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:11,582
Heave!

687
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:44,748
Sen!

688
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:46,881
Sen, where are you?

689
01:04:56,653 --> 01:04:59,299
Well done.

690
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:05,616
Hmm..

691
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,833
Gold!

692
01:05:31,298 --> 01:05:33,377
Hey, wait! That's company property!

693
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:34,012
Stop!

694
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:34,925
Back off!

695
01:05:35,188 --> 01:05:37,213
Our guest is still here, you idiots!

696
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:45,830
Sen, you're in our guest's way, step aside.

697
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:46,449
Yes, sir.

698
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:47,807
Open the main gates!

699
01:05:47,832 --> 01:05:49,113
Make way!

700
01:06:15,342 --> 01:06:19,701
Sen, you did great, we made so much money!

701
01:06:20,402 --> 01:06:24,676
That spirit is rich and powerful, everyone learn from Sen.

702
01:06:24,843 --> 01:06:26,900
Sake's on the house tonight.

703
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,768
But first, hand over all the gold you picked up.

704
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,519
What do you mean git it back.

705
01:06:32,544 --> 01:06:34,922
How stingy, that's no fair!

706
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:45,081
Here.

707
01:06:45,232 --> 01:06:46,565
I swiped a dumpling for you.

708
01:06:46,682 --> 01:06:47,590
Thank you.

709
01:06:48,763 --> 01:06:49,763
What a day.

710
01:06:50,518 --> 01:06:51,226
Mmm.

711
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:54,610
Lin, have you seen Haku?

712
01:06:54,675 --> 01:06:56,096
Not Haku again.

713
01:06:57,529 --> 01:06:59,241
He just disappears sometimes.

714
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:02,810
Rumor has it he runs around doing Yubaba's dirty work.

715
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,619
Does he really?

716
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:06,052
Lights out, Lin.

717
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:07,210
Fine.

718
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,123
There's so much water, it looks like a sea.

719
01:07:35,337 --> 01:07:37,307
What do you expect after all that rain?

720
01:07:40,548 --> 01:07:41,979
I've gotta get out of this place.

721
01:07:42,202 --> 01:07:44,006
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

722
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:08,712
Hmm?

723
01:08:08,737 --> 01:08:09,587
What's wrong?

724
01:08:39,317 --> 01:08:41,025
Ahh! It's gold!

725
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:42,218
Huh?

726
01:08:44,056 --> 01:08:46,381
What do you think you're doing,
you're not allowed in there.

727
01:08:46,406 --> 01:08:47,463
The bath's closed.

728
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:48,297
Get out, you!

729
01:08:48,322 --> 01:08:49,250
Get out of there!

730
01:08:55,607 --> 01:08:56,900
Oh! More gold!

731
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,093
Are you, are you, are you giving them to me?

732
01:09:04,527 --> 01:09:06,847
Wait, you can make gold?

733
01:09:12,095 --> 01:09:13,171
Gimme!

734
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,022
What's going on in there?

735
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:25,341
It's way past bedtime.

736
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:26,106
Come on!

737
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:27,278
Wh...

738
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:32,541
Hey, boss, up here, I'm hungry, starving!

739
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,162
And l want you to serve me.

740
01:09:34,242 --> 01:09:35,292
I know that voice.

741
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:37,570
Here, I'll pay you up front.

742
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:39,684
And l wanna take a bath, too.

743
01:09:40,066 --> 01:09:41,970
Why don't you wake everyone up?

744
01:09:47,988 --> 01:09:50,792
Mom, Dad, I got a gift from the River Spirit!

745
01:09:50,817 --> 01:09:53,381
Maybe if you eat it, it'll break the spell.

746
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,077
Which ones are you?

747
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:03,088
Mom, Dad!

748
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:14,560
Bad dream.

749
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,807
Lin?

750
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:22,601
Where is everybody?

751
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:30,045
Wow.

752
01:10:30,283 --> 01:10:31,690
It really is a sea.

753
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:35,479
There's Mom and Dad's pigpen.

754
01:10:37,203 --> 01:10:39,769
I sure hope they're doing all right over there.

755
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:45,958
Kamaji lit the boiler already?

756
01:10:46,303 --> 01:10:47,974
How long was I asleep?

757
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:50,537
Hurry up, he's hungry.

758
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:51,584
Get put of my way.

759
01:10:51,712 --> 01:10:54,742
Come on, he's starving, can't you cook any faster?

760
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:57,333
Serve everything you've got even leftovers if you have to.

761
01:10:57,358 --> 01:10:58,023
Hurry up!

762
01:10:58,048 --> 01:10:59,138
He's starving!

763
01:11:00,705 --> 01:11:01,885
Hey, Sen.

764
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,875
Oh, Lin.

765
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,550
I was just coming to wake you up, look.

766
01:11:05,915 --> 01:11:08,966
It's real gold, there's a new guest who's loaded.

767
01:11:09,045 --> 01:11:10,999
He's giving gold away by the handfuls!

768
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:25,738
Just keep the food coming, I wanna eat everything!

769
01:11:29,163 --> 01:11:30,011
Hmm.

770
01:11:30,274 --> 01:11:31,205
Who is the guest?

771
01:11:31,344 --> 01:11:32,620
Oh, who cares?

772
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:34,724
Come on, before Yubaba wakes up.

773
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:37,490
I'm going to go look for Haku.

774
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:39,904
Oh would you quit worrying about Haku?

775
01:11:40,174 --> 01:11:41,022
Come on, Sen.

776
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,018
Let's go get some gold.

777
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:42,565
Come on, Lin!

778
01:11:42,628 --> 01:11:43,643
Let's go get some more!

779
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:44,279
You bet!

780
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:45,488
Hey, wait for me!

781
01:12:04,809 --> 01:12:06,465
Where is Haku?

782
01:12:09,478 --> 01:12:12,885
He better get here before I
forget what my parents look like.

783
01:12:13,457 --> 01:12:16,021
I sure hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

784
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:35,782
Haku?

785
01:12:44,345 --> 01:12:45,345
It's Haku!

786
01:12:45,377 --> 01:12:46,377
He's back!

787
01:12:50,789 --> 01:12:52,553
Are birds chasing him?

788
01:13:03,364 --> 01:13:05,487
Haku fight 'em.

789
01:13:05,862 --> 01:13:07,156
Come on!

790
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:09,047
He's hurt!

791
01:13:09,602 --> 01:13:10,896
Haku, this way!

792
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:13,645
Aah!

793
01:13:27,206 --> 01:13:28,206
Huh?

794
01:13:28,716 --> 01:13:30,340
It's just paper.

795
01:13:58,349 --> 01:13:59,175
Haku..

796
01:13:59,342 --> 01:14:00,596
You're bleeding.

797
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:09,780
Hold still, those paper things are gone now.

798
01:14:09,955 --> 01:14:11,520
You're going to be all right.

799
01:14:24,534 --> 01:14:26,377
He went in that top window.

800
01:14:26,402 --> 01:14:28,808
I've got to get there before he bleeds to death!

801
01:14:37,176 --> 01:14:38,415
Welcome the rich man.

802
01:14:38,464 --> 01:14:40,178
He's hard for you to miss.

803
01:14:40,235 --> 01:14:41,972
His butt keeps getting bigger.

804
01:14:41,997 --> 01:14:44,737
So there's plenty there to kiss, haha.

805
01:14:44,762 --> 01:14:47,114
Oh, hey, everybody, bow down.

806
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,464
Welcome, rich man.

807
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:52,317
Beg for tips, this is the time.

808
01:14:52,342 --> 01:14:55,772
Beg for tips, make yourselves a dime.

809
01:14:58,188 --> 01:14:59,800
Give me some gold.

810
01:15:00,298 --> 01:15:01,498
Give me some tips!

811
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:05,562
Sir, I'll do anything for you, just give me some tips!

812
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:10,683
Hey, what are you doing?

813
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:12,166
Going upstairs.

814
01:15:12,278 --> 01:15:13,389
No, you're not.

815
01:15:14,204 --> 01:15:14,637
Huh..

816
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:16,430
Ah blood!

817
01:15:19,991 --> 01:15:22,627
Get out of the way our guest is coming through here!

818
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:25,471
Thank you for helping me earlier.

819
01:15:25,652 --> 01:15:27,791
Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...

820
01:15:28,683 --> 01:15:30,261
Wow, hey!

821
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:52,228
I don't want any, but thanks.

822
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:57,219
I'm sorry, but I'm in a really big hurry.

823
01:16:08,613 --> 01:16:11,901
Hey, there, hey, get back, get back now!

824
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:13,863
Everybody, out!

825
01:16:14,476 --> 01:16:16,858
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.

826
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:19,805
You'll have to excuse the little girl she's just a human.

827
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:24,379
Wipe that smile off your face.

828
01:16:24,404 --> 01:16:25,129
What?

829
01:16:25,154 --> 01:16:26,728
You're still smiling.

830
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:02,414
It's Yubaba!

831
01:19:23,117 --> 01:19:24,765
You attract terrible guests.

832
01:19:25,276 --> 01:19:26,480
Alright I'm on my way.

833
01:19:27,123 --> 01:19:29,816
Don't let he meet anyone else till I get down there.

834
01:19:30,484 --> 01:19:31,342
Er..

835
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:34,021
Haku is bleeding all over the carpet.

836
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,491
Get him put of here, he'll be died soon anway.

837
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:55,371
Oh..

838
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:03,038
Hi, sweetie hiding under the cushiones again.

839
01:20:06,707 --> 01:20:10,350
Oh, I woke you, and you were sound asleep.

840
01:20:10,608 --> 01:20:11,478
I'm sorry.

841
01:20:11,654 --> 01:20:13,475
Let me give you a kiss.

842
01:20:16,524 --> 01:20:18,968
Go back to sleep, now.

843
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:45,309
Ow!

844
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:49,577
Let go of me!

845
01:20:50,077 --> 01:20:51,524
Wow, you're a big baby.

846
01:20:52,057 --> 01:20:53,834
Would you mind letting go of me?

847
01:20:53,859 --> 01:20:55,384
I'm in a really big hurry.

848
01:20:55,409 --> 01:20:57,362
You came in here to make me sick.

849
01:20:57,387 --> 01:20:58,188
Huh?

850
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,968
You're a bad germ from outside, aren't you?

851
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:03,759
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.

852
01:21:03,784 --> 01:21:05,580
Now, would you please let go of me?

853
01:21:05,969 --> 01:21:07,859
You'll get sick if you go outside.

854
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:10,305
So stay here and play with me.

855
01:21:10,607 --> 01:21:11,696
You won't get sick.

856
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:12,824
Yes, you will.

857
01:21:12,959 --> 01:21:14,936
That's why I've never left this room.

858
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:17,250
Staying in this room is what'll make you sick.

859
01:21:17,694 --> 01:21:21,262
Listen, someone very important to me is terribly hurt.

860
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:24,547
I've got to go right now, so please let go of me.

861
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,481
If you go I'll cry, and Mama will hear me,

862
01:21:27,506 --> 01:21:29,917
and Mama will come in here and kill you.

863
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:32,138
Play with me, or I'll break your arm.

864
01:21:32,241 --> 01:21:33,044
That hurts!

865
01:21:33,529 --> 01:21:35,923
Please, I'll play with you later, okay?

866
01:21:36,038 --> 01:21:37,850
No, I wanna play now!

867
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:41,800
Germs!

868
01:21:41,825 --> 01:21:43,412
I've got germs, see?

869
01:21:55,154 --> 01:21:57,037
Haku!

870
01:21:57,062 --> 01:21:57,769
What are you doing?

871
01:21:57,794 --> 01:21:58,351
Get away!

872
01:21:58,376 --> 01:21:59,211
Get back!

873
01:21:59,236 --> 01:22:00,247
Haku, are you okay?

874
01:22:00,272 --> 01:22:01,589
Can you hear me?

875
01:22:02,305 --> 01:22:03,372
Shut your mouth!

876
01:22:03,437 --> 01:22:04,876
Haku!

877
01:22:10,632 --> 01:22:11,745
Get back!

878
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:15,517
Stop it!

879
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:32,292
I'm not afraid of germs.

880
01:22:32,475 --> 01:22:34,096
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

881
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:35,535
Please don't cry.

882
01:22:35,605 --> 01:22:36,535
Just wait.

883
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:39,219
Right now, or I'll start crying.

884
01:22:41,738 --> 01:22:43,302
Don't cry! Don't cry!

885
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,565
What a spoiled brat!

886
01:22:47,237 --> 01:22:48,815
Shut your big mouth!

887
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,684
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

888
01:22:58,126 --> 01:23:00,153
Hmm, still see-through.

889
01:23:00,451 --> 01:23:01,451
Mama?

890
01:23:02,112 --> 01:23:03,347
You pea-brain.

891
01:23:03,372 --> 01:23:05,513
Can't you even tell me from your own mother?

892
01:23:14,207 --> 01:23:16,931
There, now your body matches your brain.

893
01:23:17,335 --> 01:23:20,412
Let's see, what else can we mess with?

894
01:23:38,414 --> 01:23:39,885
This is our little secret.

895
01:23:39,966 --> 01:23:43,309
You tell anyone else, and I'll rip your mouth out.

896
01:23:44,918 --> 01:23:45,918
Who are you?

897
01:23:46,153 --> 01:23:46,938
Zeniba.

898
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,630
I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

899
01:23:48,783 --> 01:23:52,247
It was nice of you to lead me
straight to this dragon's hiding place.

900
01:23:52,636 --> 01:23:54,577
Now, hand him over to me.

901
01:23:54,711 --> 01:23:56,046
What do you want with Haku?

902
01:23:56,142 --> 01:23:57,356
He's badly hurt.

903
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,453
Too bad.

904
01:23:58,559 --> 01:24:00,740
He stole my solid gold seal.

905
01:24:00,923 --> 01:24:03,743
It's magic and powerful. I want it back!

906
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,214
Haku wouldn't steal.

907
01:24:05,436 --> 01:24:06,696
He's a good person.

908
01:24:06,864 --> 01:24:10,519
Ha, do you know why he became my sister's apprentice?

909
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:12,535
To steal her magic secrets

910
01:24:12,617 --> 01:24:15,158
and now he's stolen my magic, too.

911
01:24:15,588 --> 01:24:17,359
He's a greedy little thief.

912
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:19,322
There's nothing good about him.

913
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,918
Step aside, little girl.

914
01:24:20,943 --> 01:24:23,714
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

915
01:24:24,597 --> 01:24:26,750
There's a spell on the seal,

916
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:29,649
and anyone who steals it will die.

917
01:24:30,558 --> 01:24:31,675
No, you can't!

918
01:24:39,787 --> 01:24:40,620
You idiots!

919
01:24:40,645 --> 01:24:42,392
What's your problem?

920
01:24:42,918 --> 01:24:45,999
Keep quiet, I don't want my sister coming up here.

921
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:54,414
Ow. A paper cuts.

922
01:24:54,951 --> 01:24:56,765
Haku, we're falling!

923
01:25:17,509 --> 01:25:18,663
Haku!

924
01:25:46,957 --> 01:25:47,760
What's going on here?

925
01:25:47,785 --> 01:25:48,085
Haku!

926
01:25:48,137 --> 01:25:48,858
Sen, be careful!

927
01:25:48,883 --> 01:25:49,988
Stay back!

928
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:53,881
Are you okay, Haku!

929
01:25:57,629 --> 01:25:59,126
What's wrong with you?

930
01:26:03,105 --> 01:26:05,203
This looks serious.

931
01:26:06,975 --> 01:26:08,467
Haku, don't give up!

932
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:09,327
What do we do?

933
01:26:09,352 --> 01:26:10,338
Is he dying?

934
01:26:10,692 --> 01:26:13,541
It looks like he's bleeding from the inside.

935
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:14,596
From the inside?

936
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:17,957
I think so, maybe he swallowed something.

937
01:26:18,576 --> 01:26:21,746
Haku, I got this gift from the River Spirit.

938
01:26:22,032 --> 01:26:22,516
Eat it.

939
01:26:22,638 --> 01:26:24,216
Maybe it'll help.

940
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:27,007
Come on!

941
01:26:27,114 --> 01:26:28,477
Open your mouth!

942
01:26:28,779 --> 01:26:29,803
Please, Haku!

943
01:26:30,254 --> 01:26:30,977
Eat it!

944
01:26:33,052 --> 01:26:33,679
See?

945
01:26:33,829 --> 01:26:35,062
It's okay.

946
01:26:35,303 --> 01:26:37,469
Medicine from the River Spirit.

947
01:26:37,587 --> 01:26:39,133
Open your mouth.

948
01:26:39,811 --> 01:26:40,661
That's it.

949
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:45,136
Got it.

950
01:26:46,138 --> 01:26:47,273
Now swallow.

951
01:27:05,936 --> 01:27:07,500
Sen, look there!

952
01:27:20,046 --> 01:27:21,324
The gold seal!

953
01:27:21,424 --> 01:27:22,635
Get that black slug!

954
01:27:22,691 --> 01:27:23,154
Over there!

955
01:27:23,227 --> 01:27:24,098
Get it, get it, get it!

956
01:27:40,058 --> 01:27:42,933
You killed it, those things are bad luck.

957
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:46,048
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

958
01:27:46,572 --> 01:27:48,670
Put your thumbs and forefingers together.

959
01:27:49,262 --> 01:27:50,704
Evil, be gone!

960
01:27:50,909 --> 01:27:53,756
Haku stole this seal from Yubaba's sister.

961
01:27:54,074 --> 01:27:56,607
Zeniba's solid gold monogrammed seal.

962
01:27:57,307 --> 01:27:59,251
That's as powerful as it gets.

963
01:28:01,922 --> 01:28:02,343
Look!

964
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:03,797
He's changed back.

965
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:04,453
Help me.

966
01:28:04,597 --> 01:28:05,864
What do we do?

967
01:28:07,834 --> 01:28:10,407
Haku, Haku, wake up!

968
01:28:12,808 --> 01:28:14,614
Zeniba put a curse on the seal.

969
01:28:14,638 --> 01:28:18,327
That's strong magic, it's made him gravely ill.

970
01:28:27,713 --> 01:28:30,134
That should make him more comfortable.

971
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:34,354
Poor Haku.

972
01:28:34,563 --> 01:28:36,578
He's had it hard ever since he got here.

973
01:28:37,127 --> 01:28:40,455
He just showed up out of nowhere, just like you did.

974
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:43,038
But he got mixed up with Yubaba.

975
01:28:43,332 --> 01:28:44,912
He took a job as her apprentice.

976
01:28:45,419 --> 01:28:47,577
I warned him it was too dangerous.

977
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:49,840
"Just quit, go back home!", I told him.

978
01:28:50,537 --> 01:28:54,095
But he said for some reason he had no home to return to.

979
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:56,685
Once Yubaba got control over him,

980
01:28:56,838 --> 01:29:00,365
his face turned pale and his eyes turned steely.

981
01:29:01,053 --> 01:29:02,293
He's never been the same.

982
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,975
Kamaji, what if I take the gold seal back to Zeniba?

983
01:29:08,357 --> 01:29:11,589
I could give back the seal and apologize to her for Haku.

984
01:29:12,073 --> 01:29:13,702
Can you tell me where Zeniba lives?

985
01:29:14,369 --> 01:29:16,174
You'd go to Zeniba's?

986
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,225
It might help, but she's one dangerous witch.

987
01:29:19,298 --> 01:29:19,779
Please?

988
01:29:20,497 --> 01:29:24,016
Haku helped me before, now I wanna help him.

989
01:29:24,969 --> 01:29:26,143
Hmm.

990
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:28,465
I know how you can get there,

991
01:29:28,879 --> 01:29:30,968
but you'll have to get back on your own.

992
01:29:31,732 --> 01:29:32,605
Wait here.

993
01:29:35,942 --> 01:29:39,184
Let's see now, I know it's around here somewhere.

994
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:43,004
Everyone, I need my shoes and clothes, please.

995
01:29:44,644 --> 01:29:46,746
I guess my parents will have to wait.

996
01:29:51,206 --> 01:29:53,968
Sen, I've looked everywhere for you.

997
01:29:57,018 --> 01:29:57,462
Lin!

998
01:29:57,696 --> 01:29:59,081
There's blood everywhere.

999
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:02,557
What's going on here, who are those guys?

1000
01:30:03,233 --> 01:30:05,584
I picked up some new friends, see?

1001
01:30:06,077 --> 01:30:08,951
Everyone's looking for you, Yubaba is furious.

1002
01:30:08,959 --> 01:30:09,283
Huh?

1003
01:30:09,308 --> 01:30:13,050
The guy with all the gold turned
out to be a monster called No-Face.

1004
01:30:13,259 --> 01:30:15,935
And he says that you let him into the bathhouse.

1005
01:30:19,178 --> 01:30:20,409
I did let him in.

1006
01:30:21,506 --> 01:30:22,573
Are you serious?

1007
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,580
Yeah, I thought he was a customer.

1008
01:30:24,779 --> 01:30:25,256
What?

1009
01:30:25,392 --> 01:30:27,923
He's a monster, he's already swallowed three people.

1010
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,549
Found it!

1011
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:30,641
Here it is, Sen.

1012
01:30:31,818 --> 01:30:33,224
Hey, we're busy, boiler man.

1013
01:30:33,249 --> 01:30:35,661
You can use this.

1014
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:37,762
You've got train tickets?

1015
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,262
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

1016
01:30:39,334 --> 01:30:41,796
I've been saving them for 40 years.

1017
01:30:41,989 --> 01:30:42,919
Now, listen carefully.

1018
01:30:43,142 --> 01:30:45,795
The train stop you want is called Swamp Bottom.

1019
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:46,955
Swamp Bottom?

1020
01:30:47,047 --> 01:30:48,277
That's where Zeniba lives.

1021
01:30:48,285 --> 01:30:49,100
The sixth stop.

1022
01:30:49,174 --> 01:30:49,904
Sixth stop.

1023
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:51,802
Make sure you get it right.

1024
01:30:51,936 --> 01:30:55,909
The train used to run in both directions,
but these days it's a one-way ride.

1025
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:57,593
You still wanna go?

1026
01:30:58,832 --> 01:31:00,855
Yep, I'll walk back along the tracks.

1027
01:31:02,888 --> 01:31:04,633
Sen, what about No-Face?

1028
01:31:04,824 --> 01:31:06,164
I'll take care of that now.

1029
01:31:06,888 --> 01:31:10,493
Haku, I'll be back soon, just hold on.

1030
01:31:11,496 --> 01:31:12,639
What's going on?

1031
01:31:13,188 --> 01:31:14,768
Something you wouldn't recognize

1032
01:31:14,785 --> 01:31:15,897
it's called love.

1033
01:31:23,693 --> 01:31:25,352
He just keeps getting bigger!

1034
01:31:25,592 --> 01:31:26,379
I'm scared.

1035
01:31:26,404 --> 01:31:27,831
I don't wanna be eaten by it.

1036
01:31:27,847 --> 01:31:28,387
It's her.

1037
01:31:36,929 --> 01:31:38,296
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.

1038
01:31:38,344 --> 01:31:40,432
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

1039
01:31:42,672 --> 01:31:44,304
There's no need to get upset.

1040
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:46,963
I'm sure they'll find Sen somewhere.

1041
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:48,965
Where is Sen?

1042
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,313
I want Sen!

1043
01:31:50,767 --> 01:31:51,243
Hurry!

1044
01:31:51,242 --> 01:31:51,807
This way!

1045
01:31:57,879 --> 01:31:59,582
Madam, Sen is here now.

1046
01:31:59,607 --> 01:32:00,492
Finally!

1047
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,780
Sen has arrived, sir.

1048
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:04,935
She'll be with you in just a few minutes.

1049
01:32:06,635 --> 01:32:09,986
He's destroying everything, it's costing us a fortune.

1050
01:32:10,113 --> 01:32:13,728
So suck up to him and get every last speck of gold he's...

1051
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:15,204
Choo!

1052
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:18,620
Eww, what's that dirty mouse doing here?

1053
01:32:19,676 --> 01:32:20,218
Huh?

1054
01:32:20,859 --> 01:32:21,866
He's your...

1055
01:32:21,986 --> 01:32:23,343
He doesn't look familiar?

1056
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:26,123
Familiar, don't be stupid.

1057
01:32:26,448 --> 01:32:28,340
Now, get in there.

1058
01:32:29,289 --> 01:32:30,567
Here's Sen.

1059
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,600
Will Sen be all right in there by herself?

1060
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:36,472
You wanna take her place?

1061
01:32:36,576 --> 01:32:36,882
Huh?

1062
01:32:37,104 --> 01:32:37,525
Hmpf!

1063
01:32:57,619 --> 01:32:58,442
Try this.

1064
01:32:58,818 --> 01:33:00,191
It's delicious.

1065
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:07,023
Want some gold, I'm not giving it to anybody else.

1066
01:33:10,854 --> 01:33:13,641
Come closer, Sen what would you like?

1067
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:15,516
Just name it.

1068
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,372
I would like to leave, sir.

1069
01:33:18,558 --> 01:33:21,272
I have some place I need to go to right away, please.

1070
01:33:23,552 --> 01:33:25,736
You should go back to where you came from.

1071
01:33:26,037 --> 01:33:28,985
Yubaba doesn't want you in the bathhouse any longer.

1072
01:33:30,963 --> 01:33:34,267
Where is your home, don't you have any friends or family?

1073
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:35,880
No.

1074
01:33:36,335 --> 01:33:37,279
No!

1075
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,114
I'm lonely.

1076
01:33:39,297 --> 01:33:40,836
I'm lonely.

1077
01:33:43,644 --> 01:33:45,311
What is it that you want?

1078
01:33:45,629 --> 01:33:48,248
I want Sen, I want Sen!

1079
01:33:49,793 --> 01:33:50,793
Take the gold.

1080
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:51,645
Take it!

1081
01:33:51,828 --> 01:33:53,097
Are you going to eat me?

1082
01:33:53,122 --> 01:33:53,852
Take it!

1083
01:34:03,897 --> 01:34:06,661
If you want to eat me, eat this first.

1084
01:34:07,344 --> 01:34:09,330
I was saving this for my parents,

1085
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:11,133
but I think you'd better have it.

1086
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:33,250
Sen!

1087
01:34:35,572 --> 01:34:38,002
Sen, what did you do to me?

1088
01:34:53,734 --> 01:34:56,172
Enough, I don't care if he's rich!

1089
01:34:57,054 --> 01:34:58,842
This nonsense has gotta stop!

1090
01:35:12,745 --> 01:35:13,859
No-Face!

1091
01:35:14,597 --> 01:35:16,081
Over here!

1092
01:35:24,091 --> 01:35:25,130
Run for your life!

1093
01:35:54,989 --> 01:35:56,906
Now, that's an esophagus!

1094
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,963
I'll get you for this, Sen!

1095
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:18,457
Excuse me.

1096
01:36:20,094 --> 01:36:22,216
Sen, this way!

1097
01:36:38,512 --> 01:36:40,622
Hey, over here!

1098
01:36:40,647 --> 01:36:42,665
Sen, don't call him over!

1099
01:36:46,297 --> 01:36:49,028
I think being in the bathhouse makes him crazy.

1100
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:50,552
He needs to get out of there.

1101
01:36:50,687 --> 01:36:51,099
Yeah?

1102
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,119
And go where?

1103
01:36:52,278 --> 01:36:53,351
I don't know.

1104
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:54,765
You don't know?

1105
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,307
Great.

1106
01:36:56,505 --> 01:36:57,982
Now he's following us.

1107
01:36:58,479 --> 01:36:59,722
He won't hurt us.

1108
01:37:15,146 --> 01:37:16,694
You'll have to walk from here.

1109
01:37:16,741 --> 01:37:17,472
Okay.

1110
01:37:17,718 --> 01:37:19,601
The station's just down the tracks.

1111
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:20,791
Thanks, Lin.

1112
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:23,556
You better come back, you hear me?

1113
01:37:24,176 --> 01:37:24,929
I will.

1114
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:32,093
Sen, I'm sorry I called you a dope before!

1115
01:37:32,191 --> 01:37:33,635
I take it back!

1116
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,796
No-Face, if you put even one scratch
on that girl, you're in big trouble.

1117
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:50,628
There's the station.

1118
01:38:02,141 --> 01:38:04,157
Here comes the train come on.

1119
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,405
Oh we'd like to go to Swamp Bottom, please.

1120
01:38:37,135 --> 01:38:38,977
Oh. You wanna come with us?

1121
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,036
He'd like to come too, please.

1122
01:39:22,426 --> 01:39:25,935
Sit here, behave yourself, okay?

1123
01:41:28,442 --> 01:41:30,159
Kamaji, wake up.

1124
01:41:32,504 --> 01:41:34,950
Haku, you're all right.

1125
01:41:35,069 --> 01:41:35,720
I'm fine.

1126
01:41:35,745 --> 01:41:36,514
Where is Sen?

1127
01:41:37,212 --> 01:41:39,429
Did she go somewhere, can you tell me what's going on?

1128
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:42,259
You blacked out, remember?

1129
01:41:43,410 --> 01:41:45,286
Yeah, l remember being in darkness.

1130
01:41:45,704 --> 01:41:48,090
Then I could hear Sen's voice calling out my name.

1131
01:41:48,799 --> 01:41:50,839
So l followed her voice, and the next thing I knew,

1132
01:41:51,134 --> 01:41:52,823
l was lying here feeling better than ever.

1133
01:41:53,136 --> 01:41:56,329
Pure love, it broke Zeniba's spell.

1134
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:59,408
Sen left to return the golden seal.

1135
01:42:00,171 --> 01:42:01,704
She did it to save you.

1136
01:42:03,933 --> 01:42:09,137
This gold doesn't even come close to
covering the damage that stupid No-Face caused.

1137
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,322
Sen didn't get nearly enough, she'll have to be punished.

1138
01:42:12,702 --> 01:42:15,717
Madam, you see, Sen was the
one that saved us from No-Face.

1139
01:42:15,742 --> 01:42:16,489
Yes, yes.

1140
01:42:16,766 --> 01:42:19,553
So what, this whole mess is her fault!

1141
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,483
And now she's run away from here.

1142
01:42:22,961 --> 01:42:25,519
She's even abandoned her own parents!

1143
01:42:25,909 --> 01:42:28,498
Those pigs must be ready to eat by now.

1144
01:42:28,752 --> 01:42:30,252
Turn them into bacon.

1145
01:42:30,457 --> 01:42:31,317
Wait a minute.

1146
01:42:32,767 --> 01:42:33,386
Huh?

1147
01:42:33,411 --> 01:42:34,275
Master Haku?

1148
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:37,047
You're still alive, what is it you want?

1149
01:42:38,835 --> 01:42:42,297
You still haven't noticed that something
precious to you has been replaced.

1150
01:42:42,911 --> 01:42:45,071
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

1151
01:42:45,771 --> 01:42:48,400
Since when do you talk that way to your master?

1152
01:43:30,597 --> 01:43:31,185
Huh.

1153
01:43:39,893 --> 01:43:41,917
My baby!

1154
01:43:43,906 --> 01:43:45,533
No!

1155
01:43:47,949 --> 01:43:49,633
My baby!

1156
01:43:49,658 --> 01:43:50,602
It's just dirt.

1157
01:43:51,022 --> 01:43:52,976
Where's my baby?

1158
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:56,266
Where are you, sweetie?

1159
01:43:58,292 --> 01:44:00,918
Come out, please, come out!

1160
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:02,662
Where are you?

1161
01:44:05,824 --> 01:44:09,160
Sweetie, sweetie pie!

1162
01:44:12,969 --> 01:44:16,058
You!

1163
01:44:17,772 --> 01:44:22,071
Where is he?

1164
01:44:23,502 --> 01:44:26,974
What did you do with my baby?

1165
01:44:28,206 --> 01:44:29,746
He's with your sister.

1166
01:44:30,056 --> 01:44:32,009
Zeniba?

1167
01:44:53,556 --> 01:44:56,688
Very clever, Haku, I get it.

1168
01:44:56,879 --> 01:44:59,452
You'll get my baby back for me, but at a price.

1169
01:45:01,454 --> 01:45:03,496
So, what do you want?

1170
01:45:03,766 --> 01:45:05,482
Tear up Sen's contract.

1171
01:45:06,095 --> 01:45:10,503
And then I want you to return Sen and her
mother and father back to the human world.

1172
01:45:10,695 --> 01:45:13,094
Fine, but on one condition.

1173
01:45:13,301 --> 01:45:16,064
I get to give Sen one final test.

1174
01:45:16,146 --> 01:45:19,108
If she fails, she's mine.

1175
01:46:03,854 --> 01:46:05,775
I hope this is the right stop.

1176
01:46:07,012 --> 01:46:07,898
Let's go.

1177
01:46:34,977 --> 01:46:37,288
You can ride on my shoulder if you're tired.

1178
01:47:55,226 --> 01:47:56,242
Come in.

1179
01:48:01,972 --> 01:48:03,180
Hello?

1180
01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:07,725
Hurry up, ll don't have all day.

1181
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:09,233
Come on.

1182
01:48:13,393 --> 01:48:14,845
So, you all made it.

1183
01:48:15,289 --> 01:48:15,728
Hmm?

1184
01:48:16,306 --> 01:48:19,497
Sit down, I'll make some tea.

1185
01:48:26,069 --> 01:48:28,516
Excuse me, ma'am, Haku stole this from you.

1186
01:48:28,619 --> 01:48:29,778
I came to give it back.

1187
01:48:30,978 --> 01:48:32,249
I see.

1188
01:48:33,363 --> 01:48:35,580
Do you have any idea what this is?

1189
01:48:36,064 --> 01:48:38,828
Yes it's the golden seal you were looking for.

1190
01:48:38,988 --> 01:48:42,641
I'm here to apologize for Haku, I'm very sorry.

1191
01:48:43,516 --> 01:48:46,550
He sliced me in two, you know, and I'm still angry.

1192
01:48:46,877 --> 01:48:47,346
What?

1193
01:48:48,141 --> 01:48:48,649
What!

1194
01:48:48,721 --> 01:48:50,500
The protective spell is gone.

1195
01:48:51,685 --> 01:48:52,494
I'm sorry.

1196
01:48:52,602 --> 01:48:54,846
You mean that black slug that was on your seal?

1197
01:48:55,052 --> 01:48:56,967
I think I squashed it with my foot.

1198
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:59,064
Squashed it?

1199
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,020
That wasn't my slug.

1200
01:49:03,594 --> 01:49:07,499
My sister put that slug into
Haku so she could control him.

1201
01:49:07,951 --> 01:49:09,703
You squashed it.

1202
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:14,501
What happened to my spell?

1203
01:49:15,134 --> 01:49:17,975
Only love can break it, come now.

1204
01:49:18,864 --> 01:49:22,206
Can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms?

1205
01:49:22,716 --> 01:49:25,861
The spell on those two wore off long ago.

1206
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,632
Change back if you want.

1207
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:39,378
I don't get along with my sister. She's so obnoxious.

1208
01:49:39,785 --> 01:49:41,737
You saw how tacky her home is.

1209
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:45,167
We're identical twins, yet exact opposites.

1210
01:49:49,213 --> 01:49:52,239
I'm sorry she turned your parents into pigs.

1211
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:55,710
But there's nothing ll can do,
it's just the way things are.

1212
01:49:56,061 --> 01:49:58,951
You'll have to help your parents and Haku on your own.

1213
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:01,065
Use what you remember about them.

1214
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:01,649
What?

1215
01:50:01,805 --> 01:50:04,117
Can't you please give me more of a hint than that?

1216
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:08,017
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

1217
01:50:08,422 --> 01:50:10,125
That's a good start.

1218
01:50:10,404 --> 01:50:13,848
Once you've met someone, you never really forget them.

1219
01:50:14,127 --> 01:50:17,631
It just takes a while for your memories to return.

1220
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,258
While you're thinking,

1221
01:50:19,371 --> 01:50:21,569
the boys and I are going to make you something.

1222
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:24,821
And I want you to call me Granny from now on.

1223
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:30,748
Ah, come on, keep at it.

1224
01:50:34,221 --> 01:50:37,179
No-Face, where did you learn to spin thread?

1225
01:50:37,196 --> 01:50:38,675
You're really good at this.

1226
01:50:39,547 --> 01:50:42,520
Now let's weave the threads together.

1227
01:50:44,058 --> 01:50:46,808
Knit one, pearl two, knit one, pearl two.

1228
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:48,379
Knit one, that's right.

1229
01:50:48,506 --> 01:50:51,166
Granny, ll can't remember anything at all.

1230
01:50:51,858 --> 01:50:55,354
Haku could be dead already,
and I'm just sitting around here.

1231
01:50:55,849 --> 01:50:58,668
My mom and dad could've been eaten for dinner.

1232
01:51:01,276 --> 01:51:03,489
Wait just a little bit longer.

1233
01:51:04,078 --> 01:51:05,786
Ahh. There we go.

1234
01:51:06,078 --> 01:51:08,256
Use it to tie back your hair.

1235
01:51:12,717 --> 01:51:14,568
It's beautiful.

1236
01:51:15,434 --> 01:51:16,768
It will protect you.

1237
01:51:16,776 --> 01:51:19,815
It's made from the threads your friends wove together.

1238
01:51:20,354 --> 01:51:20,977
Thank you.

1239
01:51:30,853 --> 01:51:33,698
What good timing we've got another guest.

1240
01:51:33,723 --> 01:51:34,692
Will you let him in?

1241
01:51:34,709 --> 01:51:35,293
Sure.

1242
01:51:49,141 --> 01:51:50,135
Haku!

1243
01:51:51,556 --> 01:51:52,405
Haku.

1244
01:51:53,859 --> 01:51:55,021
Thank goodness.

1245
01:51:55,593 --> 01:51:59,333
You're alive, I can't believe it, how did it happen?

1246
01:51:59,902 --> 01:52:00,996
Ahh.

1247
01:52:01,021 --> 01:52:02,591
That's love for you.

1248
01:52:03,855 --> 01:52:05,848
Look Granny, Haku's alive!

1249
01:52:07,103 --> 01:52:10,729
Haku, I will forgive you for stealing my precious seal.

1250
01:52:11,062 --> 01:52:13,932
But in return, you must take care of this girl.

1251
01:52:15,297 --> 01:52:17,838
Okay, you two, it's time to go home.

1252
01:52:18,263 --> 01:52:19,419
Come back soon.

1253
01:52:20,588 --> 01:52:23,188
No-Face, why don't you stay with me?

1254
01:52:23,482 --> 01:52:24,945
I could use a good helper.

1255
01:52:24,978 --> 01:52:26,245
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1256
01:52:27,595 --> 01:52:28,429
Granny!

1257
01:52:28,883 --> 01:52:31,345
Thank you so much, I'll miss you.

1258
01:52:31,376 --> 01:52:32,400
Don't worry.

1259
01:52:32,416 --> 01:52:33,912
You'll be all right, Sen.

1260
01:52:34,866 --> 01:52:36,559
I want you to know my real name.

1261
01:52:36,669 --> 01:52:37,678
It's Chihiro.

1262
01:52:38,328 --> 01:52:39,003
Chihiro.

1263
01:52:39,194 --> 01:52:40,495
What a pretty name.

1264
01:52:40,863 --> 01:52:42,352
You take good care of it.

1265
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:43,293
I will.

1266
01:52:43,644 --> 01:52:44,376
Off you go.

1267
01:52:44,448 --> 01:52:44,979
Okay.

1268
01:52:45,329 --> 01:52:45,741
Bye.

1269
01:52:47,037 --> 01:52:50,126
Granny, take care, thanks for everything!

1270
01:53:39,341 --> 01:53:40,468
Haku, listen.

1271
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:43,212
I just remembered something from a long time ago.

1272
01:53:43,236 --> 01:53:44,458
I think it may help you.

1273
01:53:44,891 --> 01:53:47,966
Once, when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river.

1274
01:53:49,048 --> 01:53:51,548
And when I tried to get it back, I fell in.

1275
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:55,235
I thought I'd drown, but the water carried me to shore.

1276
01:53:56,086 --> 01:53:58,054
It finally came back to me.

1277
01:53:58,563 --> 01:54:01,343
The river's name was the Kohaku River.

1278
01:54:01,758 --> 01:54:05,358
I think that was you, and your real name is Kohaku River!

1279
01:54:27,088 --> 01:54:29,154
You did it, Chihiro, I remember.

1280
01:54:29,162 --> 01:54:31,526
I was the spirit of the Kohaku River.

1281
01:54:31,844 --> 01:54:33,044
A river spirit?

1282
01:54:33,169 --> 01:54:35,031
My name is the Kohaku River.

1283
01:54:35,453 --> 01:54:36,621
They filled in that river.

1284
01:54:36,772 --> 01:54:38,002
It's all apartments now.

1285
01:54:38,488 --> 01:54:40,926
That must be why I can't find my way home, Chihiro.

1286
01:54:41,038 --> 01:54:42,698
I remember you falling into my river,

1287
01:54:42,881 --> 01:54:44,669
and ll remember your little pink shoe.

1288
01:54:45,026 --> 01:54:47,915
So you're the one who carried me back into shallow water.

1289
01:54:47,914 --> 01:54:49,069
You saved me!

1290
01:54:49,905 --> 01:54:51,659
I knew you were good!

1291
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:25,283
Hey, there they are!

1292
01:55:38,568 --> 01:55:41,467
I see you failed to bring my baby back.

1293
01:55:44,424 --> 01:55:45,320
Mama!

1294
01:55:45,345 --> 01:55:46,257
My baby!

1295
01:55:46,666 --> 01:55:47,997
Are you traumatized?

1296
01:55:48,022 --> 01:55:50,524
Did they do terrible things to you?

1297
01:55:50,946 --> 01:55:53,932
You're standing all by yourself, when did that happen?

1298
01:55:54,823 --> 01:55:56,484
Don't forget your promise.

1299
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:59,962
You must return Chihiro and
her parents to the human world.

1300
01:56:00,741 --> 01:56:03,101
Hmm, not so fast, Haku.

1301
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:06,326
I get to give Sen one final test.

1302
01:56:06,896 --> 01:56:07,795
Shut up!

1303
01:56:08,103 --> 01:56:10,299
Stop it, Mama, leave her alone.

1304
01:56:11,246 --> 01:56:13,278
Sen and I had a really good time.

1305
01:56:14,311 --> 01:56:16,651
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

1306
01:56:17,037 --> 01:56:19,389
I have to give Sen one final test.

1307
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:22,452
If you make Sen cry, I won't like you anymore.

1308
01:56:23,246 --> 01:56:23,584
But?

1309
01:56:24,556 --> 01:56:25,522
Hey, Granny!

1310
01:56:26,141 --> 01:56:27,024
Granny?

1311
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:29,262
You're right, a deal's a deal.

1312
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:43,104
Okay, I'm ready, I'll take your test.

1313
01:56:43,264 --> 01:56:43,661
Hmm.

1314
01:56:43,788 --> 01:56:44,866
You've got guts.

1315
01:56:45,202 --> 01:56:47,215
I've got your contract right here.

1316
01:56:47,545 --> 01:56:48,363
Come this way.

1317
01:56:48,841 --> 01:56:50,547
This will only take a minute.

1318
01:56:51,739 --> 01:56:52,755
Don't worry.

1319
01:56:57,588 --> 01:57:01,280
See if you can tell which of
these pigs is your mother and father.

1320
01:57:10,977 --> 01:57:12,262
You get one try.

1321
01:57:12,659 --> 01:57:14,954
If you get it right, you can all go home.

1322
01:57:26,731 --> 01:57:28,304
There must be a mistake.

1323
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,504
None of these pigs are my mom or dad.

1324
01:57:30,766 --> 01:57:34,134
None of them, is that really your answer?

1325
01:57:35,787 --> 01:57:36,422
Mm-hmm.

1326
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:37,804
Ah!

1327
01:57:39,664 --> 01:57:42,316
Oh, you got it!

1328
01:57:49,397 --> 01:57:50,739
Thank you, everyone.

1329
01:57:51,041 --> 01:57:52,208
All right, you win.

1330
01:57:52,414 --> 01:57:53,564
Get out of my sight.

1331
01:57:54,505 --> 01:57:56,310
Thanks for everything, Granny.

1332
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:57,921
Goodbye!

1333
01:57:59,287 --> 01:58:00,287
Thank you!

1334
01:58:01,775 --> 01:58:02,516
Haku!

1335
01:58:02,557 --> 01:58:03,164
Let's go!

1336
01:58:04,217 --> 01:58:05,555
Where are my mom and dad?

1337
01:58:05,644 --> 01:58:06,724
When you passed the test,

1338
01:58:06,749 --> 01:58:08,632
they woke up on the human side of the river.

1339
01:58:08,918 --> 01:58:10,666
They're there now, and they're looking for you.

1340
01:58:12,708 --> 01:58:14,019
There's no water here.

1341
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:15,549
I can walk across now.

1342
01:58:15,846 --> 01:58:17,095
But I can't go any farther.

1343
01:58:17,945 --> 01:58:19,898
Just go back the way you came, you'll be fine.

1344
01:58:20,016 --> 01:58:21,948
But you have to promise not to look back,

1345
01:58:22,067 --> 01:58:23,641
not until you've passed through the tunnel.

1346
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:25,714
What about you, what'll you do?

1347
01:58:26,008 --> 01:58:28,940
Don't worry, I'll go back and have a talk with Yubaba.

1348
01:58:29,077 --> 01:58:31,593
I'll tell her I'm going to quit being her apprentice.

1349
01:58:31,878 --> 01:58:33,831
I'm fine, I got my name back.

1350
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:35,696
Will we meet again sometime?

1351
01:58:35,721 --> 01:58:36,558
Sure we will.

1352
01:58:36,733 --> 01:58:37,434
Promise?

1353
01:58:37,443 --> 01:58:37,774
Promise!

1354
01:58:38,522 --> 01:58:40,516
Now go, and don't look back.

1355
01:59:03,318 --> 01:59:04,163
Chihiro!

1356
01:59:05,336 --> 01:59:07,535
Where have you been, hurry up!

1357
01:59:11,643 --> 01:59:13,145
Mom, Dad!

1358
01:59:13,377 --> 01:59:15,117
You shouldn't run off like that, honey.

1359
01:59:15,236 --> 01:59:16,538
You could get in big trouble.

1360
01:59:17,193 --> 01:59:19,048
Are you guys sure you're all right?

1361
01:59:19,598 --> 01:59:22,020
Let's go, I don't wanna miss the movers.

1362
01:59:33,073 --> 01:59:34,518
Chihiro, hurry up.

1363
01:59:44,123 --> 01:59:45,601
Everybody, watch your step.

1364
01:59:46,434 --> 01:59:49,111
Chihiro, don't cling like that, you'll make me trip.

1365
02:00:01,641 --> 02:00:02,253
We made it.

1366
02:00:02,992 --> 02:00:03,903
Hey what happened?

1367
02:00:04,899 --> 02:00:05,546
What is it?

1368
02:00:06,895 --> 02:00:08,227
Look at that.

1369
02:00:10,141 --> 02:00:11,823
It's all dusty inside too.

1370
02:00:12,001 --> 02:00:13,800
Is this someone's idea of a joke?

1371
02:00:13,943 --> 02:00:14,585
Looks like it.

1372
02:00:14,765 --> 02:00:16,685
l told you we shouldn't have stopped.

1373
02:00:23,076 --> 02:00:26,325
Come on, Chihiro, let's get to our new home.

1374
02:00:26,512 --> 02:00:28,295
You're not scared, are you?

1375
02:00:28,710 --> 02:00:29,822
Don't be afraid, honey.

1376
02:00:29,846 --> 02:00:31,227
Everything's gonna be okay.

1377
02:00:44,925 --> 02:00:46,647
A new home and a new school?

1378
02:00:47,071 --> 02:00:48,419
It is a bit scary.

1379
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,700
I think I can handle it.
