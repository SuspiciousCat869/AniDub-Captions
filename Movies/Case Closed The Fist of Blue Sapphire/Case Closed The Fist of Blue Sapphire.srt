1
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:58,178
Did I keep you waiting long?

2
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,193
This is kind of a strange place to meet.

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,950
Can you keep your voice down please?
I don't want people listening in.

4
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,650
If people are watching you shouldn't
be able to try anything weird.

5
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,420
That's quite the accusation.

6
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,050
You make it sound like I'm after you or something.

7
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,037
You're not?

8
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:19,053
Well I thought we still had a
good relationship as friends.

9
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,150
Stop with the pointless small talk.

10
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,650
I just want to know what your
answer is to my earlier proposition.

11
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:26,943
You in? Or are you out?

12
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:29,256
Hmph.

13
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,012
Before I answer that...

14
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:37,342
How about you let me take one
guess what kind of drink you ordered?

15
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,037
I'd say ice tea, but that's not your thing.

16
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:42,537
Maybe Champagne? No. It's wine.

17
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,271
Not red. It's white.

18
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:46,146
A chilled Meursault.

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,670
Your Meursault ma'am.

20
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:50,967
How could you have known that?

21
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:53,786
Because I read your mind of course.

22
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:54,385
Excuse me...? Uh...

23
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,451
You can take it back.

24
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:00,435
Oh, that's right.

25
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,139
What is it?

26
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,959
My answer is "no."

27
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:04,592
Ah...

28
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:11,115
Uh...

29
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,287
Thanks for your help.

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,486
Hey, are you okay?

31
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:12,852
What the...?!

32
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,300
Please stay calm! Follow our instructions!

33
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,673
Not that way!

34
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,270
What are you doing?!

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,456
I'm preserving the scene of the crime.
Otherwise the evidence will get trampled on.

36
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,657
You understand.

37
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:54,474
Inspector!

38
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,126
So, where's the one I called for?

39
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:57,636
He's already inside.

40
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,572
Thanks a lot.

41
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,176
Sorry to make you wait, Rishi.

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,500
Huh?

43
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,794
I-Inspector Aidan! I'm glad that you called for me sir.

44
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,500
The incident happened at that
ritzy shopping mall just up ahead.

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,159
I think this case could be a little tricky.

46
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:17,348
The body was discovered by Leon Lowe. Yes, that one.

47
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:18,927
Oh, Mr. Lowe!

48
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:19,878
Huh...

49
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:22,813
I heard that you two go way back as student and teacher.

50
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:25,951
Would you mind asking him to not interfere too much?

51
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,144
It's not my place to ask that but I'll go say hello.

52
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:31,576
Mr. Lowe!

53
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,806
Is that you, Rishi?

54
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,296
It's been a while, huh?

55
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,139
It has!

56
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,597
Do you have a moment to chat?

57
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:40,521
Of course.

58
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:44,780
I heard you're working as a
civilian reserve police officer now?

59
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,203
Climbing the ranks, huh?

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,554
And it's thanks to you being my teacher Mr. Lowe.

61
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,962
You taught me everything I know
about criminal behavioral psychology.

62
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:53,787
You don't have to call me "Mister," you know?

63
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:55,640
Now, I'm just a civilian.

64
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:59,527
In any case, I didn't expect the
perpetrator to also have a bomb prepared.

65
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:04,048
The car that exploded ended up
belonging to the victim, Sherilyn Tan.

66
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,516
She was a brilliant lawyer.

67
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:08,599
So it's likely she had more than her share of enemies.

68
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,680
Or involvement in collusion...

69
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:12,475
Is the inspector there?

70
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:14,962
Excuse me, make way!

71
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:16,883
What's going on here?

72
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:18,879
There's something weird in the elevator.

73
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:20,301
What?!

74
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:22,280
What is this...?

75
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,858
Not happening.

76
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,605
Help me out, please.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,397
I said no, and I mean it.

78
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm begging you!

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,775
What's wrong, you two?

80
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,837
He wants to use that drug again
to return to his original form.

81
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:11,888
Even though it caused nothing but problem
after problem on your last school trip, right?

82
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,402
I managed to get by back then, didn't I?

83
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:16,870
So it'll be fine! Please, I need it.

84
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,639
Yeah... No.

85
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:21,732
Where are you headed to this time?

86
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:23,279
To Singapore.

87
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:24,670
Check this out Professor.

88
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:28,407
"He's entering the tournament,
undefeated, after 400 fights!"

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,116
Oh, that guy! Makoto Kyogoku, right?

90
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:35,204
Sonoko was saying she wanted
to go watch the match in person.

91
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:42,078
She asked Pops Kogoro and Ran to go with her. She invited
me too, but I can't leave the country looking like this.

92
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,550
That's a good point. The
passport has Shinichi's information.

93
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,822
I really need your help Ai!

94
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,105
Give it a rest!

95
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:49,842
Argh...

96
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,726
Maybe you should just give up on going this time?

97
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:55,577
Aw... I really wanted to go.

98
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,912
There's no need to stew about it!

99
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,892
In fact, I know just how to take your mind off things!

100
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,744
You got one already?

101
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:05,920
It's time for a special pop quiz!

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,972
Out of the following events, which
is the most popular in Singapore?

103
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:12,000
One, singing the anthem.

104
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,600
Two, celebrating lunar new year.

105
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,806
Three, hoisting up the flag.

106
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:20,310
Four, the Marina Bay fireworks festival?

107
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:22,621
What's the deal with the costume?

108
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,083
That one was too easy.

109
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:28,454
It's three, hoisting up the flag.
Because you raise it on a single pole!

110
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,433
Oh! That's correct! I expected nothing less.

111
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,634
All right, I'll give you another!

112
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:34,706
One is enough.

113
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,222
Woah... oof!

114
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:40,045
It really does get lonely here when
we don't have all the kids around.

115
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,335
Hmm... She didn't help much.

116
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:59,359
Huh?

117
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,973
Huh...

118
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,520
Uh... Ran!

119
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:20,055
Oh! How are you? What are you doing?

120
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,160
All the way over... here...

121
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,944
Ran? Are you okay...?

122
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,301
Come on now.

123
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,500
I've been waiting so long for you.

124
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:31,956
Heh.

125
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,783
Where am I?

126
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,019
It really is gigantic...-

127
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:42,167
It's Ran's voice!

128
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:43,336
Then am I...

129
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:45,686
I must be locked inside of something.

130
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,069
Damn it!

131
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,848
Huh... This should do it...

132
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,358
Ugh...

133
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:57,858
Uh...

134
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,336
Huh?

135
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:08,671
The... Merlion?

136
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,493
I'm in Singapore?!

137
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,636
I'm Shinichi Kudo a high school detective.

138
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,582
I went to an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran.

139
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,058
And while we were there...

140
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:55,251
We witnessed some men in black making a dangerous deal.

141
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,018
Because I was so absorbed in watching them, I
didn't notice the man who came at me from behind.

142
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:06,436
He forced me to drink a poison that
knocked me out, and when I woke up...

143
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,440
... I discovered that my body had shrunk!

144
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:17,250
If those guys ever found out
that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,428
They'd come back. Which would put
everyone I know in terrible danger.

146
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,417
So on Doctor Agasa's advice, I
kept my real identity a secret.

147
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,976
When Ran asked me who I was, I
quickly made up the name "Conan Edogawa."

148
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,376
I knew if I wanted info on the men in black,

149
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,150
the smart thing would be to stay at her house
with her and her dad, who ran a detective agency.

150
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:39,694
One of my greatest rivals of all is this guy.

151
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,695
Kid the Phantom Thief.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,450
He's a master of disguise. His true identity is unknown.

153
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,829
On top of that he's cunning, and knows who I really am.

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,300
Someday, I'll apprehend him myself!

155
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,050
Kid's other rival is Makoto Kyogoku.

156
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,778
A high schooler and Karate master,
who's gone undefeated in 400 matches.

157
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,150
Somehow he's fallen for Ran's classmate,

158
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,120
the daughter of the Suzuki Group, Sonoko Suzuki.

159
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,468
And what are you looking at?
Stop blabbing and get on with it!

160
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:12,021
My body may have shrunk, but my IQ hasn't!

161
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,747
Detective Conan leaves no case unsolved!

162
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,813
There is always only one truth!

163
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:22,745
Huh?

164
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:26,060
My hands are...

165
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,395
Doc's tools are gone, too.

166
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:31,293
I know! Ran should be around here!

167
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,671
Hey Ran! Wait up!

168
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,024
Oh, Shinichi! Over here!

169
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,693
Huh?!

170
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:41,147
Sorry about that!

171
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,807
You must have been waiting a while.

172
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:45,842
Yeah! Where'd you go? I looked all over the place for you.

173
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:49,536
Pops said the heat was getting to
him. So I took him to rest in the shade.

174
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,065
Huh... Well, thanks for helping him out.

175
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:54,701
Some things never change, huh? Look at him.

176
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:58,013
Do me a favor. Could you buy some water for me, Ran?

177
00:11:58,261 --> 00:11:59,711
He's so hopeless...

178
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,112
Let's go together!

179
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,301
Come on, hurry!

180
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:04,479
Uh, huh? Oh, okay.

181
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,912
Things are going so well. They're the cutest.

182
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:10,534
Damn that guy...

183
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,650
Gah! Man, I'm alive again!

184
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:18,518
Hey what's that thing you have
hanging around your neck, Dad?

185
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,950
Huh? Oh! This is a handy case I can keep my passport in!

186
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,137
Keeps it from getting lost or stolen. Pretty nifty huh?

187
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,301
You really don't have to do all that
you know. Singapore is a really safe place!

188
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:31,261
Yo. So, you're awake.

189
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,962
I just knew it was you…

190
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:34,759
Heheh, anyways.

191
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:36,855
How did you manage to get out of the suitcase?

192
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,777
With this.

193
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,256
I just had to push the tip into the latch.

194
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:43,482
It's incredibly easy to open stuff from the inside.

195
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:47,366
I didn't think a pen would be a problem...
I can't let my guard down with you!

196
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,625
I believe that's my line, Kid the Phantom Thief!

197
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,450
Hmph!

198
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,722
Ah, here it is!

199
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:57,205
So, what are you plotting to do this time?

200
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:59,325
Hah. You already know the answer.

201
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,690
Hm, that over there.

202
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,062
Hm... Huh?

203
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,873
Wait, that's Sonoko's...

204
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:08,898
At the end of the 19th century,

205
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,537
a pirate ship is said to have sunk
just off the shores of Singapore.

206
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,666
And on it, a legendary treasure.

207
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,233
One of the largest blue sapphires in the world...

208
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:23,722
Also called, the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

209
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:29,364
You know, the big jewel Mr. Zhonhan
Chen successfully salvaged last year.

210
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,241
Zhonhan Chen? Isn't he kind
of a big deal here in Singapore?

211
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,522
He is. The old man's a huge fan of martial arts, too.

212
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,900
So, he embedded the jewel into a championship belt,
and decided he was going to hold a karate tournament.

213
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,617
So the legendary jewel will be in
the hands of the tournament champion.

214
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,810
Rich people are really something else...

215
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:49,245
You can say that again.

216
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:53,425
At first, I thought I'd just take the jewel
during the chaos of the tournament and peace out.

217
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,125
But it's not like I can just enter
another country as Kid the Phantom Thief.

218
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,362
But if you just came here to take the jewel,

219
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,175
then there'd be no need to bring me along.

220
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:05,743
The circumstances are a little different for me this time.

221
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,260
But I'll tell you all about it soon enough.

222
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,489
You such a... Ugh!

223
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:10,040
What?

224
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,048
Hahahah.

225
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,467
Wait, Shinichi?

226
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:12,836
Huh?

227
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:13,713
You ran off on your own again?

228
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:14,840
Whoops, I'm in trouble!

229
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:15,800
Hold it!

230
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,527
Huh?

231
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:19,304
If you do anything to Ran, I'll make you pay for it!

232
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:23,705
Hah... Unfortunately, I can't
make any promises about that, sorry.

233
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,495
Then I'll reveal your secret right here right now!

234
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:28,330
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

235
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:34,425
You were only able to enter this country
because you were in this specific suitcase here.

236
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:39,100
Specially made to block out the
X-rays at the carry-on luggage check.

237
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,500
Inside, it contains an oxygen
generator that lasts at least 12 hours

238
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:48,637
and it's lined with cushioning that prevents body
aches, and keeps you comfortable over long spans of time.

239
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:53,533
You know what this means right, great detective?

240
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:58,227
Without my help, you won't be able to leave
this country because you don't even have a passport.

241
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,618
It'll leave you unable to return to Japan.

242
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,221
Argh...

243
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:03,358
There you are, Shinichi!

244
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:06,378
I look away for one second and you run off somewhere...

245
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:08,793
Huh?

246
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:13,600
Huh?! It's the little brat?

247
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,400
What's he doing here in Singapore?

248
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:16,467
Conan?

249
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:16,737
Urgh!

250
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,312
Ah! He ran!

251
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,760
Right? I was surprised when I saw him too!

252
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,169
The kid said he was a local.

253
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,042
No way! Are you sure?

254
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:27,480
You girls are way too gullible.

255
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,858
Hey there! What's your name?

256
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,906
Wait, can you understand me?

257
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,549
Huh?

258
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,812
I... Uh...

259
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,050
This boy looks like...

260
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,608
Uh...

261
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,084
Arthur! Yeah, that's my name! It's Arthur Hirai!

262
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,086
It's Arthur Hirai?

263
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,700
Yeah! My mother is Japanese and...

264
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,773
My name's Sonoko Suzuki!

265
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,545
And mine is Ran Mori.

266
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,743
And the guy who's sitting there
fanning himself, is my dad, Kogoro.

267
00:15:58,616 --> 00:15:59,919
Nice to meet you.

268
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,904
Uh... Yeah, you too.

269
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,082
Ran, I have to get going, sorry.

270
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,368
Oh, okay.

271
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,354
So, Arthur.

272
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,096
Are your parents around here?

273
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:13,322
They uh... They're in Japan right now!

274
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:16,720
What? They went overseas and left you home alone?

275
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,540
Mm-hmm. It's fine though, I'm totally used to it.

276
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:20,091
I see...

277
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:22,905
Well, if that's the case, would
you want to come along with us?

278
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,000
Can I?

279
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:25,849
Yeah, of course you can!

280
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,572
Oh, that's right. I'm gonna
check in with my dad for a bit!

281
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:31,929
Okay.

282
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,837
I can't believe he's this late!

283
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,831
He could have at least texted me.

284
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,232
I'm pretty sure that this is
the correct place, so where is he?

285
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,440
You're in our way!

286
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,824
What you lookin' at?

287
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:46,126
Hmph.

288
00:16:46,675 --> 00:16:48,224
What's the deal with those guys?

289
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,870
I know the one in the middle is Reijiro Nakatomi.

290
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,187
Nakatomi...

291
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,275
Oh yeah, isn't he the one who's running Nakatomi Shipping?

292
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:59,274
He's a known hustler. Rumor has
it he's got some real shady friends.

293
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,437
Hey, gorgeous.

294
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:03,538
Did you come all the way to Singapore alone?

295
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:03,899
Hm?

296
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:05,495
You should come hang out with-

297
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,450
Yeah, I don't have time for this right now.

298
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,586
Could you go away?

299
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:08,963
Hmph.

300
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,480
You sure you should open your mouth like that?

301
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:15,255
You know if I felt like it, I could
easily pick you up and drag you into my car.

302
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:17,908
Sonoko!

303
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:20,075
Shinichi?

304
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,375
She's fine. Don't do something unnecessary.

305
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,653
Uh... Huh?

306
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,407
Hey!

307
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:26,032
Aah!

308
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:26,783
Oof!

309
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:27,922
Woah!

310
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:28,965
Ugh!

311
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,124
Woah... ugh!

312
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,802
She's been waiting for me to get here. Problem?

313
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:42,677
Ugh... The hell are you?!

314
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:45,220
Hey! At least check your messages Makoto!

315
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:47,841
Sorry... I'm bad with technology.

316
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,214
Argh!

317
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,020
Ah... ugh! Oof!

318
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,855
I swear, you won't get off easy next time!

319
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,152
Oh Makoto! That was so scary!

320
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,441
I apologize for being so late...

321
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,658
Wow, dude! That was so awesome!

322
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,240
I know right, I can do it too, see? Hah!

323
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,761
Hey! Nice, Karate boy!

324
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:09,211
That was so brave.

325
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:10,227
Ah!

326
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,040
Hm...

327
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:13,024
Er...

328
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:16,901
Uh... Hm...

329
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:19,056
Hey come on now, lighten up!

330
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:20,633
Are you okay, Sonoko?

331
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:21,224
Huh?

332
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,180
Yeah, all thanks to Makoto protecting me!

333
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,000
Makoto! It's been a while.

334
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,819
Yes, it's good to see you! And you are...?

335
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:30,203
It's nice to meet you.

336
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm Shinichi Kudo.

337
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,229
Makoto Kyogoku.

338
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:35,350
Hmm.

339
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:37,312
Uh... Hm.

340
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,653
Uh...

341
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,777
Huh? Is something the matter, Makoto?

342
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:46,025
No I'm fine, I just got this strange
feeling like I've somehow met Mr. Kudo before.

343
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,477
Urk.

344
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:47,806
Ugh!

345
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:52,100
Ah... nope! This is the first time! Hahaha...

346
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:55,846
Now, since we got to seen the
Merlion, let's head over to the hotel!

347
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:58,245
Uh... Well, about that...

348
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:00,245
Hm? Uh...

349
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:04,268
You won't be able to enter the tournament anymore?!

350
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,343
We came all the way here just to see your matches!

351
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,146
I'm really sorry...

352
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,913
The only reason I was even originally able to
enter the tournament was thanks to an invitation.

353
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,924
You mean a sponsor?

354
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:16,789
That's right.

355
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,174
A lawyer named Sherilyn Tan offered to cover my expenses,

356
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:23,440
and asked me if I would like
to try entering the tournament.

357
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:27,080
But then, out of the blue, she passed away.

358
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:27,969
Hm...

359
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:33,824
One of her associates contacted me today and said to
forget that any of that sponsorship talk ever happened.

360
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:34,936
That's horrible!

361
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,591
Yeah, and I heard that the strongest contender here
in Singapore would be entering this tournament, too.

362
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:43,150
I would have loved to have
fought even one match with him...

363
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:47,656
Got it! Then I'll just step up as your sponsor instead!

364
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,334
Huh?!

365
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:50,126
Leave everything to me!

366
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,887
Just what I'd expect from the
daughter of the Suzuki Group.

367
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:57,946
I've got it all taken care of!

368
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:01,895
Hey, we just re-registered you to the tournament!

369
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,305
Is that true, Sonoko?!

370
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:03,704
Mm-hmm!

371
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:05,231
Ah... hm!

372
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:10,634
I also made it so he's staying at the same
hotel as us! It'll be like a double-date now!

373
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,168
Glad it worked out.

374
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:16,775
If that's all settled, let's head on over to the hotel!

375
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,199
Heh, I wanna go swig down some beer real soon!

376
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,013
Mr. Mori?!

377
00:20:20,037 --> 00:20:20,477
Hm?

378
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:23,772
It is you right, Mr. Kogoro Mori?

379
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:25,339
Yeah, that's me.

380
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:28,271
Here! I'm Rishi, and I'm a reserve police officer.

381
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,868
It's an honor to make your acquaintance.

382
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,846
Uh, yeah... Nice to meet you, um...

383
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:35,772
You said, you're a reserve police officer, right?

384
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:40,025
Yes! I am allowed to act as a consultant
in any of Singapore's police matters.

385
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,651
I'm a specialist in criminal behavioral psychology!

386
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,016
Oh, I see.

387
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,389
The truth is...

388
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:49,246
I'd received information that you'd entered
this country and I've been waiting for you.

389
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,733
Waiting for me?

390
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:51,532
Yes.

391
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:54,226
Many tourists visit here, so I'd figured I'd run into you!

392
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,674
But, what do you need me for?

393
00:20:57,064 --> 00:21:01,092
It's a case. There's been an incident
that I'd like to request your assistance on.

394
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:05,136
Hmph. Sorry, no can do. I came here for a vacation.

395
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:08,987
Not so fast there, I think it's in
our best interest to lend him a hand.

396
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,696
Oh yeah? What makes you say that?

397
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,960
He may just be a reserve police officer,

398
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,845
but he might recommend cheap and
delicious places to eat if you help him out..

399
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:18,953
Maybe even a casino... you know?

400
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:19,699
Oh...?

401
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:24,218
Hm, I see! When you put it like that...

402
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:25,569
Heh...

403
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:30,445
I accept! Starting now, the Great
Detective Kogoro Mori will be at your service.

404
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:31,357
I'm honored!

405
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:32,177
Seriously?

406
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:35,810
My father's from Japan, and I've heard
all about the heroic Detective Mori!

407
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,334
I'm a huge fan, too!

408
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,525
Now then, a certain businessman
recently received this card in the mail.

409
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,791
Hm? Is that?!

410
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,921
Kid the Phantom Thief!

411
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:57,886
I received a report that the Suzuki
Group decided to be the sponsor for Kyogoku.

412
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,063
Can you beat him?

413
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:00,950
There's no need for concern.

414
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:05,130
It doesn't matter who my opponent is.
I'll sink them to the mat in one blow.

415
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:06,537
I'll hold you to it.

416
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,570
Oh. Come in.

417
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:10,250
Excuse me.

418
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,553
Mr. Ramanathan has arrived, and he has
someone that he'd like to introduce to you.

419
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:18,232
He's early. Would you please
escort him into the lounge for me?

420
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,375
Yes, of course.

421
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:22,847
So, what about Kid?

422
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:25,685
Sorry, nothing yet. We're still investigating.

423
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:31,515
There seems to be a lot of mismanagement
of information with Sherilyn Tan's case.

424
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,500
I have a hunch about who's behind it.

425
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,464
I'll leave it to you then.

426
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,284
Oh, man! This is incredible!

427
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:40,225
Dad, stop embarrassing us...!

428
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,202
Oh! This suit of armor... is suitable for me!

429
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:46,873
Woah!

430
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:48,851
Huh?

431
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:50,682
Are you all right?

432
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:51,900
Yeah, thanks.

433
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:52,798
Really, Dad?

434
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,213
Can you act like an adult?

435
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:56,973
I'm so sorry my dad is causing you trouble.

436
00:22:56,998 --> 00:23:00,157
I see, and who exactly is this Leon Lowe guy?

437
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,617
Mr. Lowe was an incredibly talented and
prolific criminal behavioral psychologist.

438
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:08,653
He worked closely with the police force
and has apprehended many dangerous criminals.

439
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:12,570
Ah, he seems to be known as
the great detective of Singapore.

440
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,295
He parted ways with the police force two years ago,

441
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:19,225
and since then has become a greatly
successful president of a security firm.

442
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:23,652
Everything I know about criminal behavioral
psychology, I learned from Mr. Lowe.

443
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:24,938
You have quite the past.

444
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:27,719
So, this Leon is the one who received this warning letter?

445
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,904
No, but I'll explain the whole situation.

446
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:31,771
First, take a look at this.

447
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:36,927
It seems Kid the Phantom Thief has his eyes on
this jewel known as the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

448
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,922
It's owned by a businessman named Mr. Zhonhan Chen.

449
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:43,092
He was the one that Kid's advance notice was sent to.

450
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:47,137
If that's the case, then wouldn't we be
better off going to see this Zhonhan guy?

451
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:50,885
Actually, the jewel is currently being
stored in the basement of this mansion.

452
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,246
The jewel is here?

453
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:54,839
That's right.

454
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,454
As requested by Mr. Chen.

455
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:58,725
The safe here was independently developed,

456
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,880
and with it's state-of-the-art
security system, even banks don't...

457
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:03,818
It's state-of-the-art, you say?

458
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,594
Looks like even Kid is gonna have a
hard time getting his hands on this one!

459
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,223
I can't believe you just said that.

460
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,231
Nonsense!

461
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,340
Even top of the line security would
be at the mercy of the magnificent Kid!

462
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:16,144
Hey, Sonoko.

463
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:18,265
You know what I'm talking about right, Ran?

464
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:21,000
When it comes to theft his techniques are so graceful!

465
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:24,995
There's not a single woman on the planet
who wouldn't have their heart stolen by...

466
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,766
Sonoko, I think you should stop!

467
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:27,409
Huh?

468
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,029
Hm?

469
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,735
W-Well, except for the two of us, obviously!

470
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:35,855
Right, Ran?

471
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,937
Yeah, of course, of course!

472
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:39,254
Hah...

473
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:45,800
At this rate you might not
make it out of here in one piece.

474
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,949
Don't say that!

475
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:47,358
Heh.

476
00:24:48,164 --> 00:24:50,100
What a beautiful courtyard!

477
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,125
It's not bad.

478
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:53,198
Good evening everyone.

479
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:56,497
My name is Leon Lowe. Welcome to my home.

480
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:59,600
I hope you don't mind if my personal
bodyguard, and chief of security,

481
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,883
Heazry Jamaluddin accompanies us tonight.

482
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:03,343
Hm.

483
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:05,432
Huh.

484
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,099
Hm.

485
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:12,021
Mr. Kyogoku. I was hoping I'd run into you.

486
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,434
Yeah, same here.

487
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:14,997
I do Karate as well.

488
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:17,923
And I've always wanted to have a match with you.

489
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:23,165
Oh! So, then you must be the
great detective Mr. Kogoro Mori!

490
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,090
Yeah, that would be me. It's a pleasure to meet you.

491
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,643
Didn't realize my fame extended
all the way to foreign countries.

492
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,580
Hmph, that's strange.

493
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,441
Huh?- I don't sense anything.

494
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:36,014
Is there a problem, or...

495
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:37,513
Huh? Hm.

496
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:40,605
Huh? That's impossible...

497
00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:44,205
And you're the famous high school
student detective, Shinichi Kudo.

498
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:45,634
Nice to meet you.

499
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:49,750
Hm. Though if I'm being honest
with you, you're more like a magician.

500
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:50,582
Ah.

501
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:53,013
It's your fingers.

502
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:55,125
They're so thin and flexible.

503
00:25:55,334 --> 00:26:00,309
Oh, I am a detective. I just fight using what
I've got up here a lot more than with my hands.

504
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:01,888
Yes, of course.

505
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:06,530
Oh my, and that must be Miss Sonoko Suzuki over there.

506
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,572
Can't let your guard down with this guy.

507
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,266
You can't go in there! Please wait!

508
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,411
Don't worry about it it's fine!

509
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:17,225
Oh my! It's Kogoro Mori!

510
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:20,225
This is such a treat! My wife and I are big fans!

511
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,631
Uh... Yeah.

512
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:23,718
Do you mind if I take just one photo?

513
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:24,402
Photo?!

514
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:27,008
I'm so sorry, he just showed up out of the blue.

515
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,202
Don't worry about it.

516
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,032
Hahah!

517
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:31,665
Now then, I'd like to show everyone to our safe room.

518
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,143
That's a splendid idea! I'll come with you.

519
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:38,824
I'd love for you folks to see the Fist
of Blue Sapphire in all of it's glory!

520
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,570
Hmph.

521
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,773
Beyond these doors is the pride
of our company, the safe room.

522
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:48,897
Only a select few individuals have
the ability to open the entrance.

523
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:08,025
The walls are made of a fireproof alloy
and they're completely indestructible.

524
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,983
They also cut out all broadcast
signals. Nothing get's through.

525
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,116
The cargo's location is set to relocate regularly.

526
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:20,858
This safe is special. It's filled with my ideals.
And there isn't another like it in the entire world.

527
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:24,485
Wh-What's happening?

528
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,358
Everyone, please take a step back.

529
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:29,383
Woah...

530
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:32,553
And here is the jewel, said to
be the proof of t king of pirates.

531
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:34,175
The Fist of Blue Sapphire.

532
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:36,475
That is one big sapphire.

533
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:37,774
Can you see it, Arthur?

534
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:39,337
Yeah! Thank you!

535
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,000
I get it now. As long as it's here,

536
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:45,219
not even Kid will have a chance to
get his sticky little hands on this.

537
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,618
Unfortunately it's not that simple.

538
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,320
Starting tomorrow, for the duration of the tournament,

539
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:53,315
we must display the belt at the stadium as per the rules.

540
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,447
In other words, it's going to have to be
transferred to and stored in a room at the venue itself.

541
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:02,419
We've prepared tight security, but
it's nothing compared to this room.

542
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,387
Oh, I see.

543
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:06,646
The stadium's security will keep an eye out too, right?

544
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:09,950
Of course. We shall guard the jewel at any cost.

545
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:16,864
If anything happens to the Fist, you're the
one who will be paying a hefty compensation fee.

546
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:18,071
Hm.

547
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,369
You mentioned that the security
will be inferior to this room.

548
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:26,182
In other words, you think Kid's waiting for the
sapphire to be moved to the stadium. Is that correct?

549
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,265
Yes, exactly. It'd be far too
risky to target this location.

550
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,180
I agree.

551
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,207
I may not be of much help, but please
let me assist in guarding the jewel.

552
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:35,787
Huh.

553
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:37,709
I'd be grateful.

554
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,295
Piece of cake!

555
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:08,894
Wow!

556
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:25,829
Thanks for the fingerprints!

557
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:33,068
Hm...

558
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,677
This seems way too easy.

559
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:46,154
Ah.

560
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,360
I've been waiting.

561
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:52,039
Kid the Phantom Thief.

562
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:54,375
For you to make it all the way out here...

563
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,718
Simply brilliant.

564
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,133
You sure are confident, huh.

565
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:02,415
Deepest apologies, but I won't
be handing the jewel over to you.

566
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,450
I'd rather not have to pay a
compensation fee to Zhonhan Chen.

567
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:10,551
Hmph, my job is to steal treasure.
So I'd never ask for a simple hand out.

568
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:15,246
In fact, the more difficult something is
to steal, the more fired up I get about it.

569
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,024
That's just who I am!

570
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:26,647
Huh...

571
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,742
Well well, it's already over.

572
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:39,752
Now then, I hope you like the taste of Singaporean water.

573
00:30:59,291 --> 00:30:59,791
Gah!

574
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:03,953
This is bad. I didn't expect him to use a taser.

575
00:31:16,864 --> 00:31:17,309
Ah!

576
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:39,325
Kid!

577
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:41,381
Woah!

578
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:44,385
What a pain!

579
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:45,750
Woah!

580
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:46,447
What?!

581
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,705
What's going on?

582
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:54,586
- What happened?

583
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:55,451
It's Kid!

584
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:58,693
No need to worry, because I'm always...

585
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:05,439
When it comes to heists, those who plan for
the worst-case scenario are the most successful!

586
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:07,266
One step ahead of them.

587
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,871
I gotta hurry up and get the hell out of here!

588
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:12,444
Huh?

589
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,882
It's him!

590
00:32:21,016 --> 00:32:21,651
Ugh!

591
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:37,944
Hup!

592
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:39,730
Woah!

593
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:41,198
Woah!

594
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,419
That was some jab...

595
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,675
It would've ended there if I didn't jump back.

596
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:52,910
Well now... so it's breaking and
entering today. Am I right, Kid?

597
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,925
Yeah, but I didn't expect to see you here. Heh.

598
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,244
I was invited here tonight to
join in on some last minute training.

599
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:02,035
Who would have guessed that I'd come to blows with you.

600
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,055
Oh, no no no! I really don't want to fight!

601
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,225
Don't you run!

602
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:05,907
Woah!

603
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:07,983
No wait!

604
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:09,982
Now, prepare yourself!

605
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,045
Dah!

606
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:31,705
Huh... A soccer ball? But where did that come from?

607
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:34,565
Thanks for the back up, great detective!

608
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:36,335
Hmph!

609
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,973
This one is amazing! I can fly even without the wind.

610
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:55,292
I gotta remember to give Gramps my thanks!

611
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:58,939
But still... To think he'd be that advanced.

612
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:11,962
Hm.

613
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:19,326
You really saved me.

614
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,466
It was the right call for me to
return your stuff to you after all.

615
00:34:22,704 --> 00:34:24,380
I didn't want to save you at all though.

616
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:28,250
More importantly. I've waited long enough!

617
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,316
Tell me the real reason why you brought me with you!

618
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:32,292
Hmph.

619
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:34,541
Woah!

620
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:41,575
Leon had been searching for the Fist
of Blue Sapphire for quite a few years.

621
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:47,063
And he was one step shy of salvaging it for
himself, when Zhonhan Chen just barely beat him to it.

622
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,675
At some point, the location of
the sunken ship was leaked to Chen,

623
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,559
at least that's how it seems.

624
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:55,580
The main suspect was a woman named Sherilyn Tan.

625
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,988
For a while, she was the legal adviser for Leon's company,

626
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,885
but their relationship turned sour.

627
00:35:01,448 --> 00:35:05,342
Rumor has it that soon after she
became the sponsor for Kyogoku...

628
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,600
...to keep Jamaluddin from winning.

629
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:11,302
And thus, preventing Leon from obtaining the jewel.

630
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,216
If that's how it all went down,

631
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:17,859
then the rumor that she leaked the information
about the ships location, is very likely true.

632
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:21,019
And soon after, that same Sherilyn Tan was murdered.

633
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,500
If the rumors about the leaks are true,

634
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,694
Leon is the one with the most
motive for Sherilyn's murder.

635
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,291
Where do the police stand with the case?

636
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:33,650
Unfortunately, Leon has already been
removed from their list of suspects.

637
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:34,725
Why is that?

638
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:37,593
Because they have an even more likely suspect.

639
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:39,236
Really? Who?

640
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,496
The police haven't made it yet,

641
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:49,097
but there was a card with a message on it
left behind at the scene of Sherilyn Tan's murder.

642
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,487
It was my advance notice.

643
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,594
Hm? Now I get it.

644
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:58,876
But still, why do I have to share such a
breathtaking view with this guy of all people?

645
00:35:59,942 --> 00:36:01,744
I wish I could see it with...

646
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:14,488
It's time to go back to being Arthur Hirai for now.

647
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:18,675
Oh by the way, I see how you got
"Arthur" from Arthur Conan Doyle,

648
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:19,973
but why "Hirai"?

649
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:20,270
Huh?

650
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:25,126
Well that was taken from Ranpo
Edogawa's real name, Taro Hirai.

651
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:26,720
Ah, I see.

652
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:30,125
Regardless, this is clearly a trap set for you!

653
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,937
Hmph. Yeah, I know that.

654
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:35,559
That's the whole reason I brought
you along with me, great detective.

655
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,942
Things like this are your specialty.

656
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:42,113
I understand your reason, but I
still don't like how you went about it.

657
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,821
I am Kid the Phantom Thief.

658
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,779
Do you really expect me to stay quiet after all of that?

659
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:54,523
Oh?

660
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,975
You know how late you are? It feels
like I've been waiting here forever.

661
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,647
My bad, sorry.

662
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,563
Well anyway, take a look.

663
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,311
What a beautiful nightscape.

664
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:07,703
So romantic, isn't it?

665
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,888
Don't look so embarrased about it.

666
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,706
I mean the two of us are going out now, aren't we?

667
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,709
Y-Yeah!

668
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:23,420
Wait, you are?!

669
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:28,728
Damn it, Ran, I can't believe you
haven't realized he's an impostor yet!

670
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:32,484
Ugh, but if she does, I won't be able to go back to Japan!

671
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:51,355
When you're in Singapore, you
gotta have a Singapore Sling ya know!

672
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:52,243
One more.

673
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:54,277
Mr. Mori?

674
00:37:54,547 --> 00:37:54,982
Huh?

675
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:57,980
Oh, hello there. You're uh...

676
00:37:58,162 --> 00:38:00,787
Do you mind if I take a seat next to you?

677
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:05,528
Huh? No no no, please please do! Have a drink with me.

678
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:06,370
Oh.

679
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:08,142
Well actually, I...

680
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:09,293
Hm?

681
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:12,194
Huh?!

682
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:15,840
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I just did that.

683
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:17,995
I am so sorry.

684
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:21,449
Oh, no, it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.

685
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,289
Mr. Mori, sir. A call for you.

686
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,146
Hm? A call?

687
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,866
Yes, it seems like you have a telephone call.

688
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,551
It's for me? Whose it from?

689
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,070
Mr. Mori!

690
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:34,655
Huh?

691
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:38,082
There's something I really need to talk to you about.

692
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:40,431
Please meet me here tomorrow.

693
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:42,298
Oh? Huh?! Ah...

694
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,863
Hmm... Jeez.

695
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,689
What the... They hung up on me!

696
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:53,381
Eh! Back to the booze!

697
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:05,375
Who do you girls think is going to be the winner?

698
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,686
Mr. Kyogoku!

699
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,480
He's never lost a single match!

700
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:11,681
Oh, is that true? I've never heard that before.

701
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,867
But if you put the effort into something,
and you always keep your goal in mind,

702
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:17,575
you're sure to see results.

703
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,629
That's great! Did you two get that?

704
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:20,640
Yeah!

705
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,866
Who will win the Fist of Blue Sapphire?

706
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:35,741
Hmph!

707
00:39:36,169 --> 00:39:36,693
Huh...

708
00:39:40,664 --> 00:39:41,438
Ugh!

709
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:44,234
Ugh!

710
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,944
That Jamaluddin guy he seems crazy strong!

711
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:59,464
The power of a heavyweight but not
lacking at all in speed or technique.

712
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,140
A tough opponent...

713
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,000
As expected from our Karate team captain!

714
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,629
You see things from a completely different angle!

715
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:11,254
Hey, if Kyogoku were to win
the tournament and get the jewel,

716
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:13,750
it'd be impossible for you to nab it, right?

717
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:18,681
Yeah. It would... I'd rather not
get too close to him if I can help it.

718
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:23,331
Oh! Look it's Makoto!

719
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:26,935
Come on! Let's cheer for him!

720
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:30,050
Hang on, why is that kid still tagging along with us?

721
00:40:30,147 --> 00:40:32,505
He's really taken a liking to me, I guess.

722
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:44,043
Bow to each other.

723
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:48,516
Huh.

724
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:50,068
Begin!

725
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:50,650
Hm?

726
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:51,812
Augh!

727
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:53,096
Woah!

728
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,695
Ugh.

729
00:40:58,793 --> 00:40:59,367
Hmph.

730
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,161
Scary.

731
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:03,014
Woohoo! Makoto, you're so cool!

732
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,954
Aah, I wish I could go see him now.

733
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:08,028
Oh, it's from my Dad.

734
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:12,025
Like I told ya, I'm not here to cause any trouble!

735
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:12,827
Dad!

736
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:15,196
What happened?

737
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,285
Ran, come on, help me get through to these guys!

738
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:20,851
I put all the metal on me in the bin,

739
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:22,829
but then this happens.

740
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:25,330
You can't come in.

741
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:26,650
Just let me in!

742
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,769
Sorry, but no!

743
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:31,280
Gaah! I'm gonna miss the whole thing at this rate!

744
00:41:31,578 --> 00:41:33,650
Mr. Mori! Is something wrong?

745
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:34,937
Mr. Rishi!

746
00:41:35,224 --> 00:41:37,656
He's on staff, please let him inside.

747
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:38,640
Yes, sir.

748
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:40,176
Thank you, Mr. Rishi!

749
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,790
I'm glad I found you in time.

750
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,576
The belt was shown during opening ceremonies,

751
00:41:44,776 --> 00:41:47,076
but it's being stored in an underground safe now.

752
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:49,739
If you'd like, I'll bring you there after the matches.

753
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:52,584
In any case, where have you been all this time?

754
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:55,992
Ah! I, uh... went on patrol! That's what I did.

755
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:58,701
I bet he had a hangover and slept in.

756
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:03,563
The PIN is changed randomly every 10 minutes.

757
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,059
It's all maintained by a computer
that sends the code by email.

758
00:42:07,837 --> 00:42:10,300
There are only three people who receive that email.

759
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:14,344
Myself, Inspector Aidan, and Mr. Lowe,
who is in charge of managing the safe.

760
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:16,989
Hm...

761
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,049
That's a whole lot of empty space for one jewel.

762
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,685
I wouldn't call it empty.

763
00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:24,974
The floor has a weight sensor.
The ceiling, security cameras.

764
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:28,033
Police officers are completely
surrounding the stadium as well.

765
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,600
You really have it covered!

766
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:31,824
Seems the phantom thief is out of luck.

767
00:42:31,976 --> 00:42:32,363
Oh...

768
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:34,785
Please, refrain from smoking here.

769
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,648
Oh! Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

770
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:37,592
Oh. Huh?

771
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:43,926
Hmm... I had too many drinks and completely forgot!

772
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:47,912
She gave this to me at the bar last
night, said that she needed to talk.

773
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:52,075
Hey, that's Mr. Leon's secretary.

774
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,728
Ah, is that so?

775
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,002
To be honest, I was too drunk to remember most of it...

776
00:42:57,435 --> 00:42:58,800
But how do you know that?

777
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:01,484
It has Mr. Leon's company logo on it. Look!

778
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,865
Oh, really?

779
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:10,302
There's a message, "Tomorrow at 3PM, meet me
behind National Stadium in front of gate 3."

780
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:13,324
And it also says, "Tell no one" in all caps!

781
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:17,222
Ah, I see. 3PM, which means I have about...

782
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:19,224
Oh, wait, it's almost time!

783
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:20,932
Wait, Mr. Mori!

784
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:23,649
It's embarrassing for a man to make a lady wait!

785
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:24,952
Huh...

786
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:27,337
Hmph.

787
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:33,293
Hm.

788
00:43:38,278 --> 00:43:40,279
That was quite a match to behold.

789
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:44,641
I'm already looking forward to
the semifinals and finals tomorrow.

790
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,410
Thank you, I'll do my best.

791
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,581
Your strength is truly exceptional.

792
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:52,553
How would you feel? About working for me as my bodyguard?

793
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:55,573
Excuse me.

794
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,998
Hold on a second.

795
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:03,301
You have to know I was joking.

796
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:06,187
There is one thing I wanted to ask you, though.

797
00:44:08,051 --> 00:44:09,111
Tell me now...

798
00:44:11,054 --> 00:44:13,434
What purpose do your fists serve to you?

799
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:18,090
You seek greater strength of
course, but what lies beyond that?

800
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,608
Is there a real driving force behind your actions?

801
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:22,877
Huh?

802
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:25,836
Do you not have an answer?

803
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:29,872
An imperfect fist without a goal can be awfully dangerous.

804
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:34,654
To more than just yourself. It brings
misfortune to those around you as well.

805
00:44:34,948 --> 00:44:37,204
Those around me? Misfortune?

806
00:44:37,435 --> 00:44:40,526
Oh, yes. For instance, someone you're in love with.

807
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,115
You have someone like that. I know that you do.

808
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:49,741
That fist of yours invites danger, and
it may even bring harm to the one you love.

809
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,548
And if that were to happen, well what would you do then?

810
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,951
I'm looking forward to seeing
how your matches go tomorrow.

811
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:04,344
Huh.

812
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:06,465
Hmm...

813
00:45:10,604 --> 00:45:11,773
Huh?

814
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,719
Is there something else?

815
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:17,380
Great job out there!

816
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:18,999
It's you, Sonoko!

817
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:22,409
Jeez, you were taking forever so I came to you!

818
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:24,348
I'm sorry for making you wait.

819
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:26,850
Now let's all go eat lunch together!

820
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:29,000
There's a restaurant that I want to check out!

821
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:32,230
Sorry, Sonoko. Can you two go eat without me?

822
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,747
Why? Not hungry?

823
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,979
I'm really sorry!

824
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:39,619
It's just that I don't think Shinichi can leave
any time soon since he's guarding the jewel...

825
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:40,802
Yeah, I see.

826
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,712
Hmm, I guess it can't be helped.

827
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:46,071
Looks like it's just us, Makoto.

828
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:46,849
Okay.

829
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:48,578
I'll see you later then, Ran!

830
00:45:48,602 --> 00:45:49,010
Mhm.

831
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,710
Please excuse us.

832
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,840
I hope you eat a ton! You earned it after today.

833
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,288
Thank you so much.

834
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:56,675
Hmph.

835
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:09,484
Now, stay alert and be aware of your surroundings!

836
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:13,226
If you see anything that seems unusual, report it!

837
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:14,958
And take action immediately!

838
00:46:15,762 --> 00:46:16,516
Also... woah!

839
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:17,008
Ah!

840
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:21,350
Are you okay Miss? I'm so sorry!

841
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:22,969
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

842
00:46:26,938 --> 00:46:27,676
Hmph.

843
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:30,258
Hm.

844
00:46:31,853 --> 00:46:33,762
Wait, Inspector Aidan!

845
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:37,473
Sorry, I couldn't help but notice it before...

846
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:39,618
Oh, uh. I'm sorry, what?

847
00:46:40,094 --> 00:46:43,319
There, I fixed it! Keep up the good work!

848
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,035
Yes, ma'am!

849
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,950
Everything okay with the safe room?

850
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,000
Yes, sir. Everything looks normal.

851
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,400
Excuse me, I'm so sorry!

852
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,466
What's the matter, Miss?

853
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:57,795
Inspector Aidan says he needs
the both of you to come quickly!

854
00:46:58,798 --> 00:46:59,786
What's this about?

855
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,202
I'll keep watch of the door.

856
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:04,198
Okay, we'll be back soon, thank you!

857
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,291
Now then.

858
00:47:13,216 --> 00:47:15,067
I'll be taking that treasure!

859
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:29,668
Huh?

860
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,580
You're mine now.

861
00:47:38,724 --> 00:47:40,745
Huh? Is there something stuck?

862
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,769
Huh?!

863
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,499
What?! It's a corpse!

864
00:47:51,946 --> 00:47:52,834
Rechel?!

865
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:56,570
Damn! I gotta get out of here, fast!

866
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:00,083
Huh?

867
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,012
Something's written there...

868
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:05,723
Damn!

869
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:07,265
Gah!

870
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:10,926
Huh?

871
00:48:11,118 --> 00:48:12,334
Stop right there!

872
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:14,676
Woah!

873
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:17,192
Woah.

874
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,656
Drop the gun, now!

875
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:21,444
Kid! You're under arrest!

876
00:48:24,862 --> 00:48:25,509
Huh?!

877
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:28,806
Woah!

878
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:34,494
Come on, just how long is
Rechel gonna make me wait here for?

879
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,218
Let's give it 10 more minutes... huh?

880
00:48:37,444 --> 00:48:38,844
Huh?! What's going on?

881
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,277
It might be Kid!

882
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,126
Oh, hey, wait for me!

883
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,002
There he is!

884
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:47,475
Look!

885
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,041
Aah! This does not look good!

886
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:53,227
But, now that I'm outside, I'm safe!

887
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:55,858
Look up high!

888
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:56,601
Wow!

889
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:02,578
There were that many of them?

890
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,945
Huh? Hm...

891
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,100
Huh?

892
00:49:12,205 --> 00:49:13,494
Come back here!

893
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:19,100
Damn it!

894
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,000
Get going! Apprehend him at any cost!

895
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:22,623
Yes, sir!

896
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,268
Do they really have it under control?

897
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:28,493
There you are, Mr. Mori! I've been looking for you!

898
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:31,173
Yeah, things seem to have gotten pretty bad huh.

899
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,542
To think Kid would show up in broad daylight like this.

900
00:49:34,716 --> 00:49:36,401
But don't worry!

901
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:39,576
I, Kogoro Mori, the greatest detective am on the case...

902
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,881
That's not important right now!

903
00:49:41,054 --> 00:49:43,060
Something truly terrible has happened!

904
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,067
Please come to the safe room right away!

905
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:45,813
Huh?

906
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:46,575
Hm...

907
00:49:49,242 --> 00:49:52,942
Look! That has to be the biggest bird I've ever seen!

908
00:49:57,748 --> 00:49:58,423
Hup!

909
00:49:58,683 --> 00:49:59,409
Ugh!

910
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,283
If I've come this far...

911
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:04,672
Huh?!

912
00:50:06,642 --> 00:50:07,325
Huh?

913
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,619
It... can't be...

914
00:50:15,204 --> 00:50:18,244
She was Mr. Lowe's secretary. Her name was Rechel.

915
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:19,537
Miss Rechel?

916
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,186
I see...

917
00:50:22,678 --> 00:50:24,473
Did you check the surveillance cameras?

918
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:27,110
It's no good. The system had been hacked.

919
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:30,798
I was set to run on a loop. Showing
footage of the room with nobody in it.

920
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:33,969
Oh, gotcha. And do you have any suspects?

921
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:34,941
Of course we do.

922
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:35,366
Oh?

923
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,160
Right now we're going after him with all we have.

924
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,157
You're already on him? That means...

925
00:50:41,182 --> 00:50:44,112
There's no doubt that the
perpetrator is Kid the Phantom Thief!

926
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,792
In any case, you only have yourself to
blame for leaving your hacking system, Kid.

927
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:52,320
Hey Mister! The timing doesn't make sense.

928
00:50:52,378 --> 00:50:56,628
Wasn't Rechel supposed to meet up with Mr. Mori
at the back of the stadium when it happened?

929
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:59,118
So then what was she doing in the safe room?

930
00:50:59,142 --> 00:50:59,925
Yeah.

931
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,510
Come to think of it...

932
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:04,102
According to an officer in front of the safe room,

933
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:07,104
she was heading here to relay
a message from Inspector Aidan.

934
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,018
Apparently it was urgent.

935
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,282
So it makes sense that she'd prioritized that.

936
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:14,097
And then there was the huge ruckus right after.

937
00:51:14,392 --> 00:51:17,998
But Kid committing murder... That seems out of character.

938
00:51:20,087 --> 00:51:22,192
Hey! You can't just go in there!

939
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:24,436
Oh what's the deal with this kid...

940
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,591
Look! There's a message written in blood.

941
00:51:29,616 --> 00:51:30,670
- Come on! - Woah!

942
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:33,236
This isn't a place for kids!

943
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:37,463
Hm...

944
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,682
Take a look at this.

945
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,100
Oh, yes.

946
00:51:43,343 --> 00:51:46,941
You've been completely framed for all of this, Kid.

947
00:51:49,928 --> 00:51:50,484
Heh...

948
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:54,266
All right, bring it on.

949
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,572
Now it's really... Starting to get interesting...

950
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:03,375
I knew you'd pick something delicious,

951
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,207
but I have to say, the chicken rice and
watermelon juice were absolutely phenomenal!

952
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:08,541
Weren't they?

953
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:12,380
Hm? Something wrong?

954
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:16,163
No... It's just now that we've filled out stomachs up...

955
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,786
Makoto, there's somewhere I'd really like to go with you!

956
00:52:19,957 --> 00:52:21,357
Of course, anywhere.

957
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:26,261
Woah!

958
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:28,429
Woah! That doesn't look good!

959
00:52:28,653 --> 00:52:29,072
Huh?

960
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:32,959
Hey girl. What are you gonna do about this, huh?

961
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:35,803
What? But you're the one who ran into me!

962
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,475
Really? I don't think I understand.

963
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:39,742
Come explain!

964
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,821
Damn!

965
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:49,800
Ugh!

966
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:58,224
Some of his comrades may be hiding and waiting.

967
00:52:58,423 --> 00:53:01,331
Please Sonoko, don't stray too far away from me. Okay?

968
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:02,855
Uh, okay!

969
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:18,173
That fist of yours invites danger and it
may even bring harm to the one you love.

970
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,256
Woah!

971
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:26,365
Oh!

972
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:30,932
Huh?

973
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:32,926
Sonoko!

974
00:53:40,694 --> 00:53:41,308
Hm...

975
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:52,724
Ah...

976
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:56,415
There they are!

977
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:58,277
Please! Can you help me?

978
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:05,787
Oof!

979
00:54:09,656 --> 00:54:10,624
Ah!

980
00:54:14,393 --> 00:54:14,855
Huh?

981
00:54:21,614 --> 00:54:22,273
Hup!

982
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,281
Ugh!

983
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,648
Hmph!

984
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:27,943
Sonoko!

985
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:31,664
Is she alive?

986
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:33,323
I'm calling an ambulance!

987
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:34,374
Is she a foreigner?

988
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:37,209
Sonoko!

989
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:46,751
Sonoko...

990
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:48,974
Can you hear my voice?

991
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:52,821
Come on, wake up! Please, Sonoko!

992
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:03,508
Did the doctors have anything to say?

993
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:05,907
They said that the wounds weren't life-threatening.

994
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:09,075
She's sleeping right now so
she's gonna stay here over night.

995
00:55:09,496 --> 00:55:11,236
and they'll run tests in the morning.

996
00:55:12,173 --> 00:55:14,327
I'm really glad that she's okay.

997
00:55:15,557 --> 00:55:16,755
But even still...

998
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,550
I won't forgive the coward that did this to her.

999
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:19,514
It's all my fault.

1000
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,098
Because of me, Sonoko was...

1001
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:24,258
Hm...

1002
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,234
Sorry I'm late!

1003
00:55:26,258 --> 00:55:26,634
Huh?

1004
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:28,361
I got here as fast as I could!

1005
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,646
No, thanks for all your hard work.

1006
00:55:30,853 --> 00:55:32,353
How's the investigation?

1007
00:55:32,505 --> 00:55:35,597
Well, the incident occurred on an empty back street,

1008
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,342
so there weren't any witnesses.

1009
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,448
No, that's not quite right...

1010
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:44,008
there were witnesses, but they were all
knocked unconscious when the police car was stolen.

1011
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:48,815
Huh?

1012
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:51,724
Please pardon my intrusion,

1013
00:55:51,953 --> 00:55:54,464
Oh, Mr. Lowe! What are you doing here?

1014
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:56,825
I heard about what happened and rushed over.

1015
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,056
Sonoko's still sleeping right now.

1016
00:55:59,198 --> 00:56:01,437
Would you mind giving these to her when she wakes up?

1017
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:02,964
Of course, thank you.

1018
00:56:06,979 --> 00:56:10,244
It would seem that what I warned
you about earlier has come true.

1019
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:14,667
The god of battle is giving you a trial,
through which you can prove your worth.

1020
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:20,499
It's his way of saying you don't yet have the
strength of body, mind, and heart, to raise your fist.

1021
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:23,699
Here. I'm giving this talisman to you.

1022
00:56:25,505 --> 00:56:27,490
It's similar to a misanga.

1023
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,235
When the bracelet snaps,

1024
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:33,758
it means the god has recognized
you possess the proper strength.

1025
00:56:34,113 --> 00:56:37,628
However, if you were to raise
your fist before that happens...

1026
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,067
Well, I think you know...

1027
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:46,518
Gah, ow! Ugh.

1028
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,965
They got you pretty bad.

1029
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,754
Nah, this much is nothing.

1030
00:56:52,215 --> 00:56:54,671
Still, they didn't even hesitate.

1031
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:57,006
I guess I got out played this time.

1032
00:56:57,506 --> 00:57:01,136
They're saying they have no doubt
that Rechel's murder was all your doing.

1033
00:57:01,534 --> 00:57:05,887
It was a clever trap, built
perfectly to put the blame on you.

1034
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,239
So they beat me at my own game.

1035
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,742
I wasn't even there at the scene of the crime,

1036
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:12,640
but to the audience,

1037
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:17,177
it looks like I was standing at the center of
the stage. Clearly playing the role of the killer.

1038
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:22,191
So, if you flip the viewpoint around,
the trick they're using becomes apparent.

1039
00:57:24,076 --> 00:57:29,843
Exactly. Someone who leads you to believe there's
something inside a clenched fist... that's a magician.

1040
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:35,023
And someone who correctly guesses what's
actually inside of that fist, a detective.

1041
00:57:36,865 --> 00:57:38,848
Uh... Huh?

1042
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:47,272
I'll be anxiously awaiting your
correct guess, great detective...

1043
00:57:47,871 --> 00:57:51,723
What is hidden inside, in this
mysterious fist called murder?

1044
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,138
Come on...

1045
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:06,380
Huh.

1046
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,851
You're that boy! You haven't gone home yet?

1047
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:11,919
Hey, do you mind if I stay with you tonight?

1048
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:14,461
What? You mean at my place?

1049
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:17,394
If I go home, I'll be all by myself.

1050
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:21,621
After everything that happened here, I'm really scared.

1051
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,816
If I say I'm staying with you though, I'm
sure my Mom and Dad would be a lot more relieved.

1052
00:58:26,925 --> 00:58:27,975
Hmm...

1053
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:33,322
I also can't think of anything worse than sleeping
in the same room with him two nights in a row!

1054
00:58:40,402 --> 00:58:41,753
This is amazing!

1055
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,390
Are all these awards your Dad won? There's so many!

1056
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,353
Yes, they are. My dad was an oceanographer.

1057
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,440
He passed away five years ago though.

1058
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,200
In the process of researching, he
found several ruins sunken in the sea.

1059
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:56,180
You must be really proud of him.

1060
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:56,846
Mm.

1061
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:02,025
Well, I still have a bit of work left to do
tonight. You can go ahead and get some sleep, Arthur.

1062
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:03,157
Okay!

1063
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:04,945
Huh.

1064
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:09,276
Mr. Rishi, do these red marks
on the map mean anything special?

1065
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,818
Yeah, they show the locations where
ships were previously attacked by pirates.

1066
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,971
Wow! Do pirates still exist?

1067
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,132
Of course they do.

1068
00:59:17,497 --> 00:59:20,303
In the past, there were a great
number of them around Singapore, too.

1069
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:25,809
But right now, pirates aren't the problem... This
murder case will be even harder to handle than them.

1070
00:59:26,174 --> 00:59:28,184
Plus, it's Kid the Phantom Thief.

1071
00:59:28,494 --> 00:59:31,021
I borrowed some reference materials from inspector Aidan.

1072
00:59:32,887 --> 00:59:35,087
Going through this is gonna take all night.

1073
00:59:36,461 --> 00:59:37,940
Urk! Ah...

1074
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,049
Sorry about that Rishi, but
it's time for you to take a nap.

1075
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:07,406
Hey, what is that?

1076
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:07,819
Huh?

1077
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:09,663
Have you always had it?

1078
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:12,025
Sonoko! You finally woke up!

1079
01:00:13,136 --> 01:00:14,741
A while ago, actually.

1080
01:00:15,638 --> 01:00:17,664
I'm so glad. Truly.

1081
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:20,675
So, is that a magic charm?

1082
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:23,670
Uh, yeah... It's something like that.

1083
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,059
You shouldn't do that. You need proper rest!

1084
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,387
I'm not even a little bit sleepy.

1085
01:00:34,602 --> 01:00:37,430
I didn't come all the way to Singapore, to rest in bed.

1086
01:00:38,224 --> 01:00:41,890
You can't heal if you overexert
yourself. Please stay put for tonight.

1087
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:49,673
Hey, I've been wanting to ask, but why do you
never take off that Band-Aid near your left eyebrow?

1088
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:53,956
Uuh, this old thing? No reason, really...

1089
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,037
Huh... Hm.

1090
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:00,670
Hmph.

1091
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:12,769
Hm.

1092
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:17,425
Didn't we say we weren't going to
meet until everything was over, Eugene?

1093
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:20,420
You bragged about how perfect your plan was,

1094
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,255
but are you totally sure?

1095
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:25,965
Hmph, you may look tough, but in reality you're a coward.

1096
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:29,136
I think you should watch what you say to me.

1097
01:01:31,002 --> 01:01:32,767
Woah! Ah!

1098
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,648
I always keep my promises, don't doubt me.

1099
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,802
What ever you do, I will get
even. That's how I always operate.

1100
01:02:03,993 --> 01:02:05,764
We have an announcement to make!

1101
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:09,766
In the second semi-finals match,
Makoto Kyogoku has withdrawn.

1102
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,550
Tan Lee will proceed to the finals in his place.

1103
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:13,595
Damn it!

1104
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:16,225
This isn't what I wanted at all.

1105
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,570
Withdrew from the tournament?!

1106
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,586
Why? It's not because of me, right?

1107
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,931
There's still a possibility that the guys
who assaulted us will come after us again.

1108
01:02:25,103 --> 01:02:27,846
I can't leave your side until I know it's safe for you.

1109
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,129
So it really is my fault then.

1110
01:02:31,304 --> 01:02:32,595
Please don't do this!

1111
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:34,888
There was someone you wanted to fight, wasn't there?

1112
01:02:35,337 --> 01:02:36,015
Yes.

1113
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,028
But the current me wasn't even
able to protect you, Sonoko.

1114
01:02:40,107 --> 01:02:41,935
Right now I'm lacking something.

1115
01:02:44,211 --> 01:02:46,032
Well of course you're lacking something.

1116
01:02:46,056 --> 01:02:46,392
Huh?

1117
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,860
You keep hiding everything from me...

1118
01:02:49,126 --> 01:02:50,134
What do you mean?

1119
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:54,153
Like when I asked you about the bracelet or
the bandaid, you wouldn't tell me anything.

1120
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:57,829
No uh, actually this is... Well, it's because...

1121
01:02:58,642 --> 01:02:59,198
Get out.

1122
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:00,190
Huh?

1123
01:03:00,714 --> 01:03:04,464
I don't want to be protected by a
man who does nothing but lie to my face!

1124
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,065
Do you have any clue how worried I was about you?

1125
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,150
I couldn't reach your phone at all for a while.

1126
01:03:12,213 --> 01:03:15,913
Sorry, my bad. I just got so preoccupied with chasing Kid.

1127
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:18,131
As expected of the moonlight magician.

1128
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:21,922
Even I, Shinichi Kudo, find it
beyond me to be able to capture...

1129
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,007
Ow!

1130
01:03:24,265 --> 01:03:25,559
Oh, hello Arthur.

1131
01:03:25,788 --> 01:03:27,126
It's nice to see you!

1132
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:30,370
Was your friend Sonoko all right
after everything that happened?

1133
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:35,237
Yup. I stopped by the hospital a little earlier,
and all of her test results came back normal.

1134
01:03:35,363 --> 01:03:38,144
She'll be discharged this
afternoon and will head to the hotel.

1135
01:03:38,217 --> 01:03:40,019
I'm glad she's feeling better.

1136
01:03:40,078 --> 01:03:41,687
It's sweet of you to worry about her.

1137
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:44,221
Anyway, we should get back to the hotel.

1138
01:03:44,248 --> 01:03:46,088
I want to start packing for our trip home.

1139
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:48,829
Are you sure it's okay to leave them alone right now?

1140
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:51,920
Yeah. I think that's the best thing we can do for them.

1141
01:03:52,077 --> 01:03:54,377
It sounded like they were arguing about something.

1142
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:57,133
And I heard Makoto even forfeited his match...

1143
01:03:58,006 --> 01:03:58,300
Huh?

1144
01:03:58,623 --> 01:04:00,738
What? Where did they go?

1145
01:04:04,055 --> 01:04:07,261
So, did you learn anything
new last night, great detective?

1146
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:11,201
I found a lot more info on
Sherilyn Tan's murder at Rishi's.

1147
01:04:16,155 --> 01:04:17,675
According to witnesses,

1148
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,086
she wasn't actually stabbed in the
shopping mall where she collapsed.

1149
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,526
Instead, it likely happened in Tower 3's elevator.

1150
01:04:24,923 --> 01:04:27,215
But why an elevator of all places?

1151
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,559
If things don't go as planned, there's no way out.

1152
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:34,755
She was stabbed with a kitchen knife,

1153
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,942
and after that, she walked all the way to the mall.

1154
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,646
Right after she collapsed...

1155
01:04:43,735 --> 01:04:47,120
her car parked in the underground lot exploded.

1156
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,320
Which caused the entire hotel to have a blackout.

1157
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:55,166
And therefore, all of the security camera
footage within the area was completely wiped out.

1158
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,270
What stuck out to me is that Leon was on the scene.

1159
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:02,286
Not only had he booked his own
room, but Sherilyn's room as well.

1160
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:04,344
However, when she was murdered,

1161
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,578
many witnesses claim they saw him on a different elevator.

1162
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,780
Because his alibi had been confirmed,

1163
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,505
he was removed from the investigation as a suspect.

1164
01:05:12,662 --> 01:05:13,447
Right.

1165
01:05:13,765 --> 01:05:17,460
By the way, do you know why Leon
had a suitcase with him at the scene?

1166
01:05:17,825 --> 01:05:20,418
Well, the police ended up going through it's content.

1167
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,338
But it was empty inside.

1168
01:05:22,513 --> 01:05:26,275
He was returning from picking up a
suitcase he dropped off to get repair.

1169
01:05:26,629 --> 01:05:30,610
There's a shop near the hotel. They
confirmed that he got it earlier that day.

1170
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,763
So he has a perfect alibi.

1171
01:05:33,156 --> 01:05:35,400
One more thing... this note.

1172
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:38,936
I still don't get why they left
something like this at the crime scene.

1173
01:05:39,075 --> 01:05:41,390
What's the point of dragging me into all this?

1174
01:05:41,463 --> 01:05:44,273
They even put the effort into coating it in fake blood.

1175
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,481
What's more...

1176
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,472
The perp is also trying to frame you for Rechel's death.

1177
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:54,593
The murder weapon is the same
kind used in Sherilyn's stabbing.

1178
01:05:55,596 --> 01:06:00,212
Rechel's body had to have been placed inside
that pedestal before I ever entered the safe room.

1179
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:05,383
But to enter the room, you need to get past all
the guards as well as the numerous security systems.

1180
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:10,166
Someone who can get past security without
even tripping one of the sensors, huh...

1181
01:06:10,577 --> 01:06:11,200
Hm.

1182
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:12,506
You know it's not me.

1183
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:13,254
Hmph.

1184
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,180
Then the most suspicious person is Leon Lowe.

1185
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:21,085
Since Leon is the manager of the safe room,
he has full knowledge of the security system.

1186
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,225
Furthermore, the belt was transported
to the stadium yesterday morning.

1187
01:06:25,558 --> 01:06:29,404
And Rechel was confirmed to be
alive until at least two nights ago.

1188
01:06:29,649 --> 01:06:34,687
In other words, the crime likely occurred
between that evening and when the belt was moved.

1189
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:36,894
But why did she have to die?

1190
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,786
What reason could he have for killing his own secretary?

1191
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:43,093
She must have learned about
something she wasn't supposed to know.

1192
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:46,898
Rechel was going to meet Pops,
she had something to tell him.

1193
01:06:47,414 --> 01:06:50,641
The only clue we have left is
that message written in blood.

1194
01:06:50,781 --> 01:06:54,082
"She," huh? That's too vague, who could it be?

1195
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:08,800
It's no good. I feel something
significant will happen soon,

1196
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:10,147
but I can't figure it out.

1197
01:07:10,496 --> 01:07:13,326
So the great detective is throwing in the towel then?

1198
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:15,507
I think it'd be a good idea to take a break.

1199
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:18,475
By the way, can you tell me
what I have in each of my fists...

1200
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,625
In your left hand you have coconut water.

1201
01:07:20,998 --> 01:07:21,902
You're right.

1202
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:23,710
But how did you know that?

1203
01:07:23,757 --> 01:07:25,273
Because you bought it earlier.

1204
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,882
So you were watching me.

1205
01:07:27,455 --> 01:07:28,670
Magic, huh...

1206
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:34,590
Someone who leads you to believe there's
something inside a clenched fist... that's a magician.

1207
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:39,430
And someone who correctly guesses what's
actually inside of that fist, a detective.

1208
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,760
Now, I get it!

1209
01:07:42,115 --> 01:07:46,915
By the way, about Lady Sonoko. Is she in
some kind of fight with that karate guy?

1210
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:48,170
Apparently.

1211
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,622
A big fight followed by an accident like that abroad?

1212
01:07:51,773 --> 01:07:54,403
It's no surprise their emotions would be a mess.

1213
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,324
That's what it was about.

1214
01:07:56,348 --> 01:07:56,750
Huh?

1215
01:07:57,047 --> 01:08:01,066
They knew if they injured Sonoko,
they could manipulate Kyogoku's heart.

1216
01:08:01,399 --> 01:08:05,855
After all, he was the biggest threat to
Jamaluddin taking first place in the tournament.

1217
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:10,330
That makes sense. The accident
was also one of Leon's set ups.

1218
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,379
Kyogoku withdrew from the tournament, just like he hoped.

1219
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,800
Now the championship belt will go to Jamaluddin for sure.

1220
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:20,252
Which means, it'll end up in
the hands of his employer, Leon.

1221
01:08:20,537 --> 01:08:22,897
Right along with the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

1222
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,996
But why is Leon so fixated on
the sapphire in the first place?

1223
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,618
I got ahold of a clue that might help us answer that.

1224
01:08:29,643 --> 01:08:30,016
Huh?

1225
01:08:30,155 --> 01:08:32,552
This is the guy that Leon met with around dawn.

1226
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,900
You think you can figure out his identity?

1227
01:08:36,044 --> 01:08:37,961
It's not impossible, but...

1228
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,345
You're something else. Last we heard you
called the Doc saying you're headed to Hokkaido.

1229
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,016
What are you doing?

1230
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:47,565
Sorry, Ai. All sorts of things happened.

1231
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,734
Hey, can you guys keep it down for a bit!

1232
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,960
Okay...

1233
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,945
Well knowing you, I'm sure you're
involved in some weird incident, aren't you?

1234
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:56,735
Actually, that's it exactly.

1235
01:08:57,382 --> 01:09:00,422
Anyways, I just sent you a picture that Kid took.

1236
01:09:00,866 --> 01:09:03,345
Wait, Kid? You did just say "Kid" right?

1237
01:09:03,382 --> 01:09:05,802
Really? Kid the Phantom Thief showed up?

1238
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:07,881
You're on the phone with Conan, aren't you?

1239
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:10,390
Is he really calling from Hokkaido right now?

1240
01:09:10,471 --> 01:09:12,766
Kid's there, right? What is he stealing this time?

1241
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,809
Maybe a wooden bear statue?

1242
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:16,184
Ramen from Sapporo?

1243
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:18,082
He'd never steal that stuff.

1244
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:19,249
Hey Ai!

1245
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,636
Can I talk on the phone, too?

1246
01:09:20,668 --> 01:09:21,200
Yeah, me, too!

1247
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:21,725
Woah!

1248
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,541
Ah!

1249
01:09:23,842 --> 01:09:26,743
Sorry, the kids are over right
now and they're playing around.

1250
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:29,507
Gotcha. I'll tell you all about it when I get back.

1251
01:09:29,695 --> 01:09:32,995
For now, try and figure out the
identity of the guy in the picture.

1252
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,992
Yeah, yeah. I'll get on it.

1253
01:09:35,246 --> 01:09:37,884
And you're really sure you're
going to make it okay on your own?

1254
01:09:38,171 --> 01:09:39,645
Yeah, somehow.

1255
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:43,900
I'm sure this is going to fall on
deaf ears, but don't go out of your way.

1256
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:44,794
Thanks a lot.

1257
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:47,377
She'll take care of it.

1258
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,006
So, what will we do from here, great detective?

1259
01:09:50,805 --> 01:09:52,119
We'll wait and observe.

1260
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:55,463
How will Mr. Leon act once he
gets the Fist of Blue Sapphire?

1261
01:09:55,952 --> 01:09:58,004
But first it's time to talk to Pops.

1262
01:09:58,919 --> 01:10:00,332
Hey! Wait up!

1263
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:12,822
The winner of the Zhonhan Cup Karate is, Jamaluddin!

1264
01:10:13,516 --> 01:10:14,054
Hmph.

1265
01:10:17,206 --> 01:10:17,970
Hmph.

1266
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:21,451
So I'd like to hear what your
thoughts are on my city plan.

1267
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,196
I'm sorry but we cannot accept your proposal.

1268
01:10:27,509 --> 01:10:30,376
Why? You lose nothing with this plan.

1269
01:10:30,624 --> 01:10:32,572
It could only benefit the country.

1270
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:34,597
It's too hasty.

1271
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:39,649
If you proceed with this much development,
citizens may end up being forced out of their homes.

1272
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:43,156
We can always relocate them. My plan is perfect!

1273
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:46,394
Hm... You are still too young.

1274
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,914
Try coming back after you've learned some more.

1275
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:57,100
Old fools.

1276
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,556
Your era is coming to an end, now.

1277
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,701
And I will build a new city.

1278
01:11:17,576 --> 01:11:18,782
Hands in the air!

1279
01:11:18,913 --> 01:11:19,607
Huh?!

1280
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:21,369
Yeah, okay!

1281
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:26,711
It seems I often end up connected to you.

1282
01:11:27,243 --> 01:11:31,692
If this plan turns out to be a success,
then we will officially become partners.

1283
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,279
I'm counting on you, man.

1284
01:11:33,413 --> 01:11:35,595
I've always been able to depend on you.

1285
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:40,150
Our first meeting was when the cops were
about to take me away for suspected theft.

1286
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:42,774
You came in and saved the day before they could cuff me.

1287
01:11:42,915 --> 01:11:45,340
And you've done it countless times since.

1288
01:11:46,043 --> 01:11:49,585
It's because I knew you were the famous Reijiro Nakatomi.

1289
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:53,908
The son of Juzo Nakatomi, Japan's naval transport king.

1290
01:11:54,425 --> 01:11:57,025
Don't ever speak my father's name in my presence.

1291
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,063
Huh. My apologies.

1292
01:11:59,309 --> 01:12:02,589
In any case, everything changes tonight.

1293
01:12:03,256 --> 01:12:06,339
How would you feel about seeing that moment up close?

1294
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,175
Hmph. Now, come and join me.

1295
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:14,928
Let us bare witnesses to a page that
will be engraved into Singapore's history.

1296
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:19,450
Huh?

1297
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,268
Sorry about this, Pops!

1298
01:12:21,299 --> 01:12:23,619
Hey! What the hell's going on?!

1299
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:26,996
No, stop it!

1300
01:12:27,608 --> 01:12:28,577
That's it!

1301
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:31,833
Nakatomi?

1302
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,973
Nakatomi... You mean Nakatomi Shipping?

1303
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,393
Probably.

1304
01:12:36,536 --> 01:12:38,916
Sorry Pops, I gotta borrow this!

1305
01:12:39,735 --> 01:12:40,672
Huh..?

1306
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,078
Did that brat call me "Pops" just now?

1307
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,448
That was weird...

1308
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,355
Is there a reason you're suddenly leaving Japan?

1309
01:12:49,585 --> 01:12:51,587
Yeh, ever heard of a vacation?

1310
01:12:51,775 --> 01:12:54,454
You went to Singapore five years ago as well, right?

1311
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,957
Yeah, haven't been since. What of it?

1312
01:12:57,562 --> 01:12:58,800
President Nakatomi...

1313
01:12:58,935 --> 01:13:00,858
It's the guy from Merlion Square.

1314
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:03,663
The one that got taken down by that karate guy.

1315
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:05,403
Huh?

1316
01:13:06,116 --> 01:13:07,673
Ai! How's it going?

1317
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:09,899
Did you figure out who that guy was?

1318
01:13:10,197 --> 01:13:11,630
Yes, barely.

1319
01:13:12,123 --> 01:13:15,684
His name is Eugene Lim. And it turns out, he's a pirate.

1320
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:16,755
Really?

1321
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:20,297
Reports say he's been recently
sighted off the shores of Singapore.

1322
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:22,858
Thanks, you're the best! I knew I can count on you.

1323
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:24,645
Your flattering me means...

1324
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,522
you're going to ask me to check
up on something else, aren't you?

1325
01:13:27,714 --> 01:13:29,213
Uh... yeah.

1326
01:13:29,265 --> 01:13:29,864
Hmph.

1327
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:32,850
Have you ever heard of the name Reijiro Nakatomi?

1328
01:13:33,031 --> 01:13:34,503
From Nakatomi Shipping.

1329
01:13:34,614 --> 01:13:35,324
I have.

1330
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:39,717
I want to know the location of
the ships owned by the company.

1331
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,410
Not all of them, just the ones near Singapore.

1332
01:13:46,336 --> 01:13:49,911
There are currently two freight ships
and a single tanker near Singapore.

1333
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:54,430
What gets my attention though, is that the
tanker has strayed from it's planned route.

1334
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:57,418
Yeah, that's the one. Send me data on the tanker!

1335
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,627
Will do. I'll touch base later.

1336
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:00,635
Thanks.

1337
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:03,253
So, what's the deal with this tanker?

1338
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:05,984
That word "she" Rechel wrote before she died.

1339
01:14:06,498 --> 01:14:09,495
"She" is sometimes used to refer to ships as well.

1340
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:18,475
What you told me over the phone... is it true?

1341
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:22,469
Everything that's been happening here
was all planned out by Mr. Lowe himself?

1342
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:25,464
Could you explain it to me? I'm trying to understand.

1343
01:14:25,805 --> 01:14:30,802
It all started when the Fist of Blue
Sapphire, was found by Zhonhan Chen.

1344
01:14:31,326 --> 01:14:34,365
He embedded it into the championship
belt for the karate tournament

1345
01:14:34,576 --> 01:14:36,475
and announced he'd give the belt to the winner.

1346
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,195
Mr. Leon had Mr. Jamaluddin enter the tournament,

1347
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,390
so he could get the jewel for himself.

1348
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,552
However, there was an unexpected interference.

1349
01:14:44,657 --> 01:14:49,117
400 matches undefeated... Makoto
Kyogoku entered the tournament.

1350
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:53,431
And the one who sponsored him
was the murder victim, Sherilyn Tan.

1351
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:57,943
That makes sense as a motive,
but Mr. Lowe still has an alibi.

1352
01:14:58,088 --> 01:15:01,567
We know that when she was stabbed,
he was riding a different elevator.

1353
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,560
It happened like this.

1354
01:15:03,759 --> 01:15:06,825
After meeting up with Leon and conversing by the poolside,

1355
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:09,446
she boarded an elevator to return to her room.

1356
01:15:10,823 --> 01:15:15,491
However, the room that she was staying
in was on the 16th floor of Tower 3.

1357
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:21,181
Due to how the hotel's architecture, she was
forced to change elevators on the 34th floor.

1358
01:15:21,645 --> 01:15:23,876
But while heading to the next elevator...

1359
01:15:23,901 --> 01:15:26,600
someone jumped her and dragged
her into a different room...

1360
01:15:27,049 --> 01:15:28,934
The secretary, Rechel.

1361
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:33,074
Rechel was an accomplice? No way.

1362
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:38,425
The other hotel room Leon reserved in order to
enter the poolside restaurant reserved for guests,

1363
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,709
Was located there on the 34th floor.

1364
01:15:42,047 --> 01:15:47,347
Leon had it all planned out, and he came
down to stab Sherilyn to death, in that room.

1365
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,625
And put her corpse in the suitcase.

1366
01:15:50,872 --> 01:15:54,523
Later that day, Rechel and
Leon took separate elevators down.

1367
01:15:54,793 --> 01:15:58,676
If I had to guess, they used some
kind of magic knife for this trick.

1368
01:15:58,736 --> 01:16:01,535
However, the blood was that of Sherilyn herself.

1369
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,867
Pretending to be stabbed, Rechel collapsed.

1370
01:16:09,915 --> 01:16:10,589
Hey...

1371
01:16:11,027 --> 01:16:12,202
Moments after...

1372
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:17,908
Everything was switched around and out of sight,

1373
01:16:18,063 --> 01:16:20,513
during the black out caused by the explosion.

1374
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:36,870
That's impossible...

1375
01:16:37,058 --> 01:16:40,725
Rechel was horrified, after
finding out about Leon's true plans.

1376
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:45,293
She asked Detective Mori to meet with her, and
was planning on telling him everything she knew.

1377
01:16:45,456 --> 01:16:47,377
But Leon caught wind of it.

1378
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:51,651
And the Rechel at the safe room that
spoke with the guards, was Kid in disguise.

1379
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:55,362
Mr. Leon framed him for
everything. To move his plans forward.

1380
01:16:56,171 --> 01:16:58,396
The real Rechel had already been murdered

1381
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:00,683
and shoved inside that pedestal.

1382
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,300
He knew Kid would come by disguised as Rechel.

1383
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:08,447
so he made sure to have an alibi
and frame the entire incident on Kid.

1384
01:17:08,782 --> 01:17:10,758
But how did he know Kid would do that?

1385
01:17:10,848 --> 01:17:14,151
Mr. Rishi, who would be the safest to disguise as?

1386
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:16,516
Uh, well. Let's see.

1387
01:17:16,586 --> 01:17:20,903
No matter how good a disguise is, it's
useless if you bump into the real person.

1388
01:17:21,134 --> 01:17:24,590
You'd want it to be someone you know
the whereabouts of at a certain time.

1389
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:28,952
I see! Rechel made plans to meet
up with Mr. Mori at 3PM that day.

1390
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:29,909
And that's why...

1391
01:17:29,933 --> 01:17:30,550
Exactly.

1392
01:17:30,849 --> 01:17:34,379
Kid would disguise himself as
someone who'd never go to the safe room.

1393
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:38,320
And since Mr. Leon predicted his
moves, Kid completely fell for it.

1394
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:39,018
Tsk.

1395
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:44,095
Tell me... What is Mr. Lowe
trying to accomplish with this?

1396
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,455
It's all for a stupid little project of his.

1397
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:50,746
Leon has been in contact with Eugene
Lim, the leader of the pirate group.

1398
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:55,242
The word Rechel left behind in the
pedestal at her murder scene was "she".

1399
01:17:55,861 --> 01:18:01,407
Rechel also secretly entrusted a medal made by
Nakatomi Shipping to Detective Mori the night before.

1400
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:03,568
Everything has to do with ships.

1401
01:18:03,672 --> 01:18:05,352
How can you be sure they're related?

1402
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,314
Mr. Rishi.

1403
01:18:06,338 --> 01:18:06,754
Huh?

1404
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,528
This is data that Mr. Detective
here, had sent to him from Tokyo.

1405
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:14,349
Full analysis of the Nakatomi
Shipping vessel routes around Singapore.

1406
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:18,070
One tanker is definitely straying from it's intended path.

1407
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,356
If it continues, its destination will be Marina Bay.

1408
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:26,933
Mr. Leon wants to use Eugene's pirate
crew, to launch an entire tanker into the city!

1409
01:18:31,812 --> 01:18:35,775
What would make Mr. Lowe feel the need to
do something like that in the first place?!

1410
01:18:35,863 --> 01:18:36,863
I don't get it!

1411
01:18:37,086 --> 01:18:40,503
I'm not sure what Mr. Leon would
have to say for himself about this...

1412
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:43,375
But if you were to destroy this city and rebuild it...

1413
01:18:43,531 --> 01:18:46,650
there would certainly be a
great deal of money changing hands.

1414
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:50,577
I think Leon was so persistent
about the Fist of Blue Sapphire,

1415
01:18:50,718 --> 01:18:54,090
because he needed to exchange
it for control of the pirates.

1416
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,790
Y-Yeah, but still...

1417
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:59,461
Pirates always evade the police,
and dispersed all over the place.

1418
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,225
How did he contact them?

1419
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:02,876
He used the Merlion.

1420
01:19:03,241 --> 01:19:06,411
Remember the incident when the Merlion spewed red water?

1421
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:10,200
It was broadcasted all over the
world, I'm sure the pirates noticed.

1422
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:12,800
That must have signaled the plan was moving forward.

1423
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,723
But there's something else, more important...

1424
01:19:14,873 --> 01:19:17,193
That's right. If we don't hurry, we'll be too late.

1425
01:19:17,622 --> 01:19:20,000
I don't have the discretion to act on my own...

1426
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:23,050
We need more evidence if we're
going to mobilize the police.

1427
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,550
We won't make it if we wait!

1428
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,075
Isn't there any other option?

1429
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,575
Maybe if we confer with Mr. Zhonhan Chen!

1430
01:19:28,707 --> 01:19:31,175
He'd have some influence on the military and police!

1431
01:19:31,272 --> 01:19:33,061
I'm sure he'll be willing to lend a hand!

1432
01:19:33,466 --> 01:19:35,189
One more thing, Mr. Rishi!

1433
01:19:35,522 --> 01:19:36,580
Yeah! What is it?

1434
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:39,742
If we can't stop it, and the tanker plunges into the city,

1435
01:19:39,804 --> 01:19:42,308
where do you think Mr. Leon is likely to be?

1436
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:43,873
Let's me think.

1437
01:19:44,121 --> 01:19:48,489
He's an incredibly cautious individual, so I'm
certain that he'd be watching from a distance.

1438
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,810
In fact, it's possible he's
already left the country by now.

1439
01:19:52,402 --> 01:19:53,860
Well, I'd better get going!

1440
01:19:54,724 --> 01:19:56,823
All right. Thanks Mr. Rishi.

1441
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:04,402
Hmm...

1442
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,469
Come on, Dad. Did you get lost somewhere again?

1443
01:20:07,685 --> 01:20:09,352
The show is going to start soon!

1444
01:20:09,774 --> 01:20:12,474
And of course, Shinichi's run off to who knows where...

1445
01:20:14,839 --> 01:20:18,789
Man, this is such a pain. Why'd I
have to get dragged into all of this?

1446
01:20:19,378 --> 01:20:23,811
I've been thinking about it. Was it really
Leon who left my card in Sherilyn's murder scene?

1447
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:25,059
No.

1448
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:25,878
Hm.

1449
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:28,775
The advanced notice posted on the elevator was found

1450
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,994
quite a while after the crime
scene investigation was started.

1451
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:33,822
Why do you think that is?

1452
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:34,759
Huh.

1453
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:37,715
We got the updated path of the tanker.

1454
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:41,648
What?!

1455
01:20:42,056 --> 01:20:44,564
The ship is going to crash into the hotel!

1456
01:21:05,963 --> 01:21:08,511
Ran! Pick up the phone, please!

1457
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:41,148
Oh! Hey, Ran! Are you having fun?

1458
01:22:41,178 --> 01:22:42,935
Dad, where are you right now?!

1459
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:47,369
Huh? I don't know what's going
on, but I can see a huge boat!

1460
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,730
Wait hold on! Listen, Dad!

1461
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,695
Are you at the top of the hotel?

1462
01:22:51,775 --> 01:22:53,679
Hello? Dad, are you there?!

1463
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,353
Can we make it?

1464
01:23:00,429 --> 01:23:01,782
Yeah, think so.

1465
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:03,586
Sonoko! Open the door!

1466
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:05,780
What?

1467
01:23:05,805 --> 01:23:09,872
Everyone's in a panic outside. I think
it might be best if we left the hotel.

1468
01:23:09,981 --> 01:23:10,634
Huh?

1469
01:23:13,348 --> 01:23:14,183
Hello?

1470
01:23:15,273 --> 01:23:16,790
Yes, I understand.

1471
01:23:17,273 --> 01:23:18,204
Who was that?

1472
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:19,984
Someone from the police.

1473
01:23:20,183 --> 01:23:24,854
They told me to stay put, because if I leave
without a plan, people might come after me again.

1474
01:23:25,228 --> 01:23:27,007
They're sending someone to guard me.

1475
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,631
O-Okay, but...

1476
01:23:30,815 --> 01:23:33,062
It's fine. I'm gonna do what they said.

1477
01:23:35,317 --> 01:23:36,642
Understood...

1478
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:49,204
Oh no, we can't get close to the hotel in this panic.

1479
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:51,941
Damn. There's no choice, it's all or nothing!

1480
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,651
Wow! It's Kid!

1481
01:23:58,118 --> 01:24:00,997
It's Kid! I've got eyes on him, he's flying above the bay!

1482
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,549
I've got this place all to myself!

1483
01:24:06,932 --> 01:24:09,392
Huh?! Jeez, what's with you?

1484
01:24:10,491 --> 01:24:11,550
Huh? Erk!

1485
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,701
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

1486
01:24:21,842 --> 01:24:25,231
Goodness, me... I don't understand this man at all.

1487
01:24:27,906 --> 01:24:30,049
It's no use, I can't get through!

1488
01:24:33,795 --> 01:24:34,723
Woah!

1489
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:37,104
Hey!

1490
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:47,366
Jeez, Dad! Where did you wander off to this time?

1491
01:24:57,408 --> 01:25:01,400
Feast your eyes. This city is about to be born anew.

1492
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,040
By my hands!

1493
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:03,668
Hm?

1494
01:25:06,077 --> 01:25:07,525
What are you doing here?

1495
01:25:08,422 --> 01:25:08,798
Hm.

1496
01:25:12,718 --> 01:25:13,298
Ugh!

1497
01:25:16,173 --> 01:25:16,810
Urk..!

1498
01:25:17,508 --> 01:25:18,754
Wait, don't shoot!

1499
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:24,928
What a surprise. I didn't think
you had it in you to get this far.

1500
01:25:25,706 --> 01:25:27,644
Really. I didn't see this coming.

1501
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:30,608
Rishi.

1502
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:33,603
Well, now, I'll be a man and admit to it all.

1503
01:25:33,864 --> 01:25:36,375
Everything that's happened is part of my plan.

1504
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:38,291
I think we should have a chat.

1505
01:25:38,646 --> 01:25:40,730
Now put that terrible thing away.

1506
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,298
Sorry Mr. Lowe, I think you're
misunderstanding the situation.

1507
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,858
Freeze!

1508
01:25:50,526 --> 01:25:52,783
There's no one here. We'll stop the ship now.

1509
01:26:13,321 --> 01:26:15,590
It looks like they managed to stop the tanker!

1510
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,750
Let's go, the police will handle the rest!

1511
01:26:17,774 --> 01:26:18,260
Yeah!

1512
01:26:18,581 --> 01:26:20,981
No, the tanker. What's happening?!

1513
01:26:21,404 --> 01:26:24,858
I-I'll keep my mouth shut, I swear! Don't shoot me please!

1514
01:26:26,643 --> 01:26:30,353
Help! Help me! No! No, don't kill me!

1515
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:33,548
Rishi... I never thought you'd shoot.

1516
01:26:34,233 --> 01:26:35,104
Jamaluddin!

1517
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,974
W-Why are you..?! Jamaluddin, what are you thinking?

1518
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:43,796
The only reason I worked for
you was so I could fight Kyogoku.

1519
01:26:44,025 --> 01:26:46,425
That won't happen so I no longer have a reason.

1520
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,450
Say, what?!

1521
01:26:47,475 --> 01:26:48,131
Mr. Lowe.

1522
01:26:48,155 --> 01:26:48,468
Huh?

1523
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:52,306
With all due respect, it seems as though
you've begun losing your touch a bit?

1524
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,118
The one controlling the world was never you.

1525
01:26:58,108 --> 01:26:59,208
It was me.

1526
01:26:59,763 --> 01:27:02,268
Who would have thought... that you...

1527
01:27:03,292 --> 01:27:05,802
Just hold on, listen to me! Here.

1528
01:27:06,027 --> 01:27:07,074
I'll give this to you.

1529
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,567
The jewel is inside of it.

1530
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,578
It's a good deal for you, Rishi!

1531
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,265
Gah!

1532
01:27:20,742 --> 01:27:21,925
Gah! Ugh!

1533
01:27:24,184 --> 01:27:25,547
Kid the Phantom Thief?!

1534
01:27:25,985 --> 01:27:28,914
Wh-Why in the world is Arthur here?

1535
01:27:30,327 --> 01:27:33,542
Let's see, I have to change elevators
here to get to the roof, right?

1536
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,034
34th floor.

1537
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,201
Hey, you!

1538
01:27:36,237 --> 01:27:37,161
Hold it.

1539
01:27:47,784 --> 01:27:52,345
Argh! Wait a sec... Are they
heading towards Marina Bay Sands?!

1540
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:53,990
Ugh!

1541
01:27:56,118 --> 01:27:57,357
What are you doing?

1542
01:27:57,488 --> 01:28:00,759
I was just about to capture the
two masterminds behind all this!

1543
01:28:00,927 --> 01:28:04,110
You can drop the terrible acting Rishi Ramanathan.

1544
01:28:04,135 --> 01:28:04,443
Huh?

1545
01:28:04,468 --> 01:28:06,804
It's obvious you're the one behind all of it.

1546
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,824
My suspicion started when Kid's warning note
was posted at the scene of Sherilyn's murder.

1547
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,700
The police didn't notice the note at all for a while.

1548
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:18,213
But then after you showed up, they
found it right away, didn't they?

1549
01:28:18,309 --> 01:28:21,096
And not long ago, when I asked you where Leon would be,

1550
01:28:21,152 --> 01:28:24,450
that was when the doubt I had
against you became definitive.

1551
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:25,454
What are you...

1552
01:28:25,578 --> 01:28:28,307
Someone with an ego as inflated as Leon's

1553
01:28:28,518 --> 01:28:31,872
would never flee overseas as his project was unfolding.

1554
01:28:32,276 --> 01:28:36,160
He'd sure to be watching it play out
from the location with the best view.

1555
01:28:36,747 --> 01:28:39,561
You've known him too long to assume anything else.

1556
01:28:39,632 --> 01:28:43,650
Heh. So you were testing me with
that question were you? Clever.

1557
01:28:43,675 --> 01:28:45,311
It all five years ago,

1558
01:28:45,504 --> 01:28:48,785
you began planning everything
after your father's accident.

1559
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:53,353
An oceanographer's murder. The suspect
denied charges, but later confessed.

1560
01:28:53,864 --> 01:28:54,877
If I recall...

1561
01:28:56,283 --> 01:29:00,169
it was five years ago when you came
to Singapore. Right, Mr. Nakatomi?

1562
01:29:00,907 --> 01:29:02,616
Well, yeah. But I uh...

1563
01:29:02,678 --> 01:29:07,772
Leon captured the perpetrator, with Sherilyn
acting as the defense counsel, he pled guilty.

1564
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:10,395
I don't see that as a coincidence.

1565
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,863
What are you saying?

1566
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:16,884
It was all part of an elaborate set up, so they
could obtain a tanker that belonged to Nakatomi Shipping.

1567
01:29:17,395 --> 01:29:19,284
Everything was part of the plan.

1568
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:22,613
And there was another trap that was laid out for you.

1569
01:29:23,586 --> 01:29:25,846
And you were able to see right through it.

1570
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,343
At first, I'd thought it was all an accident too.

1571
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:33,400
However, going through myDad's
belongings, I learned something.

1572
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:36,100
While investigating ruins on the ocean floor,

1573
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:37,850
Dad discovered a sunken ship.

1574
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:42,722
Which had a high chance of containing the Fist
of Blue Sapphire, proof of the king of pirates.

1575
01:29:43,178 --> 01:29:45,838
That's why you had to murder my Dad first, right?

1576
01:29:45,975 --> 01:29:48,523
So he couldn't salvage the jewel before you!

1577
01:29:50,026 --> 01:29:52,837
Help! Someone pushed me off the deck!

1578
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:56,553
Help is on the way!

1579
01:29:56,577 --> 01:29:58,017
Hurry! Save him!

1580
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:02,982
You knew that my Dad had a strong sense of
justice, and figured he'd jump in to help.

1581
01:30:09,746 --> 01:30:10,326
Huh?

1582
01:30:14,082 --> 01:30:16,656
What's he talking about, Leon?! How could you!

1583
01:30:16,949 --> 01:30:17,525
Get off!

1584
01:30:17,549 --> 01:30:18,093
Ugh!

1585
01:30:18,825 --> 01:30:19,610
Ugh!

1586
01:30:20,095 --> 01:30:23,760
Sorry, Rishi. But it seems you have a misunderstanding.

1587
01:30:24,204 --> 01:30:26,373
The man who killed your father was put in jail...

1588
01:30:26,398 --> 01:30:28,375
I had doubts surrounding my Dad's death.

1589
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,485
Which is why I chose to become your
student, and then a reserve police officer.

1590
01:30:32,755 --> 01:30:35,039
Afterwards, I did my own research on it.

1591
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:38,162
The first person I approached was Sherilyn Tan.

1592
01:30:38,406 --> 01:30:41,603
When I suggested that we blackmail
Leon about the whole ordeal,

1593
01:30:41,746 --> 01:30:44,033
she was very quick to tell me everything.

1594
01:30:44,153 --> 01:30:46,772
And next was Rechel... Yes.

1595
01:30:46,797 --> 01:30:51,638
With her on my side, I had every last bit of
information I could ever need about you guys!

1596
01:30:51,997 --> 01:30:55,198
If that's so, why'd you post a warning note from Kid?

1597
01:30:55,671 --> 01:30:57,521
Yeah, why don't you tell us?

1598
01:30:57,999 --> 01:30:59,908
The Fist of Blue Sapphire

1599
01:30:59,965 --> 01:31:02,315
and a murder case having nothing to do with them.

1600
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:06,375
If I enticed him with those, I was
certain the Phantom Thief would show.

1601
01:31:06,423 --> 01:31:09,665
And when he did, I knew he'd get in the way of your plan.

1602
01:31:10,433 --> 01:31:13,877
I wasn't expecting that high
school detective to show up as well,

1603
01:31:13,995 --> 01:31:16,720
but he did quite a good job of playing his role.

1604
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:18,650
Also, Mr. Nakatomi,

1605
01:31:18,675 --> 01:31:21,914
I know Leon saved you back when
you were suspected of theft and all.

1606
01:31:22,033 --> 01:31:24,576
But do you honestly think that was a coincidence?

1607
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:27,197
Come on. Think about it really hard.

1608
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:30,551
Isn't it possible that everything
from that moment on was...

1609
01:31:31,647 --> 01:31:32,974
You bastard!

1610
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:37,153
Hmph. You did your research, Rishi. I'm impressed.

1611
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:38,734
Huh?

1612
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:44,393
Huh? The hell am I? Let's see...

1613
01:31:45,472 --> 01:31:46,438
There you are!

1614
01:31:46,462 --> 01:31:46,765
Huh?

1615
01:31:47,052 --> 01:31:48,130
Oh, hey!

1616
01:31:48,189 --> 01:31:49,713
Woah!

1617
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:51,040
Dad!

1618
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:52,317
Ran?

1619
01:31:53,027 --> 01:31:53,680
What the?

1620
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,468
Huh? Woah!

1621
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,194
Dad...

1622
01:32:00,219 --> 01:32:00,687
Huh?

1623
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:04,500
Ra.

1624
01:32:06,076 --> 01:32:09,482
Fall back! We need to regroup! Tell the chopper too!

1625
01:32:13,154 --> 01:32:15,029
What's the deal with you guys?

1626
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:17,435
Now then, Rishi.

1627
01:32:17,641 --> 01:32:20,271
Unfortunately for you, the tide has turned.

1628
01:32:20,906 --> 01:32:23,750
Hey Eugene, the plan seems to have failed but,

1629
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:28,097
you can have the jewel. Just
clean up and we'll call it even.

1630
01:32:28,808 --> 01:32:29,311
Hm.

1631
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,897
What? What the hell are you doing?

1632
01:32:35,213 --> 01:32:36,349
Don't move.

1633
01:32:37,157 --> 01:32:38,252
Woah!

1634
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,029
Someone help me! Aah!

1635
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:43,800
Now that I have the jewel in my
possession I have no more need for you.

1636
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,082
How dare you...!

1637
01:32:45,563 --> 01:32:48,345
I have no patience for any more of your nonsense.

1638
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,983
Not to mention, I've been known to break promises.

1639
01:32:51,094 --> 01:32:54,445
It's just that I had another much more lucrative offer.

1640
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,790
Then does that mean you guys are after...

1641
01:32:57,846 --> 01:32:58,822
Huh?

1642
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,350
You're a perceptive little boy aren't you.

1643
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,620
That's right.

1644
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:05,852
The young daughter of the Suzuki
Group is staying in this hotel.

1645
01:33:06,135 --> 01:33:08,645
And the ransom for her would be unimaginable.

1646
01:33:08,734 --> 01:33:11,936
The whole city's in a panic,
she would have evacuated already.

1647
01:33:11,966 --> 01:33:14,214
No, I'm pretty sure she's still in her suite.

1648
01:33:14,281 --> 01:33:17,621
We already called and told her
to stay in her room at all costs.

1649
01:33:18,869 --> 01:33:19,831
Huh?!

1650
01:33:21,182 --> 01:33:22,735
H-Hold on, Makoto!

1651
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,629
Apologies!

1652
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:24,547
Uh...

1653
01:33:24,571 --> 01:33:26,770
All of the elevators in the hotel have stopped working.

1654
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:27,502
Huh.

1655
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:28,745
We should get out of here.

1656
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,059
There! After them!

1657
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:33,890
Ah!

1658
01:33:33,915 --> 01:33:35,896
Stop shooting! You might hit her!

1659
01:33:36,181 --> 01:33:39,341
M-Makoto, do you know what's going on here?

1660
01:33:39,366 --> 01:33:39,951
Huh.

1661
01:33:45,685 --> 01:33:50,396
Look around. In the end, everything
is turning out just how I imagined it.

1662
01:33:50,645 --> 01:33:52,873
This city will burn and be reborn!

1663
01:33:59,559 --> 01:34:00,484
Ugh!

1664
01:34:00,938 --> 01:34:03,534
Shut up! It's not like you'll be around to see it!

1665
01:34:05,266 --> 01:34:05,540
Hm?

1666
01:34:05,564 --> 01:34:05,781
Heh.

1667
01:34:05,944 --> 01:34:07,474
Huh? Woah!

1668
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:10,431
What the... I can't see anything!

1669
01:34:10,641 --> 01:34:11,477
Woah!

1670
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,993
Hah!

1671
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:18,701
Yaah!

1672
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:23,942
Hmm!

1673
01:34:24,254 --> 01:34:24,668
Ah!

1674
01:34:24,788 --> 01:34:25,958
Woah!

1675
01:34:27,974 --> 01:34:29,228
Ugh, damn it!

1676
01:34:31,586 --> 01:34:32,264
Hmph.

1677
01:34:33,686 --> 01:34:35,282
Take this!

1678
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:36,790
Ah! Ugh!

1679
01:34:39,324 --> 01:34:40,788
What are we gonna do?!

1680
01:34:45,903 --> 01:34:46,612
Ugh.

1681
01:34:47,418 --> 01:34:50,418
What's happening, what's
happening?! What do they want with us?!

1682
01:34:56,094 --> 01:34:58,672
This doesn't make sense! What's going on?!

1683
01:35:03,839 --> 01:35:05,928
What in the world is going on?

1684
01:35:05,974 --> 01:35:08,731
I'm not sure. Most of the pirates are at the hotel.

1685
01:35:08,915 --> 01:35:11,208
I wonder what's happening inside?

1686
01:35:11,232 --> 01:35:13,887
It's dangerous here, please get to safety.

1687
01:35:16,094 --> 01:35:16,992
Huh?

1688
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,020
Woah!

1689
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,402
Woah!

1690
01:35:29,064 --> 01:35:29,683
Ugh!

1691
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:34,498
Woah, ah!

1692
01:35:34,596 --> 01:35:36,458
Noo!

1693
01:35:40,884 --> 01:35:41,593
Hah!

1694
01:35:43,206 --> 01:35:44,187
Are you okay?

1695
01:35:44,353 --> 01:35:45,683
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

1696
01:35:46,064 --> 01:35:49,092
At this rate, they really will destroy the whole city!

1697
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:52,172
We've gotta do something! Huh?

1698
01:35:54,805 --> 01:35:57,150
If we use that, it'll work!

1699
01:35:57,175 --> 01:35:58,298
Kid, let's go!

1700
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:02,563
Are you for real right now?!

1701
01:36:02,587 --> 01:36:03,519
You bet!

1702
01:36:03,645 --> 01:36:04,296
Huh?

1703
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,212
It's that guy again!

1704
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:09,643
Shoot him down!

1705
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:12,972
He's too hard to hit!

1706
01:36:12,997 --> 01:36:14,286
Pesky little bird!

1707
01:36:16,755 --> 01:36:20,696
Hey, we gotta do something about those
pirates before we go through with our plan!

1708
01:36:21,006 --> 01:36:23,087
And I've only got one shot left!

1709
01:36:23,186 --> 01:36:24,843
We have something else we can use!

1710
01:36:24,868 --> 01:36:25,255
Huh?

1711
01:36:29,078 --> 01:36:31,350
A trump card that'll turn the tables for us.

1712
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:32,875
Ah, now you're talking!

1713
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:34,820
We're going in!

1714
01:36:41,325 --> 01:36:41,958
Hah!

1715
01:36:46,831 --> 01:36:47,545
Woah!

1716
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:48,223
Gah!

1717
01:36:48,598 --> 01:36:49,371
Gah!

1718
01:36:50,552 --> 01:36:51,437
Ah!

1719
01:36:55,818 --> 01:36:56,694
Makoto?

1720
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:00,946
Stand back!

1721
01:37:03,206 --> 01:37:04,179
Stay back!

1722
01:37:06,067 --> 01:37:07,548
This fight is...

1723
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:11,228
between us!

1724
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:12,500
I got it!

1725
01:37:12,524 --> 01:37:13,064
Huh?

1726
01:37:13,273 --> 01:37:14,947
Take me down, I have an idea!

1727
01:37:14,972 --> 01:37:17,434
Hmph. I already know!

1728
01:37:17,459 --> 01:37:18,426
Woah!

1729
01:37:20,475 --> 01:37:21,475
Hmph!

1730
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:23,576
Stay back, I've got this.

1731
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,120
Ran!

1732
01:37:29,487 --> 01:37:30,161
Huh?!

1733
01:37:30,656 --> 01:37:33,219
Let's go!

1734
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,017
Huh?!

1735
01:37:41,009 --> 01:37:43,469
Hiiiiiyah!

1736
01:37:46,909 --> 01:37:49,459
Ah, what the heck is going on now?

1737
01:37:49,553 --> 01:37:51,083
I heard Shinichi's voice!

1738
01:37:52,127 --> 01:37:53,543
Are you okay, Miss?

1739
01:37:53,568 --> 01:37:55,723
Arthur?! Why are you here?

1740
01:37:55,748 --> 01:37:58,934
Well, I got worried about you, so I uh...

1741
01:37:58,959 --> 01:38:00,043
Aw, thank you.

1742
01:38:00,154 --> 01:38:04,133
Hm... Come on, where in the world is Shinichi?!

1743
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:06,612
Phew.

1744
01:38:06,869 --> 01:38:08,463
I'm just glad you're safe.

1745
01:38:09,897 --> 01:38:11,371
What? Ugh!

1746
01:38:13,872 --> 01:38:16,297
Heh! Why, thank you!

1747
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:21,342
Makoto..!

1748
01:38:22,013 --> 01:38:25,435
Kid took the jewel from me, think you can shoot him down?

1749
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:27,762
Of course Boss, will do.

1750
01:38:34,025 --> 01:38:35,883
Stay still, damn it!

1751
01:38:36,332 --> 01:38:37,710
Now take this!

1752
01:38:40,808 --> 01:38:41,467
Huh?!

1753
01:38:43,096 --> 01:38:44,082
It hit.

1754
01:38:45,974 --> 01:38:47,529
It's okay Sonoko, we're fine!

1755
01:38:47,559 --> 01:38:48,115
Urk!

1756
01:38:48,139 --> 01:38:48,610
Ah!

1757
01:38:51,748 --> 01:38:54,248
Uh, that's not good... Huh?!

1758
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:56,340
Kid! You little-!

1759
01:38:56,365 --> 01:38:57,336
See ya!

1760
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,713
W-W-W-Wait!

1761
01:39:05,909 --> 01:39:07,366
Woah! Help me!

1762
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:09,950
Damn it! We're gonna fall!

1763
01:39:10,118 --> 01:39:10,816
Huh.

1764
01:39:10,841 --> 01:39:12,721
Oh Makoto, you're bleeding.

1765
01:39:13,175 --> 01:39:15,701
Sorry about this, excuse me.

1766
01:39:15,761 --> 01:39:18,511
Huh?! Wait, what are you planning to do?

1767
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:20,872
You do know what's happening around us right?!

1768
01:39:20,897 --> 01:39:22,475
Stop! You shouldn't!

1769
01:39:22,579 --> 01:39:23,223
Ah!

1770
01:39:26,134 --> 01:39:27,616
This way I can carry you.

1771
01:39:27,859 --> 01:39:32,837
Now Sonoko, this time no matter what
happens... don't you leave my side.

1772
01:39:34,716 --> 01:39:38,200
I mean... it's not like I could
go anywhere even if I wanted to.

1773
01:39:57,261 --> 01:39:58,507
Hah!

1774
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:11,696
Argh!

1775
01:40:21,579 --> 01:40:23,073
Where'd you go?!

1776
01:40:51,532 --> 01:40:54,821
Mr. Kyogoku! Grab onto something quick!

1777
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:36,954
Huh... Uh...

1778
01:41:37,952 --> 01:41:39,184
Are you all right?

1779
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:47,971
Huh?

1780
01:41:49,955 --> 01:41:51,175
You can have it back.

1781
01:41:51,523 --> 01:41:52,017
Huh?

1782
01:41:53,379 --> 01:41:57,109
Just take it. It didn't end up being
the jewel I've been searching for.

1783
01:42:01,777 --> 01:42:02,486
Huh...

1784
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:08,692
Sonoko, please sit over here for a little bit.

1785
01:42:09,524 --> 01:42:13,824
Ah... I apologize. I think I may have tied
the knots a little bit too tightly on you.

1786
01:42:14,445 --> 01:42:15,156
Hm.

1787
01:42:16,214 --> 01:42:17,215
Ah...

1788
01:42:18,949 --> 01:42:20,505
There, you're all set.

1789
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:21,610
Hmph!

1790
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:22,451
Uh-!

1791
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:23,938
No, no! That's, uh...

1792
01:42:24,336 --> 01:42:24,805
Ah...

1793
01:42:25,241 --> 01:42:27,820
It's something of a... good luck charm, you see.

1794
01:42:27,845 --> 01:42:30,473
No way, you kept it on this whole time?

1795
01:42:30,505 --> 01:42:31,069
Huh...

1796
01:42:31,243 --> 01:42:32,021
Yes...

1797
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:35,500
I didn't think you'd find it
very manly so I hid it from you.

1798
01:42:36,597 --> 01:42:37,929
Honestly...

1799
01:42:37,954 --> 01:42:40,824
I thought I was the one being looked after all this time,

1800
01:42:40,849 --> 01:42:43,985
but in reality, I was protecting Makoto as well...

1801
01:42:51,383 --> 01:42:52,652
So that's what it was!

1802
01:42:52,677 --> 01:42:54,599
Come on, give it back to me, please!

1803
01:42:54,759 --> 01:42:55,828
Sorry, but no!

1804
01:42:55,852 --> 01:42:56,720
Please, Sonoko!

1805
01:42:56,819 --> 01:42:58,511
I'm gonna treasure this forever!

1806
01:42:58,557 --> 01:43:00,042
So lovey-dovey.

1807
01:43:08,076 --> 01:43:11,219
Who in the world are you? Better yet... what are you?

1808
01:43:11,572 --> 01:43:13,635
Definitely not an ordinary kid...

1809
01:43:15,921 --> 01:43:18,804
Conan Edogawa. I'm a detective.

1810
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,825
Are you sure you're okay?

1811
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:17,627
Letting that strong boyfriend of yours
head off to the United States again?

1812
01:47:17,693 --> 01:47:19,003
Yeah, I'm not worried.

1813
01:47:19,045 --> 01:47:22,587
After all, Makoto was born to
fight. So who am I to stop him?

1814
01:47:24,019 --> 01:47:25,889
Oh! Look over there, it's them!

1815
01:47:25,953 --> 01:47:27,376
Yeah, but what is that?

1816
01:47:27,509 --> 01:47:31,389
Hey, don't cling so close to me like
that. It makes it hard for me to walk.

1817
01:47:31,468 --> 01:47:34,415
No way. I'm not letting go of you ever again!

1818
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,964
Oh, really?

1819
01:47:36,417 --> 01:47:39,057
I mean, after all I've been waiting so long...

1820
01:47:39,756 --> 01:47:40,943
For this moment!

1821
01:47:40,967 --> 01:47:41,789
Huh?

1822
01:47:42,481 --> 01:47:44,609
Damn you Kid! We've been waiting!

1823
01:47:44,659 --> 01:47:45,884
Huh?! Seriously?

1824
01:47:45,909 --> 01:47:49,408
I've known from the very beginning of
this trip that you weren't really Shinichi!

1825
01:47:49,433 --> 01:47:53,389
Apparently you don't know, but he's
never called Dad "Pops"! Not even once!

1826
01:47:53,559 --> 01:47:55,609
But I thought he always...

1827
01:47:55,909 --> 01:47:59,630
Come to think of it, I've never
called him "Pops" in front of Ran.

1828
01:47:59,727 --> 01:48:02,767
Pretending to be him not only
once, but twice, of all the nerve!

1829
01:48:02,792 --> 01:48:05,972
Keep a nice tight grip on him
miss, and we'll take care of the rest!

1830
01:48:05,997 --> 01:48:07,697
Apprehend him!

1831
01:48:07,759 --> 01:48:08,467
Eep!

1832
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:13,219
Don't let him go! Arrest him!

1833
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,371
I'm not letting you go, no matter what!

1834
01:48:16,516 --> 01:48:18,197
Don't let him escape!

1835
01:48:18,442 --> 01:48:19,002
Oh.

1836
01:48:19,027 --> 01:48:20,026
Hey Doc...

1837
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:26,192
Hmph.

1838
01:48:26,604 --> 01:48:28,256
He's not here!

1839
01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:33,349
Aah! Jeez, how'd he escape?!

1840
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:34,250
Damn it!

1841
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:37,222
He should still be around here! After him!

1842
01:48:42,011 --> 01:48:44,101
Ah! Conan!

1843
01:48:44,609 --> 01:48:47,208
It's nice to see you Ran! Welcome back!

1844
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,623
You too, thanks!

1845
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,403
You weren't too lonely, right?

1846
01:48:53,261 --> 01:48:57,146
Of course not... I was right next to you the whole time.
