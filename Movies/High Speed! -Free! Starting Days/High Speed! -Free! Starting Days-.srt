00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:26,608
Havin' a good morning, Haruka?

5
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:28,692
I told you to stop
calling me that.

6
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:30,775
Yeah, right. I'm sorry, Haru.

7
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:33,358
Can we go to the entrance
ceremony now?

8
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:59,442
Why didn't you button this?
You tryin' to look sloppy?

9
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,400
It's tight.

10
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,442
C'mon, it's not that bad.

11
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,317
How did you know where
I was gonna be?

We've been friends so long.
I know everything about you.

00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:22,358
Okay, well maybe not everything.

15
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:25,733
Your mom told me where you were.

16
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:28,358
Right. Yeah.

17
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,817
So, know what club
you're gonna join, yet?

18

'Cause I...

So, have you decided
upon a club yet?

Wait, what?

23
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:43,650
Starting middle school
is a big deal.

24
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,317
I just figured now
would be a good time

25
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,733
to try sounding more
mature, you know?

Can you not see it?

00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:22,025
I can see for you. Um...

33
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,275
[MAKOTO]
You're in Class One.

34
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,692
Guess we're in
different classes.

35
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,608
Our rooms are right next door.

36
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:36,358
We'll be together for
joint lessons and P.E.

37

That's true, but still I--

Hey, Tachibana!

39
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,233
Oh, what's up, Mochizuki?

[MOCHIZUKI]
Yeah!

43
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,275
We haven't been in the

third grade, right? [laughs]

Just think about it, 'kay?

48
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:55,692
What about you, Numata?

49
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,942
You're gonna join
the swim club, yeah?

50
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,067
No. I hadn't planned on it.

51
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,525
Why? You know you wanna swim.
Who doesn't like fun?

52
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:04,692
Did you choose a
different club?

53
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,400
You chose a different club!

54
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,692
[NUMATA]
Not yet, but...

55
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:10,067
Then, what's the problem?
Let's swim together!

56
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,400
[NUMATA]
I don't know, okay.

57
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:13,483
I was thinking maybe I'd
join the cultural club.

[ASAHI]
You can't be serious.

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,775
And I've actually
heard all about you.

64
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,733
Rin Matsuoka filled me in.

65
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,108
Rin told you?

66
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,983
[KISUMI] Yep. He said there
was this really fast guy

67
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,692
at Iwatobi Swimming Club.

68

[ASAHI]
Swimming Club?!

69
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:35,650
Did I hear something
about an SC over here?

70
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,650
[KISUMI]
An "SC"?

71
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,233
It means swimming
club, obviously.

72
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,942
My name's Asahi Shiina.

73
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,233
And you are... Nanase!

74
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:47,067
Oh yeah, you're definitely
joining the Swim Club. Right?

75
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,442
I haven't decided, yet.

76
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,358
What? You haven't decided?

77
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,858
In that case, come join
the basketball club with me!

78
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,525
[ASAHI] Hey! You can't just
steal him like that.

79
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:57,650
He's already gonna
join the swim club!

80
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:59,983
I figure if you already
swim in an outside club,

81
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,317
why join another one?
Might as well try basketball!

So, how's middle school going?

92
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,817
Is it awesome?

93
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,150
It's too soon to tell.
We've only been one day.

94
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,192
It's normal.

95

Yeah?

96
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,650
This isn't fair. I wish I was
in the same year as you guys

97
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,275
so we could all go
to school together.

[MAKOTO] You're only one
year younger than us.

99
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,942
We'll all be back in the same
school soon enough.

100
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,233
Yeah, I know, but that means
I won't be allowed to swim

101
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,483
in the relay with
you two this year.

00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:04,775
My name is Asahi Shiina.

163
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:07,983
[KISUMI] I'm Kisumi Shigino.
Nice to meet you!

164
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,442
All right, be honest
with me, guys.

165
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,317
What'd you think of my rebounds?

166
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,067
Oh, they were cool, I guess.

167
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,692
Well, thank you. To be honest,

168
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,442
I can do pretty much anything
I set my mind to, so...

169
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:20,400
Which is exactly why you should
join the basketball club.

170
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:21,483
Not happening.

171
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,025
Nanase and I are
choosing the swim club,

172
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,067
so shut up about it
already. Right?

173
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,108
Wait, you decided to
join the swim club?

174
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,817
I never said what I was joining.

175
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,608
You should if you want, though.

176
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,108
[ASAHI]
What? No way!

177
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,483
Don't tell me you're a member
of the same SC as Nanase?

178
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:35,733
Uh. I am.

179
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,650
Great, then you can join
the swim club, too!

180
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:39,025
I what...?!

181
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:41,400
Aw, come on, don't you wanna
play basketball instead?

182
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:42,858
Nanase does, don't ya?

183
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:45,650
I bet you're feeling
popular, Haru.

184
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,858
Haru?

185
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:48,775
Oh, cuz your first
name's Haruka?

186
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:51,525
Hey, do you guys mind if I
call you Haru and Makoto?

187
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,275
Someone's desperate
to be accepted.

188
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:54,483
--I don't care.
--That's fine.

189
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,025
Really?! No fair!
Then I wanna do it, too!

190
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:59,358
Can I call you Haru and Makoto?!
Can I? Please?

191
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,275
Still don't care.

192
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:01,608
It's fine.

193
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:06,733
[gasps] You can both call
me Asahi, if you want.

194
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:11,317
So, nice to meet you again,
Haru, Makoto, Asahi.

195
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,983
I didn't say you
could call me that!

196
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,608
Don't freak out about it.
You can call me Kisumi, okay?

197
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:19,525
Oh! He just said "kiss me!"
What a pervy name!

198
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,317
You're the pervy one for even
thinking of it like that.

199
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,442
[laughs] Pervert.

200
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,108
Hey, don't call me that!
I am not a pervert!

201
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,317
[KISUMI]
Okay, fine. Pervert says what?

202
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
[ASAHI]
What?

203
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,067
What's up?

204
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,108
[gasps]

205
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,150
[exhales]

206
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,025
[gasps] What's wrong?

207
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,525
New school and everything
making you feel overwhelmed?

208
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:06,650
I'm good.

209
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,275
It just gets noisy.

210
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,483
Yeah, I bet it does.

211
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,900
There are a lot of
kids in your class

212
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:12,775
with a whole lot of energy.

213
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,192
Speakin' of which, Kisumi wanted
us to join the basketball club.

214
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,192
Have you decided what
you're gonna do?

215
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:19,650
[HARUKA]
No. Not yet.

216
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,233
[MAKOTO] You'll have to
make a choice soon.

217
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,025
School rules say we
have to join a club.

218
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:25,775
Well, have you made a decision?

219
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,900
Me? Let's see... Mm...

220
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,150
No, I don't know, either.

221
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:33,400
Then, maybe worry
about yourself first.

222
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:38,400
It's way too hard. There are
just so many to choose from.

223
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:40,317
You mentioned the
basketball club?

224
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,650
[MAKOTO gasps]

225
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,317
You okay?

226
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,442
[MAKOTO]
Haru.

227
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:51,275
What if I did join
the basketball club?

228
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:52,942
Would you be mad?

229
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,817
You don't need my permission
to join the club you want.

230
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,233
That's true, yeah.

231
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:09,483
So maybe basketball?
I've only ever played it in PE.

232
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,608
But it might be fun to try.

233
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:18,733
[MAKOTO]
Haru.

234
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,775
What if I did join the
basketball club?

235
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,525
Would you be mad?

236
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,650
[STUDENTS panting]

237
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,525
[KISUMI]
Haru!

238
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:30,942
We should eat together.

239
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:33,442
Though, I'll still eat in this
spot even if you say no.

240
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,442
Haru, let's eat lunch together!

241
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,483
Hey, what are you
doing over here?

242
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,525
[KISUMI]
Ooh, fun!

243
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:39,942
We can all hang out
and eat lunch!

244
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,108
[ASAHI] No we can't! It's just
gonna be me and Haru!

245
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:45,150
[KISUMI] And me!
Don't get all weird about it.

246
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:48,233
[KISUMI] Asahi, what elementary
did you graduate from?

247
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:52,233
I know you didn't go to mine,
or Iwatobi, where Haru went.

248
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,692
Right, that's
because I only just

249
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,317
transferred here back in March.

250
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,108
The elementary I went to
wasn't anywhere close to here.

251
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:00,858
And let me guess, you were part
of a swimming club there, also?

252
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,525
Yup! At my old SC, I was
known for swimming

253
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:05,442
the 50 and 100
meter butterfly,

254
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:07,275
and I always swam
in the medley relay.

255
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:09,400
Medley relay? What's that?

256
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,942
Don't you know anything?!

257
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:13,233
Backstroke! Breast!

258
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:15,775
BF! And Freestyle!

259
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:18,900
Four people swim a medley of
different strokes in a relay!

260
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:21,817
Will you please stop trying to
butt into our conversation, now?

261
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,192
I like how even
though you're mad,

262
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:24,608
you still explained
that really well.

263
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,733
You're a nice guy,
just embrace it.

264
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,108
[ASAHI]
Hm? Yeah, so what.

265
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:32,608
Like, explaining the obvious
doesn't mean anything, y'know.

266
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:35,233
[ASAHI sighs] I just wanna
compete at a swim meet,

267
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,608
but if I'm gonna do that,

268
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:38,733
I'll have to be on a totally
different relay team.

269
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,192
That sorta sucks,
because I'd rather

270
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:42,983
swim with the guys
from my old SC.

271
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,567
I don't understand why
the both of you

272
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,858
are so obsessed with swimming.

273
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,067
You should give basketball
a chance. For real!

274
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,358
I don't understand
why you're obsessed

275
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:57,942
with us joining basketball.

276
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,442
I dunno. I guess I just figured

277
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,942
if we joined in
middle school,

278
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,942
we'd be pretty great by the
time we got to high school.

279
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,358
I'm great now.

280
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,525
Did you not watch this?

281
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,567
If I signed up,
I'd be a starter for sure.

282
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,775
Yeah, you're right,
you are awesome.

283
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,192
Why not show everyone?

284
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,733
You just gotta
fill out this form.

285
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:13,858
[ASAHI]
All right!

286
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:16,692
Cheater! I'm not joining,
stop asking!

287
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,942
[KISUMI]
Okay, I'm sorry!

288
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,275
[ASAHI] No you're not!
You tried to trick me!

289
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:20,525
[MAKOTO]
Haru!

290
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:21,858
[KISUMI] I swear.
I'll stop after you join.

291
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:31,900
Hey, Makoto, everything okay?

292
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:34,233
Yeah, just wanted you to
meet this upperclassman.

293
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:37,817
Very nice to meet you,
Haruka Nanase from Iwatobi SC.

294
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,733
I think you should
join the swim club.

295
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,233
Uh?

296
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:44,858
[chuckles] He seems to have
strong feelings about it.

297
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:46,692
I do. Although,
I suppose I have

298
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,817
a pretty valid excuse
to feel that way.

299
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,608
I'm Natsuya Kirishima. I'm
Captain of the swim club, and

300
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,608
I wanted to personally invite
the two of you to join.

301
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:56,525
Him, too?

302
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:58,442
Oh, I hope I didn't upset you.

303
00:16:58,525 --> 00:16:59,442
No, you're good.

304
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:01,733
Haru! Be more respectful!

305
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,233
Sorry.

306
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:06,108
[laughs] The bottom line is
I want guys you to sign up.

307
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,692
So will you?

308
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,858
Um, so what are you thinking?

309
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:10,692
Not interested.

310
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:12,108
Haru!

311
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,733
Have you already decided
what club you're joining?

312
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,442
No, sir. Not yet.

313
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,150
[NATSUYA] We haven't had
a lot of first years join,

314
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,608
so we're in a pinch.

315
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:21,150
C'mon, please?

316
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,733
Whaddaya think? Should we?

317
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,733
[IKUYA] Does anyone take
the school clubs seriously?

318
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,400
[NATSUYA gasps]

319
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,358
Ikuya. They're not just
fun and games.

320
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,317
[IKUYA] Whatever. You got
tired of competing,

321
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,525
so now you're tryin' to make
new friends in some lame club.

322
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,942
Leave it to my brother
to be that stupid.

323
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,442
You two are brothers, sir?

324
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,233
In fact, we are.

325
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,442
Anyway, I hope you guys think
about joining the club.

326
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,525
We would love to
have you. Ha. Later!

327
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:49,775
Uh, hey!

328
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,608
[laughs]

329
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:53,775
He said they don't have
many new members.

330
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:55,358
I don't know what we should do.

331
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,442
[sighs] Do you know
how gullible you are?

332
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:01,483
Everyone says that when they're
trying to get people to join.

333
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,608
You think? Really?

334
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:05,858
[IKUYA] I wouldn't do it
if I were you.

335
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:09,733
Kirishima, right? So, uh, why
is it you feel that way?

336
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:12,483
Because students don't
generally take clubs seriously.

337
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,650
For people like us who
compete with an SC,

338
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,317
and don't just like to
pretend we're swimmers,

339
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,608
a stupid school club
would be a waste of time.

340
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:20,608
I mean, you get that, right?

341
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,275
Not really, but...

342
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:23,775
...I don't think it's
that big a deal.

343
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,650
How can you think that's
not a big deal?!

344
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,567
[HARUKA gasps]

345
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,025
Whatever.

346
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,067
I just refuse to pretend any
school clubs are serious.

347
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,608
Hey, are you not gonna
finish eating, or what?

348
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:37,108
There's a lot of "serious"
talk over here.

349
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:40,858
Oh, you're that weird kid

350
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:43,067
I catch creepily looking
at me all the time!

351
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,567
What? Shut up, I do not!

352
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,942
Yes, you do.

353
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,317
Guess you wanna be my friend.

354
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,067
That's cool. I mean,
you're not alone.

355
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,525
I'm just a real popular guy!

356
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:52,192
No.

357
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,692
Couldn't hide it if I wanted to.

358
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:54,567
Hide what?

359
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,108
All this charisma!

360
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:58,567
No way! Looking at
you makes me laugh,

361
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,067
like you're an animal
at the zoo.

362
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,275
An animal? What kind?

363
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,817
[IKUYA] Hmph. You remind
me of a monkey.

364
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,983
Would you shut up,
Kisumi, don't laugh!

365
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,317
You're pissing me off.
I'm not a monkey.

366
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,275
If you think I'm a monkey,
then you're a monkey!

367
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,317
No, I'm sorry.
But don't be mad.

368
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,233
Humans come from monkeys,
so it makes perfect sense!

369
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:20,817
No, it doesn't!
Don't laugh at me!

370
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,067
[IKUYA] See, he's screeching
just like a monkey, isn't he?

371
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,067
Too loud.

372
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,067

there'd be exactly five of us!

00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:37,150
--[ASAHI] I'm not joining!
--[IKUYA] There's no way.

377
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:38,650
Why won't you let it go?

378
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,067
I don't know.

379
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,233
You haven't decided on a club
yet, so why should I?

380
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,358
I've always been going
with swim club.

381
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,358
I still haven't decided, though.

382
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:47,358
I don't wanna.

383
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:48,483
Yeah, me neither.

384
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,442
Huh? Look, I don't
know about this guy,

385
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,942
but Haru and Makoto are
supposed to join swim club!

386
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,150
You're both swimmers, right?!

387
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,567
You gotta choose swim club!

388
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,358
We don't have to do anything.

389
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,650
If we go by your logic,
everyone who can swim

390
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,067
would have to join, right?

391
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,650
Hold on. If you put me in the
"cannot swim" category,

392
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,150
you're wrong again.

393
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:07,192
What are you mumbling about,
are you saying you can swim?

394
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,233
I've been going to Bando SC
since the first grade.

395
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:12,692
[KISUMI] Kirishima, you're
a swimmer, too?

396
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,775
That's why I'm not interested
in joining a club

397
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:17,317
that won't take
swimming seriously.

398
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,733
Oh, come on, how do you know
they won't take it seriously?

399
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:23,942
[IKUYA] I know they don't split
you into teams based on ability.

400
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,442
I know the practices
are way too easy.

401
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,942
And I know everyone there
would just be screwing around!

402
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:31,608
[ASAHI]
Hm? Well, I think you're crazy!

403
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:33,608
You don't know anything!

404
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,233
Yeah, and you
haven't joined yet,

405
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,525
so how can you be
sure I'm wrong?

406
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,692
I can't! I gotta try it first!

407
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,233
[gasps]

408
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:44,400
[ASAHI] How are you supposed
to find out if you won't do it?

409
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,275
Unless. Maybe you're
just chicken.

410
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:49,942
[gasps] What did you say?

411
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,025
Face it, you're scared
of jumping into something

412
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,858
you can't be a 100% about.

413
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:56,192
[NATSUYA]
Dangit.

414
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:59,233
I forgot to give those guys
a swim club flyer.

415
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:02,192
Nao would be so mad
if he found out.

416
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,817
[IKUYA] Fine! Then I will
join the stupid club

417
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,067
just to prove to you that
no one takes it seriously!

418
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,692
Hey, there! Sorry to barge in!

419
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,358
[MAKOTO]
Kirishima, sir?

420
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,233
[NATSUYA] I forgot to give
these to you earlier.

421
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:16,400
Here. You get one.

422
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,525
One for you.

423
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:18,650
Want a Swim Club Flyer?

424
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,025
No, thanks. I'm going
with basketball.

425
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,275
That's a shame.

426

He's the only one not
signing up, though, sir.

427
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:25,025
The rest of us will.

428
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,067
[NATSUYA]
What? Really?

429
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,358
Hey, why am I the only one

430
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:28,650
that's being left
out of the group?

431
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:29,858
Just lucky?

432
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:32,692
What about us?
We didn't agree to join yet.

433
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,317
Haru, you gonna say anything?

434
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,942
It's better than basketball.

435
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,650
You can't decide like that.

436
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,192
Don't knock basketball,
you guys!

437
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:45,983
You're not gonna back
out now, are you?

438
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:47,983
No, I'm not backing out!

439
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:52,233
All right, I'll
see you at the pool

440
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:53,983
after the Golden Week holidays!

441
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,483
Aw, man, in the end, the
swim club got the rebound

442
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,233
and now has possession
of everyone.

443
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:01,900
Looks like we wound up
joining a club

444
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:04,442
without really knowin' what
was going on, didn't we?

445
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:06,650
[inhales]

446
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:11,358
[NATSUYA]
Gather round!

00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:13,608
[SWIM CLUB]
Yes, sir!

448
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,900
[NATSUYA]
We have new members as of today.

449
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:18,483
I'm sure you second and third
years already know, but,

450
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,067
soon we're having
a practice swim meet

451
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,817
against Sano Middle School.

452
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,400
An official one will follow.

453
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:26,358
First years will also be
participating, so stay focused.

454
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:27,567
[SWIM CLUB]
Yes, sir!

455
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,858
Now. These are our new
first year members.

456

'Kay, why don't you
introduce yourselves,

457
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,150
starting from the end?

00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,317
I'm Asahi Shiina, first year.

459
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,567
That's a great intro and all,

460
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,317
but we already know
you're a first year.

461
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,192
[gasps] Guess you're right.

462
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,817
I just moved here last month,
so I'm new to the area.

463
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,733
Uh, I've been part
of an SC before

464
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:47,233
and am good at the butterfly.

465
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:49,358
With practice,
I'll get even better.

466
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:51,150
Nice to meet you all!!

467
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:59,525
Hey. Ikuya. Go, you're next.

My specialty is breaststroke.

It's very nice to meet you all.

[applause]

473
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,067
Last is me. Haruka Nanase.
Freestyle only.

474
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,192
Be polite, please.

475
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,067
Thank you.

[applause]

477
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,858
Uh. Now that I think about it,

478
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,358
since you all have
different specialties,

479
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:28,858
you'll be able to enter
the first-year medley relay.

480
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:31,192
Individual races for me.

481
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,317
Sir.

482
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,983
And again, I will
only swim freestyle.

483
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,858
[SWIM CLUB]
Uh?

[BOTH gasp]

486
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:39,900
Don't say my first name.

487
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,525
[NATSUYA] Sorry, what are
you saying to me?

488
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,400
Doesn't matter, as captain, I
won't allow you to just swim

489
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:47,608
individual races and
only freestyle at that.

490
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,858
Are you refusing
to do the relay?

491

[HARUKA grunts]

[SWIM CLUB MEMBERS gasp]

493
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:55,358
Now you listen to me!

494
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:58,358
Don't get too cocky, kid.

495
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,942
Go on, get in the
pool, right now.

496
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,233
Come on.

497
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:05,483
We're gonna have
a 50-meter race.

498
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:09,608
Just for you, freestyle!

499
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,567
You guys, wait!

500
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,692
Our captain won't listen to
anyone after he gets like that.

501
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:19,942
You might as well give up.

502
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,983
[MAKOTO]
Huh?!

503

[NATSUYA]
Haruka.

504
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,858
I don't mind you
having convictions,

505
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:26,733
just earn them by winning.

506
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:28,233
Don't use my first name.

507
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,442
Are you kidding me, Haru?
This isn't the time for that!

508
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:31,692
Nao, you can call start.

509
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:35,733
All right. Take your marks.

510
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:37,025
Get set.

That was impressive. You tied.

00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:19,358
We did?

523
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:21,692
Damn it.

[panting]

525
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:26,400
All right, you really
are fast, first year.

526
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,025
You proved it, and I'll let
you swim just freestyle.

527
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:33,025
It was only a tie, however.
So you'll still swim relay.

528
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,275
The next time we race,
it won't be a tie.

to start practice?

[SWIM CLUB]
Yes, sir!

00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,025
[IKUYA]
You're really fast.

533
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:55,358
I'm just normal.

00:25:55,442 --> 00:25:58,442
No, that was fast!
Like, I still can't believe it!

535
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:00,817
[NATSUYA] Hey, guys!
First years are over here!

536
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,150
[FIRST YEARS]
Yes, sir!

537
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,192
This is Nao Serizawa,

538
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:08,025
a third year member as well
as our club manager.

539
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,608
He's also in charge of
teaching the first years.

540
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:12,150
You're lucky to learn from him.

00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:13,192
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

542
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:14,358
And you are...

...Asahi, Ikuya,
Makoto, and Haruka.

544
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,983
First name again.

545
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:22,775
You really hate being called
by your first name that much?

546
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:24,483
Well, you're gonna have
to deal with it!

547
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,067
All club members call each
other by first name here.

548
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,233
That's our motto!

549
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:30,608
[BOTH gasp, groan]

550
00:26:30,692 --> 00:26:33,858
[NAO] Listen, because swimmers
usually compete as individuals,

551
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,900
it can be easy to
get self-centered.

552
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:38,567
But that won't work
in a club like ours.

553
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,775
This way, we can
form better bonds.

554
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,317
All right, Nao, get to it.

555
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,900
Well, then. I've been
entrusted with teaching you

556
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,025

sure you get better.

557
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:54,233
But I think I'll start things
off by showing you around.

Great! Let's end things today

560
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,067
with a simple 200
meter freestyle.

561
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,067
Keep in mind, this will be
part of your cool down,

562
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,483
so don't feel like you
need to go all out.

you just can't swim freestyle?

No, that's not it!
That's not it at all!

I couldn't do it. [groaning]

How should I know?

Hm... Well, maybe it's mental.

It's cool. Don't worry.

If you were able to
swim it before,

590
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:19,567
then you'll be able
to swim it again.

Natsuya and Ikuya are brothers,

but they sure don't
seem to get along.

Who knows?

00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,817
[MAKOTO] Ah, you're not
even listening to me.

Hey, lookie!
Haru and Mako are here.

609
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:13,942
You guys are late!

610
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,775
Yeah, that's because Haru and I
joined our school's swim club.

611
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,275
You have a swim club?

612
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,650
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, everyone at school's

613
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:21,442
required to join something, so.

614
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:22,858
[NAGISA]
Mm...

615
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:26,192
Uh. We still plan to come here
though, if that's cool?

616
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:29,900
[gasps] Of course! You should!

617
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:33,150
Oh, that reminds me! Coach said
that I could try something new.

618
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,608
Meaning, at the next meet,
I'm gonna get to swim

619
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:38,442
in the 50 meter and the 100
meter breaststroke races!

00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:41,025
No way. That's awesome, Nagisa!

621
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:43,317
[NAGISA] What do you think
you two will do?

622
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,150
[MAKOTO] Mm... Well,
there's supposed to be

623
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,525
a couple of meets with the
swim club coming up soon.

624
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:49,733
I should probably
prioritize those.

625
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:52,400
[NAGISA]
Really? What about Haru?

626
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,192
I guess I'll stick with Makoto.

627
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,608
I see.

628
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,233
I'll go, though. To cheer.

786
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,525
[IKUYA] I don't think
it's that funny, either!

787
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:43,400
[ASAHI] I go out of my way
to eat lunch with you all,

788
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:44,608
and this is how I get treated?

789
00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:45,942
Maybe you should
eat somewhere else!

790
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,733
[IKUYA] No, maybe you should
eat somewhere else!

791
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:48,942
[ASAHI]
Why would I do that?!

792
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,483
I'm not the weird one
who's only over here

793
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,650
because I wanna copy Haru!

794
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:52,733
Don't jump on me like that.

795
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:54,025
[IKUYA]
I wasn't copying him!

796
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:56,442
We just happened to be
eating the same way.

797
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,067
[KISUMI]
Something wrong, Haru?

798
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,983
No, it's nothing.

799
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:04,775
[MALE TEACHER B]
Attention.

800
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:07,025
What boy's on duty
for Class One?

801
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:09,775
It says Nanase on the board.

802
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:11,192
[HARUKA grunts]

803
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:12,525
[FEMALE STUDENT C] Do you
think he meant it, though?

804
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:14,150
[FEMALE STUDENT D]
I mean, obviously.

805
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:15,983
[FEMALE STUDENT C]
Oh, I hope you're right.

806
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,650
That was a close one, huh?

807
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:27,942
[NATSUYA]
So, how's club going?

808
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:29,983
[HARUKA]
Normal. Sir.

809
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,733
[NATSUYA]
I'm glad to hear that.

810
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:32,858
I don't know what
I would've done

811
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:35,067
if you said you wanted
to quit already.

812
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,983
Has Ikuya said anything about
maybe wanting to quit?

813
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:42,733
[HARUKA]
Not to me.

814
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:46,317
But you might want to ask him
about that yourself, sir.

815
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,483
You're not very good

816
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:49,025
at the whole being polite
thing, are you?

817
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:51,233
You should work on that.

818
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:54,150
[sighs]

819
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,483
[HARUKA] Why don't you
and Ikuya get along, sir?

820
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:03,567
I can only guess,

821
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,192
but it's most likely because
I pushed him away.

822
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,275
That would fit with the
timeline of him completely

823
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,025
hating my guts for
the past two years.

824
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:16,983
I doubt he really hates you.

825
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,025
[NATSUYA]
Uh?

826
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,483
Hope you're right.

827
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:24,900
[NATSUYA]
Here.

828
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:26,775
Let me know if you feel like
this is too much to carry.

829
00:39:26,858 --> 00:39:29,233
Look, I realize my brother's
got some issues.

830
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:31,025
Just gotta be patient, yeah?

831
00:39:31,108 --> 00:39:33,275
Welp, see you at practice.

832
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:36,608
Um.

833
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,983
I really appreciate
your help, sir.

834
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:43,608
[gasps]

835
00:39:43,692 --> 00:39:46,067
Sure. It's no problem.

836
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:52,608
[ASAHI]
Hm?

837
00:39:58,317 --> 00:40:00,483
Uh, Ikuya, what's going on?

838
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,275
With what?

839
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,150
You're copying--

840
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,192
No, I am not!

841
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:07,817
Yeah, so. What's
that guy's deal?

842
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,525
Uh.

843
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:10,900
How's it goin', first years?

844
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:11,858
[MAKOTO]
Oh, hello, sir.

845
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:12,692
It's going well!

846
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:13,525
[ASAHI]
It's good, sir!

847
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:15,025
--[HARUKA] Normal.
--Great.

848
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:20,358
No words from Ikuya?

849
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:21,692
Normal.

850
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,067
How you feeling, Asahi?

851
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,608
Think you can swim freestyle?

852
00:40:25,692 --> 00:40:26,775
You bet!

853
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,192
Nao said that it might
be a mental issue,

854
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:30,525
so I borrowed some books from
the library to help out.

855
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:32,817
They specifically deal with
mental training stuff,

856
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,650
and I think they're already
making a difference.

857
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,025
Yeah? Nice work!

858
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:37,483
[ASAHI laughs]

859
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:38,900
[NATSUYA]
I'm hopin' for the best!

860
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:42,817
[ASAHI] Thank you, sir.
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine!

861
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,692
Well, I'm leavin'
these guys to you.

862
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:50,442
[MALE SWIMMER D]
Captain, you ready to go?

863
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:52,358
[NATSUYA]
Yep! Be right there!

864
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:58,150
Funny. He really is awkward.

865
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,150
So, you guys ready to swim?

866
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:05,733
[FIRST YEARS]
Yes, sir!

867
00:41:05,817 --> 00:41:07,192
[IKUYA]
Yes, sir!

868
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:09,817
[NAO]
We'll practice starting first.

869
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,358
Let's try the track start.

870
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:15,525
One foot forward
and one foot back.

871
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:21,358
Don't bend your knees too much!
And watch that reaction time!

872
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:22,442
Ready!

873
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:23,525
[whistle blows]

874
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:25,483
[NAO]
Next!

875
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:30,567
[NAO]
Ready!

876
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,817
[whistle blows]

877
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,567
[whistle blowing]

878
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:37,650
Uh.

879
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:40,525
[NAO]
It's not good.

880
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,067
There's too much time
between the sound

881
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,983
of the whistle and
when you jump.

882
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:47,650
Gotta take advantage of that
start, or you'll never win.

883
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:50,150
I want you to crouch with
your focus under your belly

884
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:54,067
button, around here.
Everyone try.

885
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,483
That's where your body's
center is located.

886
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:59,400
So, it should help you
feel more stable.

887
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,817
That's physically and mentally.

888
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,108
Take a deep breath while
you're in that position,

889
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:06,067
and let it all out at once.

890
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,567
When you let go, try to exhale
all of your tension as well.

891
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,817
[exhaling]

892
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,817
This next part's important.

893
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,525
After you let that air out,

894
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:17,983
I want you to take
shallow breaths,

895
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:20,192
and imagine your body is ears.

896
00:42:20,275 --> 00:42:21,067
Ear ears?

897
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,358
Yup. For real.

898
00:42:23,442 --> 00:42:26,650
All the nerves in your body
are listening for that whistle.

899
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:28,192
This is not easy.

900
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:29,567
Ears, huh?

901
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,900
Yeah, it's hard to understand.

902
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:32,733
But that's okay.

903
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,317
Uh. It's okay?

904
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,900
Yep, in the end, you just have
to remember how it feels to you.

905
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:40,150
All right, guys,
that's good. Follow me.

906
00:42:41,942 --> 00:42:43,692
Let's play a speed game

907
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:45,275
[ASAHI, IKUYA, MAKOTO]
Uh...?

908
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,942
[MAKOTO] Um, Nao.
What are we doing?

909
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:52,983
I told you, it's a speed game.

910
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:56,733
Put both hands on the mat.
Lift your hips a bit.

911
00:42:56,817 --> 00:43:01,150
Then, whoever grabs or
swipes this cap first wins.

912
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:03,108
If you keep practicing,
you'll get a feel

913
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:05,692
for what it means to turn
your whole body into ears.

914
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:07,067
Ah.

915
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,775
[NAO]
We can start with Haruka.

916
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:10,275
Makoto, you blow the whistle.

917
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:11,608
Yes, sir.

918
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:31,067
[MAKOTO]
Uh...

919
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,567
I'm not too shabby, am I?

920
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:40,567
[laughs] Looks like Haru's
the slowest of us all!

921
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,775
I'll go next and win for sure.

922
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:43,817
[whistle blows]

923
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:46,025
[ASAHI gasping]

924
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:47,317
[whistle blows]

925
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,150
[IKUYA]
Uh!

926
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:49,025
[whistle blows]

927
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:50,483
[MAKOTO gasping]

928
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:54,358
You monster.

929
00:43:54,442 --> 00:43:55,983
What? I didn't say anything.

930
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,983
Why is he a manager?
He's amazing.

931
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:03,400
Okay, listen up.

932
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:05,692
Next, we need to work
on the relay exchange.

933
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:07,608
We don't have much time
before our practice meet

934
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:09,900
with Sano Middle School.

935
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,692
[MAKOTO]
Haru, are you all right?

936
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,233
I'm fine.

937
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:19,900
Let's do this guys.
Move, hop in.

938
00:44:19,983 --> 00:44:21,733
Get on your mark.

939
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,192
Get set...

940
00:44:27,608 --> 00:44:28,692
[whistle blows]

941
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:45,983
Too fast, Ikuya!
That was a false start!

942
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:47,942
[panting]

943
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,608
[gasps]

944
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,150
Too slow!

945
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,275
You've gotta take less
time than a flat start!

946
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,150
That was slow, too!

947
00:45:32,775 --> 00:45:34,567
Haru...

948
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
His swimming's gotten sloppy.

949
00:45:38,483 --> 00:45:40,733
But he swam fine yesterday.

950
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:56,525
[NAO]
Interesting.

951
00:45:56,608 --> 00:45:59,942
Why's he falling apart now?
Think he's scared of the relay?

952
00:46:02,942 --> 00:46:05,067
Is he?

953
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,858
Maybe.

954
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:09,233
We won the medley
in elementary though.

955
00:46:09,317 --> 00:46:12,067
What reason would he
have to be scared?

956
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,067
We were so good.
Best relay team ever.

957
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,525
I bet he's just havin' a hard
timing believing there could be

958
00:46:19,608 --> 00:46:23,608
a better team than the one
we were already on, sir.

959
00:46:23,692 --> 00:46:25,983
That makes sense.

960
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:27,858
You're okay, though, right?

961
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:30,275
I'm sad as well, I guess.

962
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:32,650
But at least we're
both still swimming!

963
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:36,817
[NAO] True. And why do you
swim, do you like it?

964
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,233
[gasps] Yes.

965
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:41,525
[NAO]
Really?

966
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:43,358
You're not just here
because Haruka is?

967
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:44,983
[MAKOTO gasps]

968
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:54,442
[NAO]
Relax.

969
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:57,525
I'm sorry, that was
a mean question.

970
00:46:57,608 --> 00:46:59,108
[inhales] Okay.

971
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,525
Go! You're almost there!

972
00:47:02,483 --> 00:47:05,650
[panting]

973
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:15,067
[ASAHI]
Haru! Good for you!

974
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,692
[panting]

975
00:47:20,942 --> 00:47:22,442
Oh, yeah. Good job!

976
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:23,983
Really good.

977
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:26,275
[panting]

978
00:47:29,067 --> 00:47:30,900
[NAO] You'll be able to
reduce your time a lot

979
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:32,817
if you improve your exchanges.

980
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,400
But right now,
I'm fairly certain

981
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:37,400
your mindset keeps you focused
on being individuals.

982
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:46,650
That's gonna be it for today!

983
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:48,483
Join the rest of the team
to say bye, okay?

984
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:49,942
--[ASAHI] Okay.
--[HARUKA] Okay.

985
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:52,108
[gasps] Okay.

986
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,525
[ASAHI]
Eh, we'll work it out.

987
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:02,900
Yeah, I'm actually
not all that worried.

988
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:04,900
Who cares if we're
good at exchanges?

989
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,942
As long as our individual
times stay fast,

990
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:08,983
it won't be a problem.

991
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:12,192
[HARUKA]
Makoto.

992
00:48:12,275 --> 00:48:13,733
Makoto.

993
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:17,108
Oh, sorry. I zoned out.
What's up?

994
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:18,608
Did something like, happen?

995
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:20,650
What? No, nothing happened.

996
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:22,192
[ASAHI]
I think something did.

997
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,858
I think you got worried
about the relay.

998
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,775
Oh, yeah. I mean, I am worried.

999
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:28,483
[ASAHI]
I said it'll be fine.

1000
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:30,817
We've got plenty of time
before even the practice meet.

1001
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,983
That's true.

1002
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:35,900
[ASAHI]
Well. Ikuya and I are this way.

1003
00:48:35,983 --> 00:48:38,650
How in the world did we end
up walking home together?

1004
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:42,233
Obviously, that's because we
live in the same direction.

1005
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:43,442
[IKUYA]
Stupid Asahi.

1006
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:45,108
[ASAHI]
What did you say? I'm not wrong.

1007
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:47,192
We do live in the
same direction.

1008
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:13,067
[HARUKA]
Makoto.

1009
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,358
[MAKOTO]
Yeah?

1010
00:49:16,817 --> 00:49:18,858
Something happened, right?

1011
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,858
I don't really know
what you mean.

1012
00:49:22,942 --> 00:49:24,192
Why are you lying?!

1013
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:27,650
[gasps]

1014
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:29,608
It's the truth though.

1015
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:31,275
Huh? Are, you sure?

1016
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:33,442
[MAKOTO]
I'm sure. It's nothing.

1017
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:35,858
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

1018
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,192
I'm home.

1019
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,233
[HARUKA'S MOM]
Oh, Haruka, welcome back.

1020
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:52,733
Listen, I got a call from
your dad's company today.

1021
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:56,650
They told me he had been
injured while he was working.

1022
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:58,067
He was?

1023
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,983
[HARUKA'S MOM] Oh, don't worry.
He's fine, it's not bad.

1024
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,067
It's just gonna be difficult
for him to get around

1025
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,067
out here until
he heals back up.

1026
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,483
So, I think he'll need
me to go help him.

1027
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:08,358
How long will you be gone?

1028
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:12,400
[HARUKA'S MOM] Mm... I think
about a week, starting tomorrow?

1029
00:50:12,483 --> 00:50:13,608
What do you want to do?

1030
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:15,483
I know you have
school to consider.

1031
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,983
I'll be fine by myself
if it's not too long.

1032
00:50:18,067 --> 00:50:21,275
[HARUKA'S MOM] You sure?
I'm gonna be so worried.

1033
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,233
I can ask the Tachibanas to
keep an eye on you, though!

1034
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:55,317
[NAO] Really? You're not just
here because Haruka is?

1035
00:50:58,442 --> 00:51:00,400
[MAKOTO]
That's not it.

1036
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:17,067
[MAKOTO'S MOM] Hey, Haruka,
how's your morning going?

1037
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,150
Did Makoto not tell
you he left early?

1038
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:21,317
He said he had to do
his class duties.

1039
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,900
[gasps]

1040
00:51:22,983 --> 00:51:25,983
Oh, your mom's leaving today to
go be with your dad, isn't she?

1041
00:51:26,067 --> 00:51:28,608
Come over for dinner
starting tonight, okay?

1042
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:30,983
[HARUKA]
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

1043
00:51:42,525 --> 00:51:45,608
[MAKOTO panting]

1044
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,817
[gasps]

1045
00:51:57,275 --> 00:51:59,608
[SASABE]
Hey, Makoto!

1046
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:02,567
Don't you have class duty today?

1047
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,150
[MAKOTO]
Yeah!

1048
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,567
[SASABE]
What's wrong?

1049
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,608
Swimming so early in the
morning isn't really like you.

1050
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,567
Yes, it is. I do love
swimming, you know.

1051
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,692
Huh?

1052
00:52:13,775 --> 00:52:15,442
[MAKOTO]
Well, I'm off to school.

1053
00:52:15,525 --> 00:52:17,275
Yeah, right.

1054
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:21,108
That was weird. Real weird.

1055
00:52:21,192 --> 00:52:22,233
[ASAHI]
Hey, Haru.

1056
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:24,192
Is that all you're
eating for lunch?

1057
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:25,692
Grilled mackerel.

1058
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,275
Seems bland compared
to yesterday.

1059
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:30,150
My parents won't be
home for a while.

1060
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:31,233
[ASAHI]
What?

1061
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:33,275
How long are they
gonna be away for?

1062
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,525
Only like a week.

1063
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:37,442
Whoa! And you'll be
alone that entire time?

1064
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:39,317
It's not really that big a deal.

1065
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,733
It's not? There's no way
I'd ever survive that.

1066
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:44,442
[ASAHI]
Yeah, same here. I...

1067
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:46,567
Haru will be fine
alone, just fine.

1068
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,150
[ASAHI] ...I would die of
starvation in three days!

1069
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:50,733
[KISUMI]
Yeah, I'm not sure you would die

1070
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:52,608
even if you were killed, Asahi.

1071
00:52:52,692 --> 00:52:54,108
[ASAHI]
Huh? Is that a compliment?

1072
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:56,067
[HARUKA]
It's burnt...

1073
00:52:59,025 --> 00:53:03,233
[NAO] The next five will be
intervals of 50-meter freestyle.

1074
00:53:03,317 --> 00:53:04,442
Asahi, are you okay?

1075
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:05,942
[ASAHI]
Oh, yes, sir!

1076
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:11,192
[NAO] I'll be timing you, too.
Haruka's up first.

1077
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:13,483
[whistle blows]

1078
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,275
Next, Asahi.

1079
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:34,192
[gasps] Right!

1080
00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:43,067
[whistle blows]

1081
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:45,400
[gasps]

1082
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,317
[ASAHI panting]
Damn.

1083
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,608
It's all right, Asahi,
don't push yourself!

1084
00:53:58,692 --> 00:54:00,275
[yells]

1085
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:01,900
[NAO]
Makoto's next.

1086
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,608
--[MAKOTO] Ready!
--[whistle blows]

1087
00:54:07,775 --> 00:54:09,483
[ASAHI]
Haru.

1088
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:12,608
Would you mind sharing with
me how you swim freestyle?

1089
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:14,483
I thrust my fingers into
the water's surface

1090
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,567
without fighting against
it to make a cut.

1091
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,942
Then, I slide my body in after.

1092
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:21,275
What does that even mean?!

1093
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,150
[exhales] I used to be able to.

1094
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,067
[NAO]
Individual specialties next.

1095
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,358
I want five 100-meter intervals,

1096
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:34,400
one every three minutes,
and they'll be timed.

1097
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:42,192
Ya wanna race?

1098
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:50,400
[whistle blows]

1099
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,733
[NAO]
What a surprise.

1100
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:03,942
Who won this time?!

1101
00:55:04,025 --> 00:55:05,733

Natsuya by a hair.

[MAKOTO panting]

1105
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,067
Makoto?

1106
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,233
You good?

1107
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:20,442
You swam more than
the 10 lengths, yeah?

1108
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,608
[MAKOTO]
Yeah. I did an extra one.

1109
00:55:23,692 --> 00:55:25,608
You're not gonna help
yourself get any better

1110
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:27,275
if you swim recklessly.

1111
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:28,733
No, I'll be all right.

1112
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:30,817
I just need to rest
for a little bit.

1113
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,900
Then...

1114
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:34,442
...I can go again.

1115
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:38,900
Your thoughts?

1116
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:40,858
Their individual
times aren't bad.

1117
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:43,942
Their problem will be
slow relay exchanges.

1118
00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:46,775
We'll be practicing
the relay from now on.

1119
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:48,150
[ASAHI, MAKOTO]
Right!

[whistle blows]

Too slow, don't be so careful.

1124
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,400
[NAO]
Too fast, be more careful!

1125
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:12,442
Are you trying to go slow?

1126
00:56:16,108 --> 00:56:17,733
Not good, guys.

1127
00:56:17,817 --> 00:56:20,275
You're slow. Why do you
think that is?

1128
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:22,400
Exchanges, probably?

1129
00:56:22,483 --> 00:56:23,983
Exchanges.

1130
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:27,942
Can anyone tell me
why they're so bad?

1131
00:56:28,025 --> 00:56:29,942
Do you want to swim the relay?

[ALL grunt]

1133

We can just swim

Like I said, I'm fine
with individual freestyle.

Haru.

1138
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:40,483
Too bad. Like I said,

1139
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:43,442
they can't swim the
relay without you!

1140
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,733
Well, they all want to
race individually, too.

1141
00:56:45,817 --> 00:56:47,817
Yeah, he's right. And besides,

1142
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,858
there's no way we'll win
a relay with this team.

1143
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:51,108
Hey, you don't speak for me!

1144
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:53,400
I wanna do the relay,
and I think we can win!

1145
00:56:53,483 --> 00:56:55,942
Fine, then why don't you
start by doing your part?!

1146
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:58,608
Asahi, your swimming is
way too self-centered.

1147
00:56:58,692 --> 00:56:59,983
What?! You shut up!

1148
00:57:00,067 --> 00:57:02,317
Stop it! Your exchanges
aren't going very well

1149
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,900
because you all swim selfishly

1150
00:57:03,983 --> 00:57:06,900
and only ever think
about yourselves.

1151
00:57:06,983 --> 00:57:08,817
Relays are different!

1152
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,233
Grow up! Think beyond
your own needs!

1153
00:57:11,317 --> 00:57:13,358
All of you, take a break
and go cool off!

[NAO]
Hey. So, you all right?

1158
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:35,775
I know Natsuya was
pretty harsh on you guys.

1159
00:57:35,858 --> 00:57:39,317
No. He was just telling
the truth, sir.

1160
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:44,275
And, you know...

1161
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:48,483
The more I think about
what Ikuya told me, the uh,

1162
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:52,983
the more he seems right about
me being selfish when I swim.

1163
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:56,400
I don't know how to fix it.

1164
00:57:56,483 --> 00:57:57,983
Ah...

I just...

1166
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:03,150
How do I even focus
on the relay?

Because, sir. What if...

1170
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:20,858
What if...

1171

What if I forget about
the other strokes, too?!

Yeah, um, what is it?

You know you were practicing

1180

recklessly today, right?

1181
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,650
[MAKOTO]
I don't think that's true.

1182

and farther than normal?

[MAKOTO] Because,
we have a meet coming up.

1184
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:05,067
I mean. It's also because
I like swimming.

1185
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,150
Huh? Uh. Where did
that come from?

1186
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:11,733
[gasps] Haru, don't you think
that's a little rude to ask?

1187
00:59:11,817 --> 00:59:14,525
But to answer you. Well,
obviously it came from me

1188
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:17,317
wanting to swim more
because I like doing it.

--So, today.

Oh, sorry. You go first.
What is it?

00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:29,858
No, you should go first.

1192
00:59:33,025 --> 00:59:35,067
So today, when you
said it was fine

1193
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,483
to just be in individual races,
what was that about?

1194
00:59:38,567 --> 00:59:41,192
[HARUKA] Nothing.
I just said what I thought.

1195
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:43,525
I've never really liked relays.

1196
00:59:45,025 --> 00:59:46,233
[MAKOTO] You didn't
mind swimming them

1197
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:47,942
in elementary school.

1198
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:50,358
Things changed, and I don't feel
like swimming them anymore.

1199
00:59:50,442 --> 00:59:53,067
It's really not that
complicated.

1200
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,942
Yeah, I suppose it is
different without Rin around.

1201
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,733
He'd convince you.

1202
00:59:58,692 --> 01:00:00,858
[HARUKA] Don't talk about
people who aren't here.

1203
01:00:00,942 --> 01:00:04,150
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, right. Sorry.

1204
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:08,692
Okay, what were you
about to say earlier?

1205
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:10,650
Why did you leave
without me this morning?

1206
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:11,775
[MAKOTO gasps]

1207
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:18,067
Oh, I had class duty. Sorry, uh.

1208
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,567
I must've just forgotten
to tell you.

1209
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,317
But, you've never forgotten
to tell me before now.

1210
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,650
Maybe I haven't, but,
I don't know, I...

1211
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:30,650
Getting used to all this
new stuff is really hard!

1212
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:33,317
I mean, you just said things
have changed for you, right?!

1213
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,192
Well, things can be
different for me, too!

1214
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:40,692
That's true.

1215
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:58,650
[MAKOTO] You're still gonna
come over for dinner, yeah?

1216
01:00:58,733 --> 01:01:00,150
I think I'll eat
at home, thanks.

1217
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:03,025
Huh. I thought your mom
had already left, though.

1218
01:01:03,108 --> 01:01:05,108
I can figure something out.

1219
01:01:07,192 --> 01:01:08,817
Thank you for this meal.

1220
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,525
[ASAHI]
I am a genius.

1221

I am a genius. I am a genius.

I am... a... gen... ius.

[NATSUYA sighs]

1224
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,608
[IKUYA]
Why not change up our training?

1225
01:01:33,692 --> 01:01:35,817
What do you mean change up?

1226
01:01:40,025 --> 01:01:42,733
Just that, we don't need
to practice exchanges.

1227
01:01:42,817 --> 01:01:45,192
If we all swim our personal
best, then we'll be fine.

1228
01:01:45,275 --> 01:01:47,108
[NATSUYA] That attitude is
why you have a hard time

1229
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:48,817
keeping pace with
the other guys.

1230
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,942
Are you tryin' to say
it's all my fault?!

1231
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:52,442
And everyone else
agrees with you?

1232
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:53,983
Bet they do! Don't they?!

1233
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:55,733
Don't talk about your friends
that way when you're the one

1234
01:01:55,817 --> 01:01:57,983
who refuses to see
your own failings.

1235
01:01:58,067 --> 01:02:01,400
A relay requires a team.

1236
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:05,108
A team, huh? And friends?

1237
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:08,817
Funny story. Especially coming
from you of all people.

1238
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,025
It's easy to tell me to
expand my horizons,

1239
01:02:11,108 --> 01:02:13,317
make new friends, when you...

1240
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,775
You never even wanted to
be my friend, right?!

1241
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,400
Well, if you don't,
then why would they?!

1242
01:02:18,483 --> 01:02:19,692
Ikuya!

1243
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:28,858
[IKUYA cries]

1244
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:38,983
[NAO]
Captain skipping practice?

1245
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:40,442
Not a good look.

1246
01:02:40,525 --> 01:02:42,608
[NATSUYA]
Leave me alone.

1247
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,025
[NAO] Why don't you stop
pushing him away?

1248
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:47,483
Or do you like being
this depressed?

1249
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,358
[NATSUYA]
How did you even know?

1250
01:02:49,442 --> 01:02:52,442
Easy. You don't really get
depressed about too much else.

1251
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:55,900
[NATSUYA]
Whatever. I have to do it.

1252
01:02:55,983 --> 01:02:59,608
If I don't, then he won't
ever become independent.

1253
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:03,650
[NATSUYA]
How's Asahi?

1254
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:05,025
[NAO]

01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:13,067
But. I'll go to
Iwatobi before that.

1407
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,692
Uh. To Iwatobi? What for?

1408
01:10:16,775 --> 01:10:19,067
Because, well. I wanna
swim with a kid

1409
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:21,442
at that school who I bet
would own the relay.

1410
01:10:21,525 --> 01:10:22,858
[SOSUKE]
Uh.

1411
01:10:31,483 --> 01:10:32,692
Iwatobi.

1412
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:35,400
Nanase swims freestyle,
so you'll do butterfly?

1413
01:10:35,483 --> 01:10:37,275
Oh, I guess so, yeah.

1414
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,692
Wait, you swim butterfly,
don't you?

1415
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:42,275
Of course I do.
I swim it better than you.

1416
01:10:42,358 --> 01:10:45,192
[RIN] Why say that?!
Trying to piss me off?

1417
01:10:47,025 --> 01:10:48,692
[SOSUKE growls]

1418
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:55,442
[MAKOTO] Haru, you should come
over for dinner tonight.

1419
01:10:55,525 --> 01:10:57,983
[HARUKA]
No. I'll eat at home.

1420
01:11:01,817 --> 01:11:02,775
Dinner's ready.

1421
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,442
[IKUYA]
Not hungry!

1422
01:11:07,608 --> 01:11:08,692
[ASAHI]
I'm a genius.

1423
01:11:08,775 --> 01:11:10,942
I'm a genius. I'm a genius.

1424
01:11:11,025 --> 01:11:12,275
[sighs]

1425
01:11:12,358 --> 01:11:13,608
Am I...?

1426
01:11:13,692 --> 01:11:15,692
Am I really a genius?

1427
01:11:23,067 --> 01:11:24,525
[panting]

1428
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:30,108
[doorbell chimes]

1429
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,692
[HARUKA, MAKOTO gasp]

1430
01:11:40,775 --> 01:11:43,275
Haru. Uh.

1431
01:11:43,358 --> 01:11:44,400
Is that your dinner?

1432
01:11:44,483 --> 01:11:47,733
[gasps] What I eat
isn't your business.

1433
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:49,525
Oh, yes it is my business!

1434
01:11:49,608 --> 01:11:52,025
Hey. You haven't been
eating any of the food

1435
01:11:52,108 --> 01:11:54,817
I've brought over, have you?
No wonder you were slow today!

1436
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,817
I get that you don't want to eat
with me, and that's fine,

1437
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,483
but don't tell me you'll
figure something out

1438
01:11:58,567 --> 01:11:59,442
if you're not gonna
actually figure--

1439
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:00,275
Let go!

1440
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:01,317
[gasps]

1441
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,817
I'm not the only
selfish one here.

1442
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,733
What would you call the
way you've been acting?

1443
01:12:04,817 --> 01:12:06,233
You changed out of nowhere!

1444
01:12:06,317 --> 01:12:08,233
Meanwhile, you tell me
nothing's going on.

1445
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:09,733
[gasps]

1446
01:12:09,817 --> 01:12:12,317
I don't understand
what this is about.

1447
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,858
What happened?

1448
01:12:13,942 --> 01:12:16,567
Why try to be something
you're not?

1449
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:19,858
Haru...

1450
01:12:21,983 --> 01:12:24,233
Makoto, be Makoto!

1451
01:12:24,317 --> 01:12:25,442
[gasps]

1452
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:47,442
I should be myself.

1453
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:48,525
You should.

1454
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:51,942
[MAKOTO]
Haru! Come with me, right now!

1455
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:53,067
Let's go, hurry!

1456
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:54,608
[HARUKA]
Hey!

1457
01:13:52,317 --> 01:13:53,692
[sighs]

1458
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:55,483
This is nice.

1459
01:14:02,608 --> 01:14:03,942
[MAKOTO]
It's funny.

1460
01:14:04,025 --> 01:14:07,317
I thought I'd be different once
I started middle school.

1461
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,400
I thought that I
wanted to change,

1462
01:14:09,483 --> 01:14:11,317
then I started freakin' out.

1463
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,733
It was like I suddenly
had no choice anymore.

1464
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,400
Nao didn't help, either.

1465
01:14:16,483 --> 01:14:18,775
He asked me one day if I
actually liked swimming.

1466
01:14:18,858 --> 01:14:20,358
He wanted to know
if the only reason

1467
01:14:20,442 --> 01:14:23,233
I was in swim club
was because of you.

1468
01:14:23,317 --> 01:14:24,692
Really?

1469
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:28,358
So, once I started
thinking about it,

1470
01:14:28,442 --> 01:14:29,608
it kinda messed with me.

1471
01:14:29,692 --> 01:14:31,817
I couldn't tell if I
still liked swimming.

1472
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,942
Maybe I was only there because
I wanted to be with you.

1473
01:14:36,025 --> 01:14:37,692
Is that why you
kept avoiding me?

1474
01:14:37,775 --> 01:14:40,608
I wasn't avoiding you,
not on purpose.

1475
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:42,525
I dunno, it's just
that I wasn't sure

1476
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:45,108
I could figure it out
if you were there, too.

1477
01:14:45,192 --> 01:14:47,317
It was confusing.

1478
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,233
To you, though, it seemed
like I didn't want you around.

1479
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:54,275
I did. Sorry.

1480
01:14:55,567 --> 01:14:56,608
No big deal.

1481
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,608
Guess, I was wrong, too.

1482
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,317
[HARUKA] So, then,
did you find your answer?

1483
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,942
[MAKOTO]
I think it's both.

1484
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:06,317
[HARUKA]
"Both"?

1485
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,192
[MAKOTO] Mm-hm. I didn't
know how I felt for a while,

1486
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:11,608
so I wound up trying too hard.

1487
01:15:11,692 --> 01:15:15,358
But I think I can start
having fun again now.

1488
01:15:15,442 --> 01:15:18,150
Even just swimming around
like this feels good.

1489
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:19,775
Being in the water
really helps out.

1490
01:15:19,858 --> 01:15:22,150
I feel better about everything.

1491
01:15:23,858 --> 01:15:27,692
The truth is...
I really do like to swim.

1492
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:30,692
But I realized. I want
you to be there, too.

1493
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:32,067
[gasps]

1494
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,067
I do.

1495
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,150
I love swimming,
and I love Haruka,

1496
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:44,483
so, let's swim together!

1497
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:48,233
[gasping]

1498
01:15:48,317 --> 01:15:49,275
[MAKOTO laughs]

1499
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:07,608
Stop saying my
whole first name.

1500
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:08,900
Right. Haru.

1501
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:10,067
Yes.

1502
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,233
Also, um.

1503
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,525
[MAKOTO]
Hm?

1504
01:16:12,608 --> 01:16:14,983
Don't be silly, of course
I'll swim with you.

1505
01:16:17,817 --> 01:16:18,900
[HARUKA]
We should probably go home.

1506
01:16:18,983 --> 01:16:21,817
[MAKOTO laughs]
Well, wait for me!

1507
01:16:24,567 --> 01:16:26,733
[gasping]

1508
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:29,692
[MAKOTO]
Nao, sir.

1509
01:16:31,275 --> 01:16:32,233
[NAO]
What's up?

1510
01:16:33,442 --> 01:16:35,358
[NAO]
What did you want to tell me?

1511
01:16:35,442 --> 01:16:36,442
[MAKOTO]
Just that.

1512
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:39,108
Yes, I like how Haru swims.

1513
01:16:39,192 --> 01:16:42,567
And I can't deny swimming
because Haru was there.

1514
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:47,108
Except, when we lost the relay,
it really bothered me.

1515
01:16:49,858 --> 01:16:52,567
[MAKOTO]
I like it. I like swimming.

1516
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,817
That's why...

1517
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,817
Why I'm ready to
do what it takes.

1518
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,692
I wanna win the relay!

1519
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,317
Got it.

1520
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,525
I just needed to say that.

1521
01:17:04,608 --> 01:17:08,150
I have a feeling you'll
win the next one.

1522
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:09,317
Thanks!

1523
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,525
[clock chimes]

1524
01:17:13,192 --> 01:17:15,567
[MAKOTO] Hey guys.
You ready for practice?

1525
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,733
Makoto?

1526
01:17:16,817 --> 01:17:17,983
What are you doing here?
You don't normally

1527
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:18,983
come in our class.

1528
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,525
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, I just felt like it.

1529
01:17:20,608 --> 01:17:22,192
[ASAHI]
Mm? Fine with me.

1530
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:25,067
Hey, Ikuya, we're
gonna go practice!

1531
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:27,400
[IKUYA]
I'm not goin'.

1532
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:28,858
Ikuya?

1533
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:31,108
Why are you being so stupid?
We need to practice, bad!

1534
01:17:31,192 --> 01:17:33,692
How else will we get
revenge on Sano?

1535
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:37,442
[IKUYA]
Not my problem.

1536
01:17:37,525 --> 01:17:39,817
I'm quitting the swim club.

1537
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,067
[gasps] What are you
even talking about?!

1538
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:44,067
Stop screwing around!

1539
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,025
[MAKOTO]
What happened?

1540
01:17:46,108 --> 01:17:48,483
Listen, your joke?! It sucks!

1541
01:17:48,567 --> 01:17:51,775
Back off! This isn't some joke!

1542
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,608
Hey! Ikuya, wait!

1543
01:17:54,692 --> 01:17:58,233
Guys, hold up, please!
Come with me, right now.

1544
01:17:58,317 --> 01:17:59,608
Again...?

1545
01:18:00,317 --> 01:18:03,400
[IKUYA panting]

1546
01:18:06,108 --> 01:18:08,858
[ASAHI]
Don't do it! Ikuya, no!

1547
01:18:08,942 --> 01:18:10,775
[IKUYA grunting]

1548
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:14,025
[IKUYA]
Ow, that hurts!

1549
01:18:14,108 --> 01:18:15,733
What do you think you're
doing, you idiot?!

1550
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:18,858
C'mon, you can't kill yourself
just because you lost one time!

1551
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:21,150
No! That's not it!
You're the idiot.

1552
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:23,150
I wasn't gonna kill myself.

1553
01:18:23,233 --> 01:18:27,317
You're such a weirdo.
Get off, jeez.

1554
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,692
[panting]

1555
01:18:31,692 --> 01:18:34,233
[IKUYA] What is this?
Why did you all follow me?

1556
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:36,442
Why do you think we followed
you, we're worried!

1557
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:37,942
[gasps]

1558
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,567
About what?

1559
01:18:41,608 --> 01:18:42,567
About you.

1560
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:43,900
After all, we're a team.

1561
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:45,233
[gasps]

1562
01:18:48,775 --> 01:18:54,108
Hold on. You were heading
to that swim club, huh?

1563
01:18:54,192 --> 01:18:57,650
It's the one where my brother
and I were members.

1564
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,567
We always said we'd compete
internationally together.

1565
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,817
We worked hard, too.

1566
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,608
But the second he
started middle school,

1567
01:19:04,692 --> 01:19:07,608
something changed.
He pushed me away.

1568
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:09,233
When I asked him why,
he just told me

1569
01:19:09,317 --> 01:19:13,192
to expand my horizons and
make new friends.

1570
01:19:13,275 --> 01:19:16,608
I'm so angry and I
can't forgive him.

1571
01:19:16,692 --> 01:19:19,817
What kind of person treats
his own brother that way?

1572
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,483
I don't think he
meant to be mean.

1573
01:19:21,567 --> 01:19:23,900
Sounds to me as if he wanted
you to be more independent

1574
01:19:23,983 --> 01:19:26,567
so you could do all that
stuff on your own.

1575
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:27,817
You know what else.

1576
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,317
I bet he misses you.

1577
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,942
As a big brother, I get it.

1578
01:19:33,025 --> 01:19:36,650
I talked to Natsuya a bit, and
he's just worried about you.

1579
01:19:36,733 --> 01:19:40,192
It really bothers him
that you hate him.

1580
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:43,150
Sounded lonely to me.

1581
01:19:43,233 --> 01:19:45,567
It's okay. Big brothers
and little brothers

1582
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:48,358
don't have to get along
every second, right?

1583
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:53,608
But now, you don't
have to be alone.

1584
01:19:53,692 --> 01:19:55,275
[IKUYA] I always thought
things would be fine

1585
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:57,733
as long as he was there.

1586
01:19:57,817 --> 01:19:59,858
I didn't need anyone else.

1587
01:19:59,942 --> 01:20:02,400
Like, I didn't need teammates,

1588
01:20:02,483 --> 01:20:06,108
and I didn't need any
friends that weren't him.

1589
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:07,900
When he left,

1590
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:12,150
I decided to stay with the club,
but I swam by myself.

1591
01:20:12,233 --> 01:20:16,525
[IKUYA cries]
It was awful.

1592
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:18,983
I was so lonely.

1593
01:20:19,067 --> 01:20:21,067
You were lonely.

1594
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,650
[IKUYA] I thought if
I could be like Haru,

1595
01:20:23,733 --> 01:20:26,983
then maybe my brother would
pay attention to me again.

1596
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:30,150
[MAKOTO] Oh, so that's why
you were copying him.

1597
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:31,733
[ASAHI]
And you call me stupid.

1598
01:20:31,817 --> 01:20:35,192
You're fast enough without
having to do stuff like that.

1599
01:20:35,275 --> 01:20:37,067
And, trust me,
I'm sure Natsuya knows.

1600
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:38,650
How could he not?

1601
01:20:40,317 --> 01:20:42,483
Right? Haru?

1602
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:47,317
Was I...

1603
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,733
Was I lonely, too?

1604
01:20:49,817 --> 01:20:51,483
Huh? Say what?

1605
01:20:53,442 --> 01:20:54,567
Ikuya.

1606
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,567
You're not me, and that's okay.

1607
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:59,525
You don't belong in my shadow,
or in Natsuya's either.

1608
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:02,108
So, line up next
to the rest of us.

1609
01:21:08,108 --> 01:21:12,108
[cries]

1610
01:21:13,983 --> 01:21:18,108
Uh! Uh! Wait. I think
I have a towel.

1611
01:21:18,192 --> 01:21:19,608
Crap! Here!

1612
01:21:19,692 --> 01:21:21,067
Use this!

1613
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:25,192
Huh? I'm not gonna use
your disgusting shirt.

1614
01:21:25,275 --> 01:21:27,525
[gasps] Shut up! It's clean.

1615
01:21:27,608 --> 01:21:29,942
I wash this thing every
single day, so use it!

1616
01:21:30,025 --> 01:21:31,150
Hm?

1617
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:33,442
[sniffles]

1618
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:37,192
[laughing]

1619
01:21:39,692 --> 01:21:43,233
Yeah! Let's go to
practice! Woo!

1620
01:21:43,317 --> 01:21:45,608
Right. Let's go.

1621
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:48,317
[ASAHI laughs]
Swim club, swim club.

1622
01:21:51,192 --> 01:21:52,650
Yeah!

1623
01:21:56,275 --> 01:22:00,567
[inhales, exhales]

1624
01:22:05,692 --> 01:22:07,775
[FIRST YEARS]
We're sorry, sir!

1625
01:22:07,858 --> 01:22:09,983
[NATSUYA] You guys have a lot
of nerve skipping practice.

1626
01:22:10,067 --> 01:22:11,608
[IKUYA]
It's my fault.

1627
01:22:11,692 --> 01:22:14,483
I ran out of school earlier, and
everyone else only came after me

1628
01:22:14,567 --> 01:22:16,400
because they were
worried about me.

1629
01:22:16,483 --> 01:22:19,025
That's the reason we were late.

1630
01:22:19,108 --> 01:22:20,692
I'm very sorry, sir!

1631
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:22,108
[gasps]

1632
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:24,233
[ASAHI] No, I ran off without
thinking about anything!

1633
01:22:24,317 --> 01:22:25,483
I'm very sorry, sir!

1634
01:22:25,567 --> 01:22:27,067
[MAKOTO] And I should've
said something to you

1635
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:30,067
before going after them.
I'm very sorry, sir!

1636
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,400
Guys, what in the world
is wrong with you?

1637
01:22:32,483 --> 01:22:33,942
Did you all get hit in the head?

1638
01:22:34,025 --> 01:22:35,358
[IKUYA]
It's possible.

1639
01:22:35,442 --> 01:22:37,608
I did get tackled by the
stupidest guy in the world, so.

1640
01:22:37,692 --> 01:22:39,192
Hey! Shut up!

1641
01:22:39,275 --> 01:22:41,483
That would never have happened
if you hadn't been so confusing!

1642
01:22:41,567 --> 01:22:43,192
[IKUYA]
Yeah, well, intelligent people

1643
01:22:43,275 --> 01:22:44,150
wouldn't have been confused.

1644
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:45,567
What?! You take that back.

1645
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:47,733
I will, as soon as you
quit being stupid.

1646
01:22:47,817 --> 01:22:49,317
Ikuya. Ahh!

1647
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,983
Stop! Let go of me!

1648
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:52,775
Why are you so weird!

1649
01:22:52,858 --> 01:22:54,483
Get off!

1650
01:22:56,692 --> 01:22:58,858
[IKUYA]
Natsuya, listen.

1651
01:22:58,942 --> 01:23:01,192
I've realized that I've
been letting myself swim

1652
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:03,858
in your shadow for a while.

1653
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:06,067
But, I'm gonna stop it.

1654
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:10,983
And about what you said
that made me so angry.

1655
01:23:11,067 --> 01:23:14,483
I get what you were doing now.

1656
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:15,858
Okay.

1657
01:23:17,442 --> 01:23:20,817
Wait a second.
Why isn't Nao here?

1658
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,525
Yeah. He's uh, well...

1659
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:26,900
Nao, sir!

1660
01:23:26,983 --> 01:23:28,358
Hey, guys.

1661
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:30,317
[ASAHI] What happened, are
you gonna die or something?

1662
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,733
No. I told Natsuya
not to say anything.

1663
01:23:33,817 --> 01:23:36,233
[MAKOTO] Sir, are you
sure you're all right?

1664
01:23:36,317 --> 01:23:38,608
We heard you were
having surgery.

1665
01:23:39,942 --> 01:23:42,317
I am, but it's not something
to freak out about.

1666
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,983
Looks like I'll be able to
leave as soon as it's over.

1667
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:49,650
Why do you need to have surgery?

1668
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,358
Detached retina.

1669
01:23:52,442 --> 01:23:54,400
It randomly started to
get really hard to see

1670
01:23:54,483 --> 01:23:57,442
out of my right eye last fall.
I thought it would eventually

1671
01:23:57,525 --> 01:24:00,192
get better,
so I tried to ignore it.

1672
01:24:00,275 --> 01:24:03,650
Didn't work, and now I
have to have surgery.

1673
01:24:03,733 --> 01:24:05,983
[MAKOTO]
Sir. Will you...

1674
01:24:06,067 --> 01:24:08,733
Uh, when will you be able
to come back to practice?

1675
01:24:08,817 --> 01:24:10,858
[NAO]
I can coach you guys right away.

1676
01:24:10,942 --> 01:24:15,608
But, I will have to take a break
from competing for a while.

1677
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,525
This year, I won't be able
to swim in any races.

1678
01:24:21,608 --> 01:24:22,608
[gasps]

1679
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,733
Oh! Hey, now,

1680
01:24:25,817 --> 01:24:27,900
don't make those faces,
everything will be fine.

1681
01:24:27,983 --> 01:24:30,567
No, I won't be able to
race in anything now.

1682
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:34,025
But I can compete again
when I get to high school!

1683
01:24:34,108 --> 01:24:37,025
So you'll keep swimming?

1684
01:24:37,108 --> 01:24:41,275
I only started because Natsuya
kinda forced me to join, but...

1685
01:24:41,358 --> 01:24:43,900
It turned out I loved to swim.

1686
01:24:46,192 --> 01:24:49,067
Asahi. I remember
when I was first told

1687
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,525
I wouldn't be able to race
for the rest of the year.

1688
01:24:51,608 --> 01:24:53,608
I was depressed for a while.

1689
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:55,442
Once I realized it wasn't
forever, though,

1690
01:24:55,525 --> 01:24:57,150
I got over it pretty fast.

1691
01:24:57,233 --> 01:24:59,358
There was no point
in being impatient.

1692
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:01,650
I know you're gonna swim
freestyle again.

1693
01:25:01,733 --> 01:25:03,233
Don't stress out about it.

1694
01:25:03,317 --> 01:25:05,067
Sometimes, we just have to wait.

1695
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:06,442
Right!

1696
01:25:06,525 --> 01:25:09,108
[NAO] Makoto, you worry
about other people too much.

1697
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:12,483
It's okay to be selfish
every so often. Also...

1698
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:15,483
I have feeling Haruka might
feel you're a little too nosy.

1699
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:17,983
[gasps] Haru! Do you?!

1700
01:25:18,067 --> 01:25:21,317
Ikuya, trust everyone
around you more.

1701
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,358
If you stay inside your shell,
it won't do you any good.

1702
01:25:24,442 --> 01:25:26,608
That's true for swimming
and school.

1703
01:25:26,692 --> 01:25:28,400
Thank you, really.

1704
01:25:28,483 --> 01:25:31,608
But I... I understand now.

1705
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,817
I'm glad.

1706
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,192
Haruka.

1707
01:25:37,275 --> 01:25:38,358
Sir?

1708
01:25:38,442 --> 01:25:40,733
Stick to your convictions,
no matter what.

1709
01:25:40,817 --> 01:25:43,858
You get to swim free in the
relay and individual races.

1710
01:25:43,942 --> 01:25:45,733
Just don't let the past
determine your future.

1711
01:25:45,817 --> 01:25:47,317
[gasps]

1712
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:51,608
All you have to do is that, and
I promise you'll be unbeatable.

1713
01:25:51,692 --> 01:25:52,817
Right.

1714
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:57,192
[NAO] I know this is going
to sound immature,

1715
01:25:57,275 --> 01:26:01,608
and the last thing I want to do
is pressure you guys any more,

1716
01:26:01,692 --> 01:26:03,983
but since I can't swim,

1717
01:26:04,067 --> 01:26:05,900
do you think you can win for me?

Yes, sir!

Oh! Hey, you don't have to yell!

[ASAHI laughs]
We should all run home together!

1721
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,358
--[IKUYA] Why?
--[MAKOTO] What? Run home?

1722

[ASAHI]
I don't know.

1723
01:26:16,692 --> 01:26:18,650
I really feel like moving
my body right now!

1724
01:26:18,733 --> 01:26:20,275
Just think of it like
extra training.

1725
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:21,442
Come on, let's go!

1726

[IKUYA]
Wait, Asahi!

1727
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:24,650
Great, this is why guys
with muscles connected

1728
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:26,108
directly to their brains
are the worst.

1729
01:26:26,192 --> 01:26:28,108
Hey, wait for us!

1730
01:26:28,192 --> 01:26:29,525

Haru, are you okay?!

What's wrong? Do you feel
sick or something?

01:27:09,942 --> 01:27:11,192
Haruka! Can you hear me?

1741
01:27:11,275 --> 01:27:13,483
[HARUKA] I said... stop
calling me Haruka.

1742

Haru!

You've only been eating
mackerel, huh?

1747
01:27:32,692 --> 01:27:34,275
You're in the hospital.

1748
01:27:34,358 --> 01:27:36,983
Apparently, you passed out
from low blood sugar.

1749
01:27:37,067 --> 01:27:38,942
That's what the doctor said.

1750

Wow, low blood sugar?

1751
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:45,442
Haruka, you were supposed
to be eating well.

1752
01:27:45,525 --> 01:27:48,942
Why didn't you tell me
what was going on?

1753
01:27:49,025 --> 01:27:50,150
[HARUKA]
I'm sorry.

[MAKOTO'S MOM]
I was so worried about you.

Who knew? Hm...

1756
01:27:58,025 --> 01:28:00,358
Looks like you're human,
too, huh, Haru?

Oh, good. Look who's awake.

You'll be able to
get out of here

1762
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:09,858
as soon as that IV finishes up.

1763
01:28:09,942 --> 01:28:11,442
Although, you should go home,

1764
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:12,942
take it easy for
the rest of the day.

1767

All right, I'll go take care
of the discharge paperwork

1768
01:28:18,817 --> 01:28:20,483
and then head out
to the grocery store.

home for me, can't you?

have to come with you?

Thanks for letting us in!

You don't mind if I borrow
your kitchen, do you?

Hold on. What for?

1781
01:29:11,233 --> 01:29:13,358
You passed out because you
wouldn't take care of yourself,

1782
01:29:13,442 --> 01:29:14,858
which is a serious problem.

So we are gonna
stay here a while.

we'll make sure

you don't pull that crap again.
How lucky are you, right?

Oh, and your mom said
she'll be back in three days

01:29:25,442 --> 01:29:27,025
and that she's cool
with us staying.

Yeah. He's right, Haru.

1791
01:29:30,858 --> 01:29:32,192
Our parents are
okay with it, too,

1792
01:29:32,275 --> 01:29:34,775
so you're not
getting out of this.

1793
01:29:34,858 --> 01:29:37,483
Just wait in the living
room for us, 'kay?

1794

No one asked me though.

[IKUYA] Asahi, you're in the
way. Would you move?

is with these shapes?

You always hide how
you really feel. Why?

You do, too.

Sorry, what?

1816
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,608
What, who just said that?

1817
01:30:35,692 --> 01:30:38,442
This is coming from the guy who
can't think before anything?

1818
01:30:38,525 --> 01:30:39,775
You're such a child.

from earlier.

You're lying!

1823

I wasn't like that,
and you know it!

1824

[ASAHI] Oh, really?
You weren't like that?

in that stupid voice!

I did not.

01:30:58,108 --> 01:30:59,942
I just watched it happen!
Admit it! You laughed.

1831
01:31:00,025 --> 01:31:01,233
Yep, you did.

1832
01:31:01,317 --> 01:31:02,442
You saw nothing.

1833
01:31:02,525 --> 01:31:03,983
Yes, I did!

1834
01:31:04,067 --> 01:31:06,150
Sometimes, you really can be
the most adorable thing ever,

1835

Haru. Fact.

1836
01:31:07,442 --> 01:31:09,567
Shut up. Can you just eat?

1837
01:31:11,733 --> 01:31:13,817
[ASAHI] It feels like we're
at an overnight school trip.

1838
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,942
[IKUYA] Will you stop talking
and go to sleep. Loud.

1839
01:31:16,025 --> 01:31:18,400
[ASAHI] What a surprise
you're acting like a parent.

1840
01:31:18,483 --> 01:31:20,400
It's not my fault I can't sleep.

1841
01:31:20,483 --> 01:31:22,650
Try harder. We have
school tomorrow.

1842
01:31:22,733 --> 01:31:29,025
[ASAHI] Mm! Yeah, but I really
want to go swimming!

1843
01:31:29,108 --> 01:31:30,858
[IKUYA] Weird,
considering you're usually

1844
01:31:30,942 --> 01:31:32,775
just trying not to drown.

1845
01:31:37,483 --> 01:31:39,108
[ASAHI]
I know, but...

1846
01:31:39,192 --> 01:31:40,942
...I feel back to normal now.

1847
01:31:41,025 --> 01:31:42,067
What?

1848
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,317
[ASAHI]
You see...

1849
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:46,025
The second I saw Haru's
freestyle, I was like,

1850
01:31:46,108 --> 01:31:48,525
there's a guy who's way,
way better than me.

1851
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:52,025
And I felt kinda like I
swallowed my heart.

1852
01:31:52,108 --> 01:31:54,983
I've been thinking about it,
and I know that yeah,

1853
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:57,692
he really is better than me.

1854
01:31:57,775 --> 01:32:00,400
And that's what helped
you get back to normal?

1855
01:32:00,483 --> 01:32:02,733
[ASAHI] No, what helped
was seeing Haru pass out.

1856
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:06,067
I realized, "This guy's just
a regular human, too."

1857
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:08,900
Wasn't that already obvious?

1858
01:32:08,983 --> 01:32:10,358
[laughs]

1859
01:32:11,942 --> 01:32:14,192
[ASAHI] I know now that I let
my own pride get in my way,

1860
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:15,775
but, seeing Haru being,

1861
01:32:15,858 --> 01:32:18,525
well, not perfect did make
me feel a lot better.

1862
01:32:18,608 --> 01:32:22,983
Now, I can accept myself
even if I'm not that good.

1863
01:32:23,067 --> 01:32:25,358
However! I'm not
planning to lie down

1864
01:32:25,442 --> 01:32:27,608
and let you keep beating
me so watch your back!

1865
01:32:27,692 --> 01:32:31,192
I'll catch up with you soon!

1866
01:32:31,275 --> 01:32:32,400
Fine, do what you want.

1867
01:32:32,483 --> 01:32:34,192
Yeah. Just know
you've been warned.

1868
01:32:34,275 --> 01:32:35,567
Good work.

1869
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,067
Nice to know you thought at
least one thing through.

1870
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:38,150
You screwing with me?!

1871
01:32:38,233 --> 01:32:39,442
Calm down.

1872
01:32:39,525 --> 01:32:41,108
You really should be proud
of yourself, though.

1873
01:32:41,192 --> 01:32:43,400
It takes a lot to admit
that stuff, right?

1874
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:46,692
I guess it does, yeah. [gasps]

1875
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:48,858
But you might need to admit
some stuff to yourself

1876
01:32:48,942 --> 01:32:51,775
to get to the root
of this problem.

1877
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:53,108
Oh. That's it.

1878
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:55,733
I think I did what that
one kid was talking about.

1879
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:56,608
What kid?

1880
01:32:56,692 --> 01:32:57,733
This guy from the other day

1881
01:32:57,817 --> 01:32:59,733
who gave me some
advice at the library.

1882
01:32:59,817 --> 01:33:01,942
--What was he like?
--Wore glasses.

1883
01:33:02,025 --> 01:33:03,483
What? Like for real?

1884
01:33:03,567 --> 01:33:05,858
We're supposed to know what
he's like with that information?

1885
01:33:05,942 --> 01:33:07,567
[laughs]

1886
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:12,358
[MAKOTO] When we were
in elementary school,

1887
01:33:12,442 --> 01:33:15,650
Haru and I got to be on this
amazing medley relay team.

1888
01:33:15,733 --> 01:33:17,233
Makoto.

1889
01:33:17,317 --> 01:33:19,483
Iwatobi SC, right?

1890
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:23,733
Yep. Our teammates
were this kid Nagisa,

1891
01:33:23,817 --> 01:33:26,025
and another kid, named Rin.

1892
01:33:26,108 --> 01:33:28,692
His name came up at
the practice swim meet.

1893
01:33:28,775 --> 01:33:31,025
I thought back then that was
the best team I'd compete

1894
01:33:31,108 --> 01:33:34,692
with in my whole life.
And we did win.

1895
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:36,192
But then we graduated,

1896
01:33:36,275 --> 01:33:39,275
and we were suddenly not
together anymore.

1897
01:33:39,358 --> 01:33:41,942
I didn't believe I could be
on a team better than that.

1898
01:33:42,025 --> 01:33:46,275
Which is why I didn't feel too
confident about the relay.

1899
01:33:46,358 --> 01:33:48,442
I mean, this may only be me,

1900
01:33:48,525 --> 01:33:50,608
but it didn't seem like
either you or Haruka

1901
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:52,692
were even tryin' to take
the relay seriously.

1902
01:33:52,775 --> 01:33:57,067
[gasps] Sorry.

1903
01:33:57,150 --> 01:33:58,400
I don't get it.

1904
01:33:58,483 --> 01:33:59,483
[MAKOTO, HARUKA, IKUYA]
Uh?

1905
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:01,233
[ASAHI]
If it was this super great team,

1906
01:34:01,317 --> 01:34:03,942
then why are you being
all negative about it?

1907
01:34:04,025 --> 01:34:06,442
You'd be happy you got
to swim with those guys.

1908
01:34:06,525 --> 01:34:09,192
And it doesn't really matter
if our team isn't as good.

1909
01:34:09,275 --> 01:34:11,900
Um, that's not very fair
to you and Ikuya.

1910
01:34:11,983 --> 01:34:12,942
Why not?

1911
01:34:13,025 --> 01:34:14,483
Don't take this the wrong way,

1912
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:17,483
but I think my team at my
old SC was the best, too.

1913
01:34:17,567 --> 01:34:19,025
Who cares?

1914
01:34:19,108 --> 01:34:21,358
Let's work to make this team
better than all our other teams.

Hey, are you picking
a fight with me?!

1920
01:34:29,983 --> 01:34:32,192
[IKUYA] I used to think I was
fine as long as I could swim

1921
01:34:32,275 --> 01:34:35,275
by myself, that my personal
best was enough.

1922
01:34:35,358 --> 01:34:37,442
Now, though,
all I want to do

1923
01:34:37,525 --> 01:34:40,192
is to swim a medley
relay with you jerks.

And Haruka?

1945
01:36:58,317 --> 01:37:00,858
Before, when I was on
another relay team,

1946
01:37:00,942 --> 01:37:04,317
it was really special to
both Makoto and me.

1947
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,567
That's the reason I didn't
want to swim in a relay

with any other team.

And now?

I believe things have
changed for me a bit.

1951
01:37:13,692 --> 01:37:15,358
Today, I want to swim
a great relay

his start was this time?

[RIN]
Dear Sosuke. How are you?

2060
01:42:37,567 --> 01:42:38,817
I'm all right, I guess.

2061
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:42,983
I think I've finally gotten
used to living here.

2062
01:42:43,067 --> 01:42:45,858
At first, the language barrier
made it really difficult.

2063
01:42:45,942 --> 01:42:48,525
I did my best with
gestures and pictures,

2064
01:42:48,608 --> 01:42:51,025
but no one could understand me.

2065
01:42:51,108 --> 01:42:53,567
Like one day, I drew a
picture of a cherry tree,

2066
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,817
and someone brought me a mop.

2067
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:58,233
I wanted to come home so bad.

2068
01:42:58,317 --> 01:43:01,358
Did you know there are kangaroos
just on the street here?

2069
01:43:01,442 --> 01:43:02,733
I wanted to touch one,

2070
01:43:02,817 --> 01:43:05,650
but I was told not to
because they kick real hard.

2071
01:43:05,733 --> 01:43:09,025
Everyone at the swim club
here is super fast.

2072
01:43:09,108 --> 01:43:11,483
I lose every day.

2073
01:43:11,567 --> 01:43:13,108
I wish I could say
I win all the time,

2074
01:43:13,192 --> 01:43:15,650
but the guys here are
even bigger than Makoto,

2075
01:43:15,733 --> 01:43:18,275
so there's a pretty big
difference in power.

2076
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:20,067
I'm workin' on it, though.

2077
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:23,650
I actually got put in
the slowest class for now.

2078
01:43:23,733 --> 01:43:28,192
I feel frustrated
about it all the time.

2079
01:43:28,275 --> 01:43:30,900
What if I eventually
get used to it?

2080
01:43:30,983 --> 01:43:34,567
What if the things that bother
me so much stop bothering me.

2081
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:37,233
That's a scary thought.

2082
01:43:37,317 --> 01:43:38,942
I'm never gonna give up!

2083
01:43:39,025 --> 01:43:40,567
I will get faster!

2084
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:42,942
I'll swim faster than anyone!

2085
01:43:43,025 --> 01:43:44,900
Hey, remember the relay?

2086
01:43:44,983 --> 01:43:47,817
I'll never forget that team.

2087
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,108
How could I?

2088
01:43:49,192 --> 01:43:51,900
That guy still swims
in front of me.

2089
01:43:51,983 --> 01:43:55,608
All I want...
is to be that fast.

2090
01:43:55,692 --> 01:43:59,608
I just want to hurry up, and
be able to swim like Haru!

I do, too.

2094
01:44:11,942 --> 01:44:14,317
I really do.

01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,733
I want to swim like you.

2096
01:44:16,817 --> 01:44:19,567
[SOSUKE] That letter was
originally addressed to you.

2097
01:44:21,817 --> 01:44:23,358
But I thought it was yours.

2098
01:44:23,442 --> 01:44:25,233
Nope. Look again more closely.

2099
01:44:25,317 --> 01:44:26,400
The part saying "that guy"?

2100
01:44:26,483 --> 01:44:29,108
It used to say "you"
but he erased it.

2101
01:44:29,192 --> 01:44:31,650
It's faint, but it was you.

2102
01:44:31,733 --> 01:44:32,817
[gasps]

2103
01:44:34,275 --> 01:44:36,567
[SOSUKE] Knowing Rin, I'm
sure he wanted to send it,

2104
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:38,192
but got too embarrassed.

2105
01:44:38,275 --> 01:44:40,733
He did spend the time
writing it, though, so,

2106
01:44:40,817 --> 01:44:43,567
he just sent it to me.

2107
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,817
That's Rin, you know?

2108
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,692
When I first read the letter,
it seemed kinda weird.

2109
01:44:50,775 --> 01:44:53,775
I mean, why bother mentioning
Tachibana to me?

2110
01:44:53,858 --> 01:44:55,817
Mostly, the writing
was too one-sided.

2111
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:57,358
Almost like he wrote
that stuff knowing

2112
01:44:57,442 --> 01:45:00,067
he'd never receive
an answer back.

2113
01:45:00,150 --> 01:45:01,817
He knows my personality.

2114
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:04,192
He'd never have written
like that to me.

2115
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,317
You can keep the letter.

2116
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,692
Are you sure?

2117
01:45:08,775 --> 01:45:11,400
Yeah, it's yours, that's
what he wanted anyway.

2118
01:45:11,483 --> 01:45:13,025
I'll win on the individual.

2119
01:45:13,108 --> 01:45:14,233
