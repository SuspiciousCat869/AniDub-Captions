1
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,903
Some mornings,

2
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,379
I wake up crying without knowing why.

3
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,563
That sort of thing happens now and again.

4
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,650
Whatever the dream was I had,

5
00:01:04,116 --> 00:01:05,650
I can never remember it.

6
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:06,834
But...

7
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:08,481
But...

8
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,967
The only thing that does last when I wake up.

9
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:13,513
This is a sense of loss

10
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,934
which lingers for a long time afterwards.

11
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:26,049
I'm always searching for something,

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,725
or someone.

13
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:30,964
I've been consumed by this feeling

14
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,160
ever since that day.

15
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,724
The day a star fell.

16
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:39,990
It was almost like...

17
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,332
...like seeing something out of a dream.

18
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:45,165
Nothing more or less...

19
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:48,386
...than a breathtaking view.

20
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:44,661
Taki.

21
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,522
Taki.

22
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,633
Taki.

23
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:51,592
Don't you remember?

24
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,213
My name is...

25
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,002
...Mitsuha!

26
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,577
Sis, what are you doing?

27
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:40,959
Whoa. They're so realistic feeling.

28
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:43,369
"Sis"? Me?

29
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,429
Are you still asleep?

30
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,493
Breakfast time!

31
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:47,551
Hurry up!

32
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,944
Wha...? What?!

33
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:21,989
Do you wanna have any last night's fish, Grandma?

34
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,110
You can eat it.

35
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,040
Morning.

36
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:25,829
Morning.

37
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,555
Lazy butt! You're so slow!

38
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,322
I'll fix breakfast tomorrow.

39
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,674
Oh, that's a lot.

40
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:37,840
Oh, well!

41
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:40,303
You're back to normal today.

42
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,828
You were so crazy yesterday.

43
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:44,661
What do you mean "crazy"?

44
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,234
Attention citizens of Itomori.

45
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,006
Good morning.

46
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:53,560
This is an official announcement from Itomori Town Hall.

47
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:56,458
It is in regards to the mayoral election.

48
00:05:56,886 --> 00:05:59,566
The election will be held on the 20th of next month.

49
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:03,364
The election committee would
like to remind everyone that...

50
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:09,607
A comet that comes only once every 1,200 years

51
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:11,988
will finally be headed our way in a month.

52
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:16,697
The comet will be visible to the naked eye
for several days once it approaches the Earth...

53
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:18,777
Just make up with him already, okay?

54
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:20,023
It's an adult matter.

55
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:24,516
According to JAXA's spokesperson, they're
preparing for The celestial show of the millennium.

56
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,199
We're leaving!

57
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,484
I can't wait till the festival!

58
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,013
It's gonna be so much fun!

59
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:04,823
Study hard, Sis!

60
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:08,489
Ow!

61
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,537
Mitsuha!

62
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,822
Good morning, Saya. Morning, Teshi.

63
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:14,475
Morning.

64
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:16,359
Come on! Would you get off already?

65
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,688
What for, meanie?

66
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,635
'Cause you're heavy.

67
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,510
Hey, that's rude.

68
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,766
You know, I've gotta say, you two make a great couple.

69
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:22,870
No we don't!

70
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,109
Oh, I see you actually bothered to do your hair today.

71
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:29,237
Wait, what?

72
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:32,349
Oh, yeah, what happened? Did your
grandma exorcise all your demons?

73
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,131
Exorcise?

74
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:35,247
Something totally possessed your body.

75
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,270
Would you just give it a rest
with all this occult nonsense?

76
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,925
Mitsuha's gotta be feeling stressed enough as it is,

77
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:41,291
Right?

78
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,915
What're you guys talking about?

79
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:44,415
Are you feeling okay?

80
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:47,519
And above all,

81
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,041
restoring the town's fiscal health so we
can continue our revitalization project!

82
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:55,570
It's only when all these things are achieved

83
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:58,920
that we can create a safe and secure community!

84
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:01,702
As the incumbent, my administration has...

85
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,508
Miyamizu's gonna get another term anyway.

86
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:07,100
I hear he's been doling out the pork, just between us.

87
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,130
Hey, Miyamizu.

88
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:10,364
Morning.

89
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:14,214
Looks like the mayor and the
contractors' kid are pretty cozy too.

90
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:15,591
Ew.

91
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:18,348
...and improve the quality of
life of each and every resident.

92
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,621
Mitsuha!

93
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,800
Stand up straight when you're walking!

94
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,818
Oh, he's tough on his family.

95
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,213
Well, that's the mayor for ya.

96
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:29,357
Awkward.

97
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:30,679
Sucks to be her.

98
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,841
Mitsuha.

99
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,779
In front of everyone...

100
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:53,075
"Two-light" That's the origin of the word "twilight."

101
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,566
I'm sure everyone here knows that word.

102
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:59,371
It's dusk. A time when it's neither day nor night.

103
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,800
When the border between worlds blur,

104
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:04,638
and one might encounter something not human.

105
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,335
Another older term for it is "dusk-light."

106
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,683
Some people also call it "golden hour."

107
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:13,989
What about magic hour?

108
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:15,703
It's something my grandma says.

109
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:19,251
Well, golden hour and magic hour are technically the same.

110
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:22,019
But it's a term that mostly photographers use.

111
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,190
Well, she does take a lot of pictures.

112
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,080
Okay, next, Miyamizu!

113
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:31,642
Uh! Yes!

114
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:35,040
Well, I can see that  you remember your own name today.

115
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:40,294
You don't remember?

116
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,936
Well, believe it or not, you forgot where
your own desk and locker were yesterday.

117
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:48,956
Plus you had the worst case of bed head,
and you didn't have your ribbon on either.

118
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,805
What? No way!

119
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,294
Yeah, it was like you had amnesia or something.

120
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:01,075
Now that you mention it, I do feel
like I've been having weird dreams lately.

121
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:04,020
Like a dream about someone else's life?

122
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:06,821
Ugh... It's all so fuzzy.

123
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,754
Wait a sec. I've got it!

124
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,841
It's memories from a previous life!

125
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:15,531
Or maybe your subconscious linked to the
Everett interpretation of the multiverse!

126
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:16,907
Keep your fool mouth shut!

127
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:20,394
Wait a minute, Teshi! Don't tell me
you're the one who wrote in my notebook!

128
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:23,095
Forget it.

129
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:28,050
But you really were acting just
a little funny yesterday, Mitsuha.

130
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:30,526
You've been feeling okay?

131
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:32,705
That's what's weird.

132
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:34,610
I feel fine.

133
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,252
Maybe it's from stress.

134
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,851
Y'know, you've got that ritual coming soon, don't cha?

135
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:40,856
Aww! Don't remind me!

136
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,157
I can't stand this place anymore.

137
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,457
It's too small and towny.

138
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:49,106
I wanna graduate already and go to Tokyo as soon as I can!

139
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,543
Can't say I blame you.

140
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,504
There really is nothing at all in this town.

141
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,932
There's only one train that stops here every two hours.

142
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,794
And all the store closes at nine o'clock.

143
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:02,697
No bookstores, no dentists.

144
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:05,364
But two cocktail lounges for whatever reason.

145
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:06,468
No jobs in town.

146
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:07,700
No one datable.

147
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,694
Even the days are too short!

148
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:12,627
You know what?!

149
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:13,856
No, what?

150
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:17,604
Forget that stuff. Why don't we go to a café?

151
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:17,965
A café?

152
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:18,839
Really?

153
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:20,430
Where!?

154
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:26,028
Hello, kids.

155
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:26,959
Hi there!

156
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,962
How is this a café?

157
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,009
Like this town's got a café'.

158
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,286
Mitsuha just went straight home.

159
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,267
Things have gotta be really rough for her right now.

160
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,693
She's on center stage and all.

161
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,575
Yeah.

162
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,503
Hey, Teshi.

163
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:54,634
What're you gonna do after you graduate high school?

164
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:56,355
Where'd that come from?

165
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,087
You talking about the future?

166
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,765
I don't know.

167
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:04,675
I think I'll probably just end up living
in this town, you know? Same as ever.

168
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,988
I wanna do what you're doing.

169
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:25,971
It's still too soon for you to try, Yotsuha.

170
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,170
Listen to the thread's voice.

171
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:31,463
When you twine it round and round like this,

172
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:34,801
feelings will start flowing between you and the thread.

173
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,574
It's not like threads talk.

174
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:39,406
She's telling you to focus.

175
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:45,386
Etched within our braided cords is a
thousand years' worth of Itomori's history.

176
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:49,490
Listen, something happened 200 years ago.

177
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:51,078
Here she goes.

178
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:55,477
The bathroom of sandal maker
Mayugoro Yamazaki caught on fire,

179
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:57,875
and this whole area burned down.

180
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:01,118
The shrine and old documents were destroyed.

181
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,415
This is known as...

182
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,082
Mayugoro's Great Fire.

183
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,340
They named the fire after him?

184
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:09,175
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

185
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:14,120
The meaning behind our festivals was lost because of that.

186
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:16,294
Only the surface was left.

187
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,873
But even if those words are
gone, the tradition shouldn't fade.

188
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:25,230
That's the Miyamizu Shrine's duty, our important task.

189
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:31,808
Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine...

190
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:37,433
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving
this house were bad enough, but politics?

191
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,356
Oh! He's hopeless.

192
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,167
Have another, Mr. Foreman.

193
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,477
The site we've got is a tricky one, that's for sure.

194
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:45,730
Whoa!

195
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:48,363
I'll be counting on your help again for this election.

196
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,478
Leave it to me.

197
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:53,390
You'll get the votes from the Kadoiri
and Sakagami districts, guaranteed.

198
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:54,663
How's the dating scene?

199
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,165
It ain’t easy, that's for sure!

200
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,347
Smells like corruption in there.

201
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:02,253
What're you talking about?

202
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:04,977
We're gonna need two or three more bottles.

203
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:05,943
Yes, dear.

204
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:09,229
Katsuhiko, you're gonna help out at the site this weekend.

205
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,135
We'll be using explosives, so you better study up.

206
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,544
What was that?

207
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,480
Got it!

208
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,840
Guess we both can't stand things here.

209
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,833
Is that Yotsuha?

210
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,112
She's all grown up.

211
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:55,041
They're lookers all right, just like their mother.

212
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:57,306
Hey-a.

213
00:14:57,988 --> 00:14:58,748
Hey.

214
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:33,565
World's oldest kind of saké.

215
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:39,577
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and then
letting it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol.

216
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,190
<i>Kuchikamizake.</i>

217
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,871
Do the gods really appreciate that?

218
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:44,913
The way it's...

219
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:46,193
Yeah! Of course they do!

220
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:50,838
Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu.

221
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:58,474
Uh! I'd never do that!

222
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,682
And in front of everybody.

223
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,177
Embarrassing, right?

224
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,218
You should try to cheer up, Sis.

225
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:21,901
Who cares if a few of the kids
from your school saw all that?

226
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:24,644
It must be nice for you, not being a teenager.

227
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:26,399
Hey, I know,

228
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,849
you should just sell <i>kuchikamizake</i> and move to Tokyo.

229
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:34,565
I bet you could sell it with all sorts
of stuff, like photos and making-of videos.

230
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:38,319
Oh! And then you could call it "Shrine Maiden Saké."

231
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:39,955
You'll make butt-loads!

232
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,479
I can't! There are liquor laws!

233
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,959
That's what you have a problem with?

234
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,169
I hate this town!

235
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:00,218
I hate this life too!

236
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:03,874
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!

237
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:10,679
What a jackass.

238
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:43,142
Ouch...

239
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:53,952
Where?

240
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,195
Something's... there.

241
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,314
Ow!

242
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,934
Taki! You up?

243
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,936
It was your turn to cook breakfast, wasn't it?

244
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,141
Did you sleep in?

245
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,444
Uh. I'm sorry.

246
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,327
Uh, I'm heading out.

247
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,807
Finish the miso.

248
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:37,620
O-Okay.

249
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:40,334
Make sure that you go to school even if you're late.

250
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:41,222
See ya.

251
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:43,519
Have a nice day!

252
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,209
What a strange dream.

253
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:06,346
Huh? It's from... Tsukasa? Who's that?

254
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:17,429
I gotta go pee.

255
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:27,926
Way too real.

256
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,125
I'm in Tokyo!

257
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,013
Where did you get this?

258
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,473
Daikanyama.

259
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,521
Guess who's opening our next gig?

260
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,430
Hey, it's skip club stuff today and catch a movie.

261
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,462
Taki.

262
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,626
Can't believe you got in at noon.

263
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:05,986
Come on, let's grab lunch!

264
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:09,058
You ignored my text too.

265
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:11,044
Uh, Mister Tsukasa?

266
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,193
"Mister"? You don't have to go that far.

267
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:16,729
You got lost?

268
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:17,429
Yeah.

269
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:18,598
Wait a second,

270
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,379
how'd you wind up getting lost on the way to school?

271
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:24,447
Uh, well, a girl...

272
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,086
A girl?

273
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:26,103
Uh, a gal.

274
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:27,930
I mean...

275
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:29,668
A guy!

276
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:33,839
You know, guys just wanna have fun!

277
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:37,822
Every day's a festival when
you're living in Tokyo. As a guy.

278
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:40,695
Hey, you sound funny.

279
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:41,987
And where's your lunch?

280
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,854
Seriously?

281
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:45,349
What is up with you?

282
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,604
We can share something.

283
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,866
Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich.

284
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,683
Yes! Ha, ha!

285
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:54,230
Thank you.

286
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,743
Wanna hit the café later?

287
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,539
Oh, that one? Sure. You in, Taki?

288
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,104
What? What?

289
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:03,621
What!?

290
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:04,685
A café!?

291
00:22:08,138 --> 00:22:10,017
They've got nice timber-work in here.

292
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,333
Yeah, it's pretty intricate.

293
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:13,714
Taki, all set?

294
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:19,058
I could live for a whole month
on what these pancakes cost!

295
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,391
Uh, maybe a decade ago.

296
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,549
Oh, well! It's only a dream!

297
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:34,822
Dreams are great.

298
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,438
What? Oh, no!

299
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,319
I think that I'm late for work!

300
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,199
You've got a shift today?

301
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,907
Guess you'd better get going.

302
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:47,599
Uh, Right.

303
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:51,260
Uh, sorry, but uh...

304
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:55,074
Where exactly do I work?

305
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:04,557
Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting!

306
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:05,053
Three new diners!

307
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:06,751
Table 12! Taki!

308
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:08,019
Got it!

309
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:09,122
Here you go.

310
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:12,538
So the zucchini and tomato salad with a side...

311
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:13,812
We didn't order that.

312
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:14,210
Wha...?

313
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:16,863
Taki! I told you that we were out of truffles!

314
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:18,875
Taki, you've gotta talk louder!

315
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,495
Taki!

316
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,425
When is this nightmare gonna be over?

317
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,986
Waiter. Hey, you!

318
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,392
Uh, yes?

319
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:40,840
See this? Does it look right? A toothpick's in it.

320
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,343
What would've happened if we ate it?

321
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:46,479
It's really lucky I noticed when I did.

322
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:48,582
Do something.

323
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,627
Um... it's just that...

324
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:52,108
Well,

325
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,411
I don't even think we have toothpicks at this...

326
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,024
What?!

327
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,384
Excuse me.

328
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,844
Is everything all right over here?

329
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:01,745
Well...

330
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,020
I'll take care of this.

331
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:06,140
What's wrong with you today?

332
00:24:07,843 --> 00:24:09,456
We truly apologize.

333
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,226
Your meal is on the house tonight.

334
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,167
Why, thank you.

335
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:14,201
You weren't hurt, were you?

336
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:25,724
Um...

337
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:27,281
Okudera...

338
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:28,594
That's "Miss" to you.

339
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,404
Miss Okudera, about before...

340
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,077
We just had some bad luck is all.

341
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:34,035
No, I...

342
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,219
Those guys were definitely scamming us.

343
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:39,505
I handled it according to the manual, but still...

344
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,519
Miss Okudera, your skirt!

345
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:45,391
Are you all right?

346
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,352
Did something happen?

347
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:47,894
Looks like someone cut it.

348
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:49,302
That guy.

349
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,092
What now? Do you remember what he looked like?

350
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:52,533
No...

351
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:54,140
Come with me.

352
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:56,682
Hey, Taki!

353
00:24:57,824 --> 00:24:59,246
Okay, take off your skirt!

354
00:24:59,299 --> 00:24:59,951
What?!

355
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:01,619
I'll-I'll look the other way!

356
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:07,849
Hold on. This won't take long.

357
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,120
All done! Ta-da!

358
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,355
You're really good, Taki!

359
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,311
It's way cuter now!

360
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:23,306
By the way, I wanted to thank you for
all your help with that customer earlier.

361
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:28,754
To be honest, well, I was worried about you.

362
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,442
You aren't that strong, but you're quick to pick a fight.

363
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,844
Heh. I like you better today.

364
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:38,958
You've got a feminine side. Who would've guessed?

365
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:52,950
I gotta say, this dream sure does seem real.

366
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,557
Ah, looks like he keeps a journal.

367
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:05,928
So organized.

368
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:08,417
I wish I lived in Tokyo.

369
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,166
One of her!

370
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:20,928
Unrequited love?

371
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,293
What is this?

372
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,713
Wha...? What?

373
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:14,927
What is going on?

374
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,323
So café today?

375
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,164
Thanks, but I gotta go to work.

376
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,727
Ha! Do you remember where to go?

377
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:28,752
Wait a second, was that you, Tsukasa? Are
you the one that's been messing with my phone?

378
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:32,641
Uh. Never mind. Later.

379
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:35,655
Well, he's back to normal.

380
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,765
I think he was kinda... cute yesterday.

381
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:44,474
What's up?

382
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:46,809
Don't play dumb! What about bro code, huh?

383
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,731
You walked home with her yesterday, right?

384
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:53,951
What're you talking about? Me and Miss Okudera?

385
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,373
So what did you guys do?

386
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:58,985
Uh, well, I don't remember actually.

387
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,617
Quit messing around and tell us!

388
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:03,058
Okudera, reporting for duty!

389
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,601
Don't slack off today, you guys.

390
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:06,292
Yeah.

391
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,793
We're gonna have a good day today.

392
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,382
Aren't we, Taki?

393
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,815
I see you're not touching your boobies today.

394
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:29,226
Breakfast time!

395
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,530
Hurry up!

396
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:34,995
My boobs?

397
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,644
Morning.

398
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:48,075
I feel like everyone's staring at me for some reason.

399
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,197
Well, ya did kinda make a scene yesterday.

400
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:51,875
Huh?

401
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:56,423
Did you see all the election posters?

402
00:28:56,512 --> 00:29:00,178
Doesn't matter who wins, nothing will
change. Except for who gets the gift bag.

403
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,863
Shh! Somebody's daddy's depending on it.

404
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,216
They're talking about me, right?

405
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:10,403
Wait! Mitsuha?

406
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:22,770
I... I...

407
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:24,772
I did what?

408
00:29:27,623 --> 00:29:28,435
Mitsuha?

409
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:38,739
Could this...? Could this mean...?

410
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:40,540
No, no, no, no!

411
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,197
Could this mean... that we're really...?

412
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,314
That we're...? In our dreams, that guy and I...

413
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,011
That we're...? In our dreams, that girl and I...

414
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:51,853
We're switching places?!

415
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,572
I'm slowly beginning to get what's going on.

416
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:31,247
Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo.

417
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:36,526
Two or three times a week, I'll
suddenly and randomly switch with Mitsuha,

418
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:38,424
who's somewhere out in the boonies.

419
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,933
The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown.

420
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,242
Any memories I have of the switch

421
00:30:44,402 --> 00:30:46,863
get more and more hazy after I wake up.

422
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:49,847
But there's no doubt that we're switching places.

423
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,830
The reactions of everyone around us prove it.

424
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:54,267
That's why...

425
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,947
That's why we decided to lay out some rules

426
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,069
so we could protect each other's way of life.

427
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,815
Things to watch out for during the switches,

428
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,753
and a list of stuff we should never do.

429
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:08,563
We also agreed to leave each other reports
on our phones on the days we switch places.

430
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:12,846
So that we can work together to get
through this weird thing that's happening.

431
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:15,310
And yet...

432
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:16,747
And yet...

433
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,830
I cannot believe this guy (girl)!

434
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:35,568
Guys'll stare.

435
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,873
Watch the skirt! These are basics for a girl!

436
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,075
Stop wasting my money on sweets!

437
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:47,072
It's going in your body! Plus I also work for that money.

438
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:49,133
Braiding cords is impossible!

439
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:51,076
You work way too many shifts!

440
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:52,705
'Cause you keep wasting money!

441
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,456
Had tea with Miss Okudera on the way home.

442
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:17,416
You two have a good thing going.

443
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,693
Quit messing with my relationships, Mitsuha!

444
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:24,700
Hey, Taki, why's a girl confessing her love to me?

445
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,304
Maybe you're just more popular when I'm you.

446
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:30,410
You're so full of yourself! Like you have a girlfriend.

447
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,182
It's not like you have anyone either!

448
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:32,799
I don't...

449
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:33,553
I don't...

450
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,843
Because I don't want a relationship!

451
00:32:57,444 --> 00:32:58,938
I shouldn't for her sake.

452
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,587
You sure do like your own boobies.

453
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:08,754
Time to go! Get ready!

454
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:15,066
Over the course of the last few days,
the Tia-mat comet has been visible.

455
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,281
But when and where can people see it?

456
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:22,904
The Tia-mat comet will be moving in the same direction
the sun does, from east to west from our point of view.

457
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,188
So right after sunset. As for where...

458
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:27,475
Why're you wearing your uniform?

459
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:41,157
Grandma? Why does our shrine god's
relic have to be kept so far away?

460
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,290
'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know.

461
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,863
Who's Mayugoro?

462
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,072
What? He's famous!

463
00:33:56,011 --> 00:33:57,358
Hop on, Grandma.

464
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:02,941
Oh!

465
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:04,765
Watch out! Careful!

466
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:19,926
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know about Musubi?

467
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:20,919
Musubi?

468
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:26,688
It's what we used to call the local
guardian deity long ago and it means "union."

469
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:29,405
This word has profound meaning.

470
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:32,667
Tying strings together is a union.

471
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,565
Connecting to people is a union.

472
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:38,135
And the flow of time is a union.

473
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:41,897
These are all part of the god's power.

474
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,332
The braided cords that we make are tied to that.

475
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:50,358
A skill from the god, they
represent the flow of time itself.

476
00:34:51,835 --> 00:34:54,081
They assemble and take shape.

477
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,722
They twist, tangle,

478
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:01,187
unravel now and then, break and reconnect.

479
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:05,633
That's what a union is. What time is.

480
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:09,797
Have a drink.

481
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:10,883
Thanks.

482
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:13,756
I want some too!

483
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,681
That's also a union.

484
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:19,988
Whether it's water, rice, or saké,

485
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,735
when something becomes a part of a
person, it's a union, it joins their soul.

486
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:30,472
Which is why the offering we're
making today is such an important custom.

487
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:33,397
It connects the god with people.

488
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:37,299
Hey, I can see it!

489
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:42,182
This is where it is.

490
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:45,436
The sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine.

491
00:36:02,015 --> 00:36:05,292
What lies ahead is the hereafter.

492
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:07,706
It's the netherworld.

493
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,377
The netherworld!

494
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:20,188
In order to return to this world, you have
to leave behind what is most important to you.

495
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:24,924
Like the <i>kuchikamizake</i> .

496
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,705
<i>Kuchikamizake</i> ?

497
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:31,727
You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine god's relic.

498
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:34,478
After all, it is half of you.

499
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:39,019
Half... of Mitsuha.

500
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:58,829
Wow! It's already magic hour!

501
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:01,008
Hm? Magic hour?

502
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:12,504
Oh, yeah!

503
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:14,248
Maybe I can see the comet.

504
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,856
The comet?

505
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:18,628
Oh,

506
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,269
Mitsuha,

507
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:23,974
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

508
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,764
I'm crying?

509
00:37:37,537 --> 00:37:38,465
But why?

510
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:44,810
Miss Okudera?

511
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:47,053
She's almost where?

512
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:50,761
Oh, Mitsuha, what did you do?

513
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:52,809
Date?!

514
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,311
Tomorrow's your Tokyo date with Miss Okudera!

515
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:06,178
Meet up at the station at 10:30!

516
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:10,764
Well, that's what I had planned, but...

517
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,219
Hi, Taki!

518
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:29,063
Wait long?

519
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:31,113
Yeah. Uh, no.

520
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:42,764
I just got here.

521
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:45,078
Thank goodness. Let's go.

522
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:48,635
Must be nice.

523
00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:51,139
They've probably met up about now.

524
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:55,693
Huh?

525
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,790
Why am I...?

526
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:03,503
Why?

527
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,849
It was a date I wanted to go on,

528
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:14,439
but if it so happens you end up going,

529
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,785
you'd better be grateful and enjoy it!

530
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:20,674
This is nice. It's my first time here.

531
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:22,586
So is this one of your usual go-to spots, Taki?

532
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:25,301
At any rate, I bet you've
never even been on a single date.

533
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:26,940
No wait. It's too expensive!

534
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:30,439
I don't know what to say to her.

535
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:35,350
That's why I've hand-picked some links
below to help you out, you wall flower.

536
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:36,108
For real?

537
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,503
She's making fun of me.

538
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:16,220
You know something, Taki?

539
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:20,628
Today you're... you're like a different person.

540
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:31,246
Um, Miss Okudera,

541
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:34,910
You getting hungry? We could get dinner.

542
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:38,286
Uh. Let's call it a day.

543
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:40,968
All right.

544
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:42,781
I could be wrong,

545
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:44,843
and I'm sorry if I am.

546
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:45,694
About?

547
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:49,568
But you used to have a little crush on me, am I right?

548
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:54,207
But right now, there's someone else you like, huh?

549
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:57,937
No. No, it's not that.

550
00:40:58,006 --> 00:40:58,876
Really?

551
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:01,585
There's no one. It's not like that.

552
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,404
Are you sure about that?

553
00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:08,089
Well, thanks for today! See you at work.

554
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,924
By the time the date's over...

555
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:27,829
...you should be able to see the comet in the sky.

556
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,773
What does she mean? Weirdo.

557
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:04,503
Oh, it's you, Teshi.

558
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:06,143
No,

559
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,612
I just didn't feel like going, that's all. I'm fine.

560
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:12,924
What? The festival?

561
00:42:15,802 --> 00:42:17,203
Oh, yeah, the comet.

562
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,467
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

563
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:23,785
Okay, got it. See ya later.

564
00:42:27,368 --> 00:42:31,006
You're just looking forward to
seeing Mitsuha in a yukata, aren'tcha?

565
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,214
I-I am not!

566
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:34,735
I mean, it didn't even cross my mind.

567
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:39,004
Y'know, she sounded kinda down when I talked to her.

568
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:41,122
Maybe she just didn't want a call from ya.

569
00:42:41,147 --> 00:42:42,396
It's not funny!

570
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:43,171
Sorry to keep ya.

571
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:44,033
Oh, she's here!

572
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:44,519
You're late.

573
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,994
Mitsuha, what happened to...?

574
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:52,580
Your hair!

575
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:55,959
I guess... it's weird.

576
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,983
You think it's gotta do with some guy?

577
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:08,450
Like... he broke her heart?

578
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:11,406
Guys always just assume that it has to do with a boy.

579
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,943
She said she felt like cutting it.

580
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:17,761
Ya sure about that? You really think
she felt like cutting off that much of it?

581
00:43:18,751 --> 00:43:20,484
Hey, guys! I can see it!

582
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:40,751
Whoa.

583
00:43:59,488 --> 00:44:03,068
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network

584
00:44:03,093 --> 00:44:04,532
or has been turned off due...

585
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,225
I'll just have to tell her how lousy
the date ended up the next time we switch.

586
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:13,599
That's what I thought.

587
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:15,278
But...

588
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:20,446
For some reason, the switches Mitsuha
and I'd been going through until now...

589
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:23,193
they never happened again.

590
00:46:16,415 --> 00:46:16,870
Wha...?

591
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:20,438
What're...? What're you doing here?

592
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:26,171
Tsukasa told me about it, so here I am.

593
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:31,495
I asked for two things.

594
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,142
To cover my shift, and to back
up my alibi if my dad asked.

595
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,988
Relax, Takagi's gonna take your shift.

596
00:46:37,144 --> 00:46:39,961
Gotcha covered! But you owe me dinner!

597
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,928
So you're all in on it.

598
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:43,862
You've got everyone worried about you.

599
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:44,384
Huh?

600
00:46:44,711 --> 00:46:47,850
We can't ignore this. What if
somebody's trying to pull one over on you?

601
00:46:47,877 --> 00:46:48,863
Like catfish?

602
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:51,407
I mean you met this person online, didn't you?

603
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:53,778
No, not exactly! It's kinda complicated.

604
00:46:53,802 --> 00:46:54,908
Could be from a dating site.

605
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:55,859
She's not!

606
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:59,108
It's because you've been acting awfully fishy lately.

607
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:00,708
So we're keeping an eye on you.

608
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:02,539
I don't need a baby sitter, okay?

609
00:47:04,882 --> 00:47:06,150
The switches stopped.

610
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,935
My calls never connected and texts never went through.

611
00:47:10,135 --> 00:47:12,970
That's why I decided to go see Mitsuha in person.

612
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:16,078
I wanted to see her.

613
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:17,174
But...

614
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:20,314
What?

615
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:22,427
You don't know where she is exactly?

616
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,826
The town's landscape is your only clue?

617
00:47:25,032 --> 00:47:25,811
Yeah.

618
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:30,562
And you can't contact her?

619
00:47:30,808 --> 00:47:32,042
What's that about?

620
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:34,963
Where are we? You're a terrible tour guide.

621
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,115
'Cause I'm not one!

622
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:39,442
Oh, well. Guess we'll help you search.

623
00:47:39,812 --> 00:47:42,392
Ah! It's so cute! Look, Taki!

624
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:44,079
Seriously, guys?

625
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,928
It moved! Aw!

626
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:16,448
This is a lost cause.

627
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:20,323
What? After everything that we've done for you today?

628
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:24,980
You haven't done anything.

629
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,156
One Takayama ramen.

630
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:31,519
One Takayama ramen.

631
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,326
I guess I'll have the same.

632
00:48:33,512 --> 00:48:34,264
Sure.

633
00:48:34,822 --> 00:48:36,139
Three orders of ramen.

634
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:36,819
Got it.

635
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:41,230
Think we can make it back to Tokyo tonight?

636
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:43,378
Well, I think we'll be cutting it close.

637
00:48:43,438 --> 00:48:44,238
Let me take a look.

638
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:45,347
'K, thanks.

639
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:47,556
Wait, Taki, you sure about that?

640
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:54,354
Yeah. I kinda feel like maybe I've been
barking up the wrong tree this whole time.

641
00:48:58,962 --> 00:49:01,595
Hey. That's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it?

642
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:04,918
It's drawn really well.

643
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,158
Come take a look at this, Hun!

644
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,355
Yeah, that's Itomori.

645
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,047
It takes me back.

646
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:14,398
My husband was born and raised there, you know.

647
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:15,727
Itomori?

648
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:20,426
Yes, of course! That's the place!

649
00:49:20,734 --> 00:49:22,148
It's nearby, right?

650
00:49:22,756 --> 00:49:23,712
You don't...

651
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,536
Itomori was...

652
00:49:25,985 --> 00:49:27,313
Itomori?

653
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:28,435
Wait!

654
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:28,861
But that's where...

655
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:30,628
Isn't that the area where that comet...?

656
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:24,021
Hey, is this place really where she's from?

657
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:27,680
No way. Taki must've just
confused this with somewhere else.

658
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:28,949
No, I didn't.

659
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:31,309
This was the place.

660
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,540
This schoolyard. These mountains.

661
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,422
Even this high school here! I remember it all!

662
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:39,138
There's no way you could.

663
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:42,749
You've gotta know about that
disaster three years ago, right?

664
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:45,312
Hundreds of people died.

665
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,115
They died?

666
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,010
Three years ago?

667
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:50,886
It can't be.

668
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,056
There's no way.

669
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,594
I mean,

670
00:50:56,279 --> 00:50:58,214
I still have the memos she wrote.

671
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:17,039
They're fading...

672
00:51:27,727 --> 00:51:31,858
Comet Tia-mat, with an orbital period of 1,200 years,

673
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:35,301
made a close approach to Earth three years ago in October.

674
00:51:36,529 --> 00:51:39,733
Nobody foresaw that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

675
00:51:46,658 --> 00:51:50,147
The fragment that broke off of it
became a meteor and struck Japan.

676
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:55,884
It looks like that day was the
same date as the autumn festival.

677
00:51:56,892 --> 00:51:58,462
The point of impact was here.

678
00:51:59,505 --> 00:52:03,833
At 8:42 p.m. it fell right around where
people were gathered for the festival.

679
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:10,513
Over 500 died.

680
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:13,077
It was a third of the town's population,

681
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,796
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

682
00:52:24,905 --> 00:52:26,151
Teshigawara...

683
00:52:26,745 --> 00:52:27,764
and Sayaka.

684
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:34,097
Huh? That's her?

685
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:36,355
You were wrong. You gotta be.

686
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:39,679
After all, this girl here died three years ago!

687
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:44,670
Just two or three weeks ago she
said that I'd be able to see the comet.

688
00:52:45,604 --> 00:52:46,405
That means...!

689
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:49,075
You're dreaming right now.

690
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:50,152
I...

691
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:50,955
aren't you?

692
00:52:53,156 --> 00:52:53,843
I...

693
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:57,985
What... was I?

694
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:13,199
Sounds lively over there.

695
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:16,579
They only have one room left. I'm really sorry.

696
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,751
It's not a problem.

697
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:20,126
How's Taki?

698
00:53:20,293 --> 00:53:22,533
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

699
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:26,706
He's going through all those newspapers
and magazines at random. Seems obsessive.

700
00:53:31,703 --> 00:53:32,752
What is it?

701
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:34,939
Oh, sorry. You smoke, huh?

702
00:53:35,203 --> 00:53:38,264
Yeah. I did quit at one point.

703
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:41,979
What do you think about what Taki's been saying?

704
00:53:45,529 --> 00:53:47,399
I had feelings for him, you know.

705
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,815
The way he's been recently.

706
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,384
I mean, he was a nice guy before,

707
00:53:52,544 --> 00:53:54,158
but he's even nicer now.

708
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:58,425
Kind of... frantic. It was cute.

709
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:03,378
Although I do think what he's been
telling us is definitely strange sounding.

710
00:54:05,884 --> 00:54:08,807
But in the end, the fact remains that Taki's met someone,

711
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,917
and that someone is the reason he changed.

712
00:54:12,445 --> 00:54:13,948
That much is for sure.

713
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,218
It was all just a dream.

714
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,781
I recognized the landscape

715
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,083
because I unconsciously remembered
the news from three years ago.

716
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:43,436
If it's not that, is she... a ghost?

717
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:44,464
Or...

718
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:48,363
did I just make it up? The whole thing.

719
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,927
What was her name?

720
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:55,884
I can't remember.

721
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,153
Tsukasa said he was gonna go ahead and take a bath.

722
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,389
Miss Okudera.

723
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:04,867
Uh... I, um...

724
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:08,345
I realize I've been saying a lot of strange things.

725
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:11,038
I'm really sorry, and thank you.

726
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,003
Braided cords. Pretty.

727
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,601
That band on your wrist,

728
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,155
that's one, isn't it?

729
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,291
Oh, this thing? Guess so.

730
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,709
Somebody... Someone gave it to me.

731
00:55:33,572 --> 00:55:36,179
I wear it sometimes as kind of a lucky charm.

732
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:40,213
Who was it?

733
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:45,802
It's late. Why don't you go down and take a bath too?

734
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,475
Sure. Wait.

735
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,415
Yeah, someone who makes these.

736
00:55:53,757 --> 00:55:55,424
They once told me something.

737
00:55:55,697 --> 00:55:57,990
The cords represent the flow of time.

738
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:01,735
They twist and tangle, unravel and connect.

739
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,393
And that's what time is.

740
00:56:06,706 --> 00:56:07,961
Maybe if I could...

741
00:56:34,464 --> 00:56:35,215
Taki.

742
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:36,936
Taki.

743
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,216
Taki!

744
00:56:41,173 --> 00:56:42,522
Don't you remember?

745
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,554
Taki...

746
00:57:30,878 --> 00:57:32,836
Eat this bento up there.

747
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,725
Your drawing of Itomori,

748
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:37,958
you did a real good job.

749
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,572
They assemble and take shape.

750
00:58:18,227 --> 00:58:19,634
They twist, tangle,

751
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,446
unravel now and then, break and reconnect.

752
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:26,385
That's what a union is.

753
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:28,800
What time is.

754
00:58:40,189 --> 00:58:41,288
There it is!

755
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:44,890
It's really there.

756
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:48,360
It wasn't a dream.

757
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,804
What lies ahead... is the netherworld.

758
00:59:45,603 --> 00:59:46,937
It's still here.

759
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,902
This was Yotsuha's,

760
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:53,013
and this was mine.

761
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:57,276
This was before the comet.

762
00:59:58,007 --> 01:00:00,067
So when I switched places with her,

763
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,643
it was also three years in the past.

764
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:07,498
Our times got tangled somehow.

765
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,877
This is half of her.

766
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:26,853
Musubi.

767
01:00:28,534 --> 01:00:31,099
If it's true, and time can be unraveled,

768
01:00:32,183 --> 01:00:34,054
just give me one chance.

769
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,033
A comet!

770
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:57,939
Your name's going to be Mitsuha.

771
01:02:04,746 --> 01:02:06,962
Both of you are my treasures.

772
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,456
You're going to be a big sister.

773
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:14,652
I'm so sorry, me dears.

774
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,760
Dad, when is Mommy coming home?

775
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:22,444
I couldn't help her.

776
01:02:22,469 --> 01:02:24,150
Get a hold of yourself!

777
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:25,879
Who cares about the shrine?!

778
01:02:25,904 --> 01:02:27,512
But you're in charge now!

779
01:02:27,537 --> 01:02:29,939
I loved Futaba! Not Miyamizu Shrine.

780
01:02:29,964 --> 01:02:30,992
Get out!

781
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:37,818
Now listen to me, girls, starting today,

782
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,247
you'll be living with Grandma.

783
01:02:44,811 --> 01:02:46,490
Who am I?

784
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:47,665
Who are you?

785
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:49,466
Don't be full of yourself!

786
01:02:49,481 --> 01:02:51,362
Like you have a girlfriend.

787
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:52,600
Must be nice.

788
01:02:52,911 --> 01:02:55,076
They've probably met up about now.

789
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,600
Why am I...?

790
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:59,075
I'm going to Tokyo.

791
01:02:59,111 --> 01:03:01,095
What? Wait, Sis!

792
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:04,370
Grandma.

793
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:06,951
would you mind doing me a favor?

794
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,678
Oh, yeah, the comet.

795
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:13,514
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

796
01:03:14,241 --> 01:03:16,334
Mitsuha! Don't go there!

797
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:21,431
Mitsuha, You've gotta get out
of town before the comet strikes!

798
01:03:24,185 --> 01:03:25,923
Mitsuha, run!

799
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,584
Mitsuha. Mitsuha!

800
01:03:29,746 --> 01:03:32,394
Mitsuha!

801
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:52,451
Mitsuha. She's alive.

802
01:04:03,513 --> 01:04:05,592
Let me guess, you're touching your boo...

803
01:04:08,483 --> 01:04:09,911
Her sister!

804
01:04:12,237 --> 01:04:14,815
Yotsuha!

805
01:04:17,735 --> 01:04:20,030
I think she's finally lost it.

806
01:04:20,197 --> 01:04:23,356
Just for today, I'm gonna head out first.

807
01:04:23,603 --> 01:04:24,639
She's lost it.

808
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:28,722
Really lost it. Totally, totally lost it.

809
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:34,162
For all you star-gazers out there, the comet Tia-mat
has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now.

810
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,055
Tonight it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 p.m.

811
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,297
and be at its maximum brightness
when viewed from the Earth's surface.

812
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,211
It's tonight. There's still time left.

813
01:04:44,174 --> 01:04:45,768
Morning, Mitsuha.

814
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:47,320
What's this?

815
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:51,983
Hold on. You're not Mitsuha, are you?

816
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:53,298
Wait, how did you...?

817
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,639
You already knew?

818
01:04:56,151 --> 01:05:01,992
No, but watching the way you've been
behaving lately stirred some memories up.

819
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:05,342
When I was a young girl,

820
01:05:05,897 --> 01:05:08,515
I had some pretty strange dreams myself.

821
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:11,133
Though it's been so long,

822
01:05:11,163 --> 01:05:15,817
the memories of who I became in those
dreams have pretty much faded at this point.

823
01:05:16,682 --> 01:05:17,621
Faded.

824
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,698
Treasure the experience.

825
01:05:19,805 --> 01:05:22,345
Dreams eventually will fade away.

826
01:05:23,203 --> 01:05:25,708
I went through similar times myself,

827
01:05:26,025 --> 01:05:27,703
and so did your mother.

828
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:32,552
What if... all those dreams
that the Miyamizu people had...

829
01:05:32,905 --> 01:05:34,426
...it had to do with today?

830
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,976
Grandma, you have to listen to me!

831
01:05:38,973 --> 01:05:42,615
Tonight, the comet is going to fall on Itomori.

832
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:44,085
You're all gonna die!

833
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:52,829
"Nobody's gonna believe that"?

834
01:05:53,236 --> 01:05:55,679
I didn't expect that out of Mitsuha's grandma.

835
01:05:56,213 --> 01:05:57,310
It doesn't matter!

836
01:05:57,377 --> 01:05:59,549
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!

837
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:03,788
Mitshua! What happened to...?

838
01:06:05,034 --> 01:06:07,447
What'd you...? Your hair!

839
01:06:07,516 --> 01:06:10,210
Ah, the haircut? Looked better before, huh?

840
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:11,979
No! I-It's good!

841
01:06:12,004 --> 01:06:15,714
Never mind that! If we don't do
something about tonight, we'll all die!

842
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:16,355
What?

843
01:06:18,346 --> 01:06:20,385
It's up to us to save everyone!

844
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,122
Wait! Shouldn't you be in school?

845
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:31,611
Well, we sort of have to save the town, or something.

846
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:34,840
The warning system?

847
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:36,699
Yeah, those speakers all over town.

848
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:43,930
I get it. It could work!

849
01:06:44,264 --> 01:06:45,782
Nice job, Teshi!

850
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,514
Hey, I don't think you should be sitting so close to me.

851
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,887
What's wrong? Uh-oh! You shy?

852
01:06:50,911 --> 01:06:53,779
Would ya quit it? It ain't proper! And you know it!

853
01:06:57,774 --> 01:06:59,044
Such a gentleman!

854
01:07:02,098 --> 01:07:04,516
I bought all the snacks, guys! Here's the change.

855
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:05,878
Sorry for the trouble.

856
01:07:05,903 --> 01:07:07,375
I didn't mind.

857
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,756
We ought be getting paid.

858
01:07:08,781 --> 01:07:09,830
Quit complaining.

859
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:13,364
So? What'd ya come up with?

860
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:15,058
Got an evacuation plan?

861
01:07:18,964 --> 01:07:21,498
A... A... A bomb?!

862
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:26,237
Yeah, we have water gel explosives we
use for construction at our storage site.

863
01:07:26,284 --> 01:07:27,798
And the warning system?

864
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,908
A start up frequency can hijack the
town's warning system pretty easily.

865
01:07:33,048 --> 01:07:36,892
So we can broadcast an evacuation warning
for the whole town right from school!

866
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:39,386
Look, we're outside the disaster area here,

867
01:07:39,664 --> 01:07:42,080
so we'll just make an announcement
to evacuate to the school.

868
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:45,118
It's... It's totally a crime.

869
01:07:45,184 --> 01:07:46,857
You'll be in charge of the broadcast, Saya.

870
01:07:46,892 --> 01:07:47,637
Why me?!

871
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,172
You're in the broadcast club.

872
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,192
And I'll be in charge of the explosives.

873
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:53,062
While I go have a word with the mayor.

874
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:53,447
Why?

875
01:07:53,524 --> 01:07:58,058
'Cause if the evacuation order's not coming
from town hall, then nobody's gonna go anywhere.

876
01:07:58,104 --> 01:08:01,029
But if I talk to the mayor, as
his daughter, I can convince him.

877
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:02,744
It's the perfect plan.

878
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:06,914
Fine, I don't really care one way or the other.

879
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,062
This is just a theory of yours, right?

880
01:08:09,495 --> 01:08:11,557
Uh. Well...

881
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:13,307
Theories can be based on reality!

882
01:08:13,366 --> 01:08:15,872
Like, do you know the story
of how Itomori Lake was formed?

883
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:17,252
It's a crater!

884
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:21,358
That means a meteor hit this area
at least once a thousand years ago!

885
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:23,323
Right! That's why...

886
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:25,312
Nice one, Teshi!

887
01:08:29,323 --> 01:08:31,323
Let's go evacuate the town!

888
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,424
What on earth are you talking about?

889
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:43,317
Like I said, we have to evacuate
everyone in town before tonight or else...

890
01:08:43,342 --> 01:08:44,649
Enough. Shut up!

891
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,446
The comet is going to split in two and strike the town?

892
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,339
Over five hundred will die?

893
01:08:56,928 --> 01:08:59,825
How dare you stand there and spout such nonsense!

894
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:03,076
If you're serious, you must be sick.

895
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,664
I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait.

896
01:09:08,543 --> 01:09:11,900
I'll have a car take you to the
city hospital for an examination.

897
01:09:12,157 --> 01:09:15,395
We will continue this discussion
after you've seen a doctor.

898
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:18,422
You!

899
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,535
You son of a...

900
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:31,042
Mitsuha?

901
01:09:32,677 --> 01:09:33,459
No...

902
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,664
Wait a minute...

903
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,231
Who are you?

904
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:55,029
I'll see you guys at the festival.

905
01:09:55,089 --> 01:09:57,516
We'll meet you at the steps to
the shrine! Don't be late, okay?

906
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:58,324
Bye-bye!

907
01:09:58,395 --> 01:09:58,957
See ya.

908
01:09:58,997 --> 01:09:59,777
Later.

909
01:10:01,652 --> 01:10:02,772
You shouldn't go!

910
01:10:03,402 --> 01:10:05,955
You've gotta leave town! Tell all of your friends!

911
01:10:05,981 --> 01:10:07,407
What's wrong with ya?

912
01:10:07,563 --> 01:10:08,468
Mitsuha!

913
01:10:08,493 --> 01:10:09,387
What was that about?

914
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,629
Come on. Let's go.

915
01:10:10,977 --> 01:10:13,016
What're you doing, huh?

916
01:10:13,704 --> 01:10:15,017
If it was Mitsuha,

917
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:17,692
would she have been able to convince him?

918
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:19,223
Is all this my fault?

919
01:10:19,838 --> 01:10:23,415
Yotsuha! Promise me that you'll
leave town with Grandma before dark!

920
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:24,206
What?

921
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:25,965
You're gonna die if you stay here!

922
01:10:26,011 --> 01:10:27,274
What're you talking about?

923
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:29,876
And why'd you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?

924
01:10:29,908 --> 01:10:32,369
You've been acting really strange lately!

925
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:35,298
Went to Tokyo?

926
01:10:35,426 --> 01:10:37,861
Hey, Mitsuha!

927
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:41,704
How'd it go with your old man?

928
01:10:44,444 --> 01:10:46,127
Hey! Mitsuha!

929
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,260
What's with your sister?

930
01:10:48,528 --> 01:10:49,577
Dunno.

931
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,408
Could she be over there?

932
01:11:02,074 --> 01:11:04,202
What's that? What's over there?

933
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:06,466
Let me use your bike, Teshi.

934
01:11:06,497 --> 01:11:08,876
Hey! Mitsuha!

935
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,240
And what do we do?

936
01:11:11,658 --> 01:11:13,411
Get things ready like we planned!

937
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:15,206
I'm counting on you!

938
01:11:41,946 --> 01:11:43,970
Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again.

939
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:49,502
But what was Taki doing out here?

940
01:11:59,294 --> 01:12:00,214
The town...

941
01:12:00,933 --> 01:12:02,434
It's gone.

942
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,148
So does that mean...

943
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:19,347
...they died?

944
01:12:30,374 --> 01:12:31,261
Taki.

945
01:12:32,107 --> 01:12:33,007
Taki!

946
01:12:35,614 --> 01:12:37,054
Don't you remember?

947
01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:51,885
I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours.

948
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,479
What? Right now?

949
01:12:53,898 --> 01:12:54,794
But why?

950
01:12:55,257 --> 01:12:56,049
For a date.

951
01:12:56,697 --> 01:12:58,647
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

952
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:00,781
I didn't say it was a date for me.

953
01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:03,561
I'll be back tonight.

954
01:13:06,937 --> 01:13:08,324
If I suddenly show up,

955
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:11,741
will it be a nuisance? Or a surprise?

956
01:13:12,478 --> 01:13:14,302
He might not like it if I do.

957
01:13:22,414 --> 01:13:26,424
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network.

958
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:28,365
I guess it won't happen.

959
01:13:29,107 --> 01:13:31,175
But what if it did?

960
01:13:32,048 --> 01:13:35,116
What would I do? Would I annoy him?

961
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:37,351
Would it be awkward?

962
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:41,945
Or maybe... he'd be glad to see me.

963
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:47,397
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network.

964
01:13:48,774 --> 01:13:50,421
I guess we won't meet.

965
01:13:52,443 --> 01:13:52,974
But...

966
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:56,457
...there's one thing I'm certain of.

967
01:13:57,844 --> 01:13:59,280
If we see each other,

968
01:13:59,827 --> 01:14:02,110
we'll definitely know right away.

969
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:05,751
That you were the one who was in me.

970
01:14:07,017 --> 01:14:10,874
And that I was the one who was in you.

971
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:11,538
Sorry.

972
01:14:14,842 --> 01:14:18,676
The train will be arriving
momentarily. Please stand behind the line.

973
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:22,224
When entering the train, please mind the gap.

974
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:44,191
Excuse me.

975
01:14:44,391 --> 01:14:46,830
The doors are now closing.

976
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:20,979
That time three years ago, before I even knew you...

977
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:24,188
Yotsuya. The platform will be on the right.

978
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:25,776
Taki.

979
01:15:27,127 --> 01:15:28,091
Taki.

980
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,078
Taki.

981
01:15:32,513 --> 01:15:34,341
Um, it's me!

982
01:15:37,049 --> 01:15:39,170
Don't you remember?

983
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:41,997
Sorry, who are you?

984
01:15:46,838 --> 01:15:48,001
I-I'm sorry.

985
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:57,308
But he's Taki.

986
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:00,329
What a weird girl.

987
01:16:00,527 --> 01:16:04,604
Yotsuya. Yotsuya. Stand clear of the doors.

988
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:10,114
Hold on!

989
01:16:10,943 --> 01:16:12,577
But what's your name?

990
01:16:13,838 --> 01:16:14,739
Mitsuha!

991
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:17,761
My name is... Mitsuha!

992
01:16:24,342 --> 01:16:27,442
Three years ago, you showed up.

993
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:31,302
It was... to see me!

994
01:16:42,872 --> 01:16:43,636
Taki?

995
01:16:53,122 --> 01:16:54,479
Mitsuha!

996
01:16:55,598 --> 01:16:56,350
Taki!?

997
01:17:11,519 --> 01:17:12,892
Mitsuha!

998
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:17,221
You're here, right? Inside my body!

999
01:17:17,735 --> 01:17:18,646
Taki!

1000
01:17:20,044 --> 01:17:21,242
Taki, where are you?

1001
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:23,338
That was Mitsuha.

1002
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:26,230
I can hear her voice, but...

1003
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:29,717
Taki, where are you?

1004
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:31,531
Taki!

1005
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:47,188
Taki, are you...?

1006
01:17:47,854 --> 01:17:49,364
Are you there?

1007
01:18:15,031 --> 01:18:15,959
Magic hour.

1008
01:18:31,108 --> 01:18:31,886
Mitsuha.

1009
01:18:38,828 --> 01:18:39,521
Taki.

1010
01:18:41,018 --> 01:18:41,820
Taki!

1011
01:18:42,749 --> 01:18:44,069
You're really here.

1012
01:18:48,819 --> 01:18:49,967
Taki!

1013
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:51,663
I came all this way to see you.

1014
01:18:52,396 --> 01:18:53,761
Which wasn't easy,

1015
01:18:53,988 --> 01:18:56,130
since you were pretty far away.

1016
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,009
Huh? How is that even...?

1017
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,217
Because back then...

1018
01:19:01,443 --> 01:19:03,803
Well, I drank some of your <i>kuchikamizake</i>.

1019
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,877
You... You drank that?

1020
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:12,598
Stupid pervert!

1021
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:13,239
Wh-What?

1022
01:19:13,455 --> 01:19:14,465
Yeah! That's right!

1023
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,938
You were touching my boobies, weren't you?

1024
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:18,715
Wh...?! H-How do you even...?

1025
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,108
'Cause Yotsuha saw you!

1026
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:24,125
I-I just... I couldn't help
myself! But it was just one time.

1027
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:25,497
Just the one time?

1028
01:19:27,459 --> 01:19:29,872
How many times isn't the issue!

1029
01:19:30,396 --> 01:19:31,346
Sorry.

1030
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,827
Wait, is that...?

1031
01:19:34,617 --> 01:19:38,241
Oh, yeah, it's yours, but you visited before I knew you.

1032
01:19:38,742 --> 01:19:40,277
So I didn't know who you were.

1033
01:19:41,455 --> 01:19:42,228
Here.

1034
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:44,818
I kept it for three years.

1035
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,210
But I think it's time you got it back.

1036
01:19:57,896 --> 01:19:58,856
What do ya think?

1037
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:01,761
Oh, uh, well... It's not bad.

1038
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,454
Oh, you're lying!

1039
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:05,814
Busted.

1040
01:20:05,911 --> 01:20:07,640
Why you gotta be like that?

1041
01:20:22,477 --> 01:20:26,781
Hey, Mitsuha, you still have a lot to do. Listen.

1042
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:28,740
It's coming.

1043
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:31,816
Don't worry. You still have enough time.

1044
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:33,891
I'll do my best.

1045
01:20:35,586 --> 01:20:38,162
It looks like magic hour's almost...

1046
01:20:38,509 --> 01:20:39,191
...over.

1047
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:42,864
Hey, Mitsuha.

1048
01:20:43,265 --> 01:20:45,521
Just so we don't forget things when we wake up.

1049
01:20:50,302 --> 01:20:51,911
Let's write down our names.

1050
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:53,523
Here.

1051
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:06,758
Mitsuha?

1052
01:21:09,709 --> 01:21:11,849
Hey, Mitsuha?

1053
01:21:20,594 --> 01:21:22,138
I was planning to tell you...

1054
01:21:23,823 --> 01:21:25,638
...that wherever you are in the world,

1055
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:28,642
I swear that I'll find you again, no matter what.

1056
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:34,513
Your name... is Mitsuha.

1057
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,230
It'll be okay. I'll remember.

1058
01:21:38,826 --> 01:21:42,863
Mitsuha, Mitsuha, Mitsuha! Your name's Mitsuha!

1059
01:21:43,056 --> 01:21:44,225
Your name is...

1060
01:21:55,492 --> 01:21:56,181
Who

1061
01:21:57,002 --> 01:21:57,913
are you?

1062
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:02,997
And what did I even come here for?

1063
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:06,760
I came... I came all this way to see her!

1064
01:22:07,146 --> 01:22:08,743
I came to save her.

1065
01:22:08,933 --> 01:22:10,646
I wanted her to be alive.

1066
01:22:11,022 --> 01:22:12,404
Who was it again?

1067
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,377
Who?

1068
01:22:13,566 --> 01:22:15,130
Who did I come to see?

1069
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:16,925
Someone precious.

1070
01:22:17,034 --> 01:22:18,845
Someone that I don't wanna forget.

1071
01:22:19,457 --> 01:22:20,788
Someone I shouldn't!

1072
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,601
Who was it?

1073
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:24,212
Who was it?

1074
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,647
Who? Who?

1075
01:22:26,871 --> 01:22:28,153
What's your name?!

1076
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:46,734
Taki. Taki. Taki!

1077
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:50,790
It'll be fine. I'll remember. I'll never forget!

1078
01:22:51,324 --> 01:22:53,296
Taki. Taki!

1079
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:56,516
Your name is Taki!

1080
01:23:11,263 --> 01:23:12,208
Teshi!

1081
01:23:12,703 --> 01:23:13,581
Mitsuha!

1082
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,591
Where the heck have you been?

1083
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,436
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

1084
01:23:17,611 --> 01:23:19,368
Wha...? Who did?

1085
01:23:19,393 --> 01:23:20,134
I did!

1086
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,464
You're gonna have to explain it to me later.

1087
01:23:28,267 --> 01:23:30,884
That thing is going to fall, right? For real?

1088
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:33,332
For real. I saw it with my own eyes!

1089
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:35,379
What? You did, huh?

1090
01:23:35,909 --> 01:23:37,965
Well, I guess it's settled then.

1091
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:41,115
We're both officially criminals.

1092
01:23:42,816 --> 01:23:46,129
What? Do I really have to?

1093
01:23:46,162 --> 01:23:47,859
Once the town's power goes out,

1094
01:23:47,884 --> 01:23:50,070
the emergency generators should kick in right away.

1095
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:52,267
Use the broadcast equipment once it does.

1096
01:23:52,446 --> 01:23:53,741
Don't be scared, Saya.

1097
01:23:53,793 --> 01:23:55,942
And repeat it as many times as you can.

1098
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,435
You can do it!

1099
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:01,656
Aw, nuts. It's do or die!

1100
01:24:07,924 --> 01:24:09,425
Shouldn't it be going off?

1101
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,557
Hell if I know!

1102
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:22,632
What was that?

1103
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,625
That was pretty loud too. Look over there!

1104
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,746
Hey, look! Up there!

1105
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,361
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1106
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:08,413
Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in.

1107
01:25:08,438 --> 01:25:09,860
Did I just hear that right?

1108
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:13,627
Wildfires are possible, as well
as the threat of more explosions.

1109
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:16,557
Residents in the following areas,

1110
01:25:16,752 --> 01:25:20,312
please evacuate to Itomori High School immediately.

1111
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,872
Kadoiri District

1112
01:25:23,477 --> 01:25:24,973
Sakagami District...

1113
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,100
Honey, we should go.

1114
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:27,917
The broadcast isn't coming from us?

1115
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:29,269
Well, who the hell is it then?

1116
01:25:29,294 --> 01:25:31,254
Miyamori District.

1117
01:25:32,129 --> 01:25:33,809
Oyazawa District.

1118
01:25:34,736 --> 01:25:36,221
Let's go, Mitsuha!

1119
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,329
Teshi!

1120
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:49,385
Everyone, run! There's a wildfire!

1121
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,422
Wildfire! Please run!

1122
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:53,032
Get outta here! Run!

1123
01:25:53,057 --> 01:25:55,833
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

1124
01:25:56,324 --> 01:25:59,679
It's not working. We're running outta time! Mitsuha!

1125
01:26:01,305 --> 01:26:02,147
What's wrong?

1126
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,548
What is it?

1127
01:26:05,196 --> 01:26:07,768
I can't remember what his name is anymore!

1128
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:11,358
What is with you?!

1129
01:26:11,434 --> 01:26:13,455
You're the one who started all of this!

1130
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:16,675
We can't evacuate everyone without firefighters!

1131
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:19,595
Get going! You gotta convince your old man!

1132
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:24,042
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1133
01:26:25,749 --> 01:26:28,006
Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in.

1134
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:31,128
Everybody! Get to the high school! Hurry!

1135
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,564
Oh, it's Mitsuha.

1136
01:26:38,455 --> 01:26:40,573
Why would terrorists attack way out here?

1137
01:26:40,598 --> 01:26:41,903
What is Chubu Electric saying?

1138
01:26:41,928 --> 01:26:42,978
They're still checking.

1139
01:26:43,362 --> 01:26:45,659
Any update? No wildfires yet?

1140
01:26:45,852 --> 01:26:47,274
You're sure? Got it.

1141
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:51,439
Make them stop this broadcast immediately!

1142
01:26:51,464 --> 01:26:53,239
Haven't you located its source yet?!

1143
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:56,027
Mayor! The Takayama sensor station just called!

1144
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:58,399
From the high school?

1145
01:26:58,817 --> 01:27:02,041
Once again, residents in the following areas,

1146
01:27:02,103 --> 01:27:04,999
please evacuate to Itomori High... Ah!

1147
01:27:05,024 --> 01:27:06,946
What're you doing? Turn that off!

1148
01:27:09,848 --> 01:27:10,901
They got Saya!

1149
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:11,839
Oh, no!

1150
01:27:15,549 --> 01:27:18,173
What were you thinking, Natori? I swear.

1151
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,295
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1152
01:27:25,377 --> 01:27:28,832
We are currently confirming the reports of the accident.

1153
01:27:29,935 --> 01:27:34,855
We instruct all residents to remain calm
and stay where they are till further notice.

1154
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:36,292
I guess we have to stay put.

1155
01:27:36,749 --> 01:27:37,640
What is going on?

1156
01:27:37,692 --> 01:27:39,152
So stay on standby.

1157
01:27:39,938 --> 01:27:42,710
Come on, they said everyone should evacuate!

1158
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:45,070
The high school's the evacuation center!

1159
01:27:45,095 --> 01:27:46,072
Katsuhiko!

1160
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:52,022
Tell me. What do you think you're doing?

1161
01:27:55,282 --> 01:27:56,460
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1162
01:27:58,049 --> 01:27:59,272
This is the end.

1163
01:28:01,936 --> 01:28:04,897
Oh my god. It's actually splitting apart.

1164
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:18,031
Look at that! The comet has split into two
large parts, and meteors are now falling to earth!

1165
01:28:18,622 --> 01:28:20,780
I don't believe anyone could've predicted this.

1166
01:28:20,805 --> 01:28:23,017
Either way, we have quite the mystical view here.

1167
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,149
So what does the comet's nucleus splitting mean for us?

1168
01:28:26,599 --> 01:28:28,163
The comet's not within the Roche limit,

1169
01:28:28,192 --> 01:28:31,957
so the nucleus itself must've had a
structural weakness for this to happen.

1170
01:28:32,259 --> 01:28:37,304
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart
and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

1171
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:38,682
There were at least 21 fragments then.

1172
01:28:38,707 --> 01:28:39,944
I'm going outside to take a look.

1173
01:28:39,969 --> 01:28:41,225
The fragments will likely burn up

1174
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:44,672
well before reaching the ground, The
probability of a meteor actually landing...

1175
01:28:44,697 --> 01:28:49,109
Scientists were already intently examining
the comet, but never foresaw this development.

1176
01:28:49,188 --> 01:28:50,773
To predict the trajectory...

1177
01:28:50,798 --> 01:28:52,791
As we stand here witnessing this spectacle,

1178
01:28:53,297 --> 01:28:55,984
unassisted and with our bare eyes,

1179
01:28:56,131 --> 01:29:00,299
it strikes me that living in such an
age has never felt more fortunate than now.

1180
01:29:04,273 --> 01:29:07,847
Hey. Who are you?

1181
01:29:11,362 --> 01:29:13,867
Who? Who?

1182
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:16,059
Who is he?

1183
01:29:16,245 --> 01:29:18,155
Someone precious.

1184
01:29:18,545 --> 01:29:20,036
Someone I shouldn't forget.

1185
01:29:20,562 --> 01:29:22,386
Someone I didn't want to!

1186
01:29:23,268 --> 01:29:27,288
Who? Who? Who are you?

1187
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:29,380
What's your name?

1188
01:29:35,499 --> 01:29:36,327
Oh, no.

1189
01:29:56,248 --> 01:29:58,309
So that we don't forget things when we wake up,

1190
01:29:58,965 --> 01:30:00,249
let's write down our names.

1191
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:13,374
"I LOVE YOU"

1192
01:30:28,065 --> 01:30:32,930
Writing this... doesn't help. I won't know your name.

1193
01:30:46,492 --> 01:30:47,457
Dad!

1194
01:30:49,338 --> 01:30:50,031
Mitsuha?

1195
01:30:50,056 --> 01:30:51,081
There you are!

1196
01:30:51,366 --> 01:30:52,827
Don't tell me you're back.

1197
01:30:57,325 --> 01:31:00,027
It was almost like seeing something out of a dream.

1198
01:31:00,915 --> 01:31:04,352
Nothing more or less than a breathtaking view.

1199
01:32:38,658 --> 01:32:39,831
Why am I here?

1200
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:42,831
What am I doing?

1201
01:32:52,502 --> 01:32:55,616
Next is Yoyogi. Yoyogi.

1202
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:11,843
The doors are closing. Please be careful.

1203
01:33:14,937 --> 01:33:17,104
I'm always searching for something.

1204
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:22,393
This feeling has consumed me for some time.

1205
01:33:24,585 --> 01:33:26,545
The reason I applied for this position...

1206
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:29,944
The landscapes people live in...
To build a city's landscape...

1207
01:33:30,099 --> 01:33:32,850
Even Tokyo, it might vanish too one day.

1208
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:35,690
And so, I wanna make landscapes that

1209
01:33:35,975 --> 01:33:37,257
how should I put this?

1210
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,896
That can continue to warm people's hearts.

1211
01:33:42,512 --> 01:33:44,799
That bad? How many does that make it?

1212
01:33:44,902 --> 01:33:46,238
I've stopped counting.

1213
01:33:46,252 --> 01:33:47,737
Doesn't sound too promising.

1214
01:33:47,752 --> 01:33:48,621
Who asked you?

1215
01:33:48,646 --> 01:33:50,314
That suit could be the problem.

1216
01:33:50,332 --> 01:33:51,883
It looks just like yours!

1217
01:33:52,011 --> 01:33:53,387
Well, I have two offers.

1218
01:33:53,412 --> 01:33:54,838
I have eight myself.

1219
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:05,081
Is what I'm searching for... someone? Or somewhere?

1220
01:34:06,291 --> 01:34:08,883
Or am I just searching for the right job?

1221
01:34:09,615 --> 01:34:11,020
I don't even really know.

1222
01:34:12,296 --> 01:34:14,876
Oh, You're job hunting, huh?

1223
01:34:14,901 --> 01:34:16,573
I haven't had much luck though.

1224
01:34:17,386 --> 01:34:19,602
Hey, maybe it's the suit that's killing your chances.

1225
01:34:19,627 --> 01:34:21,345
Does it really look that bad on me?

1226
01:34:26,503 --> 01:34:28,543
So why the sudden call today?

1227
01:34:29,049 --> 01:34:33,529
I was in the area for work and I figured
it had been a while since I saw your face.

1228
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:39,836
Remember that one time when
we went all the way to Itomori?

1229
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:43,375
You were still in high school back then, so it was...

1230
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:45,358
Five years ago.

1231
01:34:45,383 --> 01:34:46,292
That long?

1232
01:34:47,396 --> 01:34:50,204
It seems like... I've forgotten a lot.

1233
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,648
I don't remember all that much either,

1234
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:55,130
about back then.

1235
01:34:56,225 --> 01:34:57,637
Maybe we argued.

1236
01:34:58,352 --> 01:35:00,928
She and Tsukasa went back to Tokyo without me.

1237
01:35:02,324 --> 01:35:04,637
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

1238
01:35:05,818 --> 01:35:07,283
That's about all I remember.

1239
01:35:10,501 --> 01:35:12,448
But at one point in time,

1240
01:35:12,884 --> 01:35:16,781
I found myself strangely drawn to
the incident involving that comet.

1241
01:35:19,705 --> 01:35:22,894
A fragment of the comet destroyed a town in that disaster.

1242
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:27,547
But miraculously, most of the
people living in the town were unhurt.

1243
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:31,649
The town happened to be holding
an emergency drill that day,

1244
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:34,884
and most of its residents were outside the impact zone.

1245
01:35:36,753 --> 01:35:41,105
The sheer luck and coincidence of it
all sparked various conspiracy theories.

1246
01:35:42,542 --> 01:35:44,519
I read a lot of articles about it back then.

1247
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:46,465
I was kind of obsessed.

1248
01:35:47,806 --> 01:35:50,504
But whatever the reason I had for my interest,

1249
01:35:50,809 --> 01:35:52,219
is a mystery to me now.

1250
01:35:54,478 --> 01:35:56,448
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

1251
01:36:00,491 --> 01:36:02,958
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

1252
01:36:04,361 --> 01:36:09,777
I do hope that at some point, you'll find happiness too.

1253
01:36:13,777 --> 01:36:16,019
I feel like I'm always searching.

1254
01:36:16,755 --> 01:36:19,582
For something. Someone.

1255
01:36:31,194 --> 01:36:34,206
I feel like I do wanna go to one more bridal fair.

1256
01:36:34,352 --> 01:36:35,640
They're all the same.

1257
01:36:35,768 --> 01:36:38,103
A Shinto wedding sure sounds nice too.

1258
01:36:38,128 --> 01:36:40,209
You said you wanted to be married in a chapel!

1259
01:36:40,724 --> 01:36:42,195
Oh! That reminds me, Teshi.

1260
01:36:42,555 --> 01:36:45,154
Would ya please shave before the ceremony?

1261
01:36:45,263 --> 01:36:47,051
I'm going on a diet for it, ya know?

1262
01:36:47,441 --> 01:36:49,461
She says as she's eating a cake.

1263
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:51,119
I'll get serious tomorrow.

1264
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:52,979
The landscape of a town that's no longer there.

1265
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:56,880
Why does looking at it make my chest feel so tight?

1266
01:39:17,822 --> 01:39:19,375
I was always searching.

1267
01:39:19,701 --> 01:39:20,707
Searching for...

1268
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:23,248
...someone!

1269
01:40:20,901 --> 01:40:22,079
Excuse me!

1270
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:23,410
Haven't we...?

1271
01:40:24,117 --> 01:40:26,387
Have I met you somewhere?

1272
01:40:35,332 --> 01:40:36,679
I thought so too!

1273
01:40:41,423 --> 01:40:43,936
Can I ask you... your name?
