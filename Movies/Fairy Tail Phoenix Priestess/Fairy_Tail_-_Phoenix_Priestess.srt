1
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,000
If we wanna find these creeps,

2
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,583
we gotta go up to that old
fortress at the top of the hill.

3
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,416
You're pretty gung-ho
about this one, huh?

4
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,958
You bet!

5
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,916
We've been on a
major hot streak lately,

6
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,958
so this is gonna be
a piece a' cake!

7
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,291
Yeah!

8
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,500
Are you ready to take out
some bad guys, Happy?!

9
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,250
Aye, sir!

10
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:45,541
♪ opening song ♪

11
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,750
So these clowns call
themselves what, again?

12
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,500
The gang's called
the Bacchus Bandits,

13
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,291
but the real target is
their leader, Geese!

14
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,333
The job was posted
by the mayor himself,

15
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,666
so the reward is gonna be huge!!

16
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,083
Wow Lucy, you get
the craziest look

17
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,791
on your face when
you start talking about money.

18
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,375
Shut it, fleabag!

19
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,458
Let's keep our focus
on the task at hand!

20
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,875
Hey, Erza?

21
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,375
Yes, what is it?

22
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,625
I don't know, but...

23
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,500
...doesn't this place
seem too quiet?

24
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,791
Well, It was quiet.

25
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,750
Sorry, punks, but you came
to the wrong part a' town!

26
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
And you got here just
when we were lookin'

27
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,250
for somethin' to
feed the sharks!

28
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,375
These jerks know how
to get me fired up!

29
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,333
Don't forget,
we're here for their boss.

30
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,416
He's the target...

31
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,666
We have to capture him if

32
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,541
we want the reward,
Is everybody clear?

33
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,041
We're gonna get some money!
We're gonna get some cash!

34
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:10,833
We're gonna get some money!
Let's get this over, fast!

35
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,250
Yup, she's lost her mind.

36
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,083
Let's get 'em!

37
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,125
Spread out!

38
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,291
Natsu's your partner,
you know...

39
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,250
Shouldn't you be
following him instead?!

40
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,916
I just gotta make
sure somebody's looking

41
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,666
out for you beautiful ladies.

42
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,875
Wanna share a fish with me?

43
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,625
Definitely not!

44
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,333
And we "ladies" can take
care of ourselves, thank you!

45
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,250
All right!
You asked for it!

46
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:40,041
Sky Dragon...
Roar!

47
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,916
I'm sorry for
bothering you, Wendy!!

48
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,833
Whoopsie!

49
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,166
Get back here!

50
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,750
The sharks are
gettin' hungry, are they?

51
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,416
Well then, I'm gonna grill
somethin' up real good for 'em!

52
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,041
Fire Dragon!

53
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,333
Roar!!

54
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,958
What did I do?

55
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,333
Crap!
Sorry, Happy!

56
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,791
If you know what's good for you,

57
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,500
you'll hand over
Geese this instant!

58
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,708
You're crazy if ya think we're
gonna rat out our boss, lady!

59
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,083
Quite admirable.

60
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,375
Seems you have
some honor after all.

61
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:36,083
In that case, prepare
yourselves for battle now!

62
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,791
What the hell'd she do?!

63
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,041
Take her down!

64
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,333
Now then...
where can I find Geese?

65
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,958
My mistake...
It seems I overdid it.

66
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,875
There we go!

67
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,875
Snack time!

68
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,375
Fire Dragon Wing Attack!

69
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,791
Which one of you losers
goes by the name Geese?!

70
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:24,875
Put some clothes on!

71
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,416
Lance!

72
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,375
These guys don't know
when to quit do they?!

73
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,875
Ice Make: Floor!

74
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,375
Now...
Where's Geese?

75
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,250
Who's talkin'?

76
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,541
So cold...!

77
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,375
You wanna play, huh?!

78
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,583
--Hot! Hot! Cold!
--Yeah, I'll play with ya!

79
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,041
I don't want him!

80
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,916
Neither do I!

81
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,750
That's enough!

82
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,250
That's what he gets for turning
me into barbeque earlier...

83
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,833
Score one for karma.

84
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,500
Now, do you wanna tell me
where Geese is hiding...?

85
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,833
Or do you wanna tell
it to the raging bull?!

86
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,000
Moo!!

87
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,958
I know the lady's got
a totally rockin' body...

88
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,416
But you gotta
give her some room!

89
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,083
I appreciate the help Taurus,
but how the heck

90
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,875
am I supposed to
question them now?

91
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,166
Gotta put you out to pasture.

92
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,291
Oh, boo-hooo!

93
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,791
How about this one?!
Open, Gate of the Lion!

94
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,583
Loke!

95
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,166
I got this.

96
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,708
Don't worry your pretty little
head, Regulus Gatling Impact!

97
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,041
Not what I wanted.

98
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,708
Come on, beautiful.

99
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,916
It only takes two people to have
a meaningful conversation.

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,458
Ya know?

101
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,000
Happy...
Help me.

102
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,416
There's a ton of bad
guys all over the place,

103
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,541
but your tummy is
always your worst enemy.

104
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,458
--Is that him?
--Is that him?

105
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,250
--That's him!
--That's him!

106
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,500
I got this one!

107
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,375
Lucy?!

108
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,291
Yep, I told ya she was gung-ho.

109
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,833
You are not gettin' away!

110
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,708
Sweet!
Right into a dead-end!

111
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,958
Reward money, here I come!

112
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,791
Nuh-uh!

113
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,916
No way!

114
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,833
Hey, no fair!
I need money!

115
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,666
So you're tellin' me, you
idiots managed to wreck my

116
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,958
beautiful town and that Geese
lunatic is still on the loose?!

117
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,541
Yes, sir...
I take responsibility.

118
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,041
He may still be at large,
but his gang has been routed.

119
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,041
I wanted the boss!

120
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,000
And you clods call
yourselves a guild?

121
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,541
You're more like a circus act,
a buncha clowns!

122
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,625
No reward for you!

123
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry, you guys.
This was my fault.

124
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,625
Don't worry!
We're all in this together.

125
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,750
Yeah!

126
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,708
We win or lose as
a team, Right, pal?

127
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,291
And when we arrive back home,

128
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,125
the master will
punish us as a team.

129
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,083
Yeah, we know.

130
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,666
Speaking of...

131
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,875
You...

132
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,458
I was afraid that you
weren't coming back.

133
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,333
I'm sorry...

134
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:16,250
I know, you said
that you'd stay forever.

135
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,958
An unusual amount of magic
power has been detected

136
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,000
in the mountain region
north of Fiore...

137
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,208
An investigation is underway
to determine the source,

138
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,458
but preliminary reports
indicate the blast was

139
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,000
strong enough to obliterate
two mountain peaks.

140
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,375
What's more, we have
reason to believe this was

141
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,250
only a small fraction
of its full power.

142
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:38,916
Our biggest concern--is that its
power rivals that of Zeref.

143
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,791
A troubling thought
to say the least.

144
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,208
Yes, but...

145
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,125
That kind of power could
spell the world's destruction.

146
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,458
At any rate,
we cannot overlook it...

147
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,541
Which is precisely
why I've summoned

148
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,041
the guild masters here...

149
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,708
We need our best
minds working together.

150
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:04,625
A collection of our "best minds"
and biggest blowhards, I'd say.

151
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:08,208
Listen...
Think you can handle this?

152
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,250
Since I like you,

153
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,833
I'll give you my special
loyal customer discount.

154
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,833
All right, Magnolia,
your heroes are back!

155
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,208
I always miss this
place when we go.

156
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,791
Hey, we've been on the road for
a while, so before we go back

157
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,500
to the guild hall I'm 'onna
go home and freshen up...

158
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,625
See you guys in a bit!

159
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,500
Well, she's not
fooling me with that.

160
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,416
Poor Lucy.

161
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,291
She'll be fine...

162
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,666
Lucy's always been a
quick one to bounce back.

163
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,625
We're home!!

164
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,250
--Cheers!
--Cheers!

165
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,958
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

166
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,791
That's a real man for ya!

167
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,708
Yo, Natsu!

168
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,708
Didja get the bad guys or what?

169
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,875
Nope, this one got away!
Just like our reward!

170
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,208
My beloved Gray,
I'm so glad you've returned!

171
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,041
Yeah, good to see ya.

172
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,291
Oh, Gray!

173
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,875
Every time that you're
away, the guild seems

174
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,083
as empty as an
ocean without water.

175
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,875
And it seems he's returned
without that blond bimbo in tow.

176
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,750
You gotta watch
that talkin' to yourself.

177
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,541
Everyone says the
mind's the first thing

178
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,791
to go when you
start gettin' old.

179
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,250
But, I'm not old.

180
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
Is master here?

181
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,958
He got called into some kinda
last minute council meeting.

182
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,166
So it's pro'lly
gonna be a while.

183
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,708
I see...

184
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,333
Well, I'll just do
better next time.

185
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,541
Éclair, are you okay?

186
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,291
Yeah, are you all right?!

187
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:04,666
Oh, please help us!
You gotta help my friend Éclair!

188
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,208
So, it's actually
quite simple...

189
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,416
If I were to take my family's
prized Phoenix Stone,

190
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,125
and then reunite it
with its long missing twin,

191
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,500
something rather
extraordinary will happen.

192
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,583
Now it seems the
twin has been found--

193
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,791
in the hands of
some common girl.

194
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,458
My Principality of Veronica
is soon to celebrate

195
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,541
four hundred years
of existence...

196
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,208
And my wish...

197
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,958
...is to put these sacred stones
together at the ceremony

198
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,250
and dazzle my adoring subjects
with the spectacle to follow.

199
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,041
What better display of
power than to perform

200
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,291
the impossible before
their very eyes?

201
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,208
We will gladly aid you in
this endeavor, Duke Cream.

202
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,583
How?

203
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,416
You have but one task,
I ask your Carbuncle Guild:

204
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,333
Take the stone from that lowly
wretch and bring it to me.

205
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,666
You'll be rewarded handsomely...

206
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,375
See that our 400th
anniversary is a success,

207
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,208
and you'll get 400 million.

208
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,500
400 mill's a lotta Jewel!

209
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,791
Yes, indeed.

210
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,958
And all for snatching
up the stone from a girl

211
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,708
at the behest of the boy duke.

212
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,875
Apparently the child has far
more money than common sense.

213
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,541
I'll take some
of it off his hands.

214
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,625
Go, Chase.

215
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,625
The Phoenix Stone...

216
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,875
We are both the glittering
garnet jewel and

217
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,333
the creature that
lurks in the shadows.

218
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:49,166
And when this is done we
shall be considerably richer.

219
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,916
Here you go.

220
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,333
Thank you.

221
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,916
Maybe she fainted earlier just
because she was hungry?

222
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,125
Who is that girl?

223
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,583
I don't know.

224
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,666
What's with that
big baby bird thing?

225
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,166
I'm not sure, but it
seems like it's her friend.

226
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,583
Looks more like dinner to me!

227
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,416
Don't you dare.

228
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,750
You're very kind.

229
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,000
You should be all fixed up!

230
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,333
Thank you, but I would be
fine with or without the meal.

231
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,416
Huh?

232
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,083
Oh, my word.

233
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,250
Now, now, You know better
than to say things like that!

234
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,375
Please forgive her.

235
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,166
Uh, it's fine, don't worry.

236
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,666
I'm Momon, and this is Éclair.

237
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,291
I took her under my wing
just a couple of years ago!

238
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,375
--You took her in?!
--You took her in?!

239
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,166
My name is Lucy!
It's nice to meet you!

240
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,041
My name's Natsu!

241
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,166
I'm whatcha call
a Dragon Slayer!

242
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,958
Welcome to our guild, Éclair!

243
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,416
And I'm Happy!
Ya wanna bite of fish?

244
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,250
You're all very kind.

245
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,125
Come, Momon.

246
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,750
Right.

247
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,083
Wait!

248
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,291
What's wrong?

249
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,000
You're heading toward a forest.
Watch out...

250
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,666
...great sadness
awaits you there.

251
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,666
A forest?

252
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,958
Within the Boundary Forest.

253
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,625
That's right... Deep within
the Boundary Forest.

254
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,666
That's where it is.

255
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,625
I don't think you
wanna go there.

256
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,166
Come, Momon.

257
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm coming.

258
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,583
Hold on!

259
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,958
Wait a second!
Where are you going?

260
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,708
The Boundary Forest.

261
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,750
But that place is
super dangerous!

262
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,791
Everyone says it's
crawlin' with monsters!

263
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,791
Still, I must go there.

264
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,125
Why?!

265
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,458
I don't know.
It's calling to me...

266
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,125
...and I can't ignore it.

267
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,458
Fine.

268
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,125
We'll go along with
you to keep you safe.

269
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,541
We are wizards, y'know!

270
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,583
I'm not very fond of magic.

271
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,416
Huh?

272
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,375
Now, be nice!

273
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,833
Because magic...

274
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,583
...brings tremendous
sorrow with it.

275
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:09,416
You think--it brings sorrow?

276
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:15,375
Well I know it can bring joy,
so let me come with you!

277
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,833
Yeah, me too!

278
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,583
You're gonna love magic
after seeing what the

279
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,458
two of us can do with it!

280
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,625
Aye!

281
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,708
We shall accompany you as well.

282
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,500
Why not?
We got nothin' else to do.

283
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,666
Awesome!

284
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,541
Well?

285
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,291
It'd be nice to
have some company.

286
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,125
Careful not to
ruin my boots, man!

287
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,125
Hey, Wendy, can't you use
your motion sickness spell?

288
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,750
The more I use it, the less it
works, so I probably shouldn't.

289
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,125
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,708
Just try and bear with it until

291
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,208
we reach the Rose
Garden station.

292
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,625
Why does my tummy
hate me so much?

293
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,833
So Éclair, where do you
come from originally?

294
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,791
I honestly don't know...

295
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,833
I don't have any
clear memories of it.

296
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,125
Oh... Like some
form of amnesia?

297
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,833
Perhaps that's it...

298
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,958
The odd thing is,
what I do remember,

299
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,291
is that I have never
cared much for wizards.

300
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,208
Especially the nosy kind.

301
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,083
Shame on you!

302
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,083
Although she
lacks social graces,

303
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,666
she's a good person at heart,
so forgive her rudeness.

304
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,458
Pointless chatter.

305
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,125
Yeah, she's great.

306
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,750
Whoa!
This place is awesome!

307
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,583
There's magic practically
everywhere you look.

308
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,500
Yo, Happy!
Let's grab some grub!

309
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,458
Aye, sir!

310
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,375
It's chow time!

311
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,791
What a bonehead.

312
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,291
Now...

313
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,125
...we don't need to check in
until later on this evening.

314
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,791
So let's go have some
fun for a little while.

315
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,375
Your room keys?

316
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,083
Yes. Just a
moment, please.

317
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,625
Thank you.

318
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,583
Well, Erza seems like she's in a
way better mood than usual.

319
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,458
I'm pretty sure it has
something to do with

320
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,916
the wedding dress
she bought earlier.

321
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,458
What?!

322
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,375
Problem?

323
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,166
--Uh, nothing!
--Uh, nothing!

324
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,000
I wonder what
the deal is with this girl.

325
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,041
I'm all done in there
if you want the shower.

326
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,916
Éclair...

327
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,458
Listen, I'm sure that
I can get another room

328
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:10,166
if you don't want me
staying in here with you.

329
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,083
I don't mind sharing.

330
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,416
You and I are alike.

331
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,458
We both have the
same look in our eyes.

332
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,083
What do you mean by that?

333
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,458
Your eyes...

334
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:24,541
They serve as a
window into your past.

335
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,000
They tell me you've
known sadness.

336
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,166
I never thought I'd see
that in a magic user.

337
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,500
My eyes...
tell you that?

338
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,333
Momon!

339
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,333
The calm acquiescence
of a captive?

340
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,458
Or the terrifying
thrill of prey?

341
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,000
Choose.

342
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,875
What?! No!

343
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:57,375
I'm not here for you.

344
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,333
Run. Now!

345
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,833
Natsu!

346
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,583
Do you know what this
guy wants from you?

347
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,000
Above us!

348
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,750
Éclair! Lucy!
Are you okay?! Talk to me!

349
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,541
Go forth and seek her
blood, oh blade of mine.

350
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,625
Éclair!

351
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,541
You guys!
Thank god!

352
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,916
You're here!

353
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,958
Who the hell are you?!

354
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:19,958
Knowing will not help you.

355
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:21,958
Get back here!

356
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,208
You stay here and
make sure she's okay!

357
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:24,833
Aye, sir!

358
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,666
Come on!

359
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,916
You bastard!!

360
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:58,833
Come forth my starving claws...
and feed!

361
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:05,583
Aw crap!

362
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,625
Up we go!

363
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:21,916
You're gonna wish that
you'd kept on runnin'.

364
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,791
Fairy Tail, is it?

365
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,750
He disappeared...

366
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,916
So, do you know
why he's after you?

367
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,125
Did this trigger any kind
of memory at least?

368
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,791
Hey!
Is everyone okay?!

369
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,166
What was that about?

370
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,375
I don't know...
Someone's after her.

371
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,208
What?

372
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,916
You feel a breeze out here?

373
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,625
Ooh la la!

374
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,583
Your freaky strippin' habit's

375
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,041
never been contagious
before, has it?

376
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,125
Uh...

377
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,708
If it is, I could think
of worse things.

378
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:07,083
Close your eyes, perverts!

379
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,875
Take this stone.

380
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,291
Travel far,
to the Boundary Forest...

381
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,625
There you will find the
great wizard, Kalard...

382
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:28,916
See that this stone
meets his hands.

383
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,708
I think this must be what
my pursuer was after.

384
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,125
He wanted that stone?

385
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,375
I do sense a peculiar
power emanating from it.

386
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:41,041
This Kalard... the name
is unfamiliar to me.

387
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,041
So what's the deal?

388
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,875
D'ya know what's
special about it?

389
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,750
She told me she has no
memory of its significance...

390
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:50,083
But she's had it for as long
as she can remember.

391
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:53,541
My past is blank, like
an untouched canvas.

392
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,791
Just white nothingness
spreading out.

393
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,291
Nothing to remind me who I am...

394
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,875
...or the reasons
why I keep going...

395
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:06,958
But lately, the image
has been filling in, slowly.

396
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,291
This stone must be
a clue to my past.

397
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,708
I bet this Kalard guy
knows somethin'... 

398
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,916
We gotta go find him and ask.

399
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,500
You don't by any
chance happen to know

400
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,916
where we can find
Kalard, do you?

401
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,958
I do, but I'm not
quite sure who he is...

402
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:23,583
...or if I can still see him...

403
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,458
Even if it's too late,
I must go there.

404
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,916
You certainly didn't
do much "protecting."

405
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,791
Well...

406
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:46,916
Oh, man...

407
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,125
I seriously need
a fish after all that.

408
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,125
He looks so yummy!

409
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,000
You can't be serious!

410
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,000
Open, Gate of the Water Bearer!
Aquarius!

411
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,416
Hey, ugly!

412
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,000
Why dontcha swallow this?!

413
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,333
You've pulled me outta
of some dank holes

414
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,791
before but this one
takes the cake.

415
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,166
You okay, Lucy?

416
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, just peachy.

417
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Someone's set
a monster deterrent.

418
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,958
Although not recently
it would seem.

419
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,458
Does that mean
we're almost there?

420
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,875
Whoa...
He lives here?

421
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,666
There's a great
wizard in this place?

422
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,416
It looks super old.

423
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,416
More like ancient.

424
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,250
Hey...

425
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,541
Look.

426
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,208
This looks more like
the home of a wizard.

427
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,291
You find something?

428
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,625
That's me...

429
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:52,250
A picture from when
I was a small child.

430
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,666
Are you sure?

431
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,875
Get away from it!

432
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,375
Éclair...

433
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,500
So you've come.

434
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:11,916
If this message is, in fact,
reaching your ears, child...

435
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,041
...then what I was
told is indeed true.

436
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,875
Many people came
here searching for you.

437
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,791
Survivors of
Fire Village told me

438
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,583
of the events that transpired.

439
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,833
It brought me great joy
to hear you'd survived.

440
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:29,291
However...
When I think of your fate...

441
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,916
Hold on...
What's he mean by that?

442
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,958
Oh, my darling, sweet Éclair.

443
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,000
The time we shared
together blessed me with the

444
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,833
most precious memories
of my entire life.

445
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,375
Alas, as fate would
have it the people of

446
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,208
Fire Village needed you
to serve as maiden...

447
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:51,000
And I was given the task of
dispelling the Phoenix Stones.

448
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,458
Dispel magic...
Nullification.

449
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:59,500
I have no doubt, that you were
a most spectacular maiden.

450
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:05,250
My Dispel magic was
finally completed,

451
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,875
but I fear I shall never
have the chance to use it.

452
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,166
I've fallen ill.

453
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,208
I will clutch dearly to the
life I have remaining

454
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,791
until you return,
bearing the stone.

455
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:20,125
But if you are seeing this...

456
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:23,166
Oh, Éclair...

457
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,166
He's already gone?
So sad.

458
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,333
I have a simple prayer...

459
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,541
That happiness finds you,
and you find people

460
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,000
that care deeply for you.

461
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:40,041
Darling Éclair.
My dear, beloved daughter.

462
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:44,458
Father?
I'm here...

463
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:02,958
No luck...

464
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,500
We looked through every book
and stack of paper down there,

465
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:07,416
but we couldn't find anything
about his Dispel magic.

466
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,166
I see...

467
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,416
The real issue
is the spell that's

468
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,166
been cast on the Phoenix Stone.

469
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,125
Kalard made a
point of mentioning

470
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,333
his work on trying to
lift it from the stone.

471
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:29,208
That tells me it was
particularly troublesome,

472
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:33,166
and perhaps
particularly malevolent.

473
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,166
I know how you feel.

474
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,708
I lost my father
not too long ago...

475
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:05,166
And I wasn't able to
be there by his side.

476
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,125
He wanted you
to find happiness,

477
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,791
and people who care for you...

478
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:18,375
That was his final wish.

479
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,333
Éclair...

480
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,333
You've found one
of those people in me.

481
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,166
I'd like to make a formal
request of the Fairy Tail guild.

482
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,833
My father spent his final
days trying to rid the

483
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,791
Phoenix Stones of
the curse they carry.

484
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,458
Will you help me to achieve it?

485
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,375
We most gladly accept.

486
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:51,666
It's our pleasure!

487
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,375
Aye, sir!

488
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,791
You have my thanks.

489
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,166
We have paid the wretched
toll of many lost lives,

490
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,875
but the Phoenix
has been sealed away.

491
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,958
The twin Phoenix Stones
are testament to this act.

492
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:09,875
And it is because of them,
that we can have true peace.

493
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,916
Can't say it looks
that dangerous to me.

494
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,875
Maybe breaking the
stone will break the curse.

495
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,000
Now, that's usin' your brain!
Lemme see!

496
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:27,916
Fire Dragon...
Wing Attack!

497
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,041
Natsu, you idiot,
do you seriously call that

498
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,291
"using your brain"?!

499
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,291
It wasn't my idea.

500
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,208
If it were truly
that simple to break,

501
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,791
don't you think Kalard
would've done that?

502
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,625
Real smooth.

503
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,041
The other stone.

504
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,041
Do you happen to know
whatever became of it?

505
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,333
Or where it is now?

506
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:51,750
I'm not certain...
But, I think that...

507
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:57,250
It was stolen in a raid by...
Veronica?

508
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,875
I've heard of that before,
Veronica's the name

509
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,458
of a country that's north
of Fiore, and it's super tiny.

510
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:27,916
Who in the hell are you?! 

511
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,666
We are known as Carbuncle...

512
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,833
The garnet-adorned
beast that's forever

513
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:35,125
lurking in the shadows...

514
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,875
And you may call me Dist!

515
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,416
Natsu!

516
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,625
--Oh, no!
--Stay down!

517
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,458
You bastard!

518
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,458
Yo, pretty boy.

519
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,916
You're just in time for a
hot date with the Cannon.

520
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,500
Say what?!

521
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:02,333
Is this my newest rival for
the love of my darling Gray?

522
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:05,625
You will never win the heart of
my beloved so don't even try!

523
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:08,958
Uhh... You got
the wrong idea, lady!

524
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:10,708
Liar!

525
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:18,666
Those will pass through
me, for I am water!

526
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:25,291
Magic bullets?!

527
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,958
Here comes a real man!

528
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,916
What pitiful excuses
for Take Overs.

529
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,416
Keep Éclair safe.

530
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,625
Yeah, I promise.

531
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,916
This ends now!

532
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,750
It appears that even
Titania knows her place

533
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,625
is to kneel before the
great coordinator!

534
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:56,666
She requips?!

535
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,500
Bow down!

536
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,250
They're too strong.

537
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,333
Hey, Jet, you need to
run and get the master.

538
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,333
But I gotta stay here
and protect Levy!

539
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,625
Just take her somewhere
safe on your way to get him.

540
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:07,541
Oh, yeah.

541
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,625
They may need me here.

542
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,208
There she is.

543
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,041
Éclair!

544
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,916
Lucy!
Momon!

545
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,333
No, please!
Don't take her.

546
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,791
To think this beauty
will endure forevermore.

547
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,333
I wonder how Dist is faring.

548
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,958
I couldn't help her
when she needed me...

549
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:05,750
They took her, and all I
could do was watch it happen.

550
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,708
I gotta--go try and save her.

551
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,625
You will, but you're
too hurt now.

552
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:13,000
Those bastards
destroyed our guildhall

553
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,708
and kidnapped one
of our friends.

554
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,791
They are messin'
with the wrong guild!

555
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,250
They're gonna pay for this!

556
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,041
How unfortunate...

557
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:26,541
They gave us a beating
we won't soon forget.

558
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,625
You're damn right.
So now what?

559
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,666
Whadda we do?

560
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,791
Please forgive me, master.

561
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,000
I wasn't able to
protect the guild for you.

562
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,500
Hey, master.

563
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,583
Did Jet tell you
what happened here?

564
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:42,000
Um, no...
Was he supposed to?

565
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,250
Here I come!
I'll be right there!

566
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,208
There's been some unusual
magic power reported recently.

567
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:52,750
So we investigated it.

568
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:55,208
And we ended up in
this puny little country.

569
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:56,916
It was called Veronica.

570
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,875
Éclair was talkin'
about that place.

571
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,833
She told us she thought
that they were the ones

572
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,791
who had stolen the
other Phoenix Stone.

573
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,875
The guild was
attacked by Carbuncle.

574
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,333
They're mercenaries.

575
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,750
They were hired by
Veronica's Duke Cream.

576
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,041
We overheard them talking
about getting a large amount

577
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,500
of money for abducting
a girl named Éclair.

578
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:16,750
We also heard that
Veronica is throwin'

579
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,625
a 400th birthday
party tomorrow...

580
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:21,500
And this Duke Cream is
gonna make some fireworks--

581
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:24,000
by puttin' the two
Phoenix Stones together.

582
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,500
What'll that do?

583
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,708
There happens to be an ancient
legend about those stones.

584
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,583
It says that when
the two become one,

585
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:34,750
the fiery Phoenix will spring
forth from its eternal prison.

586
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:38,541
And apparently give you eternal
life as a thank you gift.

587
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,500
It'll make you live forever?

588
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,541
When the people of
Fire Village sealed away the

589
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:48,375
Phoenix many years ago,
countless lives were lost.

590
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,916
I can't imagine the havoc that

591
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,500
demon would create
were it released today.

592
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:55,500
All we have to do is dispel the
magic from one of the stones

593
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,500
to keep that thing from
ever coming back.

594
00:43:57,583 --> 00:44:00,000
That's why Kalard was so
worried about being there and

595
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,791
was waiting for her
to bring him the stone.

596
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,166
If Cream does this...

597
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,375
...he'll have the Phoenix's
Power and be able to do

598
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:08,000
whatever he wants without the
fear of death stopping him.

599
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,041
If the Phoenix were to
go on a rampage...

600
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,750
...just like what
happened last time...

601
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,875
...the duke will
survive the attack.

602
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,791
But he'll be the only one.

603
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,250
We won't let that happen!

604
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,708
Let me go.

605
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,500
I need to at least try
to rescue Éclair.

606
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:25,375
She was crying, so I held her.

607
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,666
She still couldn't
stop trembling.

608
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,291
It was so much
that I was shaking, too.

609
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:33,458
This isn't just about the stone!
Or about the Phoenix!

610
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,458
Éclair's life is at stake!

611
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,333
She's just a girl like me...

612
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,250
When she found out
that her father had died,

613
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,250
she cried just like I did...

614
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:47,458
She needs our help!
We can't abandon her.

615
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:51,416
I see.
You can go...

616
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,541
Erza, you choose
who goes with her.

617
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,666
Right.

618
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,541
Keep it small and efficient.

619
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,208
Veronica may not
be a large country,

620
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,750
but we cannot afford
to go to war with them.

621
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:01,958
Of course, master.

622
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,166
Hey, Wendy.

623
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,958
I'm 'onna need your
Troia spell this time.

624
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,916
Yeah, so that means
I'll have to go with you.

625
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,083
Then I'm going too.

626
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:10,208
Wherever Gray goes,
I will follow.

627
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,916
Aye, sir!

628
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,833
We shall hope for the best while
still preparing for the worst...

629
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:17,541
I will return to the Council at
once and give my report.

630
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,791
Godspeed, everybody.

631
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,000
Oh, what perfect timing.

632
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,333
This is exactly
what I was hoping for,

633
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:43,375
A fitting anniversary
gift for my kingdom.

634
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:46,583
Listen to me, you mustn't
revive the Phoenix!

635
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:49,875
Man cannot control
its destructive power!

636
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:53,250
That's not true, for I can
do whatever I please.

637
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,250
Now you listen to me!!

638
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,916
I will repay you
for your troubles by

639
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,666
ending your miserable life!

640
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,875
You have 'til tomorrow!

641
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,000
That wench dared to strike me?!

642
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:19,666
I have a feeling her comrades
may try and fetch her.

643
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,666
I shall have my
men at the ready.

644
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,000
See that you do.

645
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,791
You mean to tell us the stones
weren't just a legend?

646
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,375
Indeed.

647
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:47,416
Nor was the Phoenix's rebirth,
nor the power of eternal life...

648
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,000
The principality of Veronica
will use all of these

649
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,041
in their bid to conquer
the Kingdom of Fiore.

650
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,375
That's absurd!

651
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,041
They don't have the
resources to wage an attack.

652
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,916
That's precisely why
they have to resort

653
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,791
to using such powerful
ancient magic!

654
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,750
Just what are you suggesting?

655
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,583
That we should launch
a pre-emptive strike

656
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,875
on one of the smallest
sovereign nations?

657
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,833
I'll tell you what I suggest.

658
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:10,166
In fact, I'm making an official
request of the Magic Council...

659
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,958
In accordance with Article 27 of
the National Security Directive,

660
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,750
I ask you to issue a threat
elimination order so

661
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,250
as to secure the citizens'
lives and property.

662
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,208
It's the only way to prevent
this monster's return!

663
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,875
Know your place, sir!

664
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:27,166
We need to examine all relevant
information before we act.

665
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,750
I told you, we don't
have that kind of time!

666
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,458
Damn those outsiders.

667
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:51,166
Trying to curry
favor with his grace.

668
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,416
By the sacred
blood of antiquity,

669
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,958
I order thee to stagger forth...

670
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,625
Open, and reveal thyself.

671
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,791
It won't be long,
We're coming, Éclair.

672
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:48,750
No, Éclair.
Your age is far too tender.

673
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:52,000
Life is not
yet through with you.

674
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,041
I see...

675
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,958
Move.

676
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:17,833
Now I understand...
I've come full circle...

677
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,125
The end at the beginning.

678
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:26,791
Legends will be born.

679
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,708
Yeah...
Hm?

680
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:33,875
Tell me, who goes there?!
The gate's closed for the night!

681
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,750
We're Fairy Tail,
and we say it's open!

682
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:40,666
Ya better get out of our way!

683
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:46,625
Once we're beyond
this gate, our mission is

684
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,416
to find Éclair and
bring her to safety!

685
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,125
Let's do it!

686
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:57,458
Your Grace.

687
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:59,166
Do not trouble yourself.

688
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,625
My loyal lapdogs will do all
the barking, as well as bite.

689
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,916
You again...

690
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,916
So we meet again!

691
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:32,500
Good, because I had
something I wanted to tell you.

692
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:33,958
What's that?

693
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,708
How should I say this?
Your taste in clothing...

694
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:38,208
...is atrocious.

695
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:39,708
What a coincidence.

696
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:42,791
I was going to say
exactly the same to you!

697
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,208
So listen up!!

698
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,791
I was hoping that we
could fool the guards.

699
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:59,541
That they'd think we were just a
couple of girls with their cats.

700
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,458
But it looks like they're
from the Carbuncle guild.

701
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,583
You scared?

702
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:07,250
No, sir, I'm actually
not scared at all...

703
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:10,291
We're trying to help someone
here tonight, you know?

704
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:12,000
So we gotta be brave.

705
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:14,916
Wendy and I will
handle this group here.

706
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,166
You go on ahead, Lucy.

707
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,000
I owe ya one.

708
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,250
Let's go!

709
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:40,791
So the castle's
just northwest of here.

710
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:53,041
Ya gotta have somethin'
that tastes better than that.

711
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,166
Hurry it up, Juvia!

712
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,500
I am!

713
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:58,958
This is wonderful!

714
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,833
All this time I've only
dreamed of going

715
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,166
for a moonlit stroll with
my beloved Gray!

716
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,916
--Get down!
--Oh, my!

717
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,166
You...!

718
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,583
How very bold of you.

719
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:14,708
Hey, pretty boy!
Ya can't get enough, can ya?!

720
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:16,541
If you think Gray would
ever fall in love with a

721
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,416
meathead like you, you'd better
be ready to answer to me first!

722
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,666
You'll never come between us!

723
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,166
Simmer down, okay?!

724
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,375
Wait!

725
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:24,541
What in the world would
possess you to take

726
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,750
your clothes off in
front of that man?!

727
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,000
Some kind of lover's spat?

728
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,583
Water Slicer!

729
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,958
Time to make some crushed ice!

730
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,708
We gotta get outta here!

731
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:45,875
Fireworks already?

732
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,541
Hold on Éclair.
I'll be there as soon as I can!

733
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,416
You there!
Stop at once!

734
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,958
Open!
Gate of the Maiden!

735
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,666
Virgo!

736
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:58,041
Hello princess,
do you wish to punish me

737
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,750
for interrupting
the celebration?

738
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:02,083
I might if you don't
stop those guys!

739
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,625
Yes, of course!

740
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,333
Gotcha!

741
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:22,041
Princess.
You must hurry.

742
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,875
Thanks a lot!

743
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:27,375
And please, be careful.

744
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:45,166
Éclair, being with you, I made
so many good memories...

745
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,708
Momon.

746
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,041
I promise...

747
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:53,291
I promise I'm gonna try
and make it up to you.

748
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,208
I want ya to make
more good memories.

749
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:59,125
So, I'll save you!

750
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,125
That's it!

751
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:05,750
No...

752
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:10,416
A low-life like you,
who likes hurting people,

753
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,208
how many does it take
till you've had enough?

754
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,916
Let me see how taking
one more life feels.

755
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,333
Yours.

756
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,875
Natsu...

757
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:35,916
It would appear that the garnet
has clearly outshone the flame.

758
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,625
Undo!

759
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,416
Give it up.

760
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,875
How precious.

761
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:58,208
At home in your quaint,
peasant rags.

762
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:00,875
So this is what
appeals to you, does it?

763
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,708
Very funny!

764
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:21,041
Ah...
an outfit for the theatre.

765
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:25,208
She's able to
undo my requipping,

766
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,958
because my focus is weak.

767
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,541
Shut out everything
but the battle.

768
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:34,833
You're simply outclassed.

769
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,250
Since I'm bored,

770
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,875
let's get straight
to the finale.

771
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:50,375
Now, time to stop hiding.

772
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:56,958
Ha!

773
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:59,750
Hope you're ready
for a blood bath.

774
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,750
Nobody gets away with
wrecking the Fairy Tail Guild.

775
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,958
We take revenge!

776
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:13,291
Come on!

777
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,458
Cold...

778
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:18,125
Excalibur!

779
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,541
He's done.
Let's go.

780
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,500
Yes, darling!

781
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,750
O, my bride...

782
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,666
Thou art now mine
and mine alone,

783
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,958
The great and
all-powerful Phoenix.

784
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:48,916
I am not worthy of
such heavenly favor.

785
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,750
The gods themselves
decreed our union.

786
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:55,833
Wherefore this hesitation?
Thine hand shall fall into mine.

787
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:09,416
My, my, what
truly impeccable timing.

788
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,833
"Thou art mine and mine alone,

789
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:16,708
the gods have
decreed our union...

790
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:19,833
So wherefore
this hesitation?" Yes?

791
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:21,458
I'll play.

792
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,208
En garde!

793
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,916
I'd much rather be
slicing a wedding cake,

794
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,666
but you will have to do.

795
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,541
Please, that just
sounds ridiculous.

796
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,458
What?
I can't undo her requip?!

797
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:43,625
Impossible!

798
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:46,666
Never underestimate
the will of a bride!

799
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:58,958
It's like your bride form
wouldn't take no for an answer.

800
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,250
It's sad.

801
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,500
You must be...

802
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:04,958
...desperate to get
married, aren't you?

803
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,125
What?
No, that's not true!

804
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:16,000
I am one with the shadows.
Everywhere and nowhere,

805
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:19,000
feeding on the sins of man.

806
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,958
Damn you.

807
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,291
Child's play.

808
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:43,041
They don't call me Black
Steel Gajeel for nothin', pal.

809
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:45,500
Even my guts are
stronger than iron.

810
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,833
I don't know which
shadow you're hidin' behind,

811
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,291
so I guess I'll just have to

812
00:58:57,375 --> 00:59:00,125
tear up every
single one of 'em!!

813
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,666
Happy...
Think you can do this?

814
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:22,083
Aye...
I can fly at least.

815
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,750
Then let's go.

816
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,458
Aye, sir!

817
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,291
Where are they?

818
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,916
Loyal subjects!
Tonight, let us make merry!

819
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,833
To commemorate this occasion

820
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:38,958
I have gathered the
Phoenix Stones!

821
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,375
Stop this!

822
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:43,125
You cannot let those
stones make contact!

823
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,208
You will be
silenced soon enough.

824
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,708
Your Grace.

825
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:51,416
Oh, you're in for a real show.
Now, to honor our beloved

826
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Veronica on this sacred year,

827
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,583
I shall give her the
gift that will sustain

828
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:57,791
her through time without end!

829
00:59:57,875 --> 01:00:00,791
This is madness!
The Phoenix must not be revived!

830
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:05,583
O, empire's divine pillar...
O, twin, so long adrift...

831
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,625
Ye shall again be made one!

832
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,416
You can do whatever
you want with me,

833
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,541
but the Phoenix Stones
must not be united!

834
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,333
I beg of you!

835
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,125
Don't do it!!

836
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:26,333
Éclair!!!

837
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,541
We're coming!!

838
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,833
No!!

839
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:52,125
Natsu, Happy, thanks
for all you've done...

840
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:56,791
It's time for me to
save Éclair, like I promised.

841
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:12,250
I'm here, Éclair.
Just hold on a little longer.

842
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,333
Mighty Phoenix, come to me now!

843
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:20,750
Bless me with the blood
that grants life eternal!

844
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,041
Your blood in mine!

845
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:25,750
What a wretched thought.

846
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:28,666
To imagine a child
so full of ignorant

847
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,166
vanity such as yourself
being granted immortality.

848
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,666
What did you say?

849
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,500
You are not worthy...

850
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:37,291
This gift would not be
wasted were it given to me.

851
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:39,750
Be given to...
you?

852
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,583
Now gaze upon your new ruler!

853
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:49,125
One whose reign shall
endure forevermore!

854
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,041
Such a strange glow...

855
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:03,666
The light of
the Phoenix revival.

856
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,833
Master!
What've you brought with you?

857
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,291
Our upper hand.

858
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,708
The Magic Council's given
their permission to use it?

859
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:17,458
Let the council be damned.

860
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:38,500
O, mighty Phoenix!

861
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:42,375
Bless me with the blood
that grants life eternal!

862
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:50,166
What creature is this?
That's no firebird.

863
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:03,708
But still, it must have blood!

864
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:06,708
The Phoenix blood will be mine!

865
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,750
That power is insane!

866
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,958
She's still alive!

867
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:31,708
Éclair!

868
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:35,666
Is Momon here?

869
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,916
He flew into the
fire to save you.

870
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,791
He tried so hard...

871
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,291
Thank you.

872
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:50,208
Just get her to some place safe.

873
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,916
Okay!

874
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,583
There is no safe place anymore.

875
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,166
And unless we
can stop the Phoenix,

876
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,625
there's no hope for
anyone we hold dear.

877
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,375
They'll die!

878
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:06,208
I understand!
Now let's do it, Happy!

879
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:08,250
Aye, sir!

880
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:30,833
O, mighty Phoenix!
Now bless me with life eternal!

881
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:33,625
Your blood in mine!

882
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,166
"The blood of the
Phoenix is the tears

883
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:44,250
it sheds when
sealed away." It's pointless.

884
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:47,083
Stop right there!

885
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,750
Don't interfere!

886
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:52,458
Are you doing all this just
so more people can die?

887
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,250
It's gonna be okay.

888
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:26,375
Everybody, please
try and remain calm!

889
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:27,625
Hey!

890
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,291
Aren't you supposed to
be some kind of wizard?!

891
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:32,291
Why aren't you doing
anything to stop that creature?!

892
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,083
We'll handle that thing for ya.

893
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:35,916
Who the hell're you?

894
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,833
--We're Fairy Tail!
--We're Fairy Tail!

895
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:41,083
Keep moving!
This way!

896
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:44,375
Don't worry, we just need to get
Wendy to come and heal you.

897
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:45,375
Don't bother.

898
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:47,791
But Éclair, you're hurt!

899
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,166
I'm fine, and I
remember everything.

900
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,833
All that happened.

901
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,166
What?

902
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,416
Veronica was built on top
of the ruins of Fire Village.

903
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,416
That was where I lived long ago.

904
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,875
I don't understand...

905
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:06,125
It was burned to the ground
four hundred years ago,

906
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:09,583
the night I was
given, eternal life.

907
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:13,791
Although your life
has been spared,

908
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:17,791
I fear what awaits you may prove
to be a fate worse than death...

909
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:21,166
I hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

910
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,625
It was folly to worship the

911
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,583
Phoenix Stones as
we did, and we have

912
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,583
paid the ultimate price for it.

913
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:30,333
We must ensure that others
cannot make this same mistake.

914
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:33,958
No matter the cost,
you must dispel it.

915
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:38,333
If this cannot be done...
The stone must be destroyed...

916
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:41,416
The horrors it invokes
are far too great.

917
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,958
You will live until you see

918
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,500
that it vanishes
from this world.

919
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,458
Perhaps as a result from the
blood of the Phoenix,

920
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:51,166
my memory had been wiped clean.

921
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,583
I carried the stone
with me, not knowing why...

922
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:57,750
Wandering aimlessly
throughout the countryside,

923
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,833
I drifted for what
seemed like an eternity...

924
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,000
Time marked only by the graves

925
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,541
of those I held
close to my heart...

926
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:08,583
An ocean of tears between us.

927
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,916
Four hundred years.

928
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,750
An expanse of time
no one should endure.

929
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:16,416
Now I understand what you meant

930
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,916
when you said magic
brings sorrow.

931
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,958
This curse that I carry...

932
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,083
...was brought about by magic.

933
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:26,125
And it's caused
me nothing but pain.

934
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:38,250
Let's go.
Come on, it's dangerous here.

935
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:41,958
But I know I'll live through it.
You should just leave me here.

936
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:45,208
No way!
I would never do that.

937
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:46,666
Nobody in my guild would ever

938
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,083
just leave a friend
of ours behind.

939
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,083
It's no good!

940
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,583
We're gonna have
to get in way closer!

941
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,583
But then we'll
be closer to him, too.

942
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:59,583
Let's move in!

943
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,041
Damn it!

944
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,250
Where the hell
is Erza right now?!

945
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,333
Wait here 'til
I give the signal.

946
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:16,166
I will go and search for Éclair.

947
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,291
Right.

948
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,333
Why won't you die?!

949
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,041
Let your blood spring forth!

950
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:37,625
So I may be crowned
ruler for all time!

951
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:44,041
Not gonna happen!

952
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:49,000
It's hopeless!

953
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,250
Looks like I gotcha!

954
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,541
You dare touch me?!

955
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,416
I'll never understand
people like you.

956
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:09,166
People who only
wanna spread fear!

957
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,375
Éclair!!

958
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:23,208
Hey there!

959
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,375
So we meet again!

960
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:29,375
What the heck
are you doing here?

961
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:30,833
Word on the street was this

962
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,833
duke had some
kinda special stones.

963
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:34,000
Thought that they'd
be worth a bundle,

964
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,625
so I came to check it out.

965
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:36,958
But I don't think
I'll be getting

966
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,291
my hands on 'em after all.

967
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,416
Do we live in a crazy,
small world or what, huh?

968
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,250
You were just tryin' to collect
a bounty on me for stealin'.

969
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:47,041
But if you woulda
caught me back then,

970
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,916
I wouldn't be here
right now to catch you.

971
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,916
And there goes my cue to leave!

972
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,541
Glad to be of service
You owe me one, sweetheart!

973
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,125
Well, see ya!

974
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,625
You're quite special.

975
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:05,833
You make a connection
with every person that you meet.

976
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:09,166
Just as you did with me.

977
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,416
You don't have what it
takes inside to be a ruler!

978
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,791
The only thing you
need to rule is power!

979
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,833
And I will possess
absolute power

980
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,166
when I'm granted eternal life!

981
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,291
I will be an immortal
god among men

982
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:23,333
and will rule over
the entire world!

983
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:24,875
It'll be wasted on you,

984
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,416
'cuz you don't know
the first thing about life!

985
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,583
I know how to end it!

986
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,291
You hurt my friends.

987
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,708
What will you do about it?

988
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:47,458
I'm 'onna make sure you don't
hurt anybody ever again!!

989
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:00,916
It's Natsu!

990
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:07,291
Let's rock, babies!

991
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:12,375
Fairy Machine Gun...
Leprechaun!

992
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:18,916
Dark Écriture.
Slice!

993
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,208
Natsu!

994
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:28,041
You're just wastin' time!

995
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:31,625
Be a real Fairy Tail wizard
and kick that guy's ass!

996
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,208
I still don't have
the Phoenix blood!

997
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:47,166
You don't have any
respect for human life...!

998
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,625
But I will live
for all eternity!

999
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,291
Do it now, Natsu!

1000
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:53,041
So there's no way
in hell I'm gonna

1001
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:56,291
let a guy like you live forever!

1002
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,375
Yes!

1003
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,291
He beat 'im!

1004
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,333
Yeah, but it ain't over.

1005
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:13,083
He may've been able
to take down Dist,

1006
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,916
but we've still got the
Phoenix on our hands.

1007
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,791
What'll we do?

1008
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,875
We'll have to work
together like we always do.

1009
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,541
You guys look like you need
a couple'a helping hands.

1010
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:24,250
You're right!

1011
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:25,500
We all came here.

1012
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,875
We decided to say "screw
the small team idea."

1013
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:30,291
A real man isn't afraid
to get his hands dirty.

1014
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,250
You'll need some help
with that monster.

1015
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,666
All right!
Let's get to it!

1016
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,541
It looks like
the gang's all here!

1017
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:40,250
Then let's get back to work!

1018
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:42,083
Aye, sir!

1019
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,125
I'll show you what
a real man can do!

1020
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,500
They're here!

1021
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:15,250
You see?
You make lasting friendships.

1022
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:20,208
Yeah, and just like the one I've
made with you, I cherish them.

1023
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:24,125
After all these years,
all the pain that

1024
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,500
I've been through...

1025
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:27,750
It's nice to feel
happiness again.

1026
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:29,625
You deserve it.

1027
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,166
What's wrong?!

1028
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:35,500
It's the Phoenix...
It's gathering power...

1029
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,000
...from everybody around it.

1030
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:45,000
What the--?!

1031
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,458
What's happening?

1032
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:55,541
I don't think I can
fly for much longer...

1033
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,250
We can't give up yet,
little buddy.

1034
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,958
What's wrong with me?
I feel so weak all of a sudden.

1035
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:13,041
It's not you.
The Phoenix steals power.

1036
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:16,291
It will take all the
magic power it can,

1037
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:19,208
and use it to destroy the world.

1038
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:21,125
This can't be happening!

1039
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,750
We can't let that thing
use all that power.

1040
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,750
I don't understand why.

1041
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:29,000
It's the nature of the
Phoenix to be reborn...

1042
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,041
It must first be destroyed.

1043
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:33,541
The whole world must burn.

1044
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,833
Then it alone will
rise from the ashes.

1045
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,500
Seriously?

1046
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,708
That's why it must be stopped.

1047
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:42,625
No matter what
sacrifice must be made.

1048
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:44,083
Master!

1049
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:48,083
Wouldn't you agree, Miss Éclair?

1050
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:51,416
But how?

1051
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,250
The people from
Fire Village are gone,

1052
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,083
and their technique
to seal it is lost.

1053
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:56,708
So how can we do it?

1054
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:59,875
We will not seal it,
but destroy it!

1055
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,666
Four hundred years ago,

1056
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,625
the great wizard
Kalard completed

1057
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,416
work on a magic
weapon that was to

1058
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,125
be used against the Phoenix.

1059
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:11,000
It was called, "The Arrow
of Evil's Destruction."

1060
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:13,375
It was entrusted to the Council.

1061
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:14,708
He did?

1062
01:15:14,791 --> 01:15:17,833
Could this be the
dispel magic he spoke of?

1063
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:23,125
It is extremely powerful.

1064
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,541
It will completely
annihilate the Phoenix.

1065
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:28,291
However, you should know that
anyone who's consumed its

1066
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:31,166
blood will disappear
along with it.

1067
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,875
They will?

1068
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:36,750
Erza will fire this arrow
when I give the signal.

1069
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,791
She'd never hurt
Éclair like that!

1070
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:52,875
I chose not to
disclose that fact to her.

1071
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:56,583
This will be my
sin to bear alone.

1072
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:00,083
Go ahead.
You have my blessing.

1073
01:16:00,166 --> 01:16:02,166
What're you saying?

1074
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:06,583
No... please!
Don't do it!

1075
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:07,708
Master!

1076
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:09,500
Lucy, it's for the best.

1077
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,916
It's not!
How can you say that?!

1078
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,250
I've had a long, long life.
I don't want it to last forever.

1079
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:24,083
I will always be with you.

1080
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:26,833
The memories that
we made together...

1081
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,833
Those will never die...
I promise.

1082
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:34,875
It's such a special gift...
So thank you...

1083
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,583
Lucy.

1084
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:42,875
I know Momon is waiting for me.

1085
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:46,083
Seek out and destroy the evil!

1086
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,375
Please, no!!!

1087
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,333
Natsu!

1088
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:11,208
Éclair!
Talk to me! Éclair!

1089
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:16,916
But why?

1090
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,833
Crap!

1091
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:19,000
What now?

1092
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:21,875
Things just got much
worse, didn't they?

1093
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,791
If it makes impact,
everyone will die.

1094
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:41,541
Natsu...
Save them.

1095
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:06,833
Somebody, help her!!

1096
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,708
I'm glad to have met you.
Truly.

1097
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:39,666
No Éclair, please don't go.

1098
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,125
Lucy...

1099
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,708
Promise me...
you'll cherish our memories.

1100
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:54,833
Éclair!

1101
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:01,416
Don't leave me!

1102
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,250
I thank you, Natsu.

1103
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:23,916
Lucy needs you now...
Help mend her heart.

1104
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:37,583
Goodbye.

1105
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:40,458
But before we go,
I want everyone

1106
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:44,375
in Fairy Tail to know
how much you helped us.

1107
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:14,875
I didn't know...
she'd die.

1108
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:29,750
We lost her...
We lost Éclair.

1109
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:37,708
Natsu... Does magic
only cause sadness?

1110
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,833
Is that really true?

1111
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:54,666
If magic is what made me cry...
there's gotta be a way.

1112
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:59,041
It can make me stop crying, too.

1113
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,750
At the very end,
Éclair was smiling.

1114
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,041
She was?

1115
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:15,250
Don't worry.
We're all in this together.

1116
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:08,500
What beautiful magic...
