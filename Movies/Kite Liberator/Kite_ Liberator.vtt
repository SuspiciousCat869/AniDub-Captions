  Hey!

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:22.980 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Mr. Noguchi,

00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:25.983 position:5% line:77% align:start
   I know this stuffs supposed
   to help make our bones
   stay strong out here,

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.086 position:5% line:89% align:start
   but this tastes like crap.

00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:30.620 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now, now,

00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:34.491 position:5% line:77% align:start
  we've been living
  on this space station
  here for the last four years.

  The artificial gravity we're
  enjoying isn't always on.

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:39.764 position:27% line:89% align:start
And it's zero G.

00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:43.268 position:5% line:77% align:start
  There's a loss of bone mass
  and a rise of calcium levels
  in the blood,

00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:44.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
   but to how great the extent

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:47.606 position:5% line:83% align:start
   is something that as of now
   is unknown.

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:53.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
  And as for Doi's space curry,
  it's not that bad.

00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:55.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
   Doc's got a point.

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:56.983 position:16% line:77% align:start
   Remember last year,
   when someone got
   kidney stones

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
  and had to suffer through
  those spasms. I bet he does.

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:02.655 position:27% line:89% align:start
   Doesn't he?

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:06.526 position:5% line:77% align:start
  It won't be funny
  if you make it back to Earth
  with worn out bones.

00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:08.329 position:16% line:89% align:start

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:15.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
  No, actually Mr. Doi is
  the one who makes this food.

00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:17.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
   So people like us
   can live and work up here.

00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:20.375 position:5% line:83% align:start

  (DOI CHUCKLES) That's right.
  I've been doing research
  on this for a long time now.

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:27.682 position:5% line:77% align:start
 And developing special
 booster strength in your bones
 has been a priority.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
  I wouldn't call myself a
  first-class chef or anything.

00:03:30.053 --> 00:03:32.455 position:5% line:83% align:start
 But I can say without a doubt,
 that this food is landmark.

 Mr. Doi, I have to say,
 I'm really impressed.

00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:06.992 position:16% line:83% align:start

seems to work.

00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:13.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Thank you very much, doctor.
  Although, I'm not surprised.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.368 position:38% line:83% align:start
 -Hmm?
 -What?

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:16.870 position:16% line:89% align:start
  What space radiation?

00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:19.606 position:16% line:89% align:start
How's that possible, Doc?

00:04:19.673 --> 00:04:21.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
   Al our levels are tracked.

00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:24.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
 And we all work
 outside the ship a lot.

00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:27.582 position:5% line:77% align:start
 What I mean is,
 we shouldn't be the only ones
 with high levels of radiation.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.518 position:27% line:89% align:start
  That's true.

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:32.353 position:16% line:83% align:start

  the only crew members

   on missions,

00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:36.391 position:16% line:83% align:start
when the sun's radiation
was at its peak,

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:39.228 position:16% line:89% align:start
were you and Mr. Noguchi.

00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:41.430 position:5% line:89% align:start

  That's great.

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.336 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, I thought
those spacesuits of ours

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:49.838 position:16% line:77% align:start
 were supposed to be
 able to block all kinds
 of space radiation?

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.041 position:16% line:89% align:start
   Putting that aside,

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:54.944 position:5% line:77% align:start
   perhaps the two of you
   could refrain from going
   outside the space station.

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:57.381 position:5% line:89% align:start

 Hmm? Your food?

 that's been as tough for me...

  As a father.

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:28.047 position:16% line:83% align:start

you once told me,

that your younger brother
is looking after Monaka.
