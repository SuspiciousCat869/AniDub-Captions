1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,108
(magical music)

2
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,235
(thunder cracking)

3
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,717
(suspenseful music)

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,153
(groaning)

5
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,556
(groaning)

6
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,691
- What could make Meicoomon more furious

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,828
than having to watch her human partner suffer?

8
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,631
That's it Meicoomon, let the fury burn inside you.

9
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,733
Give yourself up to the transformation.

10
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,734
(groaning)

11
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,602
Let the anger bloom.

12
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,539
Let it grow.

13
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,442
(groaning)

14
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,709
(gasps)

15
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,312
Digivolve or you partner dies.

16
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,616
Digivolve into your true form and then destroy this world.

17
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,684
This world into which

18
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,421
you should never have been born in the first place.

19
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,860
(eerie music)

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,474
CHAPTER 5 COEXISTENCE

21
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,310
(birds fluttering)

22
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,179
- [Meicoomon] Meiko where are you?

23
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,751
1999 FALL TOTTORI PREFECTURE

24
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,587
(peaceful music)

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,189
- Meicoomon, answer me please.

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:05,959
(bush rustling)

27
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,293
Huh?

28
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,161
Oh.

29
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,797
Meicoomon, is that you?

30
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,833
Hello, is somebody there?

31
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:20,940
- Meiko.

32
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:27,247
- Thank goodness, I'm so happy to see you, Meicoomon.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,815
I was so worried.

34
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,283
Now it's all better.

35
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,353
- I was really scared.

36
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,623
- [Meiko] Well don't worry, you're safe now.

37
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,894
- [Meicoomon] Can we go home?

38
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:41,895
- [Meiko] You got it.

39
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,598
You know, sometimes I get scared out here too.

40
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,834
(water drips)

41
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,604
- [Meiko's Mom] Your dad will be home any minute Meiko.

42
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,806
You should try to finish washing up soon.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,408
- She was really dirty from all

44
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,809
that running around out there.

45
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,313
We like playing in the woods, huh?

46
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,314
- Yeah.

47
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,616
- Let's keep your little adventure a secret okay?

48
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,720
- You heard her Meicoomon, quiet, shh.

49
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:09,989
- Shh.

50
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,457
(giggles)

51
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,560
- (gasps) Meiko.

52
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,260
- Yeah, Mom?

53
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,395
- [Meiko's Mom] What happened?

54
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,429
Did you get hurt?

55
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,096
- Huh?

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,865
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,533
- These, look.

58
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,902
They look like blood stains.

59
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,837
- Huh, but who from?

60
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,440
(laughing)

61
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,375
I don't see anything wrong with her.

62
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,878
- [Meiko's Mom] Then what did this?

63
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,546
- [Meiko] More testing?

64
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,547
Meicoomon's fine,

65
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,849
why do you have to take her back to the lab?

66
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,884
- It's all routine now.

67
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,788
Don't worry, I just wanna make sure she's healthy.

68
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,490
Some of the people from the Tokyo Research Group

69
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,526
will also be there to observe.

70
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,329
We won't be gone more than a couple of days.

71
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,997
(slurping)

72
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,599
- [Scientist] It's turned into a monster!

73
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,466
Quick!

74
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,901
Seal the lab!

75
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,003
- [Meiko] What did they do to you?

76
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,938
What's going on?

77
00:03:58,972 --> 00:03:59,806
Father?

78
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,307
- Call the cops! - No.

79
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,742
No outsiders.

80
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,510
(growling)

81
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,479
- Get out of here, Meiko.

82
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,881
(grunting)

83
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,984
(gasping)

84
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:13,987
- Where am I?

85
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,991
- Poor thing.

86
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,294
- Meiko!

87
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,696
I missed you so much.

88
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,797
- I'm right here.

89
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,433
Everything's fine now.

90
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,738
Father, you're hurt.

91
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,438
Did she--

92
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,272
- [Meiko's Father] It's nothing.

93
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,375
But clearly there are still things

94
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,643
we don't know about her.

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,815
(yelling)

96
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:49,856
(lightening striking) (grunting)

97
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,758
- You should never have existed,

98
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,427
but I was waiting for you to be born.

99
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,397
And now that you're here, you shall do exactly

100
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,365
what you were born to do.

101
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,903
You will be the one who destroys the world.

102
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,739
(dramatic music)

103
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,476
- [Digimon] What are those things things again?

104
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,878
- Daigo and Durtles.

105
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,379
- Durtles sounds kind of dorky.

106
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,380
- Petals sounds pretty.

107
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,417
- As he would know exactly what to call them.

108
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,551
- The portals.

109
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,386
- [Digimons] That's what they're called.

110
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,588
- [Boy] Is that our world?

111
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,591
- [Digimon] Look at all the Digimon.

112
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,563
(groaning)

113
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,005
- Meicoomon, is that you?

114
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,673
Come back!

115
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,908
Don't go.

116
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,843
You belong here with me.

117
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,945
Don't believe anything Gennai says to you.

118
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,583
Please.

119
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,819
(screaming)

120
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,589
(gasping)

121
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,831
(grunting)

122
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,965
- What are you doing?

123
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,703
She was gonna kill you!

124
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,906
(growling)

125
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,825
- What's going on with Meicoomon?

126
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,860
- I don't know.

127
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,863
- She's gonna be the one who destroys the world.

128
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,931
- What are you talking about?

129
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,833
- That's what Gennai said.

130
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,636
He's figured out a way to manipulate her.

131
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,604
- [Tai] What?

132
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,573
- Meicoomon should never even have been born.

133
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,976
He told her that.

134
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,679
- Don't repeat anything that creep says.

135
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,781
He's a big liar!

136
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,050
There are no Digimon who should never have been born.

137
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,821
- You're right, but I don't think there's

138
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,689
any mystery in what he's doing.

139
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,592
If Meicoomon shows up with that much destructive power--

140
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,560
- [Matt] Look over there.

141
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,896
There are hundreds of Digimon on the move.

142
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,898
- [Boy] Are they all going to Earth?

143
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,199
- [Girl] That can't be good.

144
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,268
- [Woman] Oh, hey, wait a minute.

145
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,202
- [Man] What's the problem with

146
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,937
the number six satellite feed?

147
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,739
Our communication link just went down.

148
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,541
Is there an error in the system?

149
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,909
- [Man] It's not just the satellite, sir,

150
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,944
we've lost the GPS signal, too.

151
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,913
We have power but it's not letting me

152
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,147
re-establish contact.

153
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,616
- Comm is completely frozen, sir.

154
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,219
Global satellites don't seem to be communicating.

155
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,821
All systems are down.

156
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,123
One by one the satellites are going offline.

157
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,758
- [Man] All right, then, manual override.

158
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,692
Shut it down.

159
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,993
Reboot the system.

160
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,129
- There's just too much data pouring in.

161
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,801
- Is this really happening?

162
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,671
Is it really possible that the digital world

163
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,740
and the human world are both changing?

164
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,742
I'm so glad.

165
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,544
You are reborn.

166
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,212
Tapirmon.

167
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:06,152
You were lost, but finally, thanks to Homeostasis,

168
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,089
you are back again.

169
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,025
And I know you don't remember me now, but you will.

170
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,696
Because in the end you and I are partners.

171
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,864
Partners forever.

172
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,734
This time I will be chosen.

173
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,270
This time you and I are going to save the world.

174
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,973
We'll be together again just as we used to be.

175
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,044
(chuckling)

176
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,615
I'll find you again.

177
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,051
And this time, I'll never lose you.

178
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:39,952
Never.

179
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,722
ABNORMALITIES IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES AROUND THE GLOBE

180
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,589
- Now this.

181
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,590
Scientists at the national laboratory

182
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,959
are confirming that weather satellites around

183
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,661
the world have been malfunctioning.

184
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,596
And Fall seismology readings have been

185
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,165
reported near mysterious digital surges.

186
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,601
New Digimon sightings have also been reported,

187
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,036
and for the sake of public safety,

188
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,305
certain regions have been ordered to evacuate.

189
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,306
ABNORMALITIES IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES AROUND THE GLOBE

190
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,174
So far no one has been hurt by the activity.

191
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,976
And Digimon sightings have become a source

192
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,646
of public curiosity and speculation.

193
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,248
- I figure they'll probably all fly to Paris next.

194
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,118
- That's where I'd wanna go if I were a Digimon.

195
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,353
- Hi, we have a poll at school to see who

196
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,356
can predict where Digimon will show up next.

197
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,259
- I got a text but there's no number.

198
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,061
Whoa, is this some kind of joke?

199
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,997
And now it won't even let me delete it.

200
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,799
This phone is all jacked up.

201
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,633
(groans)

202
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,235
- [Boy] What's with this game, man?

203
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,137
It's going all wonky all of a sudden.

204
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,908
- [Boy] Whoa, I've never seen that screen before.

205
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,976
- [Boy] How'd you do that?

206
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,145
- [Homeostasis Voiceover] Humans are unnecessary.

207
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,813
They are a virus.

208
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,782
They must be destroyed.

209
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,087
- I know Himekawa isn't here, I don't know where she went.

210
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,323
Look, why aren't we getting any updates

211
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,391
at all on what's going on?

212
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,228
Listen up, the kids are still in the digital world.

213
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,129
Are you there?

214
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,166
(grunting)

215
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,167
What a mess.

216
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,141
(yelling)

217
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,179
(hissing)

218
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,381
DIGIMON APPEARING ALL OVER THE GLOBE

219
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,549
- Thanks.

220
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,384
I'm coming to you live from our action news helicopter

221
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,252
with reports that Digimon sightings

222
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,888
are now confirmed across the world.

223
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,292
Authorities are closely monitoring the situation.

224
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,361
- [Man] More satellites are failing, sir.

225
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,796
We're losing communication control.

226
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,331
- Run the diagnostic again.

227
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,899
- I'm trying, sir.

228
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,934
- Sir, the grid.

229
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,801
It's down.

230
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,204
- It's getting worse.

231
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,705
What is going on?

232
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,041
(beeping)

233
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:42,942
DIGIMON APPEARING ALL OVER THE GLOBE

234
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,176
- [Reporter] Why have the Digimon suddenly

235
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,711
appeared in such numbers?

236
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,947
Many nations are calling for emergency meetings

237
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,349
to discuss this latest crisis.

238
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,952
- Oh, kids, are you okay?

239
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,821
I feel so helpless.

240
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,092
But I know you're both fine and you'll come

241
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,061
home safe and sound to me.

242
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:06,065
And I promise I'll make you the best home-coming meal ever.

243
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,868
- [Reporter] Our next story explores the surprising spike--

244
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,904
(sirens wailing)

245
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,339
- [Reporter] The government has not declared

246
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,976
a state of emergency as no casualties have been reported.

247
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,411
GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY DIGIMON ACROSS REGIONS

248
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,146
Top level officials are currently meeting with experts

249
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,749
from across the globe to initiate a plan of action.

250
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,385
- What are they gonna talk about without you there, doctor?

251
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,355
No one knows more about what's going on.

252
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,957
One good thing; at least they don't consider

253
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,360
this to be a critical situation yet.

254
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,928
- [Doctor] Of course it is.

255
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,996
- Oh?

256
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,165
- I already know what's going on

257
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,966
because it's happened before.

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,835
- [Daigo] Tell me.

259
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,903
- Meicoomon's the key.

260
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,038
EMERGENCY TALKS OVER APPROACHING CRISIS!

261
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,039
- Exactly.

262
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,274
How many times are these creatures gonna run amok

263
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,177
through our cities like some gang of juvenile delinquents?

264
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,546
- The question is, why do they do it?

265
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,450
- Because those monstrous beasts lack any heart or soul.

266
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,318
- The real problem clearly lies with

267
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,887
our increasing reliance on digital technology.

268
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,457
We've allowed computers to take over our lives.

269
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,058
- And all of us have kids at home who

270
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,327
would rather play on their cell phones than eat.

271
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,229
- I'm sure you're familiar with the concept

272
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,899
of symbiosis where two individuals adopt each other's moods.

273
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,369
I've observed recently that Meicoomon and Meiko are aligned.

274
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,572
Not only that, it looks like this connection

275
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:23,275
is growing even stronger and becoming dangerous.

276
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,144
Meicoomon's become a violent creature

277
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,513
when they've been separated in the past

278
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,249
and then calmed down again when Meiko is present.

279
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,418
- Doctor, if what you say is true,

280
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,955
then Meicoomon isn't even a Digimon.

281
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,957
- [Doctor] No, she is a Digimon.

282
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,259
But there is no doubt she is unusual.

283
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,462
- And much too powerful. (gasping)

284
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,930
- Hackmon.

285
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:45,731
- Who is this?

286
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,167
- He's a messenger for Homeostasis.

287
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,403
Is that why you've come?

288
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,572
Are you here to protect Meicoomon?

289
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,274
- I think you may have the wrong idea

290
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,877
about the purpose of Homeostasis.

291
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,211
- You want harmony.

292
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,280
Don't you need Meicoomon for that?

293
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:05,117
- [Hackmon] The Libra has been unstable since it was born.

294
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,385
- Who is Libra?

295
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,553
- Meicoomon is Libra.

296
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:12,591
- A part of Apoclymon's data is contained in the Libra.

297
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:17,129
That shard is from a dark corner of the digital world.

298
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:21,033
The Libra's powers have made her an outcast.

299
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,069
The only thing limits the Libra's destructive power

300
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,338
has been the presence of a partner.

301
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,874
That connection contains the Libra's power

302
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,610
from exploding into its fearsome potential.

303
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,547
The partner maintains balance.

304
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,082
- Meiko stabilizes her, then.

305
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,050
- That's right.

306
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,518
- Now it makes sense.

307
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,321
Whenever my daughter and her Digimon are together,

308
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,591
Meicoomon is happy and the perfect companion.

309
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,361
But when they're apart, like when Meiko is at school,

310
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,132
Meicoomon tends to get upset, even dangerous.

311
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,900
- That's why it was important to keep

312
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,469
the Libra and her human partner connected.

313
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,440
Because its unsuppressed power is vast.

314
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,109
If it becomes uncontained it will strike

315
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,911
with relentless force.

316
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,114
Then the Libra's destructive power will

317
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,685
be so great that she will no longer recognize a partner

318
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,221
and she will stop responding to Meiko.

319
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,225
(groaning)

320
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,026
Perhaps she already has.

321
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,062
Events would suggest it.

322
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,232
And as the Libra's power grows, it threatens stability.

323
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,101
- What a mess.

324
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:29,969
Man.

325
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,538
- [Doctor] Oh, Meiko.

326
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,706
My poor daughter.

327
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:37,243
- [Hackmon] She carries a heavy burden on her shoulders.

328
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,479
Even for one who is a DigiDestined.

329
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,182
(screaming)

330
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,017
(thudding)

331
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,419
(groaning)

332
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,287
- Enough!

333
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,390
Wow, that really hurt.

334
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,626
How in any world could that even happen?

335
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,528
We all ran right off a cliff like a bunch of lemmings.

336
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,397
- It's like someone yanked the ground

337
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,532
out from one of us while we were running.

338
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,501
- I think that's exactly what happened

339
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,069
and Meicoomon's part of it.

340
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,105
But this goes beyond just the reboot.

341
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,240
- At this point we don't even know where she is.

342
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,441
(rumbling) (gasping)

343
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,543
(cracking)

344
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:16,015
(roaring) (screaming)

345
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,550
- Uh oh. - You've gotta be kidding.

346
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,585
- [Digimon] Allow us!

347
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,090
- You guys, get to someplace safe.

348
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,525
- We got this!

349
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,694
(panting)

350
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,532
(screaming)

351
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,569
- Let me go. - Hey, watch it, get off!

352
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,705
(panting)

353
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,407
- Biyomon, thank you.

354
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,476
- Help, they got us! - We're up here!

355
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,145
- [Meiko] And getting higher!

356
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,780
- Oh no, hang on!

357
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,415
Pepper Breath!

358
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,617
(groaning)

359
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,188
- [Tentomon] Sorry about the landing.

360
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,257
Yet, you held onto your computer.

361
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,158
- Good thing.

362
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,125
- Are you all right?

363
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,794
- Thanks to you, I am.

364
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,029
- Those vines, they were like ropes.

365
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:04,797
- Yeah.

366
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,632
- That was bizarre.

367
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,400
- Let's get outta here. - Huh?

368
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,601
Oh, sure.

369
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,036
Right away.

370
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,804
(grunting)

371
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,038
Thanks, Tai.

372
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,273
- This way.

373
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,376
(panting) (grass rustling)

374
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,377
Okay!

375
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,448
Wrong way! (screaming)

376
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,286
(groaning)

377
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,725
- I'm definitely gonna need a spa day after this.

378
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,625
- [Digimon] Mimi?

379
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,493
- Who's that?

380
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,361
- Your legs are--

381
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,496
- Fine, I landed on something soft.

382
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,431
- Glad I broke your fall.

383
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,299
(screaming)

384
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,333
- I'm sorry.

385
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,668
- Ouch. - Look around, guys.

386
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,536
Is anything else about to attack us?

387
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,405
- It doesn't look like it.

388
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,741
Remember the first time we came to this area?

389
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,744
Didn't Kuwagamon attack us in this very same place?

390
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,345
- But we sure weren't attacked by a bunch

391
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,848
of strange plants before.

392
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,182
- It hates us.

393
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,251
(gasping)

394
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,453
We don't belong here.

395
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,190
The digital world, it hates us.

396
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,327
(dramatic music) - But what do you mean?

397
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,262
- [Kari] It thinks we're in the way.

398
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,764
We're nothing but a nuisance.

399
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,870
- [T.K] How did we become a nuisance to

400
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,738
the entire digital world?

401
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,811
- So, are you going to tell us how to control Meicoomon?

402
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,847
There's gotta be something her partner can do.

403
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,816
What do we do to stop this thing?

404
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,351
- [Hackmon] You can't.

405
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,219
Time is up.

406
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,388
The judgment has been made.

407
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,259
(light music)

408
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,863
- It became night so quickly.

409
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,166
The sun was out just a minute ago.

410
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,467
- You're right.

411
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,135
But is this really nighttime?

412
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,872
I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

413
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,541
- So sad.

414
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,176
If we didn't know what they were,

415
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,711
those Digimon would look like shooting stars.

416
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,615
- If they were shooting stars, I'd wish for a ride home.

417
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,784
- But we've gotta find a way outta here.

418
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,453
And find Meicoomon.

419
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,720
- Hey, Izzy.

420
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,824
Have you made any progress on getting us home to our world?

421
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,159
- [Izzy] I've been running searches since we got here

422
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,595
trying to find a portal or some other way out

423
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,863
but no dice.

424
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,867
- I'm sorry.

425
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,635
(gasping)

426
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,472
It's true, this is my fault.

427
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,673
- Oh, not this again!

428
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,542
- [Meiko] You're just too nice to say so.

429
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,877
But we all know what happened.

430
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,945
- [Joe] We may know what happened,

431
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,847
but we still don't know why.

432
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,782
So how can it be your fault?

433
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:41,386
- [Meiko] I'm Meicoomon's partner and I couldn't stop her.

434
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,490
I couldn't' do anything, and now look where we are.

435
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,758
I don't know what's happening.

436
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,560
Are we not partners anymore?

437
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,796
- Just because you're partners doesn't mean

438
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,764
you're not gonna have hard times.

439
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,602
It takes work.

440
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,973
Both of you have to try or your bond could be broken.

441
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:01,673
Permanently.

442
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,545
- [Sora] It's a two way street.

443
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,513
- Yeah.

444
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,348
That's the truth.

445
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,717
You have to listen to each other.

446
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,385
- It can be tough.

447
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,455
Even I'm not perfect all of the time.

448
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,358
But our faults balance each other out.

449
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,927
- That's right.

450
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,462
That's why we have partners.

451
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,466
- [Meiko] I've watched all of you with your partners.

452
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,668
Even though your connections may be different,

453
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,570
they all seem to work so well.

454
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,473
Your ties are strong.

455
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,308
I don't know, maybe Meicoomon and I

456
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,377
just don't have a good connection.

457
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,413
- Oh, Meiko.

458
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,283
You never give yourself a break.

459
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,484
Look where you are.

460
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,718
You would not of come all this way

461
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,554
if you weren't partners.

462
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,489
That is a strong connection.

463
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,625
- Yeah, but, what if that's the problem?

464
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,327
If that's why she transformed?

465
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,963
- What are you saying?

466
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,532
- I think I'm what's wrong here.

467
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,533
- What? - Oh.

468
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,669
- Why me?

469
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,405
What was I chosen to do?

470
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,610
I can't do anything to help her

471
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:16,582
and now Meicoomon's become this.

472
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,516
This--

473
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,650
- Oh, Mei Mei.

474
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,021
(screaming)

475
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,824
- [Meiko] I'm scared.

476
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,929
If I'm not the right person, why was I chosen?

477
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,398
Someone else, someone better

478
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,934
should have been Meicoomon's partner.

479
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,403
But I was chosen, and now I've caused everything

480
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,072
to go so wrong.

481
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,407
It's all my fault.

482
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,610
(gasping)

483
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,011
- You're forgetting something.

484
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,515
Because you were chosen, we're friends,

485
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,017
and we'll be friends forever.

486
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,989
That's why we're all here together.

487
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,428
(light music)

488
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,101
- Don't close yourself off, Meiko.

489
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,535
It never works out.

490
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,874
Loneliness is tough.

491
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,743
It grows like a thorn in your heart.

492
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,547
Fight it off and let us in.

493
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,350
We're here for you.

494
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,022
- Meiko, listen.

495
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,892
Meicoomon will come back to you

496
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,395
because your feelings for her are that strong.

497
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,532
There's no getting around it.

498
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:45,637
You two are partners through thick and thin.

499
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,905
- I hope so.

500
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,640
I hope she believes it.

501
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,810
I miss her so much.

502
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,346
- [Meicoomon] Meiko, dun dun.

503
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,649
(fire crackling)

504
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,985
- [Kari] You'll just have to have faith in Meicoomon

505
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,655
and in yourself, don't let those doubts creep in.

506
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,490
They'll only make you weak and none

507
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,759
of us can afford that right now.

508
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,695
If you still feel connected to her,

509
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,830
then you can still help her.

510
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,032
I know this has been a hard time for you.

511
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,469
We all understand, even though you don't think we do.

512
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,039
But we have to stay strong and stay together.

513
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:25,043
And when you're feeling weak, you can lean on us.

514
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,111
- [Meiko] I don't even know why

515
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,014
I was chosen to be her partner.

516
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,117
- You keep forgetting that we weren't just chosen,

517
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,719
we were DigiDestined.

518
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,888
(gasping)

519
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,795
- Your problems are ours, too, so let's share them together.

520
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,163
- What are we sharing, guys?

521
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,165
Something delicious, I hope.

522
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,133
- [Gatomon] Go back to sleep.

523
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,468
- What?

524
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,770
(chuckles) - Oh man.

525
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:52,838
- Figures.

526
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,573
Same as ever.

527
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,110
- Well, if there's no food, then why'd you wake me up?

528
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,545
- He has a point, that was mean.

529
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,114
Next time you talk about sharing something

530
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,849
make sure you've got bacon.

531
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,051
(laughing)

532
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,226
- You know, even though they're not to blame for this,

533
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,928
our Digimon are gonna take the heat for what's happening.

534
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,730
- Yeah, unfortunately.

535
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,699
You're probably right about that, Izzy.

536
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,705
(snoring)

537
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:32,611
It's a shame, they all put out a 100% for us.

538
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,845
Now it's our turn.

539
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,715
We have to give it 100% just like they did

540
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,084
and fight to protect all of them.

541
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,986
That includes Meicoomon.

542
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:41,920
(gasping)

543
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,790
As long as we keep on fighting together,

544
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,259
as a team, we'll win.

545
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,594
(humming)

546
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:56,067
- You gotta believe you and Meicoomon are partners

547
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,069
no matter what might happen.

548
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,575
If she's in your heart, there's still a chance.

549
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,709
- I hope so.

550
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:05,644
Let's try.

551
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,780
- That's the spirit, let's go rescue her.

552
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,820
- You might as well know.

553
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,290
Homeostasis is now planning to remove the Libra.

554
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,891
- Remove her?

555
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,193
- That's just code.

556
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,628
You mean to eliminate her.

557
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:24,963
Monstrous.

558
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,631
- [Hackmon] The Libra's out of control,

559
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,166
you've seen it yourself.

560
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,036
The reboot failed to stop her violent attacks.

561
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,671
There is no other choice.

562
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,873
- So you say.

563
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,708
- We now believe the reboot caused

564
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,678
the Libra to undergo some sort of genetic mutation.

565
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,779
- [Daigo] Mutation?

566
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,581
You mean it Digivolved.

567
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,550
- Digi evolution is never completely destructive

568
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,018
the way this has been.

569
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,587
- [Daigo] That's true.

570
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,189
- Therefore, we have to end this now

571
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,326
before Meicoomon's next mutation makes her too strong.

572
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,927
- Aw, come on!

573
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:56,962
We can't just quit.

574
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,798
We've been trying for months to save Meicoomon.

575
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,733
Now that she's become too powerful,

576
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,870
you wanna throw all that aw-- (phone ringing)

577
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,737
Yes?

578
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,806
Are you serious?

579
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,743
But why wasn't I informed before y--?

580
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,779
Very well.

581
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,714
I understand.

582
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,283
(phone clicking)

583
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,184
- Now what?

584
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,054
- [Daigo] The self defense forces.

585
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,223
They're preparing to send out troops.

586
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,191
- Correct.

587
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,760
Your armed forces are cooperating with us.

588
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,628
(groaning)

589
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,696
Your government agrees that this is

590
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,298
the best way to handle it.

591
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,134
- And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me?

592
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:36,868
- Why?

593
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,203
What good would that have done?

594
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:43,141
Are you just going to watch again as a world meets its end?

595
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,877
Everything you know could go up in flames.

596
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,979
Your entire world is in danger.

597
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,781
What do you suggest?

598
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,017
That we stand by and let it happen?

599
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,718
We will not.

600
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,887
Our goal is harmony and balance,

601
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,957
but sometimes that means making hard choices.

602
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,160
Infections spread and get worse.

603
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,930
All impurities will be dealt with.

604
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,269
- [Daigo] What's Homeostasis trying to do here, doctor?

605
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,004
Why destroy Meicoomon?

606
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,640
Why won't they just let us do our job?

607
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,276
And what was the point of involving the DigiDestined?

608
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,912
Why were all those kids chosen in the first place?

609
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,113
- Listen-- - If you're just going

610
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,315
to cut them off.

611
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,751
And now they're stranded.

612
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,823
(suspenseful music)

613
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,830
(zapping)

614
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,101
(beeping)

615
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,303
(rumbling)

616
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,145
(dramatic music) (alarms ringing)

617
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,718
(screaming)

618
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,219
- [Reporter] In breaking news, reports are flooding in

619
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,087
of a huge explosion into

620
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,823
Green Valley Geothermal Power Plant.

621
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,759
We now go live to our correspondent on the scene.

622
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,728
- There's no confirmation yet,

623
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,863
but witnesses reported a flying Digimon

624
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,797
right before the blast.

625
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,966
You can see the fire behind me is growing

626
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,701
and first responders and fire crews

627
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,370
are already on the scene.

628
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,138
They need to control that fire,

629
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,406
because if it gets any hotter,

630
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,274
additional explosions could result.

631
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,410
(booming)

632
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,713
And if the whole plant blows up,

633
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,181
then in addition to the loss of power,

634
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,283
I'm told that the seismic shock could set off

635
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,086
a chain reaction of volcanic eruptions in the mountains.

636
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,956
So the recent malfunctions of computers and phones

637
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,026
is now spreading to major industries and networks.

638
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,962
What are these Digimon trying to do?

639
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,897
- [Doctor] What was it Hackmon called her?

640
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,898
An impurity?

641
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,369
(rain dripping)

642
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,277
- It was a nice sunny day just a few minutes ago.

643
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,845
- [Tentomon] What is it they say?

644
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,382
Some Digimon feel the rain, but others just get wet.

645
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,284
- Just who have you been talking to?

646
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,787
- [Palmon] Does the rain make me look wilted?

647
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,757
- [Digimon] I wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot horn.

648
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,425
- Hey.

649
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,194
Kari, let me ask you something.

650
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,462
- Huh?

651
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:21,533
- Earlier you said it's like the digital world is mad at us.

652
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,202
- No, I said the digital world hates us

653
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,537
and wants to get us out of here.

654
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,438
(gasping)

655
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,540
I know it's not actually saying that,

656
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,309
but that's what it feels like to me.

657
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,777
Think about it.

658
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,014
The ground, those vines, now the clouds.

659
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,083
It's like it's all rejecting us.

660
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,185
- [Gatomon] That's not entirely true.

661
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,986
- [Kari] What do you mean, Gatomon?

662
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,956
- We're all part of the digital world

663
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,357
and we're not rejecting you.

664
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,394
- Yeah, I wanna be with you forever!

665
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,228
- Me, too!

666
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,797
You wanna stay with me, don't you?

667
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,799
- [Mimi] Oh, Palmon, of course I do.

668
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,206
- I'm sorry.

669
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,208
I wasn't talking about you guys,

670
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,977
you haven't abandoned us or rejected us.

671
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,079
We're in this together.

672
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,415
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

673
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,283
It's like the digital world is fighting us

674
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,986
the way a body fights back when it gets sick.

675
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,823
- As if we were germs or an infection or something.

676
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,991
- Infection?

677
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,126
- [Izzy] Think about it.

678
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,095
The digital world is sending the elements against us

679
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,331
like it would to a virus it was trying to get rid of.

680
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,966
- I'm no germ!

681
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,200
No way!

682
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,369
- Then this digital world must be different

683
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,037
from the other one we went to.

684
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,572
- Maybe 'cause of the reboot.

685
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,774
- It's possible.

686
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,110
But we don't know if these events are happening naturally

687
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,045
or being done on purpose to get rid of us.

688
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,180
- It doesn't matter.

689
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:43,982
We're the problem.

690
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,621
Any minute we're going to be cast out of the digital world.

691
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,223
It hates us.

692
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,458
It wants us gone.

693
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,996
- Why, Kari?

694
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,431
Why does the digital world hate us all of a sudden?

695
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,569
- Could it be 'cause it knows that we're the DigiDestined?

696
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,204
No.

697
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,873
(wind howling)

698
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:16,214
- [Sora] Look, everybody, the rain stopped!

699
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,515
- [Agumon] Well, this is nice.

700
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,417
Dry and steady and safe.

701
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,452
(gasping)

702
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,622
- This is all different, but familiar.

703
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,027
This is the spot where we met Agumon

704
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,462
when we first came to the digital world.

705
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,497
How did we get here?

706
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,575
(zapping)

707
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,312
(screaming)

708
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,419
- [Gennai Voiceover] You don't know it yet,

709
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,455
but soon you will see with your own eyes.

710
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,258
And you'll know you were about to meet your demise.

711
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:02,594
Together.

712
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,000
(light music)

713
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,007
(gasping)

714
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,708
(groaning)

715
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,042
- [Boy] What was that?

716
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,411
- Where are we?

717
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,582
(light music)

718
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,986
- Are we back home again?

719
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:28,953
- We are!

720
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:29,921
We're home!

721
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,423
(gasping)

722
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,291
- Look. - Uh oh.

723
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,959
Can that be?

724
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,194
No, it can't. - Hey, Tai.

725
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,495
Where are we now?

726
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:38,463
This is weird.

727
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,598
- Uh, don't worry.

728
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,733
- I can't believe it.

729
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,568
- So, this is the human world, huh?

730
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,570
- Are those Digimon?

731
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,206
Hi! (kid crying)

732
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,707
- Are we scary looking?

733
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,143
Or are they crying because we're so cute?

734
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,112
- Maybe that's how they say welcome.

735
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,513
Maybe humans cry all the time.

736
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,547
- Ya think so?

737
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,684
- Well, we can cry if it makes them feel better.

738
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,086
- Wah, nice to meet ya.

739
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,756
- Nice try, but humans say hello same as you.

740
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,224
- Oh, that's a relief.

741
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,258
- Let's go, then.

742
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,594
I wanna make friends with everybody in this world.

743
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,095
- Yeah, me too!

744
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,030
- Hey, you.

745
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,364
What's going on here?

746
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,699
Is there a problem?

747
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,000
- No problem.

748
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,535
Everything is fine here, officer.

749
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,538
- Maybe now's a good time to start crying.

750
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,340
- Don't play me for a fool.

751
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,342
Those are Digimon!

752
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,677
- Come on, let's go.

753
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,046
(gasping)

754
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,148
Run, you guys.

755
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,783
We gotta get outta here!

756
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,751
- [Officer] Code nine, officer needs assistance.

757
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,487
Unidentified kids carrying Digimon near downtown.

758
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,188
- Where are we going?

759
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,389
I can't keep running forever.

760
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,324
- Don't worry.

761
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,693
At this rate we'll never outrun the police.

762
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,727
- Nice, Tai.

763
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,163
Running just makes it look like we're guilty.

764
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,098
- Yet here we are following him.

765
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,034
- If we weren't in trouble before, we are now for sure.

766
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,471
- You may be right, but it's too late to stop now!

767
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,740
- Uh, Tai, could you let go?

768
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,575
I can actually run on my own.

769
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,377
- Oh yeah, my bad.

770
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,645
(panting)

771
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,613
Let's go through this gate.

772
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,381
- [Officer] There they are!

773
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,615
Stop, you kids. - It's locked.

774
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,483
Dead end.

775
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,819
- Uh oh.

776
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,087
Fly away, Biyomon.

777
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,788
- No, I'm staying here.

778
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,656
- Now what?

779
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,690
- We have to hide them.

780
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,359
Hide them all quick, Izzy.

781
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,326
- Yeah, but how?

782
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,494
- This is our world.

783
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,262
Your laptop should work.

784
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,697
- Right.

785
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,166
(dramatic music)

786
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,468
- [Officer] We have you surrounded.

787
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,136
There is no use running.

788
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,504
Remain where you are.

789
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,305
(growling)

790
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,773
- No, Gatomon, don't do anything.

791
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,640
- Why?

792
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,075
I just wanna help.

793
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,578
- [Officer] Easy now, no funny business.

794
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,447
- Looks like we're out of options, Tai.

795
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,448
- Almost got it.

796
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,784
It's open!

797
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:40,651
Jump, guys!

798
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,487
- Uh, jump where?

799
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,788
- Jump into the screen.

800
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,856
- Hurry up.

801
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,424
- But what about you?

802
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,859
- We'll see you again soon.

803
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,460
Now go.

804
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,662
(grunting)

805
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,570
- This is not gonna look good on my permanent record.

806
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,806
- You oughta be more worried about life in prison.

807
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,442
- Don't even joke around about stuff like that.

808
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,743
- Don't worry, Joe.

809
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,712
They say wearing stripes makes you look thinner.

810
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:08,579
- [Joe] Don't laugh.

811
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,748
If I'm going, you're all going with me.

812
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,317
- [Officer] I wanna know exactly

813
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,753
what happened to those Digimon.

814
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,622
My officers report that each of you

815
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,891
was seen to have a Digimon accompanying you.

816
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,893
- We were just hanging out with your friends, sir.

817
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,327
- Friends are humans.

818
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,897
- I'll be friends with whoever I want.

819
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,432
- It's not that simple, son.

820
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,333
Digimon are incredibly violent.

821
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,868
- Now, that's just nonsense.

822
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,869
- That's right!

823
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,638
There are lots of good Digimon.

824
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,406
- How can you not know that whole cities

825
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,876
are being destroyed by Digimon all over the entire world?

826
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,678
(gasping)

827
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:41,913
- The entire world?

828
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,414
- Be more specific.

829
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,552
We've kinda been out of touch.

830
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,488
(knocking on door)

831
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,498
- Daigo Nishijima, management officer, eh?

832
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,300
And what exactly does the government want

833
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,668
with a bunch of kids?

834
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,770
- They're not ordinary kids, detective.

835
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,772
- Well, I'm sorry, but I can't release them

836
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,241
until our investigation is completed.

837
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,843
They were seen with a number of Digimon

838
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,212
but somehow hid them before we got there.

839
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,346
- They felt threatened.

840
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,583
They were just protecting their friends from your men.

841
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,384
- Their friends, huh?

842
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,920
That's the same word they used for those Digimon.

843
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,923
Not a surprise from them, but hearing it from you?

844
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,325
Ridiculous.

845
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,493
- Listen to me.

846
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,529
I represent the Incorporative Administrative Agency's

847
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,898
National Data Processing Bureau's information

848
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,867
and communications strategies sections

849
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,702
information management office.

850
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,505
- [Detective] Is that supposed to impress me or confuse me?

851
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,907
- Okay, then, try this one on for size.

852
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,209
Release them or you'll be working on a fishing trawler

853
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:45,943
by the end of the week.

854
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,944
- Are you insane?

855
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,680
We know for a fact they're harboring Digimon.

856
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,516
This could be a huge disaster.

857
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,418
- Not for you to worry about.

858
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,520
I'll handle it.

859
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,996
I know you guys are probably really tired

860
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,564
and all you wanna do is go home.

861
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,732
- Recording live. - Great, can you see anything?

862
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,334
- [Daigo] But, unfortunately, none of you can go home

863
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,503
because the press has all of your houses surrounded.

864
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,371
- [Mimi] The press?

865
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,605
How did they find out?

866
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,473
- There must be a leak somewhere.

867
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,974
- I see, so you say. - Pretty common

868
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,576
in government work. - He's a loner.

869
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,978
- So, when will we get to go back home?

870
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,614
- Don't worry, it won't be too long.

871
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,650
We're going to a safe place.

872
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,387
Your parents have been notified and they're cool with this.

873
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,389
I have custody of you for now.

874
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,724
- What exactly has been happening in this world?

875
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,827
- It's Meicoomon.

876
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:38,729
- Meicoomon?

877
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,834
- [Daigo] I believe that's her in the photo

878
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,870
although she does look a little different.

879
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,505
- [Tai] Yeah, it's her.

880
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,710
- She stayed in that form.

881
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,745
Please tell me she hasn't hurt anyone.

882
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,283
- I'll fill you all in later.

883
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,786
- Are we going to your bureau of whatever?

884
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:02,753
- Better.

885
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,722
You'll know this place.

886
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,457
It's all closed up for the Summer.

887
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,925
We won't attract attention.

888
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:14,899
- [Sora] You're kidding.

889
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,300
We're going to school?

890
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,169
BIG PLANT FIRE CAUSED BY DIGIMON!?

891
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,203
BIG PLANT FIRE CONTINUING TO SPREAD

892
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,838
- The fire at the power plant is still burning

893
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,640
out of control with brave fire crews

894
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:23,975
continuing to pour water

895
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:24,942
on the flaming wreckage - Horrible.

896
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:25,876
As they have done

897
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,511
for the past five hours - Mei did that?

898
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,813
Without respite. - Yeah.

899
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,083
It's like what happened with Kuwagamon.

900
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,485
- Actually, this one is even worse.

901
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,855
Meicoomon did this with a single hit.

902
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,857
What if she kept going?

903
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,460
Or even worse, what if every Digimon

904
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:46,964
went out of control the same way all at the same time?

905
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:47,665
- Game over.

906
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,535
Game over for the entire world.

907
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,604
- And then there's us.

908
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,807
We'll be blamed for any destruction the Digimon cause.

909
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,708
- No we won't!

910
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,744
We'll just chase them away.

911
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,611
- We wait.

912
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,680
- You serious?

913
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,616
- Do you remember Odaiba?

914
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,851
We can't rush in.

915
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,386
- So what are you saying?

916
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,087
That we should just stand here and watch

917
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,689
while the world's destroyed?

918
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,623
- Of course not.

919
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,892
I wanna take action the same as you do.

920
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,861
The same as we all do.

921
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,031
But you said it yourself, Matt.

922
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,799
Each one of our battles from now on

923
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,933
will be for the entire world.

924
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,672
That means we're fighting for more than just ourselves.

925
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,445
It's for all of our Digimon, right?

926
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:37,715
- Yeah, right.

927
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,483
I get it.

928
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,962
- Man, Meicoomon's really screwed things up now.

929
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:52,830
- Watch it.

930
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:53,698
(yelling)

931
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,100
- Poor Meicoomon I meant.

932
00:38:56,133 --> 00:39:02,440
- I know what you meant, but I do feel bad for her.

933
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,974
She's out there all alone.

934
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,143
- [Daigo] She may have already been removed.

935
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,414
- Removed?

936
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,782
- What do you know?

937
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:12,650
Tell us.

938
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,788
- As reports continue-- - So you're saying

939
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,791
that Homeostasis ordered Meicoomon to be removed?

940
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,560
Do you have any more information?

941
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,596
What is removal even mean? - Valley Power Plant.

942
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,931
But that fire continues to burn

943
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,432
out of control. - Someone who should never

944
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,001
even have been born. - Only 5% containment.

945
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,171
- That's Gennai described Meicoonmon to me.

946
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,973
Someone who no one ever wanted.

947
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,944
Maybe that makes me unwanted, too.

948
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,980
It makes me a pretty terrible partner.

949
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,749
- Stop that, Meiko.

950
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,185
- Stop being so hard on yourself, and Meicoomon, too.

951
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,222
- Look at that.

952
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,957
All that destruction.

953
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,526
Isn't that something a good person would prevent?

954
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,763
And who is powerless to stop it.

955
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,698
What kind of a partner is that?

956
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,467
- Meiko, you're not powerless.

957
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,703
Meicoomon is still out there and she needs

958
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,438
you now more than ever.

959
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,907
You're still connected.

960
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,775
- Huh?

961
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,185
- I think when you're partners,

962
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,087
you become each other's best hope.

963
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,192
- Kari's right, Mei Mei.

964
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,059
You are the.

965
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,864
Now we're the only ones who can save Meicoomon.

966
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,266
- Don't ever give up.

967
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,667
There's still hope.

968
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,068
- That's it.

969
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,236
That's good.

970
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,137
Hope.

971
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,543
- One thing I still don't get.

972
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,245
When all this started, why did Meicoomon

973
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,914
get targeted in the first place?

974
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,952
There are a lot of Digimon sightings around the world,

975
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,254
but those other Digimon came later.

976
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,823
Meicoomon got here first.

977
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,259
- Maybe it's part of a bigger plan.

978
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,561
Maybe there's something that--

979
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,595
(gasps)

980
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,565
Maybe there's a switch that activates Digimon.

981
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,133
(gasps)

982
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,501
Could it be that Meicoomon's that switch?

983
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,740
- You think someone's using her to destroy the human world?

984
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,275
- That would make sense.

985
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,410
But who?

986
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:23,047
- Who do we know that would want our world wiped out?

987
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,081
- Nobody!

988
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,952
- King Drasil.

989
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,921
He's been interested in Meicoomon for a long time.

990
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:34,091
- He probably brought us back from the digital world, too.

991
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,660
We're just the next step in his scheme.

992
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,864
- So why isn't Homeostasis helping us out?

993
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,098
Or are they?

994
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,233
- Doing what?

995
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,068
Removing Meicoomon?

996
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,637
- [Daigo] Homeostasis says they have no other choice now

997
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,873
that Meicoomon is out of control.

998
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,875
- [Agumon] Tai, can you hear me?

999
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,009
We've gotta talk.

1000
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:52,943
- What is it?

1001
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:57,348
- I feel so weak trapped inside this screen

1002
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,883
with no food anywhere.

1003
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,717
(laughing)

1004
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,185
- Well, some things never change.

1005
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,888
- I need something good to eat, and fast!

1006
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,322
- [All] Yeah!

1007
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,992
- Okay, what do you want?

1008
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,060
- I'll get 'em a little bit of everything.

1009
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,364
- [Gatomon] How can you two chow down like this

1010
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,833
when we have such big problems to worry about?

1011
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,968
- [Gomamon] Problems seem smaller when you're full.

1012
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,004
- Can't save the world on an empty stomach.

1013
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,205
- Nope, no way.

1014
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,373
- Oh, you're full of something.

1015
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,374
- [Both] Thank you!

1016
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,174
- [Agumon] Bring on dessert.

1017
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,310
I can still fit a little more in.

1018
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,678
- [Sora] I guess the saying is right.

1019
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,813
The way to a Digimon's heart really

1020
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:30,948
is through their stomach.

1021
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,016
- [Agumon] Oh, I like that one.

1022
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,751
I'll have to remember it.

1023
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,153
(light music)

1024
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,757
- What a peaceful night.

1025
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,692
It's so quiet.

1026
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,593
- Yeah.

1027
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,995
Hard to believe our world is in any danger

1028
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,697
at all when it's like this.

1029
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,167
- That's the problem.

1030
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,168
- [Both] Huh?

1031
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,403
- What is?

1032
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,339
- [Kari] Well, maybe not a problem, exactly.

1033
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,141
You see, we think we know about all

1034
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,677
of the trouble in other parts of the world.

1035
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,713
We see it on the news and hear about it at school

1036
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,949
but we don't really understand it.

1037
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,751
We don't get it until it happens to us

1038
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,386
or to someone we know.

1039
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,422
- [Joe] That's a scary thought.

1040
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,091
(screaming)

1041
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,126
- [T.K.] No need for panic yet.

1042
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,227
We're about to spend the whole night

1043
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,730
in this huge empty school building.

1044
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,965
You know what that means?

1045
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,068
- I know, I know.

1046
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,970
You want us to sit on your heads.

1047
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,004
- Story time!

1048
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:27,871
- [T.K.] Ghost stories.

1049
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,707
- That is so lame.

1050
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,274
No way.

1051
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,175
- Oh come on.

1052
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,977
That's what you say every time, Matt.

1053
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,212
You're not scared, are you, bro?

1054
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,080
- I.

1055
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,448
That's not it at all.

1056
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,184
I just don't think this a time for goofing around.

1057
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,186
(whispering) - He's always like this.

1058
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,821
- Cut that out, you three!

1059
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,989
I know what you're whispering about

1060
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,256
and you're totally wrong, okay?

1061
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,458
I'm not afraid of ghosts!

1062
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,259
(muffled whispering)

1063
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,662
And the same goes for all you guys, too!

1064
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,732
(eerie music)

1065
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:58,302
- [Joe] So there I was all alone in the classroom.

1066
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,871
It sent shivers down my spine.

1067
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,806
I swear, you guys, it was the scariest thing

1068
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,408
I've ever seen in my life.

1069
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,909
Pinned to the wall.

1070
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,179
I got a B minus on the final exam!

1071
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,047
(groaning) - Really?

1072
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,784
- Come on!

1073
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,985
That's not scary.

1074
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,453
- You wanna try it again?

1075
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,788
- What do you guys want?

1076
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,123
You said tell us something scary

1077
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,225
and a B minus is the scariest thing ever.

1078
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,459
Plus, it's a true story.

1079
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,063
- Most of us would not be that scared by a bad test grade.

1080
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,264
- [Joe] Because you don't live in

1081
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,966
a constant fear of failing.

1082
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,934
- So you call that scary, huh?

1083
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,336
- [Tentomon] We would classify that as a bad joke.

1084
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,806
- Does that mean I failed the ghost story challenge?

1085
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,241
- Let me try to come up with one.

1086
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:42,012
One night this guy was wandering in his castle.

1087
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,348
- Ha, this already sounds so fake.

1088
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,283
I can tell you're just making it up.

1089
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,484
- That was so bad.

1090
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,886
Worse than Joe.

1091
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,321
- Hey! - Go, Meiko.

1092
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,256
- Huh?

1093
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,223
- You tell a story.

1094
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,058
Please?

1095
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,860
- Yeah, and make it scary this time.

1096
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,831
- Uh.

1097
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,033
Hmm.

1098
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,504
- Something from down south where you come from.

1099
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,306
- Well, my father looked down

1100
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,841
on people who believed in ghosts.

1101
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,076
- Wow, tell us about him.

1102
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,111
He sounds scary.

1103
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,413
- I don't think I ever heard a ghost story,

1104
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,149
but my mom used to read me folk tales.

1105
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,118
- We'd be happy to hear one of your folk tales.

1106
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,286
- Uh huh. - Yeah.

1107
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,489
- Well, okay.

1108
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:30,194
There was this one time when something disturbing happened

1109
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,361
that I've never forgotten.

1110
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,463
- [T.K.] Yes!

1111
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,199
Now this is the proper way to start a scary story.

1112
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,468
- [Meiko] I was walking home one night on the street

1113
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,470
a few blocks from where we lived.

1114
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,271
Every single street light was out

1115
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,208
and the only light came from the sliver of moon in the sky.

1116
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:44,942
(gasping)

1117
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,810
I knew the way home so I wasn't

1118
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,946
that worried and I kept going.

1119
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,949
But then, out of nowhere I heard a little bell

1120
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,351
somewhere behind me, like the bell on a bicycle.

1121
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,419
(bell dings)

1122
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,288
I turned around thinking someone must be behind me,

1123
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,124
but no one was there.

1124
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,960
I started walking faster.

1125
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,263
I was so close to home, but then I heard the bell again.

1126
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,065
It got closer and closer.

1127
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,167
- Wow, you don't have to keep on

1128
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,102
going if you don't feel like it.

1129
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:15,439
- Wait, I was just getting to the weird part.

1130
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,374
(nervously moaning)

1131
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,443
- So, I turned around but there was nothing there,

1132
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:20,978
same as before.

1133
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,113
Then, suddenly, I could hear breathing.

1134
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,549
It got closer, I could hear the bell again.

1135
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,052
The street lights came on.

1136
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,587
I could barely breathe.

1137
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,492
And then I saw him.

1138
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,863
(booming)

1139
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,166
(screaming)

1140
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,474
- [Daigo] What's going on in here?

1141
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,476
Why do you have the lights off?

1142
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:57,347
- [Tai] Uh, we were trying to save electricity?

1143
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,382
- Okay.

1144
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,884
I think I'm gonna check you guys into a hotel.

1145
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:01,919
- Hotel?

1146
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,488
- I thought you were going to take us all home.

1147
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,191
- There are photographers camped out on your lawns.

1148
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,459
You gotta lay low for a little while longer.

1149
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,494
- Then why move?

1150
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:11,562
- We're in a school?

1151
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,429
- Whoa!

1152
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,598
Where are we supposed to take a shower?

1153
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,000
- [Tai] There are tons of showers here in the locker rooms.

1154
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,203
And never ending hot water.

1155
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,470
- Okay, I'm sold.

1156
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,172
Anyway, I wanna hear the end of the story.

1157
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,341
- No, no ghost stories!

1158
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,476
No ghost stories, okay?

1159
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,180
- You know, Matt, you could go stay at the hotel alone.

1160
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,915
- I'm not scared!

1161
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,084
And you three, I can hear you whispering.

1162
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,287
- Well then, what next?

1163
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,223
- Well, I--

1164
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,157
- Hold up!

1165
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,125
No one's asking what I wanna do.

1166
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:42,993
- Okay, Joe.

1167
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,928
What's your plan?

1168
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,296
- I'm still workin' on it.

1169
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,497
- We'll stay.

1170
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,199
Everybody better call home.

1171
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,334
- This'll be tricky.

1172
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,435
What do I tell Mom?

1173
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,538
- Don't worry about it, just tell her you're fine.

1174
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,206
- [Tentomon] Finish your story.

1175
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,174
- Okay.

1176
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,375
Where was I?

1177
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,978
(light music)

1178
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,681
- [Kari] I can't wait to come home and see you, mom.

1179
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,117
Sure, well, let me put Tai on.

1180
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,285
- Hey, Mom.

1181
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,252
- [Yuuko] Is Agumon okay?

1182
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,555
- Are you more worried about Agumon or me?

1183
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,124
- [Yuuko] I know you're gonna be all right.

1184
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,025
(giggles)

1185
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,593
- [Tai] Oh, I see how it is.

1186
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,228
- [Yuuko] You take care of your little sister

1187
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,664
and Agumon, and Gatomon, too, okay?

1188
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:54,531
- Yeah.

1189
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,732
- [Yuuko] And be careful.

1190
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,667
- Yeah.

1191
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,135
- And Tai?

1192
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,369
It's just like old times.

1193
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,570
- [Tai] That's one way to put it.

1194
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,274
- All your friends and their Digimon are together again.

1195
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,275
- [Tai] Yeah.

1196
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:08,312
Yeah, it's like a Digi reunion.

1197
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,646
- Goodnight, Tai.

1198
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,322
- If she only knew.

1199
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,091
- You hung up?

1200
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,492
- You can call her back.

1201
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,161
I'm going outside for a minute.

1202
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,196
- [Meiko] Y'all don't have to keep

1203
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,432
on asking me if I'm okay so many times.

1204
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,200
I told you, I'm fine.

1205
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,337
I'm not alone.

1206
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,205
You know that.

1207
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,009
Sorry about Meicoomon.

1208
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,645
What do I think?

1209
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:45,382
Well, it's confusing.

1210
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,249
Goodnight, then.

1211
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,287
(light music)

1212
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,488
FATHER

1213
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,657
That was a lie.

1214
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,495
I told him I was okay but I'm not.

1215
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,798
Not even a little.

1216
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:06,236
Meicoomon, what am I supposed to do?

1217
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,106
Are you to blame?

1218
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,508
I heard what Gennai said.

1219
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,444
That you were never even meant to be born.

1220
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,313
Is that the truth?

1221
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,181
Is that why you're so angry now?

1222
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,219
Oh, Mei, I still love you so much.

1223
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,620
I really thought we would keep playing

1224
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:24,821
like children forever.

1225
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,592
I don't know what I'll do without you.

1226
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,595
Everyone keeps telling me that you and I are partners,

1227
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,297
that I'm your salvation and you're mine.

1228
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,532
But what if they're wrong?

1229
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,568
Why is my stomach always in knots?

1230
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,805
'Cause I'm sad?

1231
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:42,672
Maybe.

1232
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,208
(gasping)

1233
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,209
Tai.

1234
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,413
- I wasn't trying to spy on you or anything,

1235
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,315
but I heard you talking.

1236
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,651
Was that a southern accent you were using?

1237
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,853
I've never heard you talk like that before.

1238
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,821
It's kinda cool.

1239
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,792
Sorry.

1240
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,560
- Well, aren't you a peach, hun?

1241
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,598
It's a southern way of saying you're a nice guy.

1242
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,866
- Oh.

1243
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,535
Well, thanks.

1244
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,436
I guess.

1245
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,140
- [Palmon] She told him he's like a nice piece of fruit?

1246
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,809
- Kari should know about this.

1247
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,378
- I think I oughta tell Sora about it.

1248
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,480
- Maybe I should give Matt a report.

1249
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,614
- [Tentomon] A report about what?

1250
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,283
That didn't even make any sense.

1251
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,918
- What do you think, Agumon?

1252
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,454
- [Agumon] I love this floor!

1253
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,423
- [Meiko] So what do they see?

1254
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,891
- Wavelength distortions.

1255
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,627
Izzy made 'em.

1256
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,496
I used to think that they were some things

1257
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:40,897
you could see when you were a kid

1258
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,533
that you didn't see anymore after you grew up.

1259
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,936
And I believed the flip side was true, too.

1260
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,238
Things that you never noticed when you were little

1261
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,241
suddenly seemed really obvious when you got older.

1262
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,442
I even thought time would turn

1263
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,644
me into somebody totally different.

1264
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,814
Lately, though, I just keep wondering about it.

1265
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,649
When is all that supposed to happen?

1266
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,553
Then when I saw Agumon again I wondered

1267
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,888
if we were still connected.

1268
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,294
Except it was like we'd never been apart.

1269
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,462
Really.

1270
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:16,800
And just like that I knew everything was gonna be okay.

1271
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,236
That we'd always be connected.

1272
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,904
- You truly are partners.

1273
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,978
Mine should never have been born.

1274
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,380
- Gennai said that, but he's wrong.

1275
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,949
- What if he wasn't even talking about Meicoomon, though?

1276
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:33,817
What if he meant me?

1277
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,851
Think about it, Tai.

1278
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,554
If I was never born then I wouldn't have a partner

1279
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,789
and Meicoomon would never have gotten infected--

1280
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,892
- Mochizuki, shut up!

1281
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,729
Sorry.

1282
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,230
I didn't mean to be a jerk.

1283
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,239
But you do know that's not true, right?

1284
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,340
Have some faith.

1285
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,916
- [Meiko] I've really made him angry.

1286
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:06,783
Great.

1287
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,687
- [Agumon] Hey there, how's it going?

1288
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:12,856
- [Meiko] Oh.

1289
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:13,523
Hi, Agumon.

1290
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,027
- [Digimon] Why did we send Agumon out there?

1291
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,729
- Because he should be the one to clean up Tai's mess.

1292
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,765
- I think Tai should clean up Tai's mess.

1293
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,833
- I hate it when things are messy.

1294
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,335
- So, listen.

1295
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,371
Let's go get something to eat.

1296
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,607
- Huh? (groaning)

1297
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,275
- He's hopeless.

1298
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,777
- [Meiko] You're funny, Agumon.

1299
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,978
- [Agumon] You're not hungry?

1300
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:35,879
- No, but.

1301
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,749
I do feel kind of empty in here.

1302
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,818
- Your heart is hungry?

1303
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,453
- Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

1304
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,422
- Doesn't he ever think about anything else?

1305
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,023
(giggling)

1306
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,526
- That's not what I meant, but it's close.

1307
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,563
I feel like I'm missing out.

1308
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,335
On what you and Tai have.

1309
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,570
And Gabumon and Matt.

1310
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,639
And well, all of you.

1311
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,608
- I get it.

1312
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,810
- And I'm really sorry for all

1313
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:08,311
the trouble I caused you guys.

1314
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,749
- Well, you never cause any trouble at all.

1315
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,652
I think you're talking about someone else.

1316
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,054
(light music)

1317
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,964
But that's not your fault, either.

1318
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:28,665
- Huh?

1319
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,067
- You know, I miss Meicoomon.

1320
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,369
I like her a lot.

1321
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,772
I think everything's gonna be okay.

1322
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,841
(crying)

1323
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,478
- [Meiko] Oh, thank you, Agumon.

1324
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:42,646
That means a lot to me.

1325
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,682
- And I'm sure that Meicoomon loves you

1326
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,417
a whole lot too, Meiko.

1327
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,354
- Hey, look, I think it worked.

1328
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,956
- Or she's really upset.

1329
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,391
- [Tentomon] Why are humans so confusing?

1330
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,493
- I should ask Sora what this means.

1331
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:57,560
- She's still hugging him.

1332
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,095
- I gotta report this to Joe.

1333
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,897
- I should tell Kari so she can tell Tai.

1334
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,767
- [Tentomon] But we don't even know what really happened.

1335
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,741
- [Agumon] Hey, Tai.

1336
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:12,876
- Huh?

1337
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,411
Oh, hi, Agumon.

1338
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,514
I'm feeling kinda bad.

1339
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:18,682
- [Agumon] How come?

1340
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,083
- 'Cause of Meiko.

1341
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:20,917
I yelled at her.

1342
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,386
- [Agumon] Oh yeah, that was bad.

1343
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,421
- You were spying on us?

1344
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,588
- [Agumon] Uh, no?

1345
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,157
- Don't worry about it.

1346
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,626
- [Agumon] Why did you yell at her in the first place, Tai?

1347
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,061
- I'm not really sure.

1348
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,830
- [Agumon] I'll bet it's 'cause you were hangry.

1349
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:34,698
- No.

1350
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,535
(sighs)

1351
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,604
Do you think Kari's right about how we

1352
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,140
don't get things until they happen to us?

1353
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,042
Or to someone we know?

1354
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:49,045
And what about understanding other people's feelings?

1355
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,580
How's that even possible?

1356
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,584
I worry that there's no way I can really understand

1357
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:55,785
what Meiko's feeling right now.

1358
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,889
I don't know what it's like inside her head.

1359
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,859
And I'm worried that I don't know how to help her.

1360
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,961
I feel so useless.

1361
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,630
And then I start worrying about the fact that I'm worrying.

1362
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,200
- Maybe your brain is too full

1363
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,570
and it's time to stop thinking so much.

1364
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:14,871
(Tai sighs)

1365
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,706
Don't be sad, Tai.

1366
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,676
When the time comes, you'll know just what to do.

1367
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,846
- [Tai] I hope you're right.

1368
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,750
(zapping)

1369
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,721
(dramatic music)

1370
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,559
(growling)

1371
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,163
(screaming)

1372
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,499
(gasping)

1373
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,001
- Meicoomon's here.

1374
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,906
(roaring)

1375
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:50,774
- Listen!

1376
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:51,741
Meicoomon!

1377
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,209
- I'm here.

1378
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,545
Meicoomon, it's all right.

1379
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,181
Meicoomon, you have to stop this.

1380
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,649
Let me help you.

1381
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,618
This is not who you are!

1382
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,720
(yelling)

1383
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,655
I know you got this way because of me.

1384
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:06,122
- Huh?

1385
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,192
- I'm the reason all of this is happening!

1386
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:10,393
I let you down.

1387
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:14,764
You got like this because you were trying to protect me.

1388
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:15,832
- Don't say that.

1389
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,169
- I'm to blame.

1390
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,540
Meicoomon, aren't we still partners?

1391
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:26,042
(roaring)

1392
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,111
(glass shattering)

1393
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,146
Can't I save you?

1394
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,848
Can't we save each other?

1395
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,050
- That blue mist.

1396
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,187
That film surrounded her at the power plant

1397
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,589
right before the explosion.

1398
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,924
- Agumon? - Say the word!

1399
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,058
- No, don't.

1400
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,061
If they go in they could all wind up getting infected.

1401
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,764
We don't dare risk having that happen again.

1402
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,698
- That's right!

1403
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,669
- We gotta do it.

1404
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:53,536
- Yeah.

1405
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,204
- Are you sure?

1406
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,540
- [Agumon] Let's go, Tai.

1407
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,778
(dramatic music)

1408
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,853
(rock music)

1409
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,189
(light music)

1410
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,031
- [All] Digivolve to...

1411
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:40,350
(singing in foreign language)

1412
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,251
- Greymon!

1413
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,953
- Birdramon!

1414
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,622
- Alphamon! - Angemon.

1415
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:46,289
- Koromon.

1416
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,291
- [Ikkakumon] Ikkakumon!

1417
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,634
- [All] Digivolve to...

1418
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,245
- MetalGreymon! - WereGarurumon.

1419
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,346
- MagnaAngemon!

1420
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,981
- Birdramon!

1421
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,150
- MegaKabuterimon.

1422
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,586
(grunting)

1423
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,124
- Move in.

1424
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,191
Surround her!

1425
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:28,831
(screaming)

1426
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,333
(gasping)

1427
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,602
(cawing)

1428
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,875
(eerie music)

1429
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,244
- Meiko?

1430
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,981
(soft whimpering)

1431
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,986
(screaming)

1432
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,287
(gasping)

1433
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,823
(zapping)

1434
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:54,891
- She's scared.

1435
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,961
She's crying.

1436
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:01,230
- [Tai] Then why does it look

1437
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,933
like she's getting even stronger?

1438
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,834
(yelling)

1439
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:05,935
(zapping)

1440
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:06,803
- [Joe] Oh no!

1441
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:07,470
Zudomon!

1442
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,240
- Yeah, that's what's happening.

1443
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,241
Look.

1444
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,311
The distortion around Meicoomon is growing.

1445
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,579
- Unbelievable.

1446
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,750
Could she be gaining power as she gets more and more upset?

1447
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,418
(grunting)

1448
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,419
(screaming)

1449
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,454
(zapping)

1450
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:27,156
(booming)

1451
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,224
(gasping)

1452
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,792
- She's destroying everything.

1453
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:30,893
But why?

1454
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:33,696
Doesn't she understand we're just trying to help her?

1455
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,031
- No! - Meicoomon!

1456
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,436
(zapping)

1457
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,304
(booming)

1458
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,839
(panting)

1459
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,041
- [Joe] She knocked 'em all out with one hit!

1460
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,111
- It's arrived.

1461
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,016
(grunting)

1462
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:59,355
(booming) (dramatic music)

1463
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,224
- What's that?

1464
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:04,761
- [Daiga] That is a Digimon sent by Homeostasis.

1465
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,229
- Homeostasis?

1466
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:14,037
- Jesmon.

1467
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,172
(roaring)

1468
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,178
(evil laughing)

1469
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,312
- [Man] There it goes!

1470
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,782
You should've known better.

1471
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,150
Thank you, Homeostasis.

1472
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,152
This is fascinating.

1473
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,989
(gasping)

1474
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:38,961
- Oh no!

1475
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:39,962
What is that?

1476
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,464
- It's erasing everything.

1477
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,766
Her mere existence is destructive.

1478
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,103
(grunting)

1479
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:50,006
(screaming)

1480
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,141
(booming)

1481
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,412
- Meicoomon!

1482
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,114
- This doesn't make any sense.

1483
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,284
Didn't Homeostasis tell us to take care of Meicoomon?

1484
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,186
What's going on?

1485
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,254
- Maybe it's all part of their plan.

1486
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,923
Maybe they just don't need us anymore

1487
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:08,791
so now they're cutting us off.

1488
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,827
- Up until now I thought it was King Drasil

1489
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,262
who wanted to get rid of us and remove

1490
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,997
us from the digital world.

1491
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,800
But maybe it was really Homeostasis.

1492
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:20,736
- Now what?

1493
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,939
Just who are we supposed to be fighting?

1494
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,009
(dramatic music)

1495
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,444
(booming)

1496
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:29,512
What do we do?

1497
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,316
I don't know who our real enemy is anymore.

1498
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,894
(booming)

1499
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:50,366
(zapping) (grunting)

1500
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,339
(thudding)

1501
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,407
(booming)

1502
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,410
(screaming)

1503
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,513
(panting)

1504
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:05,615
(grunting)

1505
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:06,849
- Meiko!

1506
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,051
(grunting)

1507
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:14,290
(thudding)

1508
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:18,861
- Whoa, did you all see what I just saw?

1509
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:19,529
- [Mimi] Yeah, I did.

1510
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:20,596
- I did, too.

1511
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,633
Meicoomon just saved Meiko from getting crushed.

1512
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:24,967
- But wait.

1513
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:25,902
What does that mean?

1514
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,538
- [Mimi] It means they're still partners!

1515
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:29,405
(grunting)

1516
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,541
(thudding)

1517
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:35,044
- Well, then shouldn't we be trying to protect Meicoomon?

1518
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,312
- We have to.

1519
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,481
- [Matt] Tai, time to level up!

1520
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,016
- You're right.

1521
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,984
MetalGreymon, Digivolve and then see

1522
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,520
if you can lure Meicoomon out over the ocean.

1523
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,224
- [MetalGreymon] MetalGreymon, Digivolve to...

1524
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,626
(light music)

1525
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,505
WarGreymon!

1526
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,411
- Let's get in on this.

1527
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,113
- MagnaAngemon! - Lillymon!

1528
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,583
- WereGarurumon. - MegaKabuterimon.

1529
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,518
- [All] Digivolve to...

1530
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,890
(singing in foreign language)

1531
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,696
- Phoenixmon. - Rosemon.

1532
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:29,532
- Seraphimon. - HerculesKabuterimon.

1533
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,067
- MetalGarurumon.

1534
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,904
(grunting)

1535
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,406
- To the ocean!

1536
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,276
(heavy breathing)

1537
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,478
- Stop this.

1538
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,380
Your quest is hopeless.

1539
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,414
- What did you say?

1540
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:48,017
- You are merely being foolish.

1541
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,485
- Homeostasis.

1542
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:52,021
- Why do you think we're being foolish?

1543
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,390
- [Homeostasis] Harmony and stability must be maintained.

1544
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:55,725
Anything that obstructs harmony

1545
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,727
and stability will be removed.

1546
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,729
- [Tai] That's why you wanna get rid of Meicoomon?

1547
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,664
- As if we'd let that happen!

1548
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,532
- We are merely finishing the task

1549
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,268
you were unable to complete.

1550
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,704
Anyone who endangers our objectives

1551
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,539
will also be removed.

1552
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:11,540
- [Matt] You wouldn't dare!

1553
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,342
- Just wait a minute.

1554
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,977
That's outrageous.

1555
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,179
The DigiDestined are not your pawns.

1556
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,282
- There is nothing anyone can do to help.

1557
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,117
Your interference will be stopped.

1558
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,351
- No way.

1559
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,220
I'll never abandon my friends.

1560
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,056
- Our friends.

1561
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,659
(dramatic music)

1562
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,628
(booming)

1563
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:35,131
(screaming)

1564
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,602
- That Digimon is beyond your control.

1565
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,304
- What good is harmony if you destroy

1566
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,072
someone's life in the process?

1567
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,674
- [Homeostasis] Some sacrifices are required.

1568
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,008
- [Matt] Just like that, huh?

1569
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,277
- Stop using me to say things!

1570
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,145
Get out of me!

1571
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:50,446
- Yes.

1572
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,113
Good.

1573
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:55,051
- Get out of my head right now, whoever you are.

1574
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,019
You're wrong about everything you said.

1575
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,788
They're our friends, and one of our friends

1576
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,489
is suffering because of you!

1577
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:02,425
A sacrifice?

1578
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,626
How selfish are you?

1579
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:05,494
We won't allow it.

1580
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,697
(laughing)

1581
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,503
- At this point, it is too late

1582
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,173
for you to do anything about it.

1583
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,176
Your concept of teamwork has failed you this time.

1584
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,610
It's over.

1585
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,481
(singing in foreign language)

1586
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:27,650
(grunting)

1587
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,185
(gasping)

1588
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:32,088
- Meiko, no!

1589
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,390
(panting)

1590
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,625
(grunting)

1591
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,736
- [Izzy] The distortion is closing!

1592
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,471
- We need Omnimon.

1593
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:49,505
- Come on, Matt.

1594
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,474
- [Matt] Let's save our friends.

1595
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,609
(yelling)

1596
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,687
- [Omnimon] Omnimon!

1597
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:14,663
- [Meiko] There it is!

1598
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,098
- [Tai] We're right behind you.

1599
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:16,766
(grunting)

1600
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:17,633
- [Sora] Here we go.

1601
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,835
(grunting)

1602
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,182
(yelling)

1603
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,886
- Celestial arrow!

1604
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,288
(thudding)

1605
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,860
- We got a message for you, Homeostasis!

1606
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,597
What you tell us is right or wrong doesn't matter.

1607
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,599
What matters is this.

1608
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,701
Looking out for each other.

1609
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,503
We will always protect our friends.

1610
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,648
(dramatic music)

1611
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,184
(shattering)

1612
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,755
- Alphamon.

1613
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:13,823
- Why, King Drasil?

1614
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,359
(thudding)

1615
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,561
(grunting)

1616
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,464
(gasping) - Seraphimon!

1617
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,266
(dramatic music)

1618
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,703
(clanking) (grunting)

1619
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,905
(groaning)

1620
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,575
Look out!

1621
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,811
Alphamon's about to blast you both!

1622
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,180
(zapping)

1623
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,484
He blasted everybody.

1624
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,752
(screaming)

1625
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,190
(panting)

1626
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,628
(clanking)

1627
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:57,233
(zapping) (screaming)

1628
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,641
(water trickling)

1629
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,849
- Tapirmon, why are you doing this?

1630
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,918
Why won't you come back to me?

1631
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,654
You can't just leave me after all this time.

1632
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,356
You can't leave me with them.

1633
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,793
(suspenseful music)

1634
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,661
(gun clicking)

1635
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,363
Stay away, creeps.

1636
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,265
Stay away or I'll dust you all!

1637
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,967
Tapirmon, please!

1638
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,435
Please come back!

1639
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,372
Let's save the world.

1640
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,607
I'm still your partner, aren't I?

1641
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:39,475
I'm.

1642
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,310
I'm begging you.

1643
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,645
Come back-- (wave crashing)

1644
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:43,679
It's too late!

1645
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,814
(gasping)

1646
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,486
(gasping)

1647
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,258
(grunting)

1648
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,294
- [Daigo Voiceover] I couldn't save you, Hime.

1649
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,330
When it came down to it I couldn't do anything.

1650
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,566
(blasting)

1651
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,401
(light music)

1652
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:08,370
If we're all really this powerless.

1653
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:11,240
Then why were we chosen in the first place?

1654
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,411
(water rippling)

1655
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,515
(crashing)

1656
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,650
(grunting)

1657
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,852
(blasting)

1658
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:29,825
- I don't even know who to root for anymore.

1659
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,261
(clanking)

1660
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:38,434
- Meicoomon, you have to stop this or they'll destroy you.

1661
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,736
If not for yourself, do it for your partner.

1662
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:43,939
Can't you see what this is doing to Meiko?

1663
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,474
Don't you care?

1664
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,843
Don't you have any feelings left for her?

1665
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:51,914
- No.

1666
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:56,785
Just please kill her.

1667
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:57,720
Just do it.

1668
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,357
It'll be better for everyone

1669
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,560
if Meicoomon is destroyed forever.

1670
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,462
(grunting)

1671
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,329
- You don't mean it.

1672
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:10,032
- Mei Mei, don't even think like that!

1673
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,635
(booming)

1674
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:13,502
- Why?

1675
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,872
What else can I think about?

1676
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:20,476
I can't take it anymore, I can't.

1677
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,611
(roaring)

1678
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,115
(clanking)

1679
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,249
- Listen, Meiko.

1680
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:30,452
You've gotta let your partner know there's still hope.

1681
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,186
You're just.

1682
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,889
You're just giving off despair.

1683
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,525
- [Meiko] Because I know what has to happen to now.

1684
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:39,461
- Meiko.

1685
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:43,065
You can't really believe that.

1686
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:46,835
You think killing Meicoomon is really our only hope?

1687
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,337
- [Meiko] Please don't.

1688
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:50,873
(clanking)

1689
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:52,007
- This is awful.

1690
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,376
I just can't believe this is real.

1691
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,678
It's just too sad.

1692
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,517
- Oh, Mei.

1693
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,686
I still love you so much.

1694
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,060
Homeostasis said Meicoomon had to be destroyed

1695
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,761
to restore harmony.

1696
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,963
Meicoomon is the problem.

1697
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,465
- She's right.

1698
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,566
- No, Tai.

1699
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:18,667
- No way, Tai.

1700
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:22,004
- I'm going to stop Omnimon from fighting Meicoomon.

1701
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,672
It's taking too long and he may never

1702
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,674
be able to defeat her.

1703
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,642
Stop!

1704
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:27,810
- Tai.

1705
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,412
- If Omnimon can't destroy Meicoomon, then Jesmon will.

1706
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,814
This is the only way.

1707
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,015
- Just hang on, guys.

1708
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:36,051
Even if Meicoomon is the reason everything's gone wrong--

1709
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,152
- Calm down, Joe.

1710
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,120
- It's not fair!

1711
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:38,954
This is wrong.

1712
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,690
Meicoomon and Meiko are partners.

1713
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,092
They'll be partners forever.

1714
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,126
- He's right.

1715
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,929
So what if Meicoomon does deserve all the blame

1716
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,931
and she should be destroyed?

1717
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,433
Can you really make that call, Tai?

1718
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,836
- Yeah, I can.

1719
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,671
And I will.

1720
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,172
We're going to end this ourselves.

1721
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:00,142
We don't have to let Homeostasis have the final say.

1722
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,811
Maybe we can figure out how to restore balance.

1723
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:07,916
Meicoomon is one of us.

1724
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:09,785
That's that.

1725
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,955
We protect our own!

1726
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,792
I will not run from a friend in pain,

1727
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:19,795
and all of us are so much more than that.

1728
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,163
We are the DigiDestined.

1729
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,634
(pounding)

1730
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:29,238
- Oh, things are definitely out of control.

1731
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,839
- [Tai] No, you idiot!

1732
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,207
Stop fighting!

1733
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,513
(dramatic music)

1734
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,152
- Meicoomon.

1735
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,826
It's going to be okay.

1736
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:54,763
I'm sorry.

1737
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,002
(thudding)

1738
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,738
(cracking)

1739
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,940
(groaning)

1740
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,844
(zapping)

1741
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:10,813
- [Sora] Don't watch.

1742
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,685
- It didn't help.

1743
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,787
- Let me tell you something, Tai.

1744
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:21,790
My plans do not include sacrificing any of our friends.

1745
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:22,658
Not ever!

1746
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:23,525
If you-- - Whoa!

1747
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:24,660
Break it up, you guys.

1748
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,061
We're in this together.

1749
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,129
All of us.

1750
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,303
(booming)

1751
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,705
(grunting)

1752
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,543
- [Tai] Sorry, Matt.

1753
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,846
(screaming)

1754
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:49,785
- Thank you.

1755
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:56,725
- [Sora] Meiko, where are you going?

1756
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,093
- Mei Mei! - Wait, you fool,

1757
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,294
you can't go out there!

1758
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,163
- [Tai] Come back here, both of you!

1759
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,966
- [Meiko] This is my decision.

1760
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,570
- Stop, you guys.

1761
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:09,905
- [Mimi] But we have to help them.

1762
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:10,806
- I'll handle it.

1763
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,541
- Take me! - Stop!

1764
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,079
(zapping)

1765
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,013
(grunting)

1766
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:19,748
No. - Let me go.

1767
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,649
Let me go!

1768
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:22,951
(screaming)

1769
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,152
- Un Pour Tous.

1770
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,791
(dramatic music)

1771
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,000
(blasting)

1772
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,204
(gasping)

1773
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,071
- Jesmon.

1774
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,614
(blasting)

1775
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,819
(rumbling)

1776
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:11,366
- [Tai] Matt!

1777
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,769
(grunting)

1778
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,109
(groaning)

1779
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,611
- Are you all right?

1780
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,083
Come on.

1781
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:28,984
Run.

1782
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,090
- [Tai] Omnimon!

1783
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:46,969
Hey!

1784
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,303
- Come back!

1785
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,739
(grunting)

1786
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,407
- Look out!

1787
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,776
(rumbling)

1788
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,147
- [Daigo] Hold on, Tai!

1789
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,359
(crashing)

1790
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:12,694
- Oh no.

1791
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,703
(grunting)

1792
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,839
(gasping)

1793
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:34,950
- [T.K] Tai.

1794
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,452
Where'd he go?

1795
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,021
- Brother.

1796
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,822
- [Gatomon] Kari, what happened?

1797
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:42,891
Where are we going?

1798
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:45,060
Are we gonna find Tai?

1799
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,062
- Find Tai.

1800
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,330
- Wait for me!

1801
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,135
- Where's my brother?

1802
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:55,370
Oh, Tai.

1803
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,041
How could you go and just leave me behind?

1804
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,009
- Wait!

1805
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:03,912
Wherever you're going, I wanna go, too.

1806
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,715
(dramatic music)

1807
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:12,254
- Kari.

1808
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:13,488
- What's happening to her?

1809
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:16,825
- [Izzy] Let me look.

1810
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:21,897
I think it's.

1811
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:25,967
- Oh, brother.

1812
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,003
You fool.

1813
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,772
- [T.K] Kari!

1814
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,174
- What's happening?

1815
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,308
I feel funny.

1816
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,011
What should I do?

1817
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,988
(blasting)

1818
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,232
(gasping)

1819
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,036
- [Sora] What is that, Izzy?

1820
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,438
- [Izzy] That is prodigious.

1821
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,779
(grunting)

1822
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,417
(screaming)

1823
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:18,286
- Even that didn't stop Meicoomon.

1824
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,563
- How sensitive and so fragile.

1825
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:32,033
The more innocent they are, the easier it is to break them.

1826
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,168
(laughing)

1827
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:34,870
- Kari! - Snap out of it!

1828
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,104
Get ahold of yourself!

1829
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:38,907
(dramatic music)

1830
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,414
(screaming)

1831
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,282
- Do it.

1832
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:50,152
Take over.

1833
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:08,603
- [Meiko] Why is this happening?

1834
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,074
- [Mimi] What?

1835
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:13,942
What is it, Izzy?

1836
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,143
- [Izzy] I don't know.

1837
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,511
It looks like chaos.

1838
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:30,926
(gasping)

1839
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,530

1840
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,507
(groaning)

1841
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:49,544
- Destroy it all.

1842
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:54,916
- Disappear.

1843
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,519
Everything, disappear.

1844
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,304
- [Meiko] What's going on?

1845
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,277
- I think the harmony has started to collapse.

1846
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,651
(roaring)

1847
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,688
(splashing)

1848
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,500
Maybe this was always King Drasil's plan.

1849
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,669
This was his goal.

1850
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,206
Our world is going to be swallowed by the digital world.

1851
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,213
- Why does Homeostasis have such

1852
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,749
a big problem with us trying to save our friends?

1853
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,317
What's wrong with that?

1854
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,618
- Thanks a lot, Tai.

1855
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:07,589
Everyone, on your feet.

1856
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:08,556
- And do what?

1857
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,259
- And fight, obviously.

1858
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,329
What's sitting around gonna do?

1859
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:16,531
What's feeling sorry for ourselves gonna do?

1860
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:19,134
None of that's gonna help anybody.

1861
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,202
You can save your tears for later.

1862
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:23,705
It's time to stand up and get moving!

1863
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:26,308
(light music)

1864
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:36,351
We still have each other, and we still have hope.

1865
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,119
We have not been defeated.

1866
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:43,425
- [Koromon] Where is Tai?

1867
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:45,327
Come back!

1868
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,064
Where'd you go?

1869
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,067
- [Matt] Stop that, Koromon!

1870
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,437
- But I'm supposed to protect him.

1871
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,072
And now I can't.

1872
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:57,772
My heart.

1873
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,475
It feels empty.

1874
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,244
No Tai?

1875
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,283
- I'm sorry. - Don't apologize.

1876
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:08,950
It's done.

1877
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,519
Tai did what he wanted to do.

1878
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:18,293
- Now what?

1879
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,160
- We go.

1880
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:26,368
