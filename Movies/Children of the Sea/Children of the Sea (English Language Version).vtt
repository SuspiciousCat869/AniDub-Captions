00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.277 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.553 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Go ahead, they said.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.255 position:21% line:89% align:start
So I opened my eyes.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.060 position:19% line:89% align:start
I was inside the ocean.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.231 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.236 position:33% line:83% align:start
My mom and I
reached out our hands.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.044 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.681 position:16% line:89% align:start
The fish all followed me,

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.418 position:24% line:89% align:start
everywhere I went.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:56.422 position:24% line:89% align:start
(mysterious music)

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
These are memories
from when I was little.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.441 position:19% line:89% align:start
(dramatic violin music)

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.684 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Is this the song?

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.488 position:44% line:89% align:start
- No.

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
These whales are singing
in response to the song.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
(dolphins clicking)

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Man] The dolphins are
migrating in response to it.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's categorically different

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:41.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
from any other whale song.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:51.578 position:7% line:83% align:start
- [Dehdeh] It's still far, but
it's gradually getting closer.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:55.415 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.154 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:21.809 position:7% line:89% align:start
From the star, from the stars,

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:24.545 position:19% line:89% align:start
the sea is the mother.

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:33.888 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's finally time.

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.658 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.648 position:27% line:89% align:start
(seagulls cawing)

00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:30.879 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gate rumbling)

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.820 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.372 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Yes!

00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:58.373 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm flying!

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.344 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:04.013 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Great shot, Ruka!

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:05.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're light on your feet today!

00:04:09.753 --> 00:04:11.654 position:27% line:89% align:start
(insect chirping)

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:13.623 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Ruka] Of course
I'm light on my feet!

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:15.024 position:13% line:89% align:start
Summer break starts today.

00:04:15.058 --> 00:04:17.292 position:35% line:83% align:start
In summer,
my whole body feels light.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.462 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Friend] Nice!

00:04:19.496 --> 00:04:20.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Friend] Ruka, great shot!

00:04:20.563 --> 00:04:23.366 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.768 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Ruka, you're
doing great today!

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:25.935 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Way to go, Ruka!

00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:30.573 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Oh, she's gotta be careful
when she's doing this well.

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:31.407 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:42.352 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Oops, my bad.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.724 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's what you
get for showing off.

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:55.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
(whistle blowing)

00:04:57.768 --> 00:04:59.970 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:03.473 position:13% line:89% align:start
- What happened, your nose?

00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:04.474 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:06.677 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Ruka's elbow, it hit
her on that last shot.

00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:10.915 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Girl] I think she
did it on purpose.

00:05:10.948 --> 00:05:13.517 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Well, she may
have a broken nose.

00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:14.919 position:7% line:89% align:start
Take her to the nurse's office.

00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:22.893 position:24% line:89% align:start
(groaning)(sobbing)

00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:25.396 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Ruka, you went
too far this time.

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:28.065 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Yeah, I know she tripped
you and all, but still.

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:30.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
- But...

00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:35.606 position:35% line:89% align:start
But she...

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.374 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Coach] Ruka!

00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:38.042 position:41% line:89% align:start
- She--

00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:39.810 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Ruka!

00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:42.012 position:27% line:83% align:start
I want to see you
in my office, please.

00:05:45.883 --> 00:05:48.452 position:33% line:89% align:start
(fan blowing)

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:49.921 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:52.389 position:10% line:83% align:start
So this is how we're starting
our summer break, is it?

00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:56.660 position:10% line:83% align:start
You really enjoy being quite
the troublemaker, don't you?

00:05:56.694 --> 00:05:57.863 position:24% line:89% align:start
Teammate, opponent.

00:05:57.896 --> 00:05:59.396 position:13% line:89% align:start
How many has it been, huh?

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:03.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
So tell me, why did
you hurt her like that?

00:06:05.203 --> 00:06:06.503 position:44% line:89% align:start
Well?

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:07.404 position:27% line:89% align:start
Anything to say?

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:11.676 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Well, she started it.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.713 position:27% line:83% align:start
- So none of this
is your fault, huh?

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:16.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Ruka] That's not
what I meant.

00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:23.088 position:10% line:89% align:start
- So, this was all her fault.

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:25.590 position:30% line:89% align:start
All right then.

00:06:30.562 --> 00:06:33.431 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, I need to go check on her.

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.668 position:30% line:83% align:start
I might have to
take her to the hospital.

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:38.737 position:27% line:89% align:start
You can go home.

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:41.107 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Okay.

00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:48.713 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you
send me to the nurse too?

00:06:48.747 --> 00:06:50.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Coach] Oh, and
one more thing.

00:06:52.218 --> 00:06:54.786 position:33% line:83% align:start
If you're not
going to apologize,

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:56.454 position:10% line:89% align:start
no need to come to practice.

00:07:09.902 --> 00:07:12.504 position:33% line:89% align:start
(zipper zips)

00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:16.175 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:55.015 position:30% line:89% align:start
(train running)

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:01.620 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Today was just the first day,

00:08:03.857 --> 00:08:07.660 position:19% line:83% align:start
but now my summer break
is already over.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.899 position:21% line:89% align:start
(somber piano music)

00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:47.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aw, man!

00:08:49.803 --> 00:08:51.538 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't fly anymore.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:02.884 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.186 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka sighs)

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.269 position:24% line:83% align:start
- So, what are you
doing on break?

00:09:21.302 --> 00:09:23.071 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Celebrating fun.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.239 position:30% line:83% align:start
- I'm jealous,
I want to go on a trip!

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I'll take care of the
team stuff before I go.

00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:28.276 position:33% line:83% align:start
- Sounds like
you're gonna be busy.

00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:29.243 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Yeah, it does!

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.679 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't think
my family's going anywhere.

00:09:31.712 --> 00:09:33.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're just visiting
the family grave.

00:09:33.147 --> 00:09:34.383 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Hey, want to go to a movie?

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:35.350 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Totally!

00:09:35.384 --> 00:09:36.050 position:30% line:89% align:start
Would love to.

00:09:36.084 --> 00:09:37.352 position:7% line:89% align:start
- [Girl] Yeah, me too, I'm in.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:38.686 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Girl] Cool, let's go!

00:09:40.988 --> 00:09:44.058 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:02.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
- I wonder how badly I hurt her.

00:10:05.347 --> 00:10:06.882 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:10:06.915 --> 00:10:09.918 position:21% line:89% align:start
(somber piano music)

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:22.664 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka gasps)

00:10:22.698 --> 00:10:23.832 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been so long.

00:10:26.802 --> 00:10:27.870 position:33% line:89% align:start
The aquarium.

00:10:34.109 --> 00:10:36.879 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:50.226 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Woman] Next up,
Enokura Aquarium.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.195 position:5% line:89% align:start
We will be arriving momentarily.

00:10:57.933 --> 00:10:58.967 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Wonder Aquarium!

00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:03.006 position:16% line:89% align:start
See the Wonder Aquarium!

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:03.872 position:38% line:89% align:start
Welcome.

00:11:03.907 --> 00:11:05.909 position:35% line:83% align:start
Today's the
first day of the exhibit.

00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:07.043 position:38% line:83% align:start
- Ready?
- Enjoy!

00:11:07.076 --> 00:11:08.478 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:09.445 position:38% line:83% align:start
Bye bye!
- Thanks a lot.

00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:10.947 position:38% line:83% align:start
- Thanks.
- Bye bye!

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.814 position:33% line:89% align:start
Can I see it?

00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:13.483 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Here you go.

00:11:13.516 --> 00:11:15.185 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Oh, thanks.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.325 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Wait, excuse me.

00:11:22.358 --> 00:11:24.127 position:30% line:83% align:start
But aren't you
Mr. Azumi's daughter?

00:11:26.396 --> 00:11:27.297 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.498 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ruka's here?

00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:29.533 position:24% line:89% align:start
You recognized her?

00:11:29.567 --> 00:11:31.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
- (chuckles) She has your
eyes, so it was easy.

00:11:31.535 --> 00:11:32.802 position:7% line:89% align:start
Plus she came here all the time

00:11:32.835 --> 00:11:34.170 position:13% line:89% align:start
when she was a little girl.

00:11:34.204 --> 00:11:35.138 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Why is she here?

00:11:35.171 --> 00:11:37.040 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm tied up at the moment.

00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:38.409 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can you tell her to
come find me?

00:11:38.442 --> 00:11:40.109 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm behind the big tank.

00:11:40.143 --> 00:11:41.144 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, thanks.

00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:44.147 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Chief, the sardines are here.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.215 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Oh, right.

00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:47.917 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I'll show you where they are.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Your dad said to
meet him at the tank.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.156 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll show you how to get there.

00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:53.357 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Okay.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.191 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:12.943 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:12:14.245 --> 00:12:15.346 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Kid] Wow!

00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:17.381 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:23.053 position:13% line:83% align:start
- If you head on in, you'll
be able to find him inside.

00:12:29.293 --> 00:12:30.160 position:41% line:89% align:start
Go on.

00:12:33.464 --> 00:12:35.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, be sure to check
out the Wonder Aquarium

00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:36.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
on your way out, okay?

00:12:36.867 --> 00:12:37.469 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Okay.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.219 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:12:54.252 --> 00:12:55.119 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dad?

00:13:12.037 --> 00:13:12.904 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dad?

00:13:20.378 --> 00:13:21.579 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is anyone in here?

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.589 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:32.957 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:13:52.378 --> 00:13:53.945 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:56.248 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka yells)

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted string music)

00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:19.171 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:23.642 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.212 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's there?

00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:29.915 position:13% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted string music)

00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:33.687 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ha!

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.188 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka gasps)

00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:46.198 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is summer break
a vacation in the summer?

00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:50.704 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:14:50.737 --> 00:14:52.305 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:53.139 position:41% line:89% align:start
- What?

00:14:55.174 --> 00:14:56.376 position:30% line:89% align:start
Did you just...

00:14:59.713 --> 00:15:01.181 position:27% line:89% align:start
Where did he go?

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:08.388 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:15:08.422 --> 00:15:09.689 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:15:09.723 --> 00:15:10.490 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ruka?

00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:21.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:44.090 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:15:56.504 --> 00:15:58.272 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's flying!

00:15:58.306 --> 00:16:01.041 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:16:14.255 --> 00:16:16.157 position:27% line:89% align:start
- My name's Umi.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:16.991 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's yours?

00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:20.061 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh, I'm--

00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:21.762 position:38% line:89% align:start
- I'm...

00:16:23.764 --> 00:16:24.632 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ruka.

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:27.168 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're Ruka?

00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:29.470 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ruka!

00:16:29.504 --> 00:16:32.240 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:46.287 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.823 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Pretty crazy, right?

00:16:47.856 --> 00:16:49.558 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh, Dad.

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:51.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That is Umi.

00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:53.362 position:21% line:83% align:start
He was raised at sea
by a herd of dugongs.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:58.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Dugongs?

00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:02.704 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:05.741 position:27% line:89% align:start
My summer break.

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:09.678 position:21% line:83% align:start
My long, long summer
break is about to begin.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
Inspiration for mermaids.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
This smells like dad.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Umi was found 10 years ago

00:17:32.568 --> 00:17:34.169 position:30% line:83% align:start
off the shores
of the Philippines

00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:36.204 position:27% line:83% align:start
traveling with a
herd of dugongs.

00:17:37.272 --> 00:17:40.142 position:21% line:83% align:start
Actually, it was him
and another boy.

00:17:40.175 --> 00:17:43.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
His skin is extremely
sensitive to dryness,

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.816 position:21% line:83% align:start
probably because he's
been living in the ocean.

00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:49.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, we decided to take
care of him at the aquarium

00:17:49.686 --> 00:17:51.454 position:21% line:89% align:start
and do some research.

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:54.122 position:13% line:83% align:start
By the way, any particular
reason you decided

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.257 position:19% line:89% align:start
to come out here today?

00:17:58.193 --> 00:17:59.194 position:27% line:89% align:start
- It was nothing.

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
- [Reporter] Entertainment news!

00:18:02.765 --> 00:18:04.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
The reason for
the appearance of whales

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.869 position:21% line:83% align:start
off Manhattan Island
is still unknown.

00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:08.504 position:7% line:89% align:start
Marine specialists are still--

00:18:08.538 --> 00:18:11.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Oh, so Masaaki left
without coming inside again.

00:18:15.812 --> 00:18:17.447 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why'd you go there anyway?

00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:19.649 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Ruka!

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:22.585 position:24% line:89% align:start
- I'm heading out.

00:18:31.728 --> 00:18:33.329 position:19% line:89% align:start
- The will-o'-the-wisp.

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:34.163 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's coming.

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.668 position:30% line:89% align:start
(whistle blows)

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.369 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Great shot!

00:18:39.402 --> 00:18:40.603 position:33% line:89% align:start
Looking good!

00:18:40.638 --> 00:18:41.437 position:33% line:89% align:start
Circle round!

00:18:45.676 --> 00:18:47.845 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Girl] Nice shot!

00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:50.213 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Wait, isn't that Ruka?

00:18:50.246 --> 00:18:50.848 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:18:57.821 --> 00:19:00.357 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Sorry.

00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:01.190 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:19:03.527 --> 00:19:05.729 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:19:05.763 --> 00:19:07.197 position:10% line:89% align:start
But it wasn't even my fault.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.902 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:19:16.674 --> 00:19:19.877 position:19% line:89% align:start
(dramatic piano music)

00:19:32.489 --> 00:19:35.225 position:30% line:89% align:start
(heart beating)

00:19:49.974 --> 00:19:50.842 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.881 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why am I playing
hide and seek at school?

00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:00.452 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Ruka!

00:20:00.485 --> 00:20:01.285 position:30% line:89% align:start
There you are.

00:20:04.923 --> 00:20:05.790 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Umi.

00:20:07.792 --> 00:20:09.794 position:30% line:89% align:start
(water running)

00:20:09.828 --> 00:20:11.663 position:19% line:89% align:start
- All right, let's go.

00:20:13.431 --> 00:20:14.432 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:20:14.466 --> 00:20:15.900 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where are we going?

00:20:15.934 --> 00:20:17.569 position:35% line:83% align:start
- There's a
will-o'-the-wisp coming.

00:20:17.602 --> 00:20:18.937 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're gonna go see it.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.772 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Will-o'-the-wisp?

00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:21.740 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:20:21.773 --> 00:20:23.274 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wanted Sora to come with me,

00:20:23.308 --> 00:20:24.876 position:24% line:83% align:start
but he can't really
do it right now.

00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:26.478 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Who's Sora?

00:20:26.511 --> 00:20:27.645 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Umi] My big brother.

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:29.547 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's in the hospital.

00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:30.648 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Oh.

00:20:30.682 --> 00:20:33.953 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Umi] Then I remembered
you, so I came to get you.

00:20:33.986 --> 00:20:35.453 position:16% line:89% align:start
- So, what are we seeing?

00:20:35.487 --> 00:20:37.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
- These things that
glow and fly.

00:20:37.089 --> 00:20:38.590 position:7% line:89% align:start
We'll get to see them together.

00:20:38.623 --> 00:20:41.493 position:24% line:89% align:start
(train horn blows)

00:20:42.427 --> 00:20:45.497 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:47.867 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.602 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's this place?

00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:53.371 position:16% line:89% align:start
- It's Shrine of Harvest.

00:20:54.874 --> 00:20:55.841 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Umi] And this?

00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:57.910 position:16% line:89% align:start
- This is a Chizo statue.

00:20:57.943 --> 00:20:59.645 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Hm, I see.

00:21:01.013 --> 00:21:03.449 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know what that is!

00:21:03.482 --> 00:21:04.416 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Ice cream?

00:21:05.684 --> 00:21:06.585 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:07.419 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:10.956 --> 00:21:12.558 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Mm.

00:21:12.591 --> 00:21:15.461 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:21:15.494 --> 00:21:16.896 position:38% line:89% align:start
So good!

00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:19.932 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Why do I have to pay?

00:21:21.433 --> 00:21:22.301 position:41% line:89% align:start
Why me?

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:25.838 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why did he come find me?

00:21:28.774 --> 00:21:30.776 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wonder if he
asked himself why.

00:21:35.816 --> 00:21:38.852 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:21:38.885 --> 00:21:40.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sounds like the waves
are getting bigger.

00:21:42.621 --> 00:21:43.723 position:24% line:89% align:start
It'll be dark soon.

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:47.560 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is this thing really coming?

00:21:49.663 --> 00:21:51.430 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe this was all a joke.

00:21:52.866 --> 00:21:53.800 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:55.902 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's gotta be it.

00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:01.908 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, I can't
really be out this late.

00:22:01.942 --> 00:22:02.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Here it comes.

00:22:05.045 --> 00:22:07.981 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka gasps)

00:22:08.014 --> 00:22:10.750 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:22:16.923 --> 00:22:17.791 position:33% line:89% align:start
Another one!

00:22:20.994 --> 00:22:22.896 position:27% line:89% align:start
- What were they?

00:22:22.929 --> 00:22:27.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
They were so bright,
and big, and amazing!

00:22:28.835 --> 00:22:30.137 position:19% line:89% align:start
What were they, comets?

00:22:30.171 --> 00:22:31.005 position:10% line:89% align:start
- They're will-o'-the-wisps.

00:22:31.038 --> 00:22:31.872 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Or what?

00:22:31.905 --> 00:22:33.007 position:30% line:89% align:start
Shooting stars?

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.874 position:35% line:89% align:start
Meteorites?

00:22:33.908 --> 00:22:34.976 position:21% line:89% align:start
- will-o'-the-wisps.

00:22:35.009 --> 00:22:35.675 position:21% line:89% align:start
- I don't even care!

00:22:35.709 --> 00:22:37.577 position:10% line:89% align:start
Those things were incredible.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.982 position:27% line:83% align:start
How did you know
they would come?

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:43.184 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Well, it was easy, because
it wanted to be found.

00:22:43.217 --> 00:22:44.852 position:24% line:89% align:start
It just told me so.

00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:46.087 position:35% line:83% align:start
You saw for
yourself how brightly

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:46.921 position:16% line:89% align:start
it was shining just now.

00:22:46.954 --> 00:22:48.723 position:30% line:83% align:start
It was shining
that bright because

00:22:48.756 --> 00:22:49.757 position:10% line:89% align:start
it wanted everyone to see it.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.459 position:13% line:89% align:start
Bugs and animals do it too.

00:22:52.492 --> 00:22:54.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
They shine because
they want to be found.

00:22:57.131 --> 00:22:58.833 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:22:58.866 --> 00:22:59.800 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Now I see.

00:23:01.502 --> 00:23:05.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
Today, when Umi found me
at school, I was so happy.

00:23:06.007 --> 00:23:07.942 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, do you think
they'll show up again?

00:23:09.176 --> 00:23:11.479 position:16% line:89% align:start
And now I understand why.

00:23:11.512 --> 00:23:12.947 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wanted someone to find me.

00:23:17.084 --> 00:23:19.187 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was amazing.

00:23:19.221 --> 00:23:21.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks for bringing
me here with you, Umi.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.764 position:19% line:89% align:start
(dramatic piano music)

00:23:39.207 --> 00:23:42.144 position:24% line:89% align:start
(thunder rumbling)

00:23:43.078 --> 00:23:45.747 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain pouring)

00:23:52.287 --> 00:23:54.723 position:35% line:89% align:start
(knocking)

00:23:54.756 --> 00:23:55.523 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Sora?

00:23:55.556 --> 00:23:57.192 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jim is here to
pick you up, okay?

00:23:59.094 --> 00:23:59.962 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Okay.

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:06.835 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain pouring)

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.496 position:30% line:89% align:start
(water running)

00:24:53.615 --> 00:24:56.551 position:24% line:89% align:start
(seagull chirping)

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:17.240 position:30% line:89% align:start
- How are they?

00:25:19.842 --> 00:25:21.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
- They're having a lot
of trouble concentrating.

00:25:21.644 --> 00:25:24.080 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I heard that the seals
were crying last night too.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know, because of that thing.

00:25:29.886 --> 00:25:31.754 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Woman] The meteorite?

00:25:31.788 --> 00:25:34.291 position:21% line:89% align:start
(dolphins splashing)

00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:35.725 position:5% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Humpbacks have been seen

00:25:35.758 --> 00:25:37.327 position:33% line:83% align:start
over the past
few days in the waters

00:25:37.361 --> 00:25:38.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
near the meteorite's crash site.

00:25:39.963 --> 00:25:42.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jim, it's just as you predicted.

00:25:42.698 --> 00:25:44.201 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Well, that's good to hear.

00:25:44.234 --> 00:25:47.037 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Man] We'll send you a
song that we recorded there.

00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:47.871 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Please do.

00:25:52.042 --> 00:25:54.845 position:27% line:89% align:start
(whales singing)

00:25:57.214 --> 00:26:01.085 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:26:01.118 --> 00:26:02.219 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Excuse me, sir.

00:26:04.121 --> 00:26:05.689 position:27% line:83% align:start
- You're Azumi's
daughter, right?

00:26:05.722 --> 00:26:07.658 position:13% line:89% align:start
- That recording just now.

00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:08.992 position:33% line:89% align:start
What was it?

00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:11.261 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Oh, you're referring
to that song you heard.

00:26:11.295 --> 00:26:12.362 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Song?

00:26:12.397 --> 00:26:13.964 position:13% line:89% align:start
- You were hearing whales.

00:26:13.997 --> 00:26:17.201 position:5% line:83% align:start
They sing songs as they traverse
the oceans of the world.

00:26:17.234 --> 00:26:20.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sound is able to travel a
great deal farther in water

00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:21.372 position:24% line:89% align:start
than it can in air,

00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:25.075 position:16% line:83% align:start
so they can sing to each
other across vast distances.

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:27.778 position:13% line:89% align:start
The songs that whales sing

00:26:27.811 --> 00:26:29.913 position:13% line:83% align:start
are an exceedingly complex
wave of information.

00:26:31.316 --> 00:26:34.219 position:13% line:83% align:start
When we humans express what
we're thinking with words,

00:26:34.252 --> 00:26:37.322 position:16% line:83% align:start
we can't convey even half
of what we're feeling.

00:26:37.355 --> 00:26:38.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
But whales are able to
communicate with each other

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.158 position:27% line:89% align:start
in a deeper way,

00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:44.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
directly transmitting their
experiences fully realized.

00:26:44.862 --> 00:26:47.332 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Transmitting fully.

00:26:48.266 --> 00:26:51.336 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:57.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
They can communicate
without using words.

00:27:01.479 --> 00:27:04.916 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wonder if there will
be another one tonight.

00:27:04.949 --> 00:27:07.685 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:15.394 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's that sound?

00:27:15.427 --> 00:27:17.028 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:27:17.061 --> 00:27:17.829 position:38% line:89% align:start
A person?

00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:21.433 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi?

00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:30.808 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:27:37.082 --> 00:27:38.816 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that Sora?

00:27:46.325 --> 00:27:49.195 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves splashing)

00:27:51.897 --> 00:27:53.465 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's that sound again.

00:27:53.499 --> 00:27:55.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
- It's the sand and rocks.

00:27:55.868 --> 00:27:58.037 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's the sound of them
getting hit by all the waves,

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.039 position:27% line:83% align:start
though it usually
gets covered up

00:28:00.072 --> 00:28:02.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
by the sounds of the
waves themselves.

00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:05.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
The edge of the water is
such an eloquent place.

00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:07.379 position:33% line:83% align:start
All sorts of
information gathers here,

00:28:07.413 --> 00:28:09.048 position:10% line:89% align:start
carried by the ocean waters.

00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:11.984 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you're able
to tell them apart,

00:28:13.118 --> 00:28:15.287 position:10% line:89% align:start
you can know almost anything.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.492 position:13% line:89% align:start
I assume you're Ruka then?

00:28:22.194 --> 00:28:23.463 position:16% line:89% align:start
You know who I am, right?

00:28:25.097 --> 00:28:26.932 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you definitely know.

00:28:30.102 --> 00:28:31.238 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Sora, right?

00:28:34.873 --> 00:28:36.742 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You are so boring.

00:28:38.511 --> 00:28:41.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
Everything you
do is so easy to predict,

00:28:41.348 --> 00:28:42.848 position:21% line:89% align:start
you're such a child.

00:28:44.284 --> 00:28:46.086 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're here to see Umi, right?

00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:47.988 position:27% line:83% align:start
He happens to be
offshore right now,

00:28:48.955 --> 00:28:50.090 position:27% line:89% align:start
too bad for you.

00:28:51.458 --> 00:28:53.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
- You shouldn't be out here!

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
'Cause you're sick.

00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:57.430 position:10% line:89% align:start
- No, it isn't that I'm sick,

00:28:57.464 --> 00:28:58.331 position:13% line:89% align:start
they're just observing me.

00:28:59.566 --> 00:29:01.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're totally free to
be interested in Umi,

00:29:01.968 --> 00:29:03.937 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I have to wonder if he has

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.206 position:13% line:89% align:start
any interest at all in you.

00:29:06.239 --> 00:29:08.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, he doesn't think
all that much of you--

00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:09.242 position:30% line:89% align:start
- I don't care!

00:29:09.276 --> 00:29:12.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wasn't here to see
Umi, I just wanted the...

00:29:12.512 --> 00:29:14.014 position:27% line:89% align:start
A shooting star.

00:29:14.914 --> 00:29:16.116 position:7% line:89% align:start
I just wanted to see it again.

00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:19.919 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Umi has me already, so you
should see yourself home now.

00:29:19.953 --> 00:29:21.422 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] I was just about to!

00:29:21.455 --> 00:29:22.956 position:27% line:83% align:start
And to be honest,
I don't know what

00:29:22.989 --> 00:29:24.858 position:16% line:89% align:start
you're doing here either.

00:29:24.891 --> 00:29:25.825 position:21% line:89% align:start
- What is that song?

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.529 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can hear a song right now,

00:29:28.562 --> 00:29:30.464 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's one that I've
never heard before.

00:29:32.932 --> 00:29:34.034 position:38% line:89% align:start
- A song.

00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:35.101 position:21% line:89% align:start
You mean the whales?

00:29:39.106 --> 00:29:42.310 position:30% line:83% align:start
Earlier, when I
heard the recording,

00:29:42.343 --> 00:29:44.211 position:27% line:83% align:start
I saw whales and
those shooting stars

00:29:44.245 --> 00:29:45.212 position:30% line:89% align:start
inside my mind.

00:29:46.213 --> 00:29:49.383 position:7% line:89% align:start
Also, some kind of celebration.

00:29:49.417 --> 00:29:51.385 position:19% line:89% align:start
Something like a baby.

00:29:51.419 --> 00:29:52.353 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh yeah?

00:29:52.386 --> 00:29:54.255 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, what about it?

00:29:54.288 --> 00:29:55.089 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Nothing!

00:29:56.257 --> 00:29:58.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Ah, you're lonely.

00:29:58.225 --> 00:30:01.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess you'd like me to
play with you, little girl.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.567 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:30:08.169 --> 00:30:09.970 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:30:10.004 --> 00:30:11.305 position:30% line:89% align:start
- What a jerk!

00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:13.407 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
that kid's related to Umi.

00:30:14.643 --> 00:30:16.611 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's so annoying!

00:30:16.645 --> 00:30:20.247 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:30:20.281 --> 00:30:23.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
Actually, he feels more
like a ghost than a kid.

00:30:24.653 --> 00:30:27.456 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:30:28.956 --> 00:30:30.124 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Oh, weird!

00:30:30.157 --> 00:30:32.260 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's just you, Sora?

00:30:32.294 --> 00:30:34.663 position:7% line:89% align:start
I felt like Ruka was here too.

00:30:34.696 --> 00:30:35.497 position:27% line:89% align:start
- She just left.

00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:43.505 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:30:43.538 --> 00:30:46.441 position:16% line:83% align:start
You were right about her,
she does have the same smell.

00:30:46.475 --> 00:30:47.676 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:30:47.709 --> 00:30:51.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Well in that case, I think
we should take a deeper look.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.382 position:19% line:89% align:start
How was it under there?

00:30:53.415 --> 00:30:55.217 position:27% line:83% align:start
- There's a bunch
of them gathering.

00:30:56.685 --> 00:30:58.453 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm.

00:30:58.487 --> 00:31:00.322 position:19% line:89% align:start
- So, can you hear it?

00:31:00.355 --> 00:31:02.190 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Yeah, I can hear it.

00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:07.229 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:31:17.406 --> 00:31:21.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Dehdeh] From the star,
from the stars,

00:31:21.209 --> 00:31:23.111 position:19% line:89% align:start
the sea is the mother.

00:31:39.762 --> 00:31:41.464 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Well, based on our findings,

00:31:41.497 --> 00:31:44.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
we can conclude that Sora
is definitively human.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.403 position:19% line:83% align:start
His eyeballs with their
specialty light refraction,

00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:49.639 position:24% line:83% align:start
his cardiopulmonary
functions, muscles,

00:31:49.672 --> 00:31:52.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
and bone density are all
a result of him adapting

00:31:52.508 --> 00:31:54.043 position:21% line:89% align:start
to living underwater.

00:31:54.076 --> 00:31:55.745 position:7% line:89% align:start
But no elements of luminescence

00:31:55.778 --> 00:31:57.447 position:27% line:83% align:start
were found in his
skin structure.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.615 position:16% line:83% align:start
Therefore, it is unlikely
that he would glow.

00:32:06.422 --> 00:32:08.157 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:32:08.191 --> 00:32:09.325 position:21% line:89% align:start
False killer whales?

00:32:16.199 --> 00:32:19.670 position:13% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted synth music)

00:32:27.444 --> 00:32:28.344 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Hi, Ruka!

00:32:28.377 --> 00:32:29.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry for the wait.

00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:32.549 position:10% line:89% align:start
You sure you want to do this?

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:33.383 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes!

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:37.354 position:19% line:83% align:start
- The water temperature
is pretty low.

00:32:37.387 --> 00:32:38.755 position:13% line:83% align:start
- You shouldn't be putting
your finger in there,

00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:39.656 position:21% line:89% align:start
it's the shark tank.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.023 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Yep, I know!

00:32:46.463 --> 00:32:48.665 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:17.729 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Masaaki.

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:19.062 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Uh, he's not here.

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:19.731 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can I help you?

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:20.765 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Oh, hey there, Kanako.

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:22.165 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been a while.

00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:23.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Who is this?

00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:24.536 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Mr. Azumi's wife.

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:25.503 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Woman] Oh, Ruka's mom?

00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:26.538 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah.

00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:28.071 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Mr. Azumi's not here.

00:33:28.105 --> 00:33:29.474 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's doing a workshop.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.475 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Is that right?

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:31.308 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yep.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.812 position:24% line:89% align:start
- And where's Ruka?

00:33:36.179 --> 00:33:38.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I think Ruka's
somewhere in the building.

00:33:38.115 --> 00:33:39.684 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Ugh, okay then.

00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:40.685 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Where are you--

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:42.787 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I remember my way
around, I'll go find her.

00:33:44.656 --> 00:33:45.757 position:27% line:89% align:start
- That's Kanako.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.191 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's an employee here,

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
but she's on a leave of absence.

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:49.627 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh, yeah.

00:33:49.661 --> 00:33:52.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
Someone told me she was
legendary around here.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Kanako's here and
she's coming this way?

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:56.768 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, what are you...

00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:59.370 position:24% line:89% align:start
- What's going on?

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:01.439 position:27% line:83% align:start
- My mom's here,
and she's the worst!

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:03.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
- If you want to hide from
her, I've got an idea.

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:05.810 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.613 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:09.547 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look, there it is.

00:34:10.783 --> 00:34:11.649 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ah.

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:14.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
- We can hide here,
it's perfect.

00:34:14.686 --> 00:34:16.755 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, the
aquarium owns the ship,

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:19.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
but they'll never think
to look for us here.

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.559 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:34:21.594 --> 00:34:22.460 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:25.363 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:26.230 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hey.

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:27.666 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look, it moves.

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
- All aboard now!

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
Set sail!

00:34:32.538 --> 00:34:33.439 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:34.272 position:27% line:89% align:start
- You've got it.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:38.777 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Ship setting sail!

00:34:39.712 --> 00:34:42.748 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:34:50.756 --> 00:34:51.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
- That's amazing.

00:34:51.657 --> 00:34:53.225 position:33% line:83% align:start
I didn't know
you could drive a boat.

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:53.826 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Nah, I can't.

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:54.927 position:41% line:89% align:start
- What?

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.229 position:13% line:83% align:start
- I was just messing around
and it started moving.

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:58.464 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Wait, are we gonna be okay?

00:34:58.497 --> 00:34:59.832 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Watch out, incoming!

00:35:02.234 --> 00:35:03.636 position:21% line:89% align:start
- We almost crashed!

00:35:03.669 --> 00:35:05.804 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I was pretty sure he'd
be able to dodge us.

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:08.741 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh no, the port!

00:35:08.774 --> 00:35:10.442 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's so far away.

00:35:10.476 --> 00:35:13.212 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:35:16.582 --> 00:35:18.317 position:21% line:89% align:start
But this feels good.

00:35:22.488 --> 00:35:23.489 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Hey, Sora!

00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:25.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
Can we take the boat over
to go see some whales?

00:35:25.792 --> 00:35:27.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Yeah, sounds good.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.495 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Some whales?

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:34.366 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.575 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Hey, we stopped!

00:35:42.609 --> 00:35:43.777 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.512 position:19% line:89% align:start
- It's not responding.

00:35:45.545 --> 00:35:46.746 position:19% line:89% align:start
- So we're stuck here?

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.580 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Guess so.

00:35:48.882 --> 00:35:51.317 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Ruka] What are we
supposed to do now?

00:35:51.351 --> 00:35:52.719 position:10% line:89% align:start
- There's nothing we can do.

00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:00.293 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I don't know.

00:36:01.661 --> 00:36:02.562 position:41% line:89% align:start
- What?

00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:03.430 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are we going to do?

00:36:03.463 --> 00:36:05.465 position:13% line:89% align:start
How are we gonna get back?

00:36:05.498 --> 00:36:08.535 position:13% line:83% align:start
- I don't recall you trying
to stop me at any point.

00:36:08.568 --> 00:36:09.235 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:10.603 position:5% line:89% align:start
- You were standing right there,

00:36:10.637 --> 00:36:12.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
did you ever tell me
to stop or go back?

00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:15.608 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, you didn't say anything,
because you were happy.

00:36:15.642 --> 00:36:17.510 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't blame others
for your situation.

00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:23.884 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

00:36:23.918 --> 00:36:26.987 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Because we grew up in the
ocean instead of on land,

00:36:27.021 --> 00:36:29.757 position:10% line:83% align:start
we need to keep cool, or our
skill will start to burn,

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.692 position:19% line:83% align:start
and we'll have trouble
with our breathing.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.428 position:30% line:83% align:start
My body's more
used to it than Sora's.

00:36:35.463 --> 00:36:37.998 position:7% line:83% align:start
But our overall life expectancy
is still pretty short.

00:36:39.533 --> 00:36:40.034 position:33% line:89% align:start
- It's short?

00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:40.901 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:36:40.935 --> 00:36:42.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, they're doing
research to see

00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:44.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
if they can make us live longer.

00:36:47.074 --> 00:36:47.975 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:36:48.008 --> 00:36:49.343 position:10% line:89% align:start
Something's heading this way.

00:36:49.376 --> 00:36:50.010 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:36:50.044 --> 00:36:51.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Come on, let's go see!

00:36:52.513 --> 00:36:55.683 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

00:36:55.716 --> 00:36:58.719 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:36:59.854 --> 00:37:01.056 position:38% line:89% align:start
- But...

00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:02.990 position:30% line:83% align:start
Isn't the water
really deep here?

00:37:05.726 --> 00:37:06.594 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:37:07.862 --> 00:37:10.932 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:37:14.903 --> 00:37:17.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't swim in water this deep.

00:37:17.638 --> 00:37:19.540 position:27% line:89% align:start
What am I doing?

00:37:19.573 --> 00:37:21.509 position:41% line:89% align:start
(yells)

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.847 position:38% line:89% align:start
So deep.

00:37:28.549 --> 00:37:30.351 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't swim in this!

00:37:31.452 --> 00:37:32.319 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:37:33.088 --> 00:37:35.891 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:37:44.966 --> 00:37:47.836 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:37:49.771 --> 00:37:52.574 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:37:54.442 --> 00:37:55.510 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whale sharks?

00:38:08.423 --> 00:38:09.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can't hold on...

00:38:23.505 --> 00:38:24.907 position:35% line:89% align:start
(coughing)

00:38:24.941 --> 00:38:26.108 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Geez.

00:38:26.142 --> 00:38:29.078 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you couldn't swim, then
you shouldn't have gotten in!

00:38:29.111 --> 00:38:30.512 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I can swim!

00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:32.014 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You were drowning!

00:38:32.048 --> 00:38:33.983 position:21% line:89% align:start
- That was because--

00:38:34.016 --> 00:38:35.051 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Because you couldn't swim.

00:38:35.084 --> 00:38:36.384 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Yes, I can!

00:38:38.821 --> 00:38:39.722 position:24% line:89% align:start
- How interesting.

00:38:39.755 --> 00:38:41.490 position:13% line:89% align:start
It seems they have company.

00:38:42.825 --> 00:38:44.560 position:30% line:89% align:start
- You're right.

00:38:44.594 --> 00:38:45.795 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Something's wriggling.

00:38:48.464 --> 00:38:49.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
A school of fish?

00:38:49.665 --> 00:38:50.766 position:38% line:89% align:start
Amazing.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.136 position:19% line:83% align:start
- They're chasing after
that group of whale sharks.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.671 position:10% line:89% align:start
- The whale sharks' patterns,

00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:58.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
they were glowing
in the ocean just now.

00:38:58.541 --> 00:38:59.775 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just like before.

00:39:00.877 --> 00:39:02.511 position:7% line:89% align:start
Like the ghost at the aquarium.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.948 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Umi] It was glowing?

00:39:05.982 --> 00:39:06.582 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:39:07.683 --> 00:39:09.052 position:10% line:89% align:start
When I was little, I saw it.

00:39:09.086 --> 00:39:10.988 position:7% line:89% align:start
It glowed and then disappeared.

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:15.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
- We saw the same exact
thing when we were little.

00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:16.659 position:35% line:89% align:start
- A ghost?

00:39:16.692 --> 00:39:17.627 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
And Sora and I have been
calling it that too.

00:39:19.096 --> 00:39:19.930 position:16% line:89% align:start
- You saw the same thing?

00:39:19.963 --> 00:39:21.798 position:19% line:89% align:start
- What about the song?

00:39:21.832 --> 00:39:23.699 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Is that when you
heard the whale song?

00:39:23.733 --> 00:39:25.102 position:19% line:89% align:start
When you saw the ghost?

00:39:25.135 --> 00:39:27.871 position:16% line:83% align:start
- No, I heard it for the
first time the other day.

00:39:27.905 --> 00:39:29.806 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you guys know what it means?

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.708 position:19% line:83% align:start
- It means that there's
gonna be a celebration,

00:39:31.742 --> 00:39:32.743 position:30% line:83% align:start
and it's called
the Birth Festival,

00:39:32.776 --> 00:39:33.844 position:13% line:89% align:start
somewhere out in the ocean.

00:39:33.877 --> 00:39:36.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
- We've been traveling all
over the world with Jim

00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:38.982 position:13% line:83% align:start
researching its connection
to the two of us.

00:39:39.016 --> 00:39:40.483 position:16% line:89% align:start
The whale song is a clue.

00:39:40.517 --> 00:39:41.450 position:7% line:89% align:start
We think they're using the song

00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:43.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
to look for guests
for the Birth Festival.

00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:47.724 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Guests?

00:39:47.758 --> 00:39:49.092 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Jim] Just looking
at his latest data,

00:39:49.126 --> 00:39:51.862 position:27% line:83% align:start
we don't see any
changes in Sora.

00:39:51.895 --> 00:39:54.698 position:19% line:83% align:start
- But in reality, he's
weakening much faster

00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:56.199 position:19% line:89% align:start
than the data suggests.

00:39:56.233 --> 00:39:57.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
Umi, on the other hand,

00:39:57.534 --> 00:39:59.770 position:27% line:83% align:start
is adapting well
to being on land.

00:39:59.803 --> 00:40:01.571 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Despite their
similar background,

00:40:01.605 --> 00:40:02.706 position:16% line:89% align:start
they are quite different.

00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:04.574 position:27% line:83% align:start
- And what about
those meteorites?

00:40:04.608 --> 00:40:06.244 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no indication
that they ever reached

00:40:06.277 --> 00:40:07.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
the surface of the Earth.

00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:09.880 position:16% line:89% align:start
- I guess they burned up.

00:40:09.913 --> 00:40:12.250 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Professor Anglade is
headed out to collect them,

00:40:12.283 --> 00:40:15.053 position:33% line:83% align:start
and I'm sure
it'll be a fool's errand.

00:40:15.086 --> 00:40:16.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
- However, all the
creatures of the sea

00:40:16.853 --> 00:40:19.190 position:30% line:83% align:start
are rushing to
that part of the ocean.

00:40:19.223 --> 00:40:22.160 position:10% line:83% align:start
And there is that unfamiliar
whale song to consider.

00:40:22.193 --> 00:40:24.062 position:19% line:83% align:start
- It's likely that all
of these events

00:40:24.095 --> 00:40:26.030 position:33% line:83% align:start
are omens of
the coming Festival.

00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:31.535 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Then we have
to hurry, or Sora will...

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.577 position:33% line:89% align:start
- What is it?

00:40:43.748 --> 00:40:44.682 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Is it here?

00:40:46.117 --> 00:40:47.218 position:19% line:89% align:start
- False killer whales!

00:40:48.853 --> 00:40:50.922 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sora!

00:40:50.955 --> 00:40:51.856 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:40:51.889 --> 00:40:52.690 position:35% line:89% align:start
Umi, wait!

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.195 position:21% line:89% align:start
Something's glowing.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.764 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:00.999 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi?

00:41:01.032 --> 00:41:02.700 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sora?

00:41:02.734 --> 00:41:03.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come back!

00:41:07.638 --> 00:41:11.176 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.612 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:41:14.645 --> 00:41:16.315 position:33% line:83% align:start
- Do you know
how lucky you were?

00:41:16.348 --> 00:41:18.583 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a good thing the
ocean was dead calm today

00:41:18.616 --> 00:41:21.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
and another ship happened
to come by and find you.

00:41:21.786 --> 00:41:23.922 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you even listening, Ruka?

00:41:23.956 --> 00:41:27.092 position:13% line:83% align:start
What were you even thinking
going out there by yourself?

00:41:27.126 --> 00:41:29.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
And you lied to me telling
me you were at practice.

00:41:31.063 --> 00:41:31.897 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ruka!

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.664 position:30% line:83% align:start
Where have you
been going every day?

00:41:33.699 --> 00:41:34.800 position:30% line:89% align:start
To see Masaaki?

00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:36.135 position:10% line:89% align:start
- It's none of your business!

00:41:37.236 --> 00:41:39.905 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain pouring)

00:41:39.938 --> 00:41:40.973 position:19% line:89% align:start
None of your business.

00:41:42.174 --> 00:41:44.977 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:41:51.817 --> 00:41:55.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Man] Just odd,
it washing up like that.

00:41:55.687 --> 00:41:56.855 position:19% line:89% align:start
- How did this happen?

00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:58.057 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you think they
were already dead?

00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:04.297 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Excuse me.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:05.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, please.

00:42:09.968 --> 00:42:10.836 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:42:12.072 --> 00:42:12.938 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:42:13.972 --> 00:42:16.642 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain pouring)

00:42:26.152 --> 00:42:28.822 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind blowing)

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:31.958 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:35.028 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh, Ruka.

00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:35.895 position:21% line:89% align:start
- What is that, Dad?

00:42:35.929 --> 00:42:37.330 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Pretty strange, huh?

00:42:37.363 --> 00:42:39.799 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is a relative
of the Megamouth.

00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:40.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Megamouth?

00:42:40.166 --> 00:42:41.301 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Uh huh.

00:42:41.334 --> 00:42:44.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a type of shark that
lives very deep in the ocean.

00:42:44.404 --> 00:42:45.772 position:30% line:83% align:start
And most of the
fish you see here

00:42:45.805 --> 00:42:47.640 position:13% line:89% align:start
are also deep sea dwellers.

00:42:47.674 --> 00:42:50.276 position:27% line:83% align:start
The question is,
why did this happen?

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.879 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are also fish from
the shallows mixed in,

00:42:52.912 --> 00:42:55.014 position:16% line:89% align:start
and Sora's still missing.

00:42:55.048 --> 00:42:55.949 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a mess.

00:42:55.982 --> 00:42:57.384 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Wait, Sora hasn't come back?

00:42:57.418 --> 00:42:58.385 position:44% line:89% align:start
- No.

00:42:58.419 --> 00:42:59.386 position:13% line:89% align:start
Jim's out looking for him.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.387 position:21% line:89% align:start
- And what about Umi?

00:43:00.421 --> 00:43:02.155 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is he okay?

00:43:02.188 --> 00:43:04.023 position:19% line:89% align:start
- He seems pretty down.

00:43:04.057 --> 00:43:06.159 position:10% line:89% align:start
Probably worried about Sora.

00:43:06.192 --> 00:43:07.428 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey!

00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:09.062 position:21% line:89% align:start
A typhoon is coming!

00:43:09.095 --> 00:43:10.164 position:19% line:89% align:start
I need you to get home!

00:43:12.333 --> 00:43:15.001 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain pouring)

00:43:28.983 --> 00:43:30.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
- A ribbonfish too?

00:43:49.236 --> 00:43:50.704 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi.

00:43:50.738 --> 00:43:51.338 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi!

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.341 position:33% line:89% align:start
Umi, get up.

00:43:55.477 --> 00:43:57.878 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:44:05.886 --> 00:44:06.954 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi!

00:44:06.987 --> 00:44:07.788 position:35% line:89% align:start
Talk to me!

00:44:09.391 --> 00:44:10.258 position:35% line:89% align:start
His heart.

00:44:13.027 --> 00:44:15.497 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water bubbling)

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:16.364 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:44:16.398 --> 00:44:18.032 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's not breathing.

00:44:18.066 --> 00:44:18.699 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do I do now?

00:44:18.732 --> 00:44:20.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't know how to do CPR.

00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:32.314 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:44:34.049 --> 00:44:35.350 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Ruka, what were you doing?

00:44:39.521 --> 00:44:40.956 position:33% line:89% align:start
- You idiot!

00:44:40.989 --> 00:44:42.157 position:24% line:83% align:start
What were you doing
laying underwater?

00:44:43.358 --> 00:44:45.327 position:5% line:89% align:start
- It's Sora, I know where he is.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.028 position:24% line:89% align:start
The waves told me!

00:44:47.062 --> 00:44:48.296 position:33% line:89% align:start
- The waves?

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:49.464 position:30% line:89% align:start
- This typhoon.

00:44:49.497 --> 00:44:51.800 position:30% line:83% align:start
It carries the
ocean air of home,

00:44:51.833 --> 00:44:52.867 position:19% line:89% align:start
and the smell of Sora.

00:44:52.901 --> 00:44:54.102 position:30% line:89% align:start
- The typhoon?

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.872 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.314 position:35% line:89% align:start
Umi's hand.

00:45:10.085 --> 00:45:11.220 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's so hot.

00:45:19.095 --> 00:45:20.962 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have to protect him.

00:45:26.102 --> 00:45:28.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I heard the typhoon
changed directions

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
and it's now heading towards us.

00:45:29.505 --> 00:45:31.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
- First deep sea fish
and now a typhoon?

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Oh, wait, isn't that
Azumi's daughter?

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.844 position:33% line:89% align:start
- It's Ruka.

00:45:34.877 --> 00:45:35.511 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hey!

00:45:35.544 --> 00:45:37.480 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't go up to the beach!

00:45:37.513 --> 00:45:38.948 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's dangerous!

00:45:39.982 --> 00:45:41.484 position:30% line:83% align:start
They don't even
have an umbrella.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.822 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:46:21.425 --> 00:46:23.893 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rain pouring)

00:46:26.996 --> 00:46:30.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Okay, but I already told
you, she didn't come here.

00:46:30.267 --> 00:46:31.168 position:33% line:89% align:start
Washed away?

00:46:31.201 --> 00:46:32.436 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, I don't think so.

00:46:32.469 --> 00:46:34.938 position:30% line:83% align:start
Someone in town
saw them walking together.

00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:36.540 position:5% line:89% align:start
If I see her, I'll let you know.

00:46:36.573 --> 00:46:37.407 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:39.009 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, okay, I got it.

00:46:41.178 --> 00:46:43.080 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, geez, where on Earth
could they have gone

00:46:43.113 --> 00:46:44.481 position:13% line:89% align:start
with a typhoon coming here?

00:46:44.514 --> 00:46:47.017 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Memories, time, and spirits

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:48.452 position:7% line:89% align:start
pass one another in a typhoon.

00:46:49.486 --> 00:46:51.288 position:27% line:83% align:start
It seems time is
running out faster

00:46:51.321 --> 00:46:53.658 position:16% line:89% align:start
than I imagined it would.

00:46:53.691 --> 00:46:54.558 position:33% line:89% align:start
Much faster.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.426 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Running out?

00:46:57.327 --> 00:47:00.397 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:47:37.034 --> 00:47:38.536 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Bye bye!

00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:41.572 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:47:58.724 --> 00:47:59.957 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Are we close?

00:48:00.726 --> 00:48:02.059 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:48:02.093 --> 00:48:02.694 position:38% line:89% align:start
This way!

00:48:03.695 --> 00:48:06.532 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:48:17.276 --> 00:48:18.142 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:48:25.551 --> 00:48:27.386 position:41% line:89% align:start
My, my.

00:48:27.419 --> 00:48:29.254 position:35% line:83% align:start
So you guys
found him already, huh?

00:48:40.199 --> 00:48:41.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
If you're looking for Sora,

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.168 position:30% line:83% align:start
he's out for a
swim at the moment.

00:48:47.539 --> 00:48:49.441 position:19% line:83% align:start
I found him out in the
middle of the ocean.

00:48:50.676 --> 00:48:53.011 position:21% line:83% align:start
That makes me the one
who brought him here.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
And it seems you're the
one who brought Umi here,

00:48:59.485 --> 00:49:03.055 position:10% line:83% align:start
or perhaps it's more accurate
to say he brought you here,

00:49:03.088 --> 00:49:05.057 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the help of
the typhoon, of course.

00:49:05.625 --> 00:49:06.659 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Yeah.

00:49:06.693 --> 00:49:08.461 position:21% line:83% align:start
- If that's the case,
then you should be careful

00:49:08.495 --> 00:49:09.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
when it comes to Umi.

00:49:16.736 --> 00:49:20.172 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whatever happens now, you
can't say I didn't warn you.

00:49:23.443 --> 00:49:24.577 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:25.578 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:49:25.612 --> 00:49:28.648 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't forget to catch
us something for dinner!

00:49:31.351 --> 00:49:33.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, why don't you
make yourself at home?

00:49:33.319 --> 00:49:35.822 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll call Jim and let
him know you're here.

00:49:35.855 --> 00:49:36.689 position:21% line:89% align:start
- From the aquarium?

00:49:36.723 --> 00:49:37.790 position:33% line:89% align:start
You know him?

00:49:37.824 --> 00:49:38.424 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Of course.

00:49:39.792 --> 00:49:43.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm an oceanographer who
happens to be Jim's assistant.

00:49:43.129 --> 00:49:44.364 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, I was.

00:49:44.397 --> 00:49:46.165 position:27% line:83% align:start
Since we have an
unexpected guest,

00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:48.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess I'll take my
summer break now.

00:49:48.468 --> 00:49:50.203 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Your summer break?

00:49:50.236 --> 00:49:51.504 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Umi] Ruka!

00:49:51.538 --> 00:49:52.338 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:49:56.242 --> 00:49:57.110 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sora.

00:49:59.813 --> 00:50:03.216 position:19% line:89% align:start
(wondrous piano music)

00:50:37.151 --> 00:50:37.818 position:38% line:89% align:start
A dugong.

00:50:38.819 --> 00:50:41.221 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:50:44.792 --> 00:50:45.659 position:38% line:89% align:start
Amazing.

00:50:49.163 --> 00:50:51.365 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:50:53.768 --> 00:50:56.637 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:51:04.211 --> 00:51:07.414 position:19% line:89% align:start
(dramatic piano music)

00:51:26.701 --> 00:51:28.903 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:51:42.917 --> 00:51:44.086 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.390 position:5% line:83% align:start
- So, you're saying the Festival
itself is happening soon.

00:51:48.423 --> 00:51:49.324 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Jim] Correct.

00:51:49.357 --> 00:51:51.426 position:16% line:89% align:start
- You know the location?

00:51:51.459 --> 00:51:53.528 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Jim] I believe the
boys who came from the sea

00:51:53.561 --> 00:51:54.629 position:21% line:89% align:start
will guide us to it.

00:51:55.998 --> 00:51:57.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
- If we can observe the Festival

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:58.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
and analyze its mechanism,

00:51:58.801 --> 00:52:02.370 position:7% line:83% align:start
it could lead us to incredible
advances in ocean science.

00:52:03.773 --> 00:52:06.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Interestingly, we've
received some intel

00:52:06.408 --> 00:52:07.877 position:30% line:83% align:start
that these boys
you believe are the key

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:10.412 position:33% line:83% align:start
were taken by
your assistant, Anglade.

00:52:10.445 --> 00:52:11.647 position:13% line:89% align:start
- He hasn't taken the boys.

00:52:11.681 --> 00:52:13.214 position:30% line:83% align:start
He's currently
coordinating with them,

00:52:13.248 --> 00:52:15.718 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I am able to
contact him at any time.

00:52:15.751 --> 00:52:17.820 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Man] Without them,
we won't be able to know

00:52:17.853 --> 00:52:20.389 position:21% line:83% align:start
when the signs of the
Festival are happening!

00:52:20.423 --> 00:52:21.624 position:16% line:89% align:start
- If that's your concern,

00:52:22.925 --> 00:52:24.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
then Anglade can be
the one to guide you

00:52:24.927 --> 00:52:25.795 position:21% line:89% align:start
when the time comes.

00:52:25.828 --> 00:52:27.930 position:30% line:83% align:start
- And you just
expect us to trust him?

00:52:27.963 --> 00:52:29.098 position:10% line:89% align:start
- There's no need for trust.

00:52:29.131 --> 00:52:31.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
We can track the location of
the ship wherever it goes.

00:52:31.867 --> 00:52:32.635 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Not good enough!

00:52:32.668 --> 00:52:34.503 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should mobilize
the fleet now.

00:52:34.537 --> 00:52:35.371 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Just wait.

00:52:35.404 --> 00:52:36.939 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Jim] How much
time do we have left?

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:38.808 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is it enough?

00:52:39.875 --> 00:52:42.845 position:35% line:89% align:start
Umi, Sora.

00:52:58.461 --> 00:52:59.328 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Wow.

00:53:04.067 --> 00:53:05.635 position:5% line:89% align:start
The sky and the sea are all red.

00:53:05.669 --> 00:53:07.570 position:27% line:83% align:start
- You know, your
eyes are red too.

00:53:07.604 --> 00:53:08.537 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:09.371 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Here, look.

00:53:10.406 --> 00:53:12.609 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:53:14.678 --> 00:53:15.712 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Hey, guys!

00:53:16.947 --> 00:53:19.583 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did you catch anything yet?

00:53:19.616 --> 00:53:21.651 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's about time to
cook up some dinner!

00:53:21.685 --> 00:53:22.886 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Oh, I'm on it.

00:53:23.987 --> 00:53:26.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
- It's not just the twilight sky

00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:28.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
that is making the sea look red.

00:53:28.658 --> 00:53:29.459 position:38% line:89% align:start
See that?

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.028 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] What is it?

00:53:32.062 --> 00:53:33.930 position:27% line:83% align:start
- You'll find out
once night falls.

00:53:35.632 --> 00:53:36.600 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Caught something!

00:53:38.001 --> 00:53:39.002 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look at this.

00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:43.840 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:53:57.521 --> 00:53:59.791 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:54:19.043 --> 00:54:20.545 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hey.

00:54:20.578 --> 00:54:23.581 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:54:27.585 --> 00:54:29.720 position:38% line:89% align:start
(humming)

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:06.591 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Anglade] Let's dig in.

00:55:09.427 --> 00:55:11.562 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:55:16.434 --> 00:55:19.104 position:35% line:89% align:start
(slurping)

00:55:19.137 --> 00:55:19.938 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Mm!

00:55:28.513 --> 00:55:29.581 position:21% line:89% align:start
- How are you, Sora?

00:55:29.615 --> 00:55:31.450 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did you have a good swim?

00:55:31.483 --> 00:55:32.985 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Not too bad.

00:55:33.018 --> 00:55:35.487 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although I feel my body
gets worse every time

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.489 position:19% line:89% align:start
they collect more data.

00:55:37.522 --> 00:55:39.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
Where did we come from
and where are we heading?

00:55:39.925 --> 00:55:41.426 position:27% line:83% align:start
To find that out,
I've gone through

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
all their exams and experiments,

00:55:43.562 --> 00:55:45.931 position:30% line:83% align:start
but neither the
X-rays nor the MRIs

00:55:45.964 --> 00:55:48.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
have shown any
signs of abnormalities.

00:55:50.769 --> 00:55:52.504 position:30% line:83% align:start
Even though it
feels like my body

00:55:52.537 --> 00:55:54.107 position:10% line:89% align:start
has somehow been transformed.

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.842 position:16% line:83% align:start
Strictly speaking from a
scientific point of view,

00:55:56.875 --> 00:55:59.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
what's happening
inside me can't be seen.

00:56:00.246 --> 00:56:02.481 position:27% line:83% align:start
- The amount that
humans are able to see

00:56:03.816 --> 00:56:05.785 position:30% line:83% align:start
is only a small
fraction of everything

00:56:05.818 --> 00:56:07.486 position:13% line:89% align:start
that exists in this world.

00:56:07.519 --> 00:56:08.855 position:10% line:89% align:start
Using advanced technologies,

00:56:08.888 --> 00:56:11.224 position:24% line:83% align:start
humans continue to
observe the Universe

00:56:11.257 --> 00:56:14.193 position:13% line:83% align:start
only to discover that there
is a thing called dark matter

00:56:14.227 --> 00:56:16.596 position:19% line:83% align:start
that cannot be observed
by any known methods.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.233 position:30% line:83% align:start
And the sum of
its substance is at least

00:56:20.266 --> 00:56:22.467 position:7% line:89% align:start
10 times that of normal matter.

00:56:24.037 --> 00:56:27.540 position:16% line:83% align:start
That means that over 90%
of the Universe's mass

00:56:27.573 --> 00:56:29.943 position:21% line:83% align:start
is made up of it, yet
it remains a mystery.

00:56:30.843 --> 00:56:32.512 position:13% line:89% align:start
- So, almost all of it is?

00:56:32.545 --> 00:56:33.513 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:56:33.546 --> 00:56:35.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's like we're not
seeing anything at all.

00:56:37.684 --> 00:56:40.687 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Universe is filled with
something we cannot see,

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.223 position:21% line:83% align:start
which means it's much
more vast and complex

00:56:43.257 --> 00:56:45.558 position:5% line:89% align:start
than what our eyes can perceive.

00:56:45.591 --> 00:56:49.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
- I think that the Universe
is a lot like humans.

00:56:49.529 --> 00:56:51.030 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm.

00:56:51.065 --> 00:56:53.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Tiny fragments of
memories are floating around

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.703 position:24% line:83% align:start
inside each person,
dispersed and severed,

00:56:57.804 --> 00:56:59.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
until by some chance,
several memories

00:56:59.974 --> 00:57:02.076 position:7% line:89% align:start
become connected to each other,

00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:04.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then that memory
grows a little bigger,

00:57:04.777 --> 00:57:06.180 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then the larger
memory draws in

00:57:06.213 --> 00:57:07.848 position:13% line:89% align:start
more fragments of memories,

00:57:07.881 --> 00:57:09.183 position:13% line:89% align:start
and they connect and merge

00:57:09.216 --> 00:57:11.151 position:33% line:83% align:start
into an even
bigger one, ever growing.

00:57:13.153 --> 00:57:15.022 position:5% line:89% align:start
And that process is what we call

00:57:15.055 --> 00:57:16.757 position:13% line:89% align:start
thinking or feeling, right?

00:57:18.692 --> 00:57:20.694 position:19% line:89% align:start
And that's just like--

00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:21.996 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Yes, that's right.

00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:24.164 position:30% line:83% align:start
The process you
described is just like

00:57:24.198 --> 00:57:27.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
how a star or galaxy is born.

00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:27.901 position:38% line:89% align:start
Amazing.

00:57:29.269 --> 00:57:30.137 position:30% line:89% align:start
- The Universe.

00:57:31.739 --> 00:57:33.240 position:35% line:89% align:start
And people.

00:57:33.273 --> 00:57:36.143 position:24% line:89% align:start
(mysterious music)

00:57:51.192 --> 00:57:53.994 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:57:58.199 --> 00:58:00.235 position:13% line:89% align:start
Where are Sora and Anglade?

00:58:06.074 --> 00:58:07.208 position:30% line:89% align:start
Umi, you okay?

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:10.644 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're burning up.

00:58:11.645 --> 00:58:13.848 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:58:24.993 --> 00:58:26.061 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please be okay.

00:58:36.405 --> 00:58:38.340 position:10% line:89% align:start
I remember when I was little,

00:58:38.374 --> 00:58:40.742 position:7% line:89% align:start
what my mom did to comfort me.

00:58:47.216 --> 00:58:51.320 position:13% line:89% align:start
♪ Hush, hush, go to sleep

00:58:51.353 --> 00:58:55.257 position:19% line:89% align:start
♪ Rest, my little one

00:58:55.291 --> 00:58:59.161 position:21% line:89% align:start
♪ I just adore you

00:58:59.195 --> 00:59:02.064 position:21% line:89% align:start
♪ More than anyone

00:59:04.934 --> 00:59:06.168 position:24% line:89% align:start
I forget the rest.

00:59:07.702 --> 00:59:10.306 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

00:59:15.845 --> 00:59:17.847 position:16% line:89% align:start
Anglade's yacht is gone.

00:59:19.048 --> 00:59:20.282 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:59:20.316 --> 00:59:22.184 position:21% line:89% align:start
The water's glowing.

00:59:23.252 --> 00:59:24.120 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Sea sparkle.

00:59:24.987 --> 00:59:26.856 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh, Sora.

00:59:26.889 --> 00:59:28.290 position:7% line:89% align:start
- They're known as sea sparkle.

00:59:28.324 --> 00:59:29.492 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Sea sparkle?

00:59:29.526 --> 00:59:32.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
- It's because of them that
the sea was red at sundown.

00:59:32.928 --> 00:59:33.597 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Oh.

00:59:33.629 --> 00:59:35.831 position:10% line:89% align:start
- They're a kind of plankton.

00:59:35.865 --> 00:59:37.299 position:5% line:89% align:start
They glow when they're agitated.

00:59:38.934 --> 00:59:39.802 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Amazing.

00:59:42.071 --> 00:59:43.873 position:30% line:83% align:start
They can make a
red sea glow blue.

00:59:46.343 --> 00:59:47.877 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:49.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sora, what are you...

00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:54.817 position:27% line:83% align:start
(water splashing)
(wondrous music)

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.263 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Now pay attention.

01:00:09.366 --> 01:00:12.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
Water organizes
itself into pockets.

01:00:12.035 --> 01:00:14.404 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you can find the pockets,
swimming becomes easy.

01:00:18.275 --> 01:00:19.142 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Beautiful.

01:00:22.812 --> 01:00:24.881 position:13% line:89% align:start
I wonder if I can do that.

01:00:27.484 --> 01:00:29.352 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka gasps)

01:00:29.386 --> 01:00:32.122 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:43.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:48.339 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's almost like...

01:00:48.372 --> 01:00:49.473 position:30% line:89% align:start
We could swim.

01:00:51.409 --> 01:00:54.978 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's almost like we could
swim all the way to the stars.

01:00:59.383 --> 01:01:02.886 position:16% line:83% align:start
- It's like the Milky Way
is above us and below us.

01:01:02.919 --> 01:01:05.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Dehdeh] And tomorrow's
the new moon.

01:01:05.323 --> 01:01:07.425 position:30% line:83% align:start
- It feels like
it's cradling all life.

01:01:09.293 --> 01:01:11.963 position:10% line:83% align:start
- [Dehdeh] The whole ocean is
orbiting around this meteorite

01:01:11.996 --> 01:01:14.865 position:27% line:83% align:start
that is believed
to have burned up.

01:01:14.899 --> 01:01:15.765 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you make of that?

01:01:17.134 --> 01:01:20.238 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Perhaps this world we live
in is all merely a dream.

01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:26.344 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was breathed into life
by the countless shellfish

01:01:26.377 --> 01:01:27.812 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the depths of the ocean.

01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:31.916 position:27% line:83% align:start
- What about Umi
and Sora, their origin?

01:01:31.949 --> 01:01:33.084 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where did they come from?

01:01:34.185 --> 01:01:35.419 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Who are they, really?

01:01:37.054 --> 01:01:38.557 position:10% line:89% align:start
- And where are they headed?

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
The same questions
apply to all of us.

01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:47.932 position:19% line:83% align:start
- There's little doubt
that those two boys

01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:51.235 position:10% line:83% align:start
see the world in a completely
different way than we do.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:53.037 position:27% line:83% align:start
Their perspective
is through the lens

01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:54.805 position:7% line:89% align:start
of a different place and time.

01:01:54.839 --> 01:01:56.441 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Dehdeh] It's a world
that the two of them share,

01:01:56.475 --> 01:01:59.511 position:30% line:83% align:start
but we couldn't
even begin to imagine.

01:01:59.544 --> 01:02:02.880 position:13% line:83% align:start
- And yet here we are, they
have appeared right before us.

01:02:04.216 --> 01:02:07.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Well, there's at least
one thing we can do for them

01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:09.221 position:16% line:89% align:start
and that's not to impede

01:02:09.254 --> 01:02:11.490 position:24% line:83% align:start
the natural course
of their journey.

01:02:11.523 --> 01:02:13.892 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you're truly
invested in them,

01:02:13.925 --> 01:02:15.427 position:7% line:89% align:start
vow to protect them from those

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.328 position:13% line:89% align:start
who think they know better.

01:02:17.929 --> 01:02:21.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
- It seems it's almost time
for the Festival to begin.

01:02:23.302 --> 01:02:24.970 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Indeed, it is.

01:02:25.003 --> 01:02:27.072 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the main guest
has been chosen.

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.177 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Don't worry.

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:37.049 position:24% line:83% align:start
Umi's body is just
restructuring itself.

01:02:39.351 --> 01:02:42.854 position:19% line:83% align:start
I did it too, and soon
it will happen again

01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:44.289 position:10% line:89% align:start
when the time finally comes.

01:02:54.567 --> 01:02:55.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
(dramatic piano music)

01:02:55.967 --> 01:02:57.135 position:21% line:89% align:start
- It's so beautiful.

01:03:00.306 --> 01:03:04.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
Things glow because
they want to be found.

01:03:04.177 --> 01:03:08.980 position:19% line:83% align:start
Umi taught me that, but
their beautiful light

01:03:09.015 --> 01:03:10.383 position:7% line:89% align:start
somehow makes them seem lonely.

01:03:12.352 --> 01:03:13.852 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe sad is the right word.

01:03:15.088 --> 01:03:17.323 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe because they'll
eventually disappear.

01:03:18.391 --> 01:03:21.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yet despite that,
they shine anyway.

01:03:29.502 --> 01:03:32.004 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just something
that crossed my mind,

01:03:32.038 --> 01:03:33.373 position:7% line:89% align:start
don't pay any attention to me.

01:03:44.618 --> 01:03:47.320 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wait, what did I just swallow?

01:03:47.353 --> 01:03:48.522 position:27% line:89% align:start
- The meteorite.

01:03:48.555 --> 01:03:50.156 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've decided to
entrust it to you.

01:03:51.692 --> 01:03:54.495 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:06.707 position:27% line:83% align:start
Remember, if ever
there comes a time

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
when that stone is
needed to save Umi,

01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:12.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
you must reach into your
stomach and give it to him.

01:04:12.413 --> 01:04:15.149 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:21.989 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

01:04:31.165 --> 01:04:32.499 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's happening?

01:04:35.637 --> 01:04:37.304 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sora?

01:04:37.337 --> 01:04:40.073 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:51.985 position:33% line:89% align:start
- It seems...

01:04:53.153 --> 01:04:55.122 position:16% line:89% align:start
I really am out of time.

01:04:55.155 --> 01:04:55.757 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Sora!

01:04:57.692 --> 01:04:59.494 position:13% line:89% align:start
- I thought it would happen

01:05:00.428 --> 01:05:03.598 position:7% line:89% align:start
on the night of the full moon.

01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:07.034 position:33% line:83% align:start
Both Jim and
Anglade miscalculated.

01:05:07.067 --> 01:05:09.002 position:10% line:89% align:start
Remember what you're seeing.

01:05:09.036 --> 01:05:11.606 position:21% line:83% align:start
It will help you when
it's time for Umi to--

01:05:11.639 --> 01:05:12.640 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Sora, wait!

01:05:14.676 --> 01:05:16.411 position:16% line:89% align:start
- The dugongs from today,

01:05:17.345 --> 01:05:20.048 position:7% line:89% align:start
maybe they came to collect me.

01:05:20.081 --> 01:05:22.750 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's much sooner than expected.

01:05:26.688 --> 01:05:27.555 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's too soon.

01:05:29.224 --> 01:05:30.325 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

01:05:30.358 --> 01:05:31.626 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Sora!

01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:34.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:05:47.442 --> 01:05:48.611 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's that noise again!

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.111 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's happening?

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.754 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:05:58.787 --> 01:06:01.524 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:06:05.159 --> 01:06:07.095 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

01:06:07.128 --> 01:06:08.163 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yay!

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:10.132 position:16% line:89% align:start
I want to see a dolphin!

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is it gonna jump, daddy?

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:15.137 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who's that?

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:20.109 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I'm starting to
wonder if Umi's

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
completely forgotten
how to speak.

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:22.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
- It's possible.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, he hasn't
since he got back.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:28.584 position:33% line:83% align:start
- All right,
show's starting soon,

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:30.653 position:27% line:89% align:start
time to get out.

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:32.655 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:35.624 position:24% line:89% align:start
(dolphin squawking)

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:59.849 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Well, at least she's back
home safe and sound now.

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:01.818 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Kanako] That's all
you have to say?

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.687 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I didn't mean for it
to come out like that.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.289 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Kanako] It's fine,
it's just what I expected.

01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:08.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
I get it, Ruka doesn't want
to stay at home with me

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.393 position:21% line:89% align:start
because I'm a drunk.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:12.429 position:5% line:89% align:start
You two are similar in that way.

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:15.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
- It's you and Ruka who
are just like each other.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:20.570 position:13% line:83% align:start
Both of you want people to
know how you're feeling,

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:22.539 position:33% line:83% align:start
but you don't
know how to express it

01:07:22.572 --> 01:07:26.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
so you get frustrated
and lash out at everyone.

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:29.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
That makes navigating
through life complicated.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:31.615 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now I understand.

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:33.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
Back then, I didn't
know what to do

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.886 position:10% line:89% align:start
or how to help you, I guess.

01:07:43.728 --> 01:07:44.594 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

01:07:46.864 --> 01:07:50.568 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Since we're being
honest, you are too.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:56.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Maybe I haven't done my best,

01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:58.476 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I want to make things right

01:07:58.509 --> 01:07:59.910 position:10% line:89% align:start
if you'll give me the chance.

01:08:04.715 --> 01:08:06.283 position:13% line:89% align:start
I think we belong together,

01:08:06.317 --> 01:08:08.586 position:27% line:83% align:start
living under the
same roof as a family.

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:15.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
(somber piano music)

01:08:23.401 --> 01:08:24.335 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Ah, Jim.

01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:25.302 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're finally here.

01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:27.772 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah.

01:08:34.913 --> 01:08:37.415 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Unfortunately, we
didn't make it in time.

01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:40.618 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sora is already gone.

01:08:42.253 --> 01:08:43.855 position:27% line:83% align:start
Out on the ocean
I heard the sound

01:08:43.889 --> 01:08:45.456 position:10% line:89% align:start
traveling through the water.

01:08:46.925 --> 01:08:51.930 position:19% line:83% align:start
698.45 hertz, the sound
a star makes when dying.

01:08:53.632 --> 01:08:55.967 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then, by the time
I got back to shore,

01:08:57.569 --> 01:08:59.738 position:16% line:89% align:start
I found Umi with a fever

01:08:59.771 --> 01:09:01.973 position:30% line:83% align:start
and Ruka lying
catatonic on the beach.

01:09:05.644 --> 01:09:07.646 position:30% line:83% align:start
- [Jim] So, you
think Sora's dead?

01:09:11.516 --> 01:09:12.384 position:30% line:89% align:start
- I don't know.

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.989 position:16% line:83% align:start
Could be the Festival of
that Dehdeh they spoke of.

01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:30.702 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Either way, you're
saying that in the end

01:09:30.736 --> 01:09:32.771 position:21% line:83% align:start
there was nothing we
could've done for him.

01:09:34.339 --> 01:09:35.007 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm.

01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:39.912 position:19% line:89% align:start
(dramatic piano music)

01:09:46.518 --> 01:09:49.421 position:10% line:83% align:start
What's strange is that I can
still sense Sora's presence.

01:09:57.897 --> 01:10:00.298 position:33% line:83% align:start
I need to see
further into the stars.

01:10:07.874 --> 01:10:10.610 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

01:10:13.479 --> 01:10:16.682 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Woman] Step forward,
make some room!

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.322 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:31.064 position:33% line:89% align:start
(drum music)

01:10:35.401 --> 01:10:36.536 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Sora] Ruka.

01:10:45.478 --> 01:10:47.815 position:33% line:89% align:start
(drum music)

01:11:08.535 --> 01:11:10.737 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sniffing)

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.989 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka gasps)

01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:31.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

01:11:37.764 --> 01:11:39.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

01:11:41.936 --> 01:11:44.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Ruka] Somewhere
deep inside me,

01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:46.107 position:19% line:89% align:start
a whirlpool is coiling.

01:11:47.075 --> 01:11:49.010 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Why are they doing that?

01:11:54.616 --> 01:11:57.417 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:11:59.988 --> 01:12:00.989 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

01:12:01.022 --> 01:12:03.157 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Woman] Is there
something out in the ocean?

01:12:04.092 --> 01:12:05.894 position:5% line:89% align:start
- [Woman] What is that, a whale?

01:12:05.927 --> 01:12:07.795 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Woman] What is that?

01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:12.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Chief, there's a
whale outside!

01:12:12.033 --> 01:12:12.834 position:35% line:89% align:start
- A whale?

01:12:15.136 --> 01:12:17.939 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:23.678 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

01:12:23.711 --> 01:12:24.579 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Whoa.

01:12:24.612 --> 01:12:26.714 position:24% line:89% align:start
- It's a humpback!

01:12:26.748 --> 01:12:29.484 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.903 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Both of you have eyes
connected to a world

01:12:47.937 --> 01:12:49.838 position:19% line:89% align:start
far beyond this place.

01:12:50.973 --> 01:12:51.740 position:30% line:89% align:start
- You're right.

01:12:51.774 --> 01:12:53.709 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why I need
to get out there.

01:12:54.977 --> 01:12:57.445 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Lucky for you, I'm
a shepherd of the sea.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.447 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hop aboard.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.489 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah, great wind.

01:13:07.523 --> 01:13:08.958 position:24% line:89% align:start
Great currents too.

01:13:08.991 --> 01:13:12.528 position:16% line:83% align:start
We have a good chance of
catching up to that whale.

01:13:12.561 --> 01:13:14.229 position:7% line:89% align:start
- This whale song, I heard it.

01:13:15.164 --> 01:13:18.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
- It's searching for its guest

01:13:20.102 --> 01:13:22.972 position:27% line:83% align:start
while singing the
song of the stars.

01:13:24.106 --> 01:13:25.741 position:16% line:89% align:start
- The song of the stars.

01:13:25.774 --> 01:13:28.110 position:5% line:89% align:start
- From the star, from the stars.

01:13:28.144 --> 01:13:30.113 position:19% line:89% align:start
The sea is the mother.

01:13:30.146 --> 01:13:31.680 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Gather every star you can

01:13:31.714 --> 01:13:33.116 position:16% line:89% align:start
and drop them in the sea,

01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:35.751 position:27% line:83% align:start
the waves gently
rock them back to sleep.

01:13:35.784 --> 01:13:38.188 position:13% line:83% align:start
I remember the lyrics that
I had forgotten before.

01:13:38.221 --> 01:13:40.957 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's from that lullaby my
mom used to sing to me.

01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:52.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
(string strumming)

01:14:02.879 --> 01:14:05.281 position:7% line:89% align:start
The winds sing along with you.

01:14:06.816 --> 01:14:09.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
- The whales sing the
song of the stars,

01:14:09.252 --> 01:14:11.721 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the wind carries the
memories of the ocean.

01:14:12.922 --> 01:14:15.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
We've taken the messages
from those memories

01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:18.828 position:21% line:83% align:start
and passed them down
through songs and poems.

01:14:18.862 --> 01:14:21.598 position:19% line:83% align:start
But words are only able
to capture a fraction

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:24.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
of the language of the
wind, just like a sail.

01:14:26.169 --> 01:14:29.072 position:16% line:83% align:start
This instrument is a way
to talk with the wind

01:14:29.105 --> 01:14:31.242 position:7% line:89% align:start
and the memories of the ocean,

01:14:31.275 --> 01:14:33.643 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the feelings
we cannot express.

01:14:35.379 --> 01:14:38.315 position:24% line:89% align:start
(string strumming)

01:14:39.616 --> 01:14:41.118 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] I hear a small voice

01:14:41.152 --> 01:14:42.852 position:24% line:83% align:start
being carried along
with the wind.

01:14:45.389 --> 01:14:48.691 position:16% line:83% align:start
These memories come to us
when we least expect it.

01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:52.662 position:13% line:89% align:start
Memories of someone's life,

01:14:52.695 --> 01:14:55.099 position:16% line:89% align:start
of their past and future.

01:14:55.132 --> 01:14:58.135 position:21% line:89% align:start
(somber flute music)

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:11.982 position:33% line:83% align:start
- A school of
false killer whales.

01:15:12.016 --> 01:15:14.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
Their destination must
be the same as ours,

01:15:15.252 --> 01:15:16.353 position:24% line:89% align:start
that is good news.

01:15:17.855 --> 01:15:19.357 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:20.891 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Huh?

01:15:20.925 --> 01:15:21.792 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why did I jump in?

01:15:27.265 --> 01:15:29.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
I lost track of Umi.

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:32.670 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

01:15:32.703 --> 01:15:33.338 position:24% line:89% align:start
(whale screeching)

01:15:33.371 --> 01:15:34.805 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

01:15:34.839 --> 01:15:37.409 position:7% line:89% align:start
What are you trying to tell me?

01:15:37.442 --> 01:15:40.312 position:24% line:89% align:start
(whale screeching)

01:15:43.681 --> 01:15:45.283 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know everything
Sora is feeling

01:15:46.418 --> 01:15:47.919 position:13% line:89% align:start
because I can feel it too.

01:15:50.889 --> 01:15:53.892 position:24% line:89% align:start
(whales screeching)

01:15:54.758 --> 01:15:57.362 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

01:16:15.747 --> 01:16:18.417 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.149 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

01:17:18.344 --> 01:17:21.280 position:24% line:89% align:start
(mysterious music)

01:17:41.834 --> 01:17:44.438 position:33% line:83% align:start
- [Umi] Ruka,
the song is coming!

01:17:46.573 --> 01:17:47.840 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] Umi?

01:17:48.976 --> 01:17:51.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Umi] It's coming
straight at you!

01:17:54.314 --> 01:17:57.050 position:30% line:89% align:start
(whale singing)

01:17:59.453 --> 01:18:01.922 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:18:18.005 --> 01:18:19.239 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Amazing.

01:18:19.273 --> 01:18:21.442 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've never heard the
song this loud before.

01:18:32.052 --> 01:18:34.221 position:27% line:89% align:start
The whole ocean.

01:18:34.255 --> 01:18:37.558 position:21% line:83% align:start
The entire ocean has
begun gathering together.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.163 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

01:18:57.245 --> 01:18:59.881 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Surely this is an
excessive amount of security.

01:18:59.914 --> 01:19:02.517 position:24% line:83% align:start
- It's nothing more
than our usual protocol.

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:04.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
- The target destination
veers quite far

01:19:04.419 --> 01:19:05.453 position:21% line:89% align:start
from our predictions.

01:19:05.486 --> 01:19:07.021 position:30% line:83% align:start
- I understand,
but I assure you,

01:19:07.055 --> 01:19:09.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
it is the center of the Festival

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:11.492 position:21% line:83% align:start
where all the answers
will be revealed.

01:19:11.526 --> 01:19:13.328 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Then well done, Jim.

01:19:13.361 --> 01:19:15.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like we'll have the
best seats in the house.

01:19:18.433 --> 01:19:19.967 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Best of luck to you all.

01:19:22.604 --> 01:19:24.807 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I'll be taking
my own route there.

01:19:28.677 --> 01:19:31.312 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, I wonder if there's
anything else left

01:19:31.347 --> 01:19:32.381 position:19% line:89% align:start
that I can do for them.

01:19:35.651 --> 01:19:38.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just wish I could've
bought them more time.

01:19:38.554 --> 01:19:41.390 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's why we started testing
them in the first place,

01:19:41.423 --> 01:19:44.593 position:13% line:83% align:start
but then things got out of
hand with the experiments,

01:19:44.626 --> 01:19:46.295 position:24% line:83% align:start
and those children
ended up becoming

01:19:46.328 --> 01:19:47.995 position:13% line:89% align:start
the victims in the process.

01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:52.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Dehdeh told me that if
I cared for the children

01:19:52.134 --> 01:19:53.001 position:21% line:89% align:start
I had to protect them

01:19:53.035 --> 01:19:56.271 position:30% line:83% align:start
from those who
thought they knew better,

01:19:56.305 --> 01:19:58.140 position:27% line:83% align:start
those people who
believe that humans

01:19:58.173 --> 01:20:00.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
are superior to everything else.

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:08.250 position:13% line:83% align:start
- I'm not sure, but I hope
this is enough to protect them.

01:20:08.283 --> 01:20:09.985 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Jim!

01:20:10.018 --> 01:20:11.253 position:16% line:89% align:start
Umi and Ruka are missing.

01:20:12.321 --> 01:20:14.123 position:30% line:83% align:start
You know where
they are, don't you?

01:20:16.191 --> 01:20:18.527 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have to take
us to them, please.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.462 position:10% line:89% align:start
- You have to take us to her.

01:20:20.496 --> 01:20:21.631 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

01:20:31.708 --> 01:20:33.041 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Little fish.

01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:36.379 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.047 position:19% line:89% align:start
Your home is that way.

01:20:45.355 --> 01:20:46.222 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

01:20:49.659 --> 01:20:50.660 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

01:20:52.462 --> 01:20:54.531 position:21% line:83% align:start
Creatures of the sea
can't survive here.

01:20:56.466 --> 01:20:57.333 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah, ah!

01:20:58.401 --> 01:21:00.103 position:24% line:89% align:start
Umi, are you okay?

01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:02.539 position:38% line:89% align:start
Umi, hey!

01:21:02.572 --> 01:21:04.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
We have to get you
back in the water.

01:21:06.309 --> 01:21:09.145 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

01:21:09.179 --> 01:21:10.713 position:7% line:89% align:start
Which world does Umi belong in?

01:21:12.716 --> 01:21:15.518 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

01:21:32.703 --> 01:21:34.738 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka gasps)

01:21:34.772 --> 01:21:36.005 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi?

01:21:36.039 --> 01:21:37.106 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where are you?

01:21:40.478 --> 01:21:41.345 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi?

01:21:42.279 --> 01:21:45.081 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wondrous music)

01:21:47.585 --> 01:21:50.387 position:27% line:89% align:start
(haunting music)

01:21:57.261 --> 01:21:59.597 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ruka gasps)

01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:27.157 position:33% line:89% align:start
What are you?

01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:37.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
This creature, it's
been here all alone

01:22:38.202 --> 01:22:39.303 position:21% line:89% align:start
for a very long time.

01:22:40.405 --> 01:22:41.439 position:21% line:89% align:start
You've been watching.

01:22:44.843 --> 01:22:45.677 position:35% line:89% align:start
Incredible.

01:22:46.811 --> 01:22:50.649 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even down here in
this dark, sunken place,

01:22:50.682 --> 01:22:51.783 position:24% line:89% align:start
life still exists.

01:22:53.451 --> 01:22:57.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
All the memories from every
creature in the sea are here.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.361 position:27% line:89% align:start
(whale clicking)

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:08.633 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water bubbling)

01:23:15.808 --> 01:23:18.209 position:35% line:89% align:start
(coughing)

01:23:42.835 --> 01:23:43.703 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sora?

01:23:47.473 --> 01:23:50.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Ruka, your role
in this is now over.

01:23:51.644 --> 01:23:52.511 position:33% line:89% align:start
You did well.

01:23:55.381 --> 01:23:56.649 position:35% line:89% align:start
- My role?

01:23:56.682 --> 01:23:58.217 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:59.619 position:13% line:89% align:start
The meteorite has awakened.

01:24:01.687 --> 01:24:04.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
- And what happens when
the meteorite awakens?

01:24:04.357 --> 01:24:06.726 position:19% line:83% align:start
- It becomes the eye of
a tremendous whirlpool.

01:24:08.194 --> 01:24:10.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can stick around
if you want to see it,

01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:11.865 position:13% line:89% align:start
although I'm not quite sure

01:24:11.898 --> 01:24:14.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're gonna be able to
handle what comes next.

01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:19.906 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You look like Sora,

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.674 position:30% line:83% align:start
but you're not
really Sora, are you?

01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:23.944 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Like I told you before,

01:24:23.977 --> 01:24:26.647 position:33% line:83% align:start
all memories
converge in the meteorite.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.348 position:16% line:83% align:start
This memory is taken from
someone you've known,

01:24:29.382 --> 01:24:30.884 position:13% line:89% align:start
it's one of your memories.

01:24:30.917 --> 01:24:33.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's part of the meteorite,
and it's part of you.

01:24:35.656 --> 01:24:38.224 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, it's time
to close your eyes.

01:24:39.426 --> 01:24:40.694 position:24% line:89% align:start
Slowly and gently.

01:24:42.696 --> 01:24:43.563 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good girl.

01:24:45.766 --> 01:24:49.870 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sky and ocean align to mark
the beginning of the Festival.

01:24:49.903 --> 01:24:53.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sing now, sing of
the joy of being born.

01:24:54.608 --> 01:24:56.643 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is your lullaby.

01:24:56.677 --> 01:24:57.477 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can you hear it?

01:24:58.412 --> 01:24:59.579 position:24% line:89% align:start
The song has begun.

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:03.483 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Universe and
all its creatures

01:25:03.517 --> 01:25:05.485 position:19% line:89% align:start
are singing in unison.

01:25:08.555 --> 01:25:09.690 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You're being so mean.

01:25:11.358 --> 01:25:14.561 position:24% line:83% align:start
- The Universe is a
life form unto itself.

01:25:14.594 --> 01:25:17.464 position:27% line:83% align:start
The planets with
oceans are its womb,

01:25:17.497 --> 01:25:19.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
and meteorites
provide the sperm,

01:25:19.934 --> 01:25:22.369 position:13% line:89% align:start
the Festival of Conception.

01:25:22.402 --> 01:25:25.605 position:16% line:83% align:start
For generations, we have
witnessed the ritual

01:25:25.639 --> 01:25:27.875 position:7% line:89% align:start
and sang the songs of its tale.

01:25:27.909 --> 01:25:31.846 position:19% line:83% align:start
From the star, from the
stars, the sea is the mother.

01:25:32.914 --> 01:25:35.449 position:13% line:89% align:start
And now the song continues.

01:25:35.482 --> 01:25:38.853 position:16% line:83% align:start
The people are her bosom,
heaven is the playground,

01:25:38.886 --> 01:25:41.689 position:10% line:89% align:start
and now the Festival begins.

01:25:41.723 --> 01:25:42.523 position:38% line:89% align:start
Finally.

01:25:45.626 --> 01:25:47.328 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Ruka] I want to see!

01:25:47.361 --> 01:25:49.897 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:02.098 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see it.

01:28:02.131 --> 01:28:03.800 position:24% line:89% align:start
Am I the Universe?

01:28:03.833 --> 01:28:06.569 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:28:44.975 --> 01:28:48.012 position:13% line:89% align:start
♪ Hush, hush go to sleep

01:28:48.045 --> 01:28:49.713 position:19% line:89% align:start

01:28:49.747 --> 01:28:51.715 position:19% line:89% align:start
♪ Rest, my little one

01:28:51.749 --> 01:28:52.850 position:13% line:89% align:start

01:30:22.174 --> 01:30:23.042 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, don't!

01:30:27.679 --> 01:30:28.546 position:35% line:89% align:start
You can't!

01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:32.018 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi!

01:30:32.051 --> 01:30:34.787 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:31:27.074 --> 01:31:30.576 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Umi] They shine because
they want to be found.

01:31:31.344 --> 01:31:33.146 position:21% line:89% align:start
- That's Umi's light.

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:39.352 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby crying)

01:31:50.897 --> 01:31:53.700 position:27% line:89% align:start

01:33:24.926 --> 01:33:28.096 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashes)

01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:28.930 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi!

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.167 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi?

01:33:37.406 --> 01:33:38.340 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, please.

01:33:40.776 --> 01:33:42.244 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where are you?

01:33:42.277 --> 01:33:45.480 position:19% line:89% align:start
(calming toy box music)

01:34:08.504 --> 01:34:10.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Good and evil.

01:34:11.474 --> 01:34:12.975 position:10% line:89% align:start
The Universe is held together

01:34:13.008 --> 01:34:15.777 position:10% line:89% align:start
by balancing opposing forces.

01:34:15.811 --> 01:34:17.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
Indeed, all things
can be observed

01:34:17.347 --> 01:34:19.815 position:10% line:89% align:start
from one of two perspectives.

01:34:19.848 --> 01:34:22.784 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just like the lifeforms from
the land and sea are different.

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.855 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, actually they're the same.

01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:30.859 position:33% line:83% align:start
At the basic
level, all lifeforms

01:34:30.892 --> 01:34:32.962 position:10% line:89% align:start
are made of the same matter.

01:34:32.996 --> 01:34:35.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
Matter that came
from outer space.

01:34:36.032 --> 01:34:38.001 position:24% line:83% align:start
Every one of us is
comprised of it.

01:34:39.235 --> 01:34:43.106 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, outer space and
humanity are similar.

01:34:44.374 --> 01:34:47.477 position:19% line:83% align:start
Actually, if we're made
from the same substance,

01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:50.546 position:10% line:83% align:start
then we're not just similar,
we're exactly alike.

01:34:51.848 --> 01:34:54.550 position:13% line:89% align:start
The Sun, the sea, humanity,

01:34:55.619 --> 01:34:58.421 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sora, and Umi, and me.

01:34:58.454 --> 01:35:01.157 position:24% line:83% align:start
Every single living
thing here on Earth.

01:35:06.129 --> 01:35:09.032 position:10% line:89% align:start
If we went into outer space,

01:35:09.065 --> 01:35:10.800 position:33% line:83% align:start
it would look
just like the ocean.

01:35:12.569 --> 01:35:16.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
(haunting ambient music)

01:35:35.526 --> 01:35:36.393 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Umi!

01:35:42.533 --> 01:35:43.467 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:47.037 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did you just say goodbye?

01:36:02.554 --> 01:36:03.420 position:38% line:89% align:start
Umi, no!

01:36:06.591 --> 01:36:08.359 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where are you going?

01:36:08.392 --> 01:36:11.128 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:36:15.633 --> 01:36:16.501 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait!

01:36:20.003 --> 01:36:20.871 position:44% line:89% align:start
Umi!

01:36:25.276 --> 01:36:26.144 position:38% line:89% align:start
Umi, no!

01:36:29.046 --> 01:36:29.913 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait!

01:36:42.961 --> 01:36:44.529 position:27% line:89% align:start
Take me with you.

01:36:44.562 --> 01:36:47.298 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:36:52.003 --> 01:36:52.670 position:38% line:89% align:start
I want...

01:36:58.042 --> 01:36:59.911 position:19% line:89% align:start
I want to be with you!

01:37:04.583 --> 01:37:05.450 position:38% line:89% align:start
Forever!

01:37:09.053 --> 01:37:11.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:38:47.287 --> 01:38:49.422 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:52.726 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Ruka!

01:38:52.759 --> 01:38:53.560 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ruka!

01:38:54.494 --> 01:38:55.730 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Ruka, hold onto me!

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.131 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here.

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:03.671 position:30% line:89% align:start
We've got you.

01:39:04.739 --> 01:39:06.339 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Ruka?

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:07.173 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ruka?

01:39:11.344 --> 01:39:14.347 position:24% line:89% align:start
(seagull squawking)

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.581 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Move it!

01:39:46.614 --> 01:39:47.548 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Come on, let's go!

01:39:47.582 --> 01:39:48.449 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Got it.

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:52.219 position:30% line:89% align:start
(cats snarling)

01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:55.256 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Aw, great.

01:39:56.591 --> 01:39:58.492 position:24% line:89% align:start
Good bounty today.

01:39:58.526 --> 01:40:00.528 position:16% line:89% align:start
The seas were good to us.

01:40:25.387 --> 01:40:28.323 position:24% line:89% align:start
(string strumming)

01:40:51.413 --> 01:40:54.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I think I was probably
just about your age

01:40:56.318 --> 01:40:58.253 position:7% line:89% align:start
when I also met a beautiful boy

01:40:58.286 --> 01:40:59.488 position:19% line:89% align:start
who came from the sea.

01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:05.560 position:7% line:83% align:start
The children of the sea quietly
appear before us one day,

01:41:05.594 --> 01:41:07.529 position:30% line:83% align:start
and whisper the
stories of their truth.

01:41:11.601 --> 01:41:13.970 position:27% line:83% align:start
The stories about
where we came from

01:41:14.003 --> 01:41:15.505 position:19% line:89% align:start
and where we are going,

01:41:15.538 --> 01:41:17.473 position:16% line:89% align:start
and the reason we exist.

01:41:23.613 --> 01:41:26.749 position:13% line:83% align:start
The clues we get to unlock
the secrets of the world

01:41:26.783 --> 01:41:29.686 position:13% line:89% align:start
are revealed in many forms.

01:41:29.719 --> 01:41:31.821 position:16% line:89% align:start
The goddess of the whale,

01:41:31.854 --> 01:41:33.423 position:13% line:89% align:start
boys who slip through time.

01:41:34.791 --> 01:41:38.828 position:7% line:83% align:start
They reach out to us, touching
us with their messages

01:41:38.861 --> 01:41:40.396 position:19% line:89% align:start
traveling on the wind.

01:41:41.664 --> 01:41:44.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Universe exists
everywhere in disguise

01:41:44.333 --> 01:41:46.235 position:21% line:89% align:start
right in front of us.

01:41:46.269 --> 01:41:49.205 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even a small story that fits
in the palm of your hand.

01:41:53.911 --> 01:41:57.848 position:35% line:89% align:start
- My own...

01:41:57.881 --> 01:41:58.681 position:33% line:89% align:start
My own story.

01:42:00.984 --> 01:42:03.619 position:30% line:89% align:start
(fan spinning)

01:42:11.561 --> 01:42:12.462 position:35% line:89% align:start
I didn't...

01:42:15.498 --> 01:42:16.800 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't understand anything.

01:42:19.603 --> 01:42:21.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
I just want to see
them one more time.

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.007 position:24% line:89% align:start
I wanted to ask...

01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.978 position:41% line:89% align:start
Why me?

01:42:31.448 --> 01:42:32.316 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm not worthy.

01:42:38.622 --> 01:42:40.758 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

01:42:43.861 --> 01:42:46.530 position:27% line:83% align:start
- You're perfect
just as you are.

01:42:50.934 --> 01:42:55.039 position:33% line:83% align:start
You must have
faith in Umi and Sora,

01:42:55.073 --> 01:42:57.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
but most
importantly in yourself.

01:43:00.444 --> 01:43:03.514 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

01:43:11.022 --> 01:43:13.858 position:27% line:89% align:start
(seagulls cawing)

01:43:59.071 --> 01:44:01.806 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ball bouncing)

01:44:14.053 --> 01:44:15.788 position:19% line:89% align:start
- The sky and the sea.

01:44:19.825 --> 01:44:20.726 position:24% line:89% align:start
They're both here.

01:44:26.198 --> 01:44:30.870 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that's everything that
happened on my summer break.

01:48:29.245 --> 01:48:31.848 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby crying)

01:48:36.219 --> 01:48:38.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Can you come over here
and cut the umbilical cord?

01:48:38.821 --> 01:48:42.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I asked them if you'd
let them cut it for me.

01:48:42.325 --> 01:48:43.793 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

01:48:43.826 --> 01:48:44.660 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby crying)

01:48:44.694 --> 01:48:45.828 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Nurse] Here.

01:48:48.965 --> 01:48:51.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
(waves crashing)

01:48:53.102 --> 01:48:55.705 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby crying)

01:49:03.313 --> 01:49:05.215 position:30% line:89% align:start
(scissor snips)

01:49:05.249 --> 01:49:08.318 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Ruka] I could feel the
sensation of cutting off a life.

01:49:17.861 --> 01:49:19.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mom?

01:49:19.997 --> 01:49:21.331 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Yeah, what is it?

01:49:22.799 --> 01:49:24.468 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Do you remember that lullaby

01:49:24.501 --> 01:49:25.869 position:19% line:89% align:start
you used to sing to me?

01:49:27.504 --> 01:49:28.939 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was wondering
if you learned it

01:49:28.972 --> 01:49:31.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
from your mom singing it to you.

01:49:31.108 --> 01:49:31.909 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

01:49:31.942 --> 01:49:32.976 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:49:33.010 --> 01:49:35.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your grandmother used to
sing it to me all the time

01:49:35.979 --> 01:49:39.049 position:16% line:83% align:start
back when I was a little
girl in the village.

01:49:39.082 --> 01:49:40.784 position:13% line:89% align:start
What made you ask me that?

01:49:49.226 --> 01:49:50.428 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Oh, no reason.

01:49:54.031 --> 01:49:57.235 position:13% line:89% align:start
