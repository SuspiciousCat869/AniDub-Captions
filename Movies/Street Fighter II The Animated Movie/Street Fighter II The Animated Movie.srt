1
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,795
(upbeat music)

2
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,367
(thunder roaring)

3
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,907
(men shouting)

4
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,017
(fighter panting)

5
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:00,120
(both grunting)

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,623
(thunder roars)

7
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,293
(both grunting)

8
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,896
(thunder booms)

9
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,504
(fighters grunting)

10
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,066
(Ryu panting)

11
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,772
(thunder booms)

12
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,682
(both grunting)

13
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,069
(Sagat chuckles)

14
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,572
(Sagat yells)

15
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,279
(both grunting)

16
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,433
(Sagat pants)

17
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,807
(Ryu pants)

18
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,146
(thunder crackles)

19
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,750
(Sagat grunts)

20
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,454
(Sagat pants)

21
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,124
(thunder booms)

22
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,465
(Ryu pants)

23
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,975
(Sagat yells)

24
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,846
(Ryu yells)

25
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,333
(rock music)

26
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,976
(upbeat music)

27
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,184
(people chattering)

28
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,221
- [Reporter] Sir, what is your position on the homeless?

29
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,455
- Oh my goodness, what a crowd.

30
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,158
- Well, let's tackle one problem at a time.

31
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,560
- [Journalist] Minister, do you care to make a statement

32
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,561
on anti-corruption?

33
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,562
- No, sorry.

34
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,270
Thanks.

35
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,805
- [Reporter] Mr. Sellers, could we have a statement?

36
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,708
(crowd shouting)

37
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,976
- [Sellers] Huh?

38
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,612
(Cammy yells)

39
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,813
- [Guard] Get back, sir.

40
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,884
- [Cammy] Going somewhere, Mr. Sellers?

41
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,320
- [Sellers] What do you want?

42
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,357
(bones crunching)

43
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,661
- After her, come on. - Get her back.

44
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:06,666
- Give me some back-up. (Cammy yelling)

45
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,736
- Get the hell off me you...

46
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,105
- What the hell's going on? - Over here.

47
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,608
(Cammy yells)

48
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,878
- This timid little flower is Cammy White.

49
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,115
What we know is that she's a special agent attached to MI-6.

50
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,118
She's being interrogated at Base B.

51
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,354
However, she claims to have no memory

52
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,955
of the past three years.

53
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,391
- Which means?

54
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,227
- Which means, sir, she's being controlled somehow.

55
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,862
According to our data,

56
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,098
Shadowlaw is creating its own terrorists

57
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,667
by manipulating the victim's subconscious.

58
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,136
We're trying to figure out how that's being done.

59
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,405
- We do know that Shadowlaw

60
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,474
isn't selecting killing machines at random.

61
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,742
It's gathering information

62
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,543
on street fighters around the world.

63
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,646
We've had several reports on this.

64
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,682
- Street fighters turning terrorist?

65
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,151
- This walking mountain of muscle is called Sagat.

66
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,819
He's a champion Muay Thai fighter

67
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,455
and is considered a national hero in Thailand.

68
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,392
Contestant number two is Balrog,

69
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,093
whose penchant for violent behavior

70
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,996
got him permanently banned from boxing.

71
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,665
From Spain, we have Vega.

72
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,734
He's savage, ruthless, and a card-carrying psychopath.

73
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,671
- Bison has recruited these three mercenaries

74
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,639
to be special soldiers for Shadowlaw.

75
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,474
They're all extremely dangerous.

76
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,177
- [Officer] Hm.

77
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,814
- Each year, the crimes they commit grow bigger

78
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,215
and more brazen.

79
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,052
Shadowlaw must be crushed once and for all.

80
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,953
- We are going to plan a joint investigation

81
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,122
with the American military forces.

82
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,692
(jets roaring)

83
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,867
(engines whirring)

84
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,748
- Captain Guile.

85
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,851
Someone from Interpol is here to see you.

86
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,586
- For me, here?

87
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,420
Hm.

88
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,296
- I'm Chun-Li.

89
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,497
- Yeah, and?

90
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,032
- Oh.

91
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,867
Well, captain, we're here to discuss the joint Shadowlaw

92
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,068
investigation with you.

93
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,504
- Bison's ass is mine.

94
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,072
- Huh?

95
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,741
What do you mean, captain?

96
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,908
- [Guile] I don't need Interpol's

97
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,977
or anyone else's help to take him out.

98
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,848
- Hey, brush-head, this is not a request.

99
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,952
- You want Bison destroyed, don't ya?

100
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,254
So what's the problem?

101
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,088
- Uh.

102
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,226
(growls)

103
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,198
(plane whooshing)

104
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,006
(mystical music)

105
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,230
(engines whirring)

106
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,205
(ominous music)

107
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,002
- [Scientist] Of course, if you're...

108
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:36,803
Oh.

109
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,753
- I've been expecting you, sir.

110
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,087
- Is it ready?

111
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:28,922
- Yes.

112
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,827
A masterpiece of computer technology.

113
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,596
It's splendid.

114
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:40,466
We've created the ultimate high-performance monitor cyborg.

115
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,570
It's state of the art.

116
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,372
The images it receives are immediately beamed

117
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,677
via satellite to the supercomputer at headquarters.

118
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,679
They've been so successful,

119
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,614
we've already replaced our older,

120
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:58,551
obsolete surveillance robots with these superior models.

121
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,352
- Good.

122
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,590
(gears whirring)

123
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,459
And the man I'm looking for,

124
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,661
has there been any report of him?

125
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,296
- No, my lord, not yet.

126
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,032
- Any man strong enough to beat the crap out of Sagat

127
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,301
is a man I want found.

128
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,737
- I assure you, we're scouring the world for him

129
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,139
and other fighters as well.

130
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,076
But, sir, do you really think that this man Ryu

131
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,546
is as powerful as the computer analysis rates him?

132
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,814
(chuckles)

133
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,016
Even the highest-ranking martial arts specialists

134
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,051
average only 2,000.

135
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:36,122
It seems incomprehensible that he could rank over 3,000.

136
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,591
- I don't recall asking

137
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,860
for your inept opinion regarding this.

138
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,564
I expect you to employ every means necessary to find him.

139
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,667
Search everywhere, even if you have to fly a cyborg

140
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,302
into the depths of the Himalayas.

141
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,785
(pleasant music)

142
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,469
- Shoryuken.

143
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,849
- [Sensei] Ryu, what do you see in front of your fist?

144
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,521
(both grunting)

145
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,119
(Ken yells)

146
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:48,988
- Oh?

147
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,823
- [Sensei] Good.

148
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,391
That's enough for now.

149
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,727
You both deserve a rest.

150
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,264
Ryu, Ken, you boys go fetch some water from the valley

151
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,932
before breakfast, eh?

152
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,167
- [Both] Yes, sensei.

153
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,737
(Ryu sighs)

154
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,106
- Hey, girlfriend, why don't you throw more punches?

155
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,541
Might break a nail?

156
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,443
Wooga, wooga, wooga.

157
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,844
- Get off me.

158
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,479
What are you accusing me of, sluffing off?

159
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,714
- Just kidding.

160
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,250
Gosh, you're so sensitive.

161
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,585
(Ryu yells)

162
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,890
Hey, not bad if you're planning to fight old ladies.

163
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,558
We won't be training forever, you know?

164
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,261
The time will come when our lives will depend on this.

165
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,038
(wind howling)

166
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,488
(rock music)

167
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,289
- Oh.

168
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,324
- Sorry I'm late, honey.

169
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,195
- I was beginning to think that you'd forgot all about me.

170
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,131
- I was delayed by underestimating my opponent.

171
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,367
He was much better than I actually thought.

172
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,102
- And?

173
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,370
How did you do?

174
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,671
- I won.

175
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,505
- Oh.

176
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,343
I guess you can put another notch on your gun, cowboy.

177
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,178
- Uh-huh.

178
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,249
- Time is money.

179
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,150
Does he care?

180
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,619
Obviously not.

181
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,488
It's a little difficult to make the movie without the star.

182
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,723
- He knew when his call time was

183
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,758
but nobody's seen him since lunch.

184
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,593
- [Director] It's always something with that Fei Long.

185
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,728
He's an asshole.

186
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,764
- That idiot doesn't stand a chance.

187
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,334
Come on, kick his ass.

188
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,836
- Hey, Fei Long.

189
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,371
- Oh man, what's this?

190
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,007
- [Friend] Nothing, a little extra fun, that's all.

191
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,475
- Fun?

192
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,710
- Yeah, they're dragging some poor schmuck into the ring

193
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,113
who's dumb enough to shoot off his big mouth, you know?

194
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,848
- Hey, I didn't say anything.

195
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,017
- The fighters don't take smart-ass remarks

196
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,919
lightly around here, chicken.

197
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,921
- You can back up your words, can't ya?

198
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,458
- Eh, looks interesting.

199
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,260
- Maybe showbiz turned you into a big star

200
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,996
but this stuff brings you back, doesn't it, huh?

201
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,666
- Keep your eye on the new guy, he looks good.

202
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,566
- Huh?

203
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,236
(bones popping)

204
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,709
(both grunting)

205
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,688
- Not bad, or was it just luck?

206
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,860
Let's see how well you do against a fighter like me.

207
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,430
(upbeat music)

208
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,334
- Come on, double or nothing on Fei Long.

209
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,903
- There's been a shortage of new blood around here lately.

210
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,237
So, what's your name?

211
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,173
- I'm just passing through here.

212
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,709
Just a Japanese guy taking in a fight.

213
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,111
And Ryu is my name.

214
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,347
(Fei chuckles)

215
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:39,285
- [Crowd] Fei Long, Fei Long, Fei Long, Fei Long, Fei Long.

216
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,825
(Fei shouts)

217
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,799
(Ryu grunts)

218
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,135
(Fei howls)

219
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,873
- [Onlooker] That's great, kick-ass.

220
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,383
(both grunting)

221
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,787
(Fei yells)

222
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,456
(both grunting)

223
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,497
(Fei yells)

224
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,434
(crowd shouts)

225
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,103
(both grunting)

226
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,319
- Send him home. - Finish him.

227
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,654
- Send him home. - Finish him.

228
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,090
- Send him home. - Finish him.

229
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,328
- No, we're not done yet.

230
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,031
You haven't seen anything.

231
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,166
Get ready.

232
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:03,669
Hm.

233
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,274
(grunts)

234
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,175
Shien Kick.

235
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,181
(howls)

236
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,823
- [Ryu] Tatsumaki Senpuu Kick.

237
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,528
(friend whimpers)

238
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,771
(pleasant music)

239
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,518
- That's it, now I remember who you are.

240
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,420
You're the guy who beat Sagat, the Muay Thai champ,

241
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,354
a few years ago.

242
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,324
I feel better about losing now.

243
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,493
But you disappeared.

244
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,428
Now, don't try to tell me it's a coincidence

245
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,096
and there's another Japanese fighter

246
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,397
roaming around named Ryu.

247
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,435
You know, I heard Sagat was hired as an attack dog

248
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,036
by the Shadowlaw organization.

249
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,740
- What's the Shadowlaw?

250
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,075
- You don't know?

251
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,676
- Nope.

252
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,678
- [Fei] It's a major organized crime syndicate

253
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,681
that trades in weapons and drugs worldwide.

254
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,451
They're involved in just about anything that's illegal.

255
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,853
- [Ryu] So, that's the path Sagat took.

256
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,191
(pleasant music)

257
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,482
- So long, see you again, my friend.

258
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,423
(wood creaking)

259
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,078
(electronic beeping)

260
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,793
- [Challenger] Dammit, Masters,

261
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,995
I came here to challenge you.

262
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:43,829
Fight me.

263
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,802
- You don't hear very well.

264
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,738
I won't take part in a street fight, I said, got it?

265
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,643
- [Challenger] It does not matter where a battle is waged.

266
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,011
- Oh, please.

267
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,580
(both grunting)

268
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,253
- So, just what are you trying

269
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,921
to prove here, Chief Running Mouth?

270
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,656
- You are known as a skilled fighter

271
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,758
and have won many titles in your time.

272
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,959
I seek glory and honor

273
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,328
by defeating a warrior such as yourself.

274
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,563
(yells)

275
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,865
- Well, that reason's completely lame.

276
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,568
And so are you for thinking you can beat me.

277
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:26,672
Nobody alive has been good enough to beat me yet.

278
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,640
Except Ryu.

279
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,875
- Ryu?

280
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,444
The vagabond who dropped off the earth.

281
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,381
You compare him to me?

282
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,582
(yells)

283
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,251
(both grunting)

284
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,360
- Watch out.

285
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,363
When you ask for something, you might get it.

286
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,365
(yells)

287
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,336
Shoryuken.

288
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,597
- Finish it.

289
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,135
You can't leave it like this.

290
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,708
(Ken sighs)

291
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,542
Huh?

292
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,087
(Ken sighs)

293
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,290
- [Ken Voiceover] Ryu, where the hell are you?

294
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,225
We've got unfinished business.

295
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,364
(tires screeching)

296
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,179
(electronic music)

297
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,431
(baby crying)

298
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,126
(girl panting)

299
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,264
- Oh.

300
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,705
Are you okay?

301
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,553
Sorry, kiddo.

302
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,158
Huh.

303
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,132
I see, that milk was for your mother, wasn't it?

304
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,411
It's my fault.

305
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,480
Take this and buy your mom some more milk, okay?

306
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,149
Go ahead.

307
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:41,293
(girl giggles)

308
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,030
(Ryu chuckles)

309
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:10,455
(crowd yelling) (upbeat music)

310
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,458
(fighters grunting)

311
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,036
(bones popping)

312
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,138
- [Crowd] Yo, yo, yo, yo.

313
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,943
(fighters yelling)

314
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,104
- Rush him.

315
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,452
(rock music)

316
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,399
(Honda yells)

317
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,172
- Fight fair, Dhalsim.

318
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,680
(heart pounding)

319
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,620
- Kill, kill. - Hurry up and finish it off.

320
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:50,722
- Huh?

321
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,359
A power, but where?

322
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,728
Emanating from a man.

323
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,340
(electronic beeping)

324
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,149
(Honda yells)

325
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,387
You win.

326
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,655
- [Honda] Huh?

327
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,324
- I throw in the towel to you.

328
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,826
- What?

329
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,061
Don't you wanna lose with honor, you witch doctor?

330
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,630
- I can't fight.

331
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,865
I feel another power among us.

332
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:34,933
- Power?

333
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,368
What are you babbling about?

334
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,270
Are you trying to throw the fight?

335
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,805
- I don't care if you win.

336
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,040
The fight is over.

337
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,510
- [Crowd] Choke him, choke him, choke him.

338
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,512
- Bonehead.

339
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,748
I'll take my winnings now.

340
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:50,549
- Okay.

341
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,954
Have you ever felt the fighting spirit of another?

342
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,440
(upbeat music)

343
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,389
- [Girl] Hey, mister.

344
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,791
- Hey.

345
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,026
(girl giggling)

346
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,262
(man grunting) (crowd gasping)

347
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,096
Huh?

348
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,005
(guns firing)

349
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,851
(tires screeching)

350
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,323
(glass shatters)

351
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,893
(men grunting)

352
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,569
(tires squealing)

353
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,006
This poor little kid.

354
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,442
(sirens wailing)

355
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,211
Who the hell were those guys?

356
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,480
- They're Shadowlaw terrorists.

357
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,481
- Shadowlaw?

358
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,253
- There was change for you.

359
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,288
- [Ryu] Don't worry about it.

360
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,689
Everything will be okay.

361
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,065
(sirens wailing)

362
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,902
Huh?

363
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,137
(Honda chuckles)

364
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,540
- Hey, man, half this money is yours.

365
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,374
- Money?

366
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,909
- Cash, my man.

367
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,412
I might have lost the fight if you hadn't been around.

368
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,246
(chuckles)

369
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,647
Here, keep it.

370
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,184
Japanese fighters stick together, 'cause we're brothers.

371
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,820
(laughing)

372
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,590
(plane whooshes)

373
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,960
- [Bison] Are you certain Jahan was eliminated?

374
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,629
- Yes, it was confirmed by the monitor cyborg

375
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,264
who was on-hand to verify it.

376
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,867
He also sensed an unidentified fighter

377
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,735
and we're looking into that now.

378
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,569
- That's all?

379
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,104
- One more item.

380
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,241
Our cyborg in Seattle sent back an interesting video.

381
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,344
I think you might find it very enlightening.

382
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,778
- Ha, on my way.

383
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,514
(plane whooshes)

384
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,098
This call has interrupted me and I hope,

385
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,433
for your sake, that the information is worth it.

386
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,968
Speak.

387
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,104
- Sir, I assure you this will prove most valuable.

388
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,877
This man appears to be quite a remarkable fighter,

389
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,513
but we discovered something extraordinary

390
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,316
when we overlaid his picture on top of Ryu,

391
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,318
the one we're looking for.

392
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,719
- And who is he?

393
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,721
- Ken Masters.

394
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,226
We've compiled a computer dossier on him and his fights.

395
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,162
But nothing was mentioned of his relationship with Ryu.

396
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,630
- Is there a connection?

397
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,966
- We learned that both men, in Japan,

398
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:31,937
studied at the same dojo together for over 10 years.

399
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,706
Their fighting skills are considered equal.

400
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,107
- [Bison] Equal, eh?

401
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,208
But that doesn't mean

402
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,044
their fighting potentials are the same.

403
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,046
- We do not have enough current data

404
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:44,783
to substantiate Ryu's implied capabilities.

405
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,552
Either our sources have failed to obtain this data

406
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:51,356
or it's possible that he's withholding his full potential.

407
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:52,757
- I see.

408
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,727
From the same school now, is he?

409
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,863
Gentlemen, I believe we have found our new secret

410
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:02,968
P Project weapon in the form of Mr. Ken Masters.

411
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,169
- Fine choice.

412
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,504
As you know, our master, Ed Pressman,

413
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,240
may win the next presidential election.

414
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,176
His Brady Bill support exposes him

415
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:12,811
to the threat of assassination.

416
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,280
His security must be ensured.

417
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,249
And, of course, if we fail, Shadowlaw will have

418
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,652
to oppose the American government.

419
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,920
- Failure is not an option

420
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,523
once Masters submits to my Psycho Power.

421
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,460
- But, sir, I should remind you of Cammy.

422
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,961
(Bison grunts)

423
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,429
- [Bison] She carried out her mission, didn't she?

424
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,797
- She's at Interpol.

425
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,966
They have her for questioning.

426
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,134
- I don't give a shit.

427
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,269
If her job's finished, she's finished.

428
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,840
- On the subject, we've monitored portions

429
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,943
of Cammy's interrogation from Interpol's offices.

430
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:47,912
- Show me.

431
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,955
- [Chun-Li] Are you aware that you're a special agent

432
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,724
of Britain's MI-6 division?

433
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,926
- [Cammy] I don't remember.

434
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,328
- [Chun-Li] How can a trained agent

435
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,763
like yourself follow orders

436
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:08,299
from Shadowlaw to assassinate the Minister of Justice?

437
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,868
Did you know what you were doing?

438
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,503
- [Cammy] I don't remember.

439
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,738
- Cammy, your mind is being controlled.

440
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,173
I don't know how it's being done,

441
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,641
but we're trying to learn how.

442
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,243
You've got to help us out here.

443
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,512
Can you give me anything to work with?

444
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,847
Think, any kind of clue at all.

445
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,284
- [Cammy] I, I don't remember.

446
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,886
- Don't be concerned.

447
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,954
They won't be able to break my hold

448
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,956
on these mindless puppets.

449
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,528
- But, sir, there's so much at risk to allow her to live.

450
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,129
- All in due time.

451
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,866
But right now, I want you to continue searching for Ryu.

452
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,334
I don't care what it takes

453
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,870
and I don't want excuses, just find him.

454
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,338
- Yes, sir.

455
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,041
Do you want me to issue an order to our Northern U.S. agents

456
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,544
to apprehend Ken Masters?

457
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,812
- Hm.

458
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,513
Don't bother.

459
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,749
I haven't been hunting in a long time.

460
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,718
I'm getting out of practice.

461
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,335
- Huh?

462
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,973
(pleasant music)

463
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,545
Hey, get out of the way.

464
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,382
- You can't conduct an investigation by yourself.

465
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,317
- Hm.

466
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,551
Yeah, I've heard that before.

467
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,656
Now move your cute little butt before I run it over.

468
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,491
- Hm.

469
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,658
Go ahead.

470
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,960
(Guile grunts)

471
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,130
(tires screeching)

472
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,297
(Guile growls)

473
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,233
Guile, you're putting personal revenge

474
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,902
in front of common sense and duty to your country.

475
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,508
- I see when you're not being a royal pain in the ass

476
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,310
you're snooping around in other peoples' personal affairs.

477
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,079
- I don't mean to invade your privacy,

478
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,082
captain, but I have to read the files of everyone

479
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,917
who'll be involved in this assignment.

480
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,685
I'm truly sorry about your best friend,

481
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,955
but we have to put this situation beyond vengeance.

482
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,925
- And all your chatter won't bring Bison down either.

483
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,360
- Well then, are you man enough

484
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,662
to check out my other abilities?

485
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,264
- I don't have time for this.

486
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,166
Huh?

487
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,902
(Chun-Li grunts)

488
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,511
- I'd like Bison myself because he killed my father.

489
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,183
But first and foremost, I do my job here, Guile.

490
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:42,587
My duty as an agent comes before personal feelings.

491
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:46,558
Please, captain, we can't do this by ourselves.

492
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,960
We have to try and help each other.

493
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,070
- I can't stand women who jabber like parrots.

494
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,672
Well, are you getting in or not?

495
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,606
(Chun-Li chuckles)

496
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,208
- Dare I refuse that invitation?

497
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,972
(both grunting)

498
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,610
Why are we going to a disco?

499
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,645
Are we looking for a monitor cyborg?

500
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,947
- Nah, just a guy I heard of,

501
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,749
a pretty good fighter named Dee Jay.

502
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,685
(glass shattering)

503
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,254
(thugs yelling)

504
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:52,190
(Dee Jay laughing)

505

00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,749
Come on.

676
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,651
(sighs)

677
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,552
- It was Vega.

678
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,387
- What?

679
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,926
(gasps)

680
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,328
Chun-Li.

681
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:25,562
Hang in there.

682
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,364
Don't cash out on me now.

683
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,567
- And what's Ms. Li's condition?

684
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,938
That's unfortunate, she's one of our best investigators.

685
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,807
So, we'll have to rely heavily right now

686
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:39,243
on our own surveillance methods.

687
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,311
We've confirmed that a monitor cyborg

688
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,180
is near Ken Masters in Seattle.

689
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,550
Thank you.

690
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,452
Yes, he's very good, not just another street fighter,

691
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,021
he's the All-American Martial Arts Tournament champion

692
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,523
no less.

693
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:55,659
I have no doubts that Bison will try to approach him.

694
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,362
We've also discovered there was another fighter named Ryu

695
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,697
who studied with Masters at the same dojo.

696
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,199
We're investigating that now,

697
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,601
but our sources indicate that he traveled to Thailand

698
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,170
after leaving India.

699
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,671
- Keep on it.

700
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:10,107
I wanna know everything about this Ryu character.

701
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:13,043
The doctors said they're gonna work on Chun-Li right now.

702
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,212
If you need to reach me, I'll be here.

703
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,182
As soon as I know things are stable,

704
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,617
I'll catch the next flight to Seattle.

705
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,820
Also, have a dossier on Ken Masters ready for me.

706
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:32,095
(car engine thrumming)

707
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,881
- Eliza, let's get married.

708
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,417
- Huh?

709
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,719
What do you mean, right this minute?

710
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,754
- [Ken] Sure, why not?

711
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,656
- Well, this is out of the blue.

712
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,325
You know, I don't even think I've heard you

713
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,493
mention the word marriage before.

714
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,829
- [Ken] So then, let's do it.

715
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,331
- [Eliza] But...

716
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:08,198
- But what?

717
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,469
- Something doesn't feel right.

718
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:13,403
- [Ken] Whatever.

719
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,372
- Hey, don't be angry.

720
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,540
- I'm not.

721
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,976
(rock music)

722
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,582
(singing in foreign language)

723
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,051
(Ken panting)

724
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,554
(Ryu panting)

725
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,041
(Ryu grunts)

726
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,312
(Ken shouts)

727
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:58,682
- [Ken] Ryu.

728
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:13,463
(both chuckling)

729
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:15,265
- Ken.

730
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,200
(horn honking)

731
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,137
(tires screeching)

732
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,409
Well, maybe I should have said yes.

733
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,243
What's wrong?

734
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:27,978
- Nothing.

735
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,638
- Hey, we made it.

736
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:57,941
And your offer?

737
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,310
I'll consider it.

738
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,612
- Eliza.

739
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:03,513
- I love you.

740
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,757
Uh, call me later, okay?

741
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:15,459
- [Ken] Sure.

742
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,294
When I get back.

743
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:44,454
Ryu, I'm getting tired of waiting.

744
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,397
- [Pilot] Master, I've located the target.

745
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,198
- [Bison] Excellent, move in closer.

746
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,885
(plane roaring)

747
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,566
- Hm?

748
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,068
(tense music)

749
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:40,777
(tires screeching)

750
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:41,945
Are you crazy?

751
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,022
What is going on?

752
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:02,999
(ominous music)

753
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:06,937
- Greetings, Mr. Masters, I have come for you.

754
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,540
- [Ken] Excuse me, but who the hell are you?

755
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,977
- I am Bison, Shadowlaw's master.

756
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,145
- [Ken] Should I be impressed?

757
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:16,179
I never heard of ya.

758
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,681
What do you want?

759
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:20,450
- [Bison] I will turn you into the strongest fighter alive.

760
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,152
- Huh, Buffalo or whatever

761
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:23,787
you're called, you're full of crap.

762
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,755
- Don't you realize the potential

763
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,692
of becoming an even better fighter than Ryu?

764
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:29,893
- Huh, Ryu?

765
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:32,362
Just how do you know about him?

766
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:35,765
- Well now, it would appear I've touched a sensitive spot.

767
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:36,733
- Shut up.

768
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:38,301
I have had enough of this.

769
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:41,304
Hey.

770
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:44,908
Whoa.

771
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,585
I guess I'm in no position to bargain.

772
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,490
(yells)

773
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,562
Hey, what kind of a punch do you call that?

774
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:07,697
- [Bison] Your pathetic efforts are futile

775
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,933
against my Psycho Power.

776
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,034
- Psycho Power?

777
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:18,041
- Ken, you will follow my command.

778
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,176
There is no point in resisting.

779
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,578
- No way.

780
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:23,847
(grunting)

781
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,523
(shouting)

782
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,360
- [Bison] You have no choice.

783
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,395
You will obey me.

784
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,435
- On a cold day in hell.

785
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,337
- You foolish young man.

786
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,914
- [Ken] Hadouken.

787
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:10,760
(Bison chuckles)

788
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,929
- You disappoint me, Masters.

789
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:16,366
I'll fashion you into a real fighter.

790
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,841
- If you don't mind me asking, sir, what's so urgent

791
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,144
to bring you all the way out here to see Ken Masters?

792
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,380
- It's likely Bison is targeting him.

793
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,038
Is that his car?

794
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,673
- Yes, sir, no mistaking it.

795
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:59,075
- Dammit, we're too late.

796
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,118
- Shadowlaw has stationed monitor cyborgs

797
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,619
in every corner of the earth.

798
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,188
And other than warehouses they use for storing weapons

799
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,691
and narcotics, we haven't been able to find anything

800
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:17,027
that resembles their primary headquarters.

801
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:19,829
- It seems logical to me that Bison would take Masters

802
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,598
back to the same training facility

803
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,266
where he took the other fighters.

804
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,368
The big question is where is it?

805
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,404
- It seems their main bases of operation

806
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,439
are concentrated in Southeast Asia.

807
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:32,509
So, I suggest we focus our search in that area.

808
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:35,378
- Captain Guile, sir, talking about Southeast Asia,

809
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,881
we've located the fighter you're looking for, Ryu.

810
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:40,550
He's the one who trained with Ken Masters.

811
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,619
- So this is the guy who was in India.

812
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,853
Where is he?

813
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,522
- He was last seen at the Thailand-Laos border

814
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,891
and was reportedly heading into the hills there.

815
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:49,693
- Do you know if any monitor cyborgs

816
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:51,561
have been reported in his proximity?

817
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,063
- Yes, sir, we've detected several,

818
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:54,764
but I don't think they've found him yet.

819
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,167
Ryu doesn't sit still, he's constantly moving

820
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,436
through India, Thailand, and China.

821
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:02,238
His travel seems random and we don't know why he moves

822
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:05,308
around, so it doesn't seem likely a cyborg is tailing him.

823
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,512
- I'm sure the fact that Ryu is as good a fighter as Ken

824
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,414
hasn't escaped Bison's notice,

825
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,750
but so far, we have the advantage.

826
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,721
We've got to reach Ryu before Shadowlaw does

827
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:20,690
so we can plan a welcoming committee for Bison.

828
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,860
Also, what plans have been formulated by Interpol

829
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,130
and the American military for destroying Shadowlaw?

830
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,865
- Since we've already determined the locations

831
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,000
of their main bases, our tactical force teams have been

832
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,303
assembled and are secretly waiting the signal to raid.

833
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:34,738
The first attack will be the hardest,

834
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,339
focusing on the Shadowlaw headquarters

835
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,774
near the Cambodian border.

836
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:39,676
Interpol and the American forces have decided

837
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:41,511
that this is the best choice we have.

838
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,111
- I've got some good news.

839
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:18,448
I came to tell you that we found Bison's hideout.

840
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:20,950
I guess you'll chew me out for this,

841
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,020
but I'll get revenge for what he did to both of us.

842
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,726
I hate to see you like this.

843
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:34,264
I know it means as much to you as it does to me

844
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,832
to pull Bison's plug, kiddo.

845
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:38,601
Let me take care of it this time while you rest up.

846
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,139
I gotta go.

847
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:50,246
(mystical music)

848
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:17,106
(thunder crackles)

849
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,676
(Ryu grunting)

850
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:39,395
(electronic beeping)

851
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:05,054
(Ken grunting)

852
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,723
- [Bison Voiceover] Your passion to fight stems

853
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:08,992
from your competitiveness with Ryu.

854
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:10,894
(chuckles)

855
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:13,296
Just the quality I'm looking for.

856
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:15,298
With my Psycho Power, I will increase

857
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:18,001
and destroy that emotion many times over.

858
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,075
(Ken grunting)

859
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,753
(Ken yelling)

860
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,244
(Ryu grunting)

861
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,375
(pleasant music)

862
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,883
(both grunting)

863
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:50,426
- Hey, buddy, you all right?

864
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,764
- Oh yeah, I'm okay.

865
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:57,100
(Ken gasps)

866
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:11,748
- [Ken] There.

867
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:16,486
- Thank you, Ken.

868
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:17,687
So then, shall we?

869
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:18,788
En garde.

870
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:21,624
(Ken chuckles)

871
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,193
(Ryu grunting)

872
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,221
(helicopter whirring)

873
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,934
- [Pilot] Captain Guile, we'll be in the mountains

874
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,736
at the Laos border in a few minutes.

875
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:10,406
- Roger.

876
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,380
(rock music)

877
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,249
- Master Bison, we just received word

878
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,752
that Guile is aboard a military helicopter

879
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:25,621
now heading for the Thai-Laos border.

880
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:28,558
We believe he's discovered Ryu's location.

881
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,461
- How nice, he did the work for us.

882
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:32,962
(chuckles)

883
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,064
It seems the captain's trying to get there

884
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,266
before we reach him first.

885
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,801
We'll be there.

886
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:41,070
We'll take Ken and give him a nice, warm welcome.

887
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,807
- But, sir, Ken isn't quite ready yet.

888
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,042
- No choice.

889
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:48,077
I'll let Ryu and Ken fulfill their destinies

890
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,013
by staging the fight they've been longing for.

891
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:54,417
Make preparations to bring Ryu back with us.

892
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,184
- Yes, sir.

893
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,989
- Please, master, give me the chance

894
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,491
to prove myself against Ryu.

895
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:07,263
- Remember, you are a Shadowlaw warrior now, Sagat.

896
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,799
Put these commonplace thoughts aside.

897
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:11,234
- But, sir, we're talking

898
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:14,337
about fighter's pride and my reputation here.

899
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:15,738
- Fighter's pride, how dull.

900
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,310
The world is now your arena, not the street.

901
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,945
- My lord, please.

902
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,680
- Sagat, I'm losing patience.

903
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,317
My authority is absolute and I won't tolerate questioning.

904
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,453
I hope that's clear.

905
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,055
Besides, you have other orders to carry out.

906
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,957
You'll leave for New York at once to take care

907
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,860
of Cammy and Vega, if he's not dead already.

908
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,930
You'll soon learn that Shadowlaw does not forgive mistakes.

909
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:57,613
(wind howling)

910
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:35,551
(Ryu panting)

911
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,957
(Ryu grunting)

912
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:55,004
- Hey, I'm getting tired just watching ya.

913
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:57,206
Take a break and have a drink with me.

914
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,708
- Yeah.

915
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,276
(thunder roars)

916
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:02,311
- Uh-oh, looks like a storm's brewing.

917
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,388
Who's that?

918
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,558
(helicopter whirring)

919
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,132
We finally have visitors drop in

920
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,201
and look at me, I'm just a mess.

921
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,114
(Guile grunts)

922
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,753
- [Guile] Are you Ken Masters' friend, Ryu?

923
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:44,854
- That depends.

924
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:46,322
Who wants to know?

925
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:48,958
- Captain Guile, operative with United States Air Force.

926
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,826
- I'm Ryu, but what's this about Ken?

927
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,061
- Your friend's been abducted

928
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:54,563
by a crime organization called Shadowlaw.

929
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,565
- What do you mean abducted?

930
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,835
- And their ultimate plan is to turn him into a terrorist.

931
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,103
- That's ridiculous,

932
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,105
there's no way he could ever become a criminal.

933
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,275
- They're subjecting him to a form of mind control.

934
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,744
- Ken is not a terrorist.

935
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,847
(plane roars) (ominous music)

936
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,883
- Shit, Bison had me tailed.

937
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:14,817
- What the?

938
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,852
- Boy, a lot of visitors today.

939
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:24,026
(coughs)

940
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,329
He likes to make an entrance.

941
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:46,449
- Ken.

942
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,226
- Well, look what crawled out of the woodwork.

943
01:14:57,226 --> 01:15:00,096
- Why, Captain Guile, it's been such a long time.

944
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:04,233
Finally, the stars of the show are all assembled onstage.

945
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,935
Take a bow.

946
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:08,871
- Stinking bastard, what have you done to Ken, huh?

947
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,873
- Well, well, well, Ryu.

948
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,641
I was looking for you.

949
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,443
But you're a difficult man to find,

950
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,879
so we recruited Ken in your absence.

951
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,548
(cackles)

952
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:21,050
- Let him go, now.

953
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:29,592
(gasps)

954
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:33,562
- Ryu.

955
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:35,798
- What have they done to you?

956
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:36,632
Ken.

957
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,035
- Nice job, huh?

958
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,038
Your friend is now the perfect exterminator

959
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:43,939
thanks to my subtle influence.

960
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:46,108
Beating him isn't going to be easy.

961
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,109
- No, don't.

962
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,844
Ken, resist it.

963
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,148
(Bison laughs)

964
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,582
- Save your energy, boy, you're going

965
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,751
to need all you can muster on the battlefield.

966
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:59,422
And your utter annihilation is the sole mission in his life.

967
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:01,290
- No way, he's my friend.

968
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,893
- Bison, I'll rip your fucking heart out,

969
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,628
you filthy bastard.

970
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:07,396
(Bison cackles)

971
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,098
- Afraid I don't have one.

972
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:12,568
You know, Guile, evil is a good career choice.

973
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,070
It has a lot to offer.

974
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:17,006
- Huh? - Hm?

975
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,310
- Here is a sample of my power.

976
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,079
- Oh god, I can't take it.

977
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,981
I gotta kill this nut before I kill myself.

978
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,050
(shouts)

979
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:34,690
(grunting)

980
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,229
Hi there, and you are?

981
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:41,430
- I'm the welcome wagon.

982
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,466
It's nice to meet you, friend.

983
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,303
- [Bison] Hello, captain, are you still planning

984
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,206
to give me the heart transplant you mentioned?

985
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:52,208
- Ready and waiting.

986
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,876
- Ken, don't you recognize me?

987
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:59,415
Ken.

988
01:16:59,415 --> 01:17:01,851
(Ken grunts)

989
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:04,286
(Ryu grunts)

990
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,056
Stop it, it's me.

991
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:08,591
I'm your friend, dammit.

992
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:12,094
(both grunting)

993
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:29,278
- What's wrong, Guile?

994
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:31,313
Thinking about your friend I killed?

995
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,481
Try harder.

996
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:36,519
(Guile grunting)

997
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:44,827
- Sonic Boom!

998
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,801
Huh?

999
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:53,969
- You're mine.

1000
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:59,041
(Guile screams)

1001
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:02,545
(Balrog yells)

1002
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:05,447
(Honda yells)

1003
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,117
(both grunting)

1004
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,694
- Huh? - Oh shit!

1005
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,201
(thunder crackles)

1006
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:33,275
(Guile groans)

1007
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:40,849
(Bison chuckles)

1008
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,551
- [Guile] Coward.

1009
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,620
Don't walk away from me.

1010
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,288
We're not finished.

1011
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,624
(Ken yells)

1012
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:53,028
(thunder roars)

1013
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:57,132
- This is crazy.

1014
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,601
Don't you realize someone else is making you fight me?

1015
01:18:58,601 --> 01:18:59,668
Don't you get it?

1016
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:02,104
For God's sakes snap out of it.

1017
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,440
(Ken yells)

1018
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:16,819
(Ryu gasps)

1019
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:18,454
(thunder roars)

1020
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:21,123
(both grunting)

1021
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:24,860
(Ken yells)

1022
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,694
Ken.

1023
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:33,268
(thunder rumbles)

1024
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,103
- Huh?

1025
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:38,841
Huh?

1026
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:39,675
Huh?

1027
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,949
(yells)

1028
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,385
(rock music)

1029
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,457
(yells)

1030
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:09,004
(thunder rumbles)

1031
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,544
Huh?

1032
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,048
(Ryu panting)

1033
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,359
(Ken screams)

1034
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:35,364
(thunder rumbles)

1035
01:20:43,906 --> 01:20:46,375
(Ken screams)

1036
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,145
- Ken.

1037
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,551
(thunder roars)

1038
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:58,220
Take a good, long look at me, dammit.

1039
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,089
Come on, this is a real fight.

1040
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:01,724
Tell me who I am.

1041
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:06,695
- [Ken] Ryu.

1042
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:09,031
- Yes.

1043
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,034
(gasps)

1044
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,337
- You worthless pile of excrement.

1045
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:18,006
- Stop it!

1046
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:21,777
(Ken screaming)

1047
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:31,186
(Ken yells)

1048
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,388
Ken!

1049
01:21:37,126 --> 01:21:39,228
You get the hell out of my way.

1050
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,497
- Well now, aren't you the big He-Man?

1051
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:43,966
Now is the opportunity to see just how good

1052
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:47,169
your legendary fighting skills really are.

1053
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:48,670
- Move or I'll go through ya.

1054
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,506
- All I get is talk and no action.

1055
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,541
You must not be too concerned about your friend

1056
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,176
who's probably dead by now.

1057
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,844
- I'll show you action.

1058
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:21,403
Well, I'm leaving.

1059
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,838
- Time sure flew by.

1060
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:25,841
I'm heading outta here myself in a couple of days.

1061
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:27,576
- Take care, hotshot.

1062
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:29,278
- Next time, muscle man.

1063
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,750
- I'll see ya when fate brings us together again.

1064
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:40,322
(grunting)

1065
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,593
(rock music)

1066
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:52,668
Huh?

1067
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:56,305
(Bison laughs)

1068
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,741
- Here's my offer.

1069
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,376
Give up this life of luxury

1070
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:03,579
and join me as a Shadowlaw soldier.

1071
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:05,314
Otherwise, I'll destroy you.

1072
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,648
- There's no chance.

1073
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,318
I'd gladly take death over slavery any day.

1074
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:13,555
- Ha, very good, there's still plenty of fight left in you.

1075
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:14,890
That's stamina.

1076
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:15,924
- Get outta my way.

1077
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:16,892
- You stupid fool.

1078
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,904
- [Sensei] Are you going?

1079
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:30,172
- Yes.

1080
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,241
I hate to go now, but I must leave.

1081
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:34,443
- [Sensei] Your training here has been but a step

1082
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:36,078
in your preparation.

1083
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:39,481
A time will come in your life when you will face an opponent

1084
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:43,252
and to defeat him, you must go beyond victory.

1085
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:44,553
- Beyond what?

1086
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:49,625
Sensei, I don't understand what you mean.

1087
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:50,993
Please explain it to me.

1088
01:23:52,995 --> 01:23:53,829
Sensei.

1089
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:58,233
- [Bison] I'll explain it to you, boy.

1090
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:00,602
(laughs)

1091
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:03,105
(Ken screams)

1092
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:09,177
- What the?

1093
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:10,979
What the hell happened?

1094
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:12,514
I can't remember.

1095
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,884
(groans)

1096
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:20,022
My legs, they won't move.

1097
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:23,558
(Ryu grunts)

1098
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,902
(Ryu grunting)

1099
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:39,241
(Ken panting)

1100
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:46,248
A plane.

1101
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,917
(thunder roars)

1102
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:52,354
That's it.

1103
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:53,822
It's coming back to me.

1104
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,457
I remember now.

1105
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,359
It was Bison, he brought me here.

1106
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:59,861
(Ryu screams) Huh?

1107
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:02,197
Ryu.

1108
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,606
I'll have your head.

1109
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,278
(thunder roars)

1110
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,112
Bison!

1111
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,383
(grunting)

1112
01:25:23,185 --> 01:25:24,019
Ryu!

1113
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,356
(Ryu yelling)

1114
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:30,993
(Ken grunts)

1115
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:33,528
Dammit.

1116
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:36,231
(thunder roars)

1117
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:46,775
Breathing.

1118
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:47,909
Spirit.

1119
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,378
Discipline.

1120
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:51,446
(groans)

1121
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,323
- [Ken Voiceover] Focus the mind.

1122
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:03,659
Cleanse the soul.

1123
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:07,095
Keep sight of my target.

1124
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,997
Concentrate.

1125
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,599
Focus.

1126
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:11,933
Don't lose it now.

1127
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:16,038
- [Ken And Sensei] Be prepared for the unexpected.

1128
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:17,639
Concentrate.

1129
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,108
Mind and body as one.

1130
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:22,911
Achieve tranquility through movement.

1131
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,714
Integrate spirit and flesh.

1132
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:27,349
Channel the powers.

1133
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,284
Focus the mind.

1134
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:30,919
Cleanse the soul.

1135
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:33,488
Release that which is negative.

1136
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:37,626
- Separate darkness and light. - Mind and body as one.

1137
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:40,395
- Give birth to yourself. - Oneness through knowledge.

1138
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:43,031
- Define your existence. - Oneness through emotions.

1139
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:46,168
- Create your divination. - Oneness with the heavens.

1140
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:49,004
- [Both] From strength, learn gentleness.

1141
01:26:49,004 --> 01:26:51,440
Through gentleness, strength will prevail.

1142
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:57,145
- [Sensei] Ken, what do you see beyond your fist?

1143
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:00,048
Ken, awaken.

1144
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:02,884
- Huh?

1145
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:07,122
(wind howls)

1146
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:09,791
(thunder roars)

1147
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,030
My fate.

1148
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:19,701
(Ryu grunting)

1149
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:23,071
(thunder roars)

1150
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,473
- What's wrong?

1151
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:25,307
Getting tired?

1152
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:27,342
Ha, shall I end it now?

1153
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,978
(Ryu yelling)

1154
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,780
(Bison cackling)

1155
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:35,050
(triumphant music) Huh?

1156
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,889
(Ken yells)

1157
01:27:44,526 --> 01:27:46,094
- Ken, you're all right.

1158
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,663
- Hey, buddy, how ya been?

1159
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:50,866
We'll catch up on the reunion stuff later.

1160
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:52,968
We got something to do first.

1161
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,605
Like taking out the trash.

1162
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:57,439
- Yeah.

1163
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,209
- You both seem bound and determined

1164
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,979
to meet destruction at my hands.

1165
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:05,213
So be it.

1166
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,782
I'll fight you on your own level.

1167
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:08,784
Come on.

1168
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,119
(rock music) (Ken yelling)

1169
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,688
(all grunting)

1170
01:28:27,169 --> 01:28:30,372
(singing in foreign language)

1171
01:28:30,372 --> 01:28:31,373
- Huh? - Huh?

1172
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:36,211
(Bison cackles)

1173
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:39,781
- Even though you two amuse me, I must conclude this game.

1174
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:42,384
I have engagements to keep and I can't be late.

1175
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,420
(Ken yelling)

1176
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:48,089

You can rest in peace now, kiddo.

- So you wanna play dead? (Chun-Li laughing)

1228
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,581
I can arrange that.

1229
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:56,030
