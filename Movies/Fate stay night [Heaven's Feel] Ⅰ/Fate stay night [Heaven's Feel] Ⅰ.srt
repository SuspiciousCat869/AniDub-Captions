1
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,869
Shirou Emiya, he's looking good.

2
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:01,588
Isn't he, though?

3
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:05,014
With Ayako Mitsuzuri and Shinji Matou in the lineup,

4
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,641
we'll win the rookie tournament.

5
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:08,651
Yeah, we're a shoo-in.

6
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:11,707
Though, Ms. Fujimura...

7
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:18,824
compared to the other first-year students,
don't you think Emiya is, well, different?

8
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,641
Sorry. It's hard to put into words.

9
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:39,661
Getting hurt during your
part-time job before the tournament.

10
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:40,686
What are you thinking?

11
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:44,609
Is inconveniencing everyone just something you do now?

12
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:46,785
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,420
But, hey, the team has you and Mitsuzuri.

14
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,135
You guys can win easily.

15
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,926
Sorry.

16
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:15,092
I'm home.

17
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,991
Beginning synchronization.

18
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,180
Tracing basic structure.

19
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,071
Component materials...

20
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,072
tracing.

21
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,925
Altering fundamental structure.

22
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,649
Strengthening component materials.

23
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,384
It's raining.

24
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,536
Hey, wait a sec... Aren't you Shinji's little sister?

25
00:04:13,357 --> 00:04:14,160
That's right.

26
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,445
I'm Sakura, Sakura Matou.

27
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:32,817
Shirou!

28
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,690
I came by to check up on you!

29
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,126
How's your shoulder? Feeling any better?

30
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,736
This isn't what it looks like!

31
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,221
I promise. It's completely innocent!

32
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:47,870
Believe it or not?

33
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:51,145
I've somehow been making do on my own all this time.

34
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:52,527
And besides,

35
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:56,222
it'll be terrible if me to make a
friend's little sister pick up my slack.

36
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,764
Well, as Shirou's legal guardian,

37
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,417
I just can't let you do this.

38
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:05,137
Here, I'll tell you what!

39
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:07,551
I'll help him with the housework,
so you don't have to worry!

40
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,417
How's that?

41
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:25,835
You'll never guess who I ran
into while I was out and about!

42
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:29,537
Next up, we'll be discussing...

43
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,206
The dishes are in the upper cupboard.

44
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,555
The lower one has the rice bin and kitchen knife.

45
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:35,656
And right down here...

46
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:38,684
No!

47
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,546
First, fold backward from the back
side around the middle of the shoulder.

48
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,237
Try to fold the sleeves so they're
parallel to the creases in the shirt.

49
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,403
Do the same to the other side,

50
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,483
but be careful so it holds its shape.

51
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:04,070
Don't worry. This is good for your first time doing it.

52
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,292
I'm going to try it again.

53
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:13,165
Okay, let's start from the beginning.

54
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:16,767
Right, then.

55
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:18,537
If you'll excuse me...

56
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:21,102
Of course! We'll see you tomorrow!

57
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:34,334
That's right. I remember now.

58
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,556
A year and a half ago,

59
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,866
I unexpectedly lost against an underclassgirl

60
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:42,224
who I never thought was that stubborn.

61
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,598
The seasons changed.

62
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,288
But even after my shoulder healed,

63
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:56,054
that life didn't change.

64
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:59,538
I can't remember if Sakura insisted on it.

65
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,147
Or was I the one who wished for it?

66
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,716
Either way, it's just a trivial detail now.

67
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:13,265
If anything changed, it's the fact
that I didn't go to team practice anymore.

68
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:17,019
I wanted more hours at my part-time job anyway,

69
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:20,454
and it didn't matter what I did
as long as I could train my body.

70
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,668
So my situation worked out for the best, I guess.

71
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:34,430
Oh, there's one other thing that
may be trivial in the long run.

72
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,191
Hey, I'm home.

73
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,580
Welcome home, Shirou.

74
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:51,264
These days, I don't use my keys as often as I used to.

75
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,788
Merry Christmas to the both of you!

76
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:20,207
As I was saying...

77
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,935
Shirou is cute, truly.

78
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,132
He's imitated Kiritsugu forever.

79
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:31,243
He wanted to be a hero of justice, didn't you?

80
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:32,887
What are you talking about?

81
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:34,847
That booze has gone to your head.

82
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:36,704
This Kiritsugu,

83
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,720
he's... he was Shirou's father, wasn't he?

84
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,863
He was indeed.

85
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,680
And for Shirou, he was a true hero,

86
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,279
which probably explains why he wanted to be just like him.

87
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,616
You have someone like that in your life, don't you?

88
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,117
A hero of my own...

89
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,130
Shirou.

90
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,616
Emiya. Hey there.

91
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,510
Issei, what's up?

92
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:39,945
Well, now, great timing, Emiya!

93
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,327
Don't just stand there. Help us out with recruitment.

94
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:44,470
Hang on. Who's this?

95
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:47,486
Oh, she's Shinji's sister, and...

96
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,255
Huh? Seriously?

97
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:50,596
How's it going?

98
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,215
You interested in archery?

99
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,890
I mean, of course you are,
'cause your brother is doing it!

100
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:56,086
Oh, what's your name?

101
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,571
I'm Sakura.

102
00:09:58,685 --> 00:09:59,974
So you're Sakura!

103
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,560
Well, then, come join the Archery Team!

104
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:04,937
Unless you've found some other team to join.

105
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:06,268
No, I haven't.

106
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:07,203
Perfect then!

107
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,443
She's so pushy. How rude.

108
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,150
...it's a done deal!

109
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,432
Problem, Emiya?

110
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:18,993
Nuh-uh.

111
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,223
Hey, Shirou!

112
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,532
Thank you for taking our picture, sir.

113
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:31,032
You realize that you're a teacher, too.

114
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,277
Oh. Um, sorry.

115
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,048
Eh? What's wrong?

116
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,137
Oh, nothing.

117
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,647
All right, guys. Big smiles now!

118
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,795
Trace on.

119
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,615
Aw, man.

120
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,410
I'm gonna have to take it apart again.

121
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,928
Sakura, dear!

122
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,803
It's getting close to dinnertime.

123
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:52,020
Have you thought about what you're going to cook tonight?

124
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,471
I picked up some fresh eggplants today,

125
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,642
so I think I'll make some arrabiata.

126
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,482
Sounds delicious! I'm looking forward to it.

127
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:08,398
Ah, this scene again.

128
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:13,476
It's like an old memory being
licked clean by the color of flames.

129
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:18,112
It's telling me that I'm not
allowed to wallow in my memories.

130
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,720
However, I see the terminus I usually
arrive at whenever I'm dreaming...

131
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:28,657
a sign that I'm going to be waking up soon.

132
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:36,312
Shirou?

133
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:41,126
Fell asleep again?

134
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,292
Good morning, Sakura.

135
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:57,367
Hey, Sakura, you know you don't have
to come by my place every day, right?

136
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,320
I'm sure you have lots of things of your own to do.

137
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,389
Oh, no, I don't mind, really.

138
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:05,826
My only hobbies are cooking and archery.

139
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:07,864
Just so you know,

140
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,011
my goal is to make food that's even tastier than yours.

141
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:13,832
And I think I'm getting really close to a breakthrough.

142
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:15,316
Is that a fact?

143
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:19,256
So your master plan all this
time has been to steal my secrets?

144
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:22,450
You bet. Prepare for your imminent defeat.

145
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,012
And besides that...

146
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,036
I can't enjoy eating meals,

147
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,449
except for when I get to eat them with you at your place.

148
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,453
Let's go.

149
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,525
We gotta hurry if you're gonna
make it to morning practice.

150
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,180
I've been meaning to ask, Emiya,

151
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,535
are you currently dating Matou's younger sister?

152
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:53,208
Oh. Well...

153
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,586
I happened to see the two of you coming to
school together as if you were a happy couple.

154
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:59,684
She's my friend's little sister, man.

155
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,256
Of course we're not dating.

156
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:04,981
By the way, if you saw us, you
could have said hi or something.

157
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,457
I'm sure you're well aware that I'm still in training.

158
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,144
I don't have the courage for such a thing just yet.

159
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,257
Of course not.

160
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,200
All right, here.

161
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,523
I'm finished with this one.

162
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,750
Good morning, Shinji.

163
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:33,274
Hey, Emiya, I see you're still
buttin' in like earlier this morning.

164
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,662
One might even say it's your favorite pastime.

165
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm not busy, you know.

166
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:41,289
If you need help with anything, I'm available.

167
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:45,391
You've never been good at restringing
and mending bows, so we can start there.

168
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:48,737
You do remember you're no longer with the Archery Team?

169
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:50,856
Or are you that forgetful?

170
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,989
I think it'd be best for all involved parties

171
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:57,377
if you simply minded your own business.

172
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,686
We'll begin with pronunciation.

173
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,092
Even if it's spelled the same,

174
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,353
that doesn't mean pronunciation follows suit.

175
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,867
It's easy to slip up, so be careful.

176
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,540
Emiya, aren't we having lunch together?

177
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:19,275
Sorry. I'm eating in the cafeteria.

178
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,096
Hey, Sakura...

179
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:44,240
Sakura.

180
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:47,954
Hi, Shirou.

181
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,324
Hey, wasn't that girl...

182
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:52,454
Oh, yes.

183
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:53,795
She's one of the second years.

184
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,882
Tohsaka, wasn't it?

185
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,248
Rin Tohsaka?

186
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,792
I didn't know you knew her.

187
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:04,046
Uh, she's pretty famous, right?

188
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:06,590
Always in the middle of the spotlight?

189
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:08,732
Yes, that's true.

190
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:14,738
Miss Tohsaka, she's beautiful and awesome, too.

191
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,409
What's wrong?

192
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:40,374
Tell me, Shirou,

193
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:44,182
are you planning to quit the Archery Team for good?

194
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,305
It's complicated.

195
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:51,231
Think Shinji would blow a gasket if I did?

196
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:58,934
In truth, I think he finds it hard to deal with you.

197
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,063
Then again, I'm positive he
likes you more than the others.

198
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,554
He's not honest with his feelings,

199
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:09,093
so he's mean to the people he likes sometimes.

200
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,157
That's quite the troublesome personality he has.

201
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:17,600
Thank you for walking with me.

202
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:43,142
Insects?

203
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:47,232
But it's winter.

204
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:48,262
How weird.

205
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,569
Come now.

206
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:56,474
I hear you've done a fine job of
taking care of my granddaughter.

207
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:58,760
Oh, uh, excuse me, sir.

208
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,621
My name is Shirou Emiya.

209
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:02,831
I'm a classmate of Shinji's.

210
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:05,083
Emiya.

211
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:10,182
Is the Einzbern girl in good health these days?

212
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:14,652
I'm having this dream again.

213
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,193
I remember.

214
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,204
After this, I was saved by Kiritsugu.

215
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,109
If you don't summon yours real soon...

216
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:39,366
you are going to die...

217
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,927
Big brother.

218
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:49,207
Next in the news...

219
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:52,400
late last night, there was a massive gas leak

220
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,542
in a large-scale facility in
the New City district of Fuyuki.

221
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:59,230
It is believed that the leak originated
in one of the underground restaurants.

222
00:19:59,282 --> 00:19:59,812
Done.

223
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,395
Sakura, grab a plate.

224
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,834
Oh, sure!

225
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,970
Dozens of people who were near the building...

226
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:11,249
Hey, you okay?

227
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:12,377
...they, too, feel ill.

228
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:16,113
Police are investigating whether the
source is a natural occurrence or...

229
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,112
Are you sure you're all right?

230
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:22,108
You didn't eat a single bite of the breakfast we made.

231
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,636
It's all right to skip practice now and again.

232
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,929
You heard your faculty advisor.

233
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,554
I'm fine. Really, I am.

234
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,534
Um, Shirou...

235
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:41,891
I have a favor to ask.

236
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:47,596
Can... Can you come straight home after school today

237
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,556
and get home as soon as possible?

238
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:52,198
This news just in.

239
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,571
Four residents were found dead in a home early
this morning in the Miyama town district of Fuyuki.

240
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,849
The Fuyuki Police report

241
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:03,950
that the victims were murdered
by an object akin to a sharp blade.

242
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:19,236
Emiya.

243
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,779
Emiya.

244
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:21,979
Emiya!

245
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,550
Morning, Emiya.

246
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:28,203
Morning, Mitsuzuri.

247
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:34,376
Emiya, would you happen to know anything
about the murder in Miyama town last night?

248
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:37,183
Wait. There was a murder?

249
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,339
Were they able to catch the culprit?

250
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,421
No, not yet.

251
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:47,056
I'll have to have the clubs
cancel their after-school activities.

252
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:49,930
Excuse me.

253
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:52,435
Ryudou, do you have a minute?

254
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:54,117
Yes, of course.

255
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:55,742
Sorry, Emiya.

256
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,202
We can talk about all this a little later, okay?

257
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:25,804
What are you doing here, Emiya?

258
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:28,717
My, my. A first-years classroom.

259
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,081
What could you be up to?

260
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,343
Still here?

261
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:34,827
I thought practice was cancelled for today.

262
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:40,688
Practice or not, I keep myself busy
with a plethora of other activities.

263
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:43,173
Hey, if you're up to it, you can...

264
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:45,285
Don't be such a pain to Mitsuzuri.

265
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,519
Watch your tone.

266
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:51,320
An outsider has no right to say that.

267
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,471
I just remembered, Emiya.

268
00:22:57,725 --> 00:23:00,970
There's something I need done, and only you can do it.

269
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:03,003
'Kay. What is it?

270
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:07,740
I want you to handle some stupid
cleanup work for the stupid Archery Team.

271
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,775
I don't mind, but it's your job, isn't it?

272
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,890
Didn't you hear me?

273
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,160
I've got more important things to do.

274
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:18,626
You're not busy.

275
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,816
So I can ask you for help, right...

276
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,060
Emiya?

277
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:31,124
All right. I'm happy to help.

278
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:37,332
Fine then.

279
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:41,574
Why don't you go do what I said, Mr. Nice Guy?

280
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:49,761
All extracurricular after-school
activities have been cancelled for today.

281
00:23:50,656 --> 00:23:55,433
All faculty students are required
to vacate the campus by 1800 hours.

282
00:23:57,315 --> 00:23:59,062
Come on. Let's head home, sweetie.

283
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,900
Okay.

284
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,537
See you tomorrow!

285
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:03,822
See you later!

286
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:08,527
Hey, what do you say we check out that shop?

287
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:10,448
Sure, I've been dying to go there.

288
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:11,488
Let's go! Let's go!

289
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:12,457
I'm so excited!

290
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,091
I guess I must have lost track of time.

291
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:01,560
I should go home.

292
00:25:11,782 --> 00:25:12,635
The hell...

293
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,632
Who's there?!

294
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,010
What's going on?

295
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,901
What the hell was that?

296
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,806
I gotta get out of here.

297
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:00,798
If I don't, I'll die.

298
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:31,745
Hey there.

299
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:07,393
So pathetic.

300
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,945
All too premature

301
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,395
and, for that matter, all too poor a summon.

302
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:20,282
We have all the players we need,

303
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:23,845
but their quality and the precision
of the stage are both lacking.

304
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:31,892
This Holy Grail War is a far cry from the
grand ritual that we originally sought after.

305
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:39,706
But we don't have the option of
cancelling something that has already begun.

306
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:47,408
If the goblet has been filled to the
brim naturally someone must drink it.

307
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:56,234
Fortunately, the current overseer
from the Church is that man.

308
00:28:56,955 --> 00:29:02,168
I'm confident he will find a way to
mediate this distorted Holy Grail War.

309
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:06,723
The Grail calls forth Heroic Spirits,

310
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:09,831
who are in need of Mages to make pacts with.

311
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:13,584
If the participants are roped into this ritual,

312
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:17,932
their destinies will be to kill
anyone who stands in their way.

313
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:23,685
What's important is that only
one needs to be standing in the end.

314
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:31,964
The seventh Servant who was summoned to
fight in this battle is none other than that Saber.

315
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:36,203
And its Master happens to be Emiya's son.

316
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:40,215
How strange fate can be.

317
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:44,721
The Church is a neutral zone.

318
00:29:44,746 --> 00:29:46,739
No one can meddle with them there.

319
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,690
The question is, will the man turn out
to be a saint worthy of speaking the gospel

320
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,499
or something else entirely?

321
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,106
Is everything all right, Emiya?

322
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:28,614
For the life of me, I can't fathom why an half-baked
amateur Mage like you was chosen to be a Master.

323
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,915
Whatever the reason, you'll learn about the
Holy Grail War from the guy we're about to meet.

324
00:30:34,562 --> 00:30:38,127
Though, I should warn you he's quite despicable.

325
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:48,721
You never accepted my invitations to come by,

326
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:52,308
and now here you are with an odd guest.

327
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:55,561
I see.

328
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:59,399
I take it this means that he is the seventh.

329
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,714
I am Kirei Kotomine.

330
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:07,240
I'm sure Rin told you, but I'm in charge of this Church.

331
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:12,620
Shirou Emiya, huh?

332
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,833
And I assume that you are Saber's Master. Am I correct?

333
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:21,191
It's true that Saber has saved my life and protected me.

334
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:28,761
But if a Master is something a proper Mage becomes,
you would be better off picking someone else.

335
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,722
We should choose a new Master, you say?

336
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:35,972
How interesting.

337
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:42,358
In that case, I take it you don't care
about what happened ten years ago, either.

338
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:45,057
The great Holy Grail

339
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,119
is the omnipotent power in the field of Magecraft,

340
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:51,288
a granter of wishes that can realize any desire.

341
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:53,620
In order to obtain this power,

342
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:57,790
the previous Masters fought a fearsome
battle in which they killed each other.

343
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:00,306
As a result of this clash,

344
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:02,707
an accident triggered a deadly event.

345
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:05,381
You could even call it a catastrophe.

346
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:08,718
No way.

347
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,303
The big fire?!

348
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,183
Yes, you're right.

349
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:16,429
Everyone who lives in this city
knows about the losses of that day...

350
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:21,333
500 casualties, 134 structures burned down.

351
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:23,627
The blaze that ravaged the city,

352
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:27,737
whose mysterious origin has been
unknown to the public to this very day,

353
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,657
was the legacy of the last Holy Grail War.

354
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:34,202
Emiya, what's wrong?

355
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,803
Hey, Kirei,

356
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:39,165
I only told you to explain the rules to him,

357
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,253
not open up old wounds!

358
00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:50,992
That Holy Grail thing, it's for real?

359
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:53,333
During the last war,

360
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:57,126
a man momentarily held the Holy Grail in his hand.

361
00:32:57,396 --> 00:32:59,721
So what happened to him?

362
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:01,395
Why, nothing at all.

363
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:05,467
That Holy Grail was not able to achieve completion.

364
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:11,723
The Grail never lands in the hands of a man
who does all he can to run away from a fight.

365
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:15,771
Really? You sound like you've
seen the thing with your own eyes.

366
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:20,944
I did see it...

367
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:25,091
since I fought for it during the previous war

368
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,726
as one of the seven chosen Masters.

369
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:29,822
Wait! You never told me that!

370
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:32,635
I fought until the halfway point,

371
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,971
but I made a wrong decision.

372
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,004
Because of my mistake,

373
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:41,185
I was only able to hold an empty Holy Grail.

374
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:42,979
What does that even...

375
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:46,591
I know we're in the middle of our chat,

376
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:50,486
but it seems there's an impatient guest outside.

377
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,169
Hey, does the name Einzbern ring any bells?

378
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:04,430
Now then, young man,

379
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,981
there's no time to waste.

380
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:09,092
What have you decided to do?

381
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:09,950
Emiya!

382
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,931
If you're telling me the Holy Grail War
was what caused that disaster ten years ago...

383
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:21,038
then...

384
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,284
I'll do it.

385
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,778
I'll fight as a Master!

386
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:38,492
You should be rejoicing.

387
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:42,121
The wish in your heart will at last come true.

388
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:45,738
For a hero of justice

389
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:48,499
must have a powerful villain to defeat.

390
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:58,120
Well, I guess I shouldn't have
expected a Servant to remember.

391
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,152
So are you all done chatting?

392
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,298
Good evening to you, big brother.

393
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:14,100
My name is Illya...

394
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:17,740
Illyasviel von Einzbern.

395
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:27,963
Thank you for being so courteous.

396
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:30,753
Okay, I'm gonna kill you now.

397
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:34,168
Get them, Berserker.

398
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:01,774
Saber!

399
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:08,472
Run.

400
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:17,760
Please, run!

401
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,815
Of all the times for Archer to be hurt.

402
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,981
That's the way, Berserker!

403
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:26,398
She's got the ability to regenerate her body,

404
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,898
so you can violate her after beheading her!

405
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:55,397
Damn it. I'm a fool.

406
00:36:58,833 --> 00:36:59,571
Wait!

407
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:37,467
No way. Why?

408
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,112
This can't happen.

409
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:41,580
It's no fun.

410
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,722
Master!

411
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,532
Damn it! Why is he so reckless?!

412
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:58,008
When I was a child,

413
00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:01,262
I looked up to heroes of justice more than anything.

414
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:08,869
But you can only be a hero for a short time.

415
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:12,523
Once you become an adult, it's harder to claim to be one.

416
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,324
Kiritsugu.

417
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,882
Besides, choosing to save one person

418
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,803
means deliberately choosing to not save another.

419
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,784
I don't understand.

420
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:34,609
What do I have to do to become a hero of justice?

421
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:47,214
What?

422
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:49,064
I'm healed.

423
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:51,270
Master...

424
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,032
are you all right?

425
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:58,762
You're awake, finally.

426
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:00,935
Tohsaka.

427
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:04,133
Hold on. Did you heal me?

428
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:08,345
No, the wounds were healed via your own power, Master.

429
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:12,349
You're joking, I don't have the
power to do something like this.

430
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:16,911
If that's true, then perhaps your pact
with Saber had some influence on you.

431
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,649
Not so fast.

432
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,320
You gotta tell us why you acted so recklessly earlier.

433
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:27,823
Why? What I did back there wasn't that bad, was it?

434
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,615
Actually, I could have done much better...

435
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,243
I think you're missing the point.

436
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:35,331
We Servants depend on our Masters' magical energy.

437
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:36,918
If we lose that,

438
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:39,950
we also lose the ability to remain in this world.

439
00:39:41,164 --> 00:39:43,077
Oh. I didn't realize...

440
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:44,882
Make sure you don't forget it.

441
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:46,981
I've got to get going now.

442
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:51,322
I have to get back to my own
Servant in order to heal his injuries.

443
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:58,270
Oh, and remember we'll be enemies
the next time we see each other.

444
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:05,527
Deep down...

445
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:07,488
she's a really good person.

446
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,416
Saber, how are your wounds holding up?

447
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:16,583
They're okay,

448
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,495
but not completely healed yet.

449
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,424
Hey, uh, Saber,

450
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:29,802
do you want the Holy Grail, too?

451
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:33,059
Yes. It's the reason I'm here in this world.

452
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,644
So about Berserker's Master,

453
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,659
she said her name was Einzbern.

454
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:45,704
Small kids like her fight in this?

455
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:50,455
Uh, Saber?

456
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:56,036
Someone's here, and they're using Magecraft.

457
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,605
But I'm not sensing Berserker.

458
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,312
This entity is different.

459
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,145
Your orders, Master?

460
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,399
Let's go.

461
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:23,105
Please be careful.

462
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:24,770
A barrier has been erected.

463
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:29,842
I know this feeling, but from where?

464
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,524
Mitsuzuri?

465
00:42:09,615 --> 00:42:10,732
Leave her alone!

466
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:16,019
What a surprise.

467
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,979
To think my curiosity would lead directly to you, Emiya.

468
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:23,582
What's going on?

469
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:27,336
I suppose an explanation would be useful.

470
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:32,113
You could say I had the captain
of our Archery Team lend me a hand.

471
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:36,232
How could you?

472
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:39,248
Emiya...

473
00:42:39,494 --> 00:42:41,313
is that your Servant with you?

474
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:48,775
Since you've shown me yours,

475
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,260
it's only fair that I introduce you to mine.

476
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,321
What do you say we have them duke it out?

477
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:58,736
I've always wanted to witness a
battle between Servants up close!

478
00:43:00,554 --> 00:43:01,459
What the hell?

479
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:04,276
Shinji, you're a Master?

480
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:06,752
Nothing gets past you, does it?

481
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:09,284
I come from a family of Mages.

482
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,298
The Matous are one of the Three
Great Families of the Grail Wars.

483
00:43:13,745 --> 00:43:19,045
Although, I can't say I wanted an amateur
like you finding out that I'm a Master.

484
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,642
But given my status as the firstborn son...

485
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:28,870
I think it's only natural that I
participate in the Holy Grail War, right?

486
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,705
Shinji!

487
00:43:30,102 --> 00:43:32,506
You're such a dumb ass, as usual.

488
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:34,951
But you know how to play this game, don't you?

489
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:38,021
This is a game of the utmost importance!

490
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:41,355
And make no mistake, I'm playing for keeps!

491
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:55,531
Now take her out, Rider!

492
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,810
I, uh...

493
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,909
Hey, who gave you permission to be defeated?

494
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:53,517
Stand.

495
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,664
Stand up.

496
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:01,156
On your feet right now!

497
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,306
Do you understand what you're doing?

498
00:45:03,422 --> 00:45:06,758
You're making me look like a loser and weaker than he is!

499
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,790
What?!

500
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:13,198
Why is this happening?

501
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:15,173
Damn it, extinguish!

502
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:17,977
Extinguish! Extinguish! Extingui...

503
00:45:27,385 --> 00:45:28,266
Shinji.

504
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:33,522
It seems this was too much for you to handle, Shinji.

505
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:45,424
The Matous have suffered a shameful defeat.

506
00:45:45,749 --> 00:45:47,869
Quite the bitter disappointment.

507
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:49,454
You again.

508
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:52,035
Grandfather, please wait.

509
00:45:52,202 --> 00:45:53,925
I am the Mage of the Matou family.

510
00:45:53,957 --> 00:45:55,854
This is my birthright!

511
00:45:58,362 --> 00:46:02,052
You're an incompetent fool who's a failure in every way.

512
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:05,721
Our bloodline has fallen to its lowest depths.

513
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:10,153
I no longer have any expectations
as far as you're concerned.

514
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,558
What's that mean?

515
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:17,033
Hold on! Please come back!

516
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:19,963
Is Sakura gonna be forced to do something like this, too?!

517
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:22,518
Why?

518
00:46:22,772 --> 00:46:25,532
Why are you bringing her name into this all of a sudden?

519
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,170
I am the true Mage of the Matou family.

520
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,208
She is a piece of damn trash!

521
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,280
What could she know about Magecraft?!

522
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,532
I was supposed to be the only one in the
family that could receive the Matous' teachings!

523
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:56,138
Mitsuzuri.

524
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,486
She's a victim of the Holy Grail War.

525
00:47:02,711 --> 00:47:05,075
It's best to ask the overseer for help.

526
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:22,214
Honestly...

527
00:47:22,594 --> 00:47:25,550
to think you'd return in only a matter of hours.

528
00:47:32,442 --> 00:47:33,600
Fascinating.

529
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,728
You are spellbound by something evil.

530
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:44,653
I'll take it from here.

531
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:02,768
You're still here?

532
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,562
How is she?

533
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:07,029
I finished all of her treatments.

534
00:48:07,475 --> 00:48:08,760
There's no need to worry.

535
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:11,545
But I must say,

536
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,314
you look to be worse off than she is.

537
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,259
I've already been healed.

538
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:25,944
In the battle ten years ago, I faced a man much like you.

539
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,657
He insisted on standing before me,
even after suffering fatal wounds.

540
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:34,578
He was the last man that I fought in the previous war,

541
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:37,243
and after he claimed victory in our battle,

542
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,666
he went on to win the Holy Grail.

543
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:42,053
What's more...

544
00:48:42,863 --> 00:48:45,277
his name was Kiritsugu Emiya.

545
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:52,076
Saber.

546
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:56,188
Mitsuzuri's gonna make it.

547
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:57,671
Excellent.

548
00:48:58,257 --> 00:49:00,425
You were in the Church for quite some time.

549
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:01,621
About that...

550
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:06,146
we had a talk about Dad.

551
00:49:07,198 --> 00:49:08,703
His name was Kiritsugu.

552
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:14,956
Master...

553
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:21,647
It's time. There's something the two of us must discuss.

554
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:28,067
In a word, I suppose you could sum up
Kiritsugu Emiya as being an assassin.

555
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:34,535
He was a killer who made his living by
specializing in the assassination of Mages.

556
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,772
It's true that Mages are outlaws who
have strayed from the path of virtue,

557
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:42,167
but even among them, he was quite an anomaly.

558
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:45,649
The last time, I was also beckoned to this era,

559
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:48,693
but I fought as a Servant of the Einzberns.

560
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:53,240
Then, my Master's name was Kiritsugu Emiya.

561
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,281
That said...

562
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:58,909
He was truly a man possessing neither blood nor tears.

563
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:02,829
If it ended in his victory, he would seek out any method.

564
00:50:02,854 --> 00:50:04,726
And once a Master was his target,

565
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,631
not even the ones who begged for their lives were spared.

566
00:50:08,036 --> 00:50:09,947
Out of all the other participants,

567
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:13,176
Kiritsugu found the priest to be his greatest foe.

568
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:15,441
He and I...

569
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,027
had a complicated relationship.

570
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,519
I guess you could say that killing
each other was really our only option.

571
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:26,861
We committed ourselves to the
task of winning the Holy Grail War,

572
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:29,309
and in the end, we were victorious.

573
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,027
However...

574
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:34,698
Kiritsugu Emiya did the unthinkable that day

575
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:37,348
when he betrayed the Holy Grail.

576
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:39,578
After we had gotten the Grail,

577
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,539
he destroyed it.

578
00:50:49,164 --> 00:50:52,122
He killed one in order to let ten live.

579
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:54,339
An incorrigible saint,

580
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:57,012
the likes of which I'd never seen before.

581
00:51:17,163 --> 00:51:18,972
No matter what the priest said,

582
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:20,804
the Kiritsugu I know

583
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:25,304
would never dream of abandoning anyone
who'd fallen victim to the Holy Grail War.

584
00:51:26,614 --> 00:51:28,399
He was that kind of hero,

585
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:30,308
which is why I looked up to him.

586
00:51:32,003 --> 00:51:34,042
So I've decided that I'm going to fight.

587
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:37,272
I know it's a bit late, but, Saber...

588
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,852
Saber, I want you to fight with me.

589
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,026
No matter what has happened in my past,

590
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,351
this Command Spell now binds me to you, Master.

591
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:52,875
Yeah.

592
00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:56,803
But would you mind calling me Shirou instead?

593
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:00,575
Fine. I'll call you Shirou.

594
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:06,081
Yes, I think I prefer calling you by that name.

595
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:09,120
Thanks.

596
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:14,914
So shall we head home?

597
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,182
Yes.

598
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:22,793
Oh, I see!

599
00:52:22,928 --> 00:52:25,439
You're one of Kiritsugu's old acquaintances.

600
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:28,031
Still, I'm sorry about your luggage.

601
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,018
I wonder where they could have sent it to.

602
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:33,233
Hope you don't mind wearing Shirou's hand-me-downs, Saber.

603
00:52:34,257 --> 00:52:36,152
No, I don't mind.

604
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:39,312
I know that Kiritsugu traveled overseas a lot,

605
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:42,200
but he never told me anything about his friends.

606
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:46,450
All right, I want to hear some of your
favorite memories involving Kiritsugu.

607
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,499
Oh, well, let's see.

608
00:52:50,163 --> 00:52:51,209
I know it's sudden.

609
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:52,836
Sorry, Sakura.

610
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:54,024
It's fine.

611
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:56,939
Um, well, anyway, did you...

612
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,617
happen to see Shinji this morning?

613
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,081
Yes, I did. Is there a problem?

614
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:08,106
No. Just wanted to check in, is all.

615
00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:14,187
Sakura.

616
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:15,445
U-Um, yes?

617
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:16,776
Is something wrong?

618
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:23,797
This bruise, what happened?

619
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,019
Did Shinji do it?

620
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:43,041
Emiya.

621
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,932
You have some nerve coming to school without your Servant.

622
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:49,645
What were you thinking?

623
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,288
Listen, if you think so little of me that...

624
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,296
Uh, what are you doing?

625
00:53:59,685 --> 00:54:01,200
I'm begging you, Tohsaka!

626
00:54:01,415 --> 00:54:03,018
Could you give me some advice?

627
00:54:03,312 --> 00:54:05,120
Huh? What?

628
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:10,034
I see.

629
00:54:10,343 --> 00:54:12,237
Shinji turned out to be a Master,

630
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:14,305
Ayako got roped in somehow,

631
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,612
and Rider's been taken out of commission.

632
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,326
Well? This can't really be everything, can it?

633
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,383
Also, Shinji has a little sister,

634
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:36,773
and her name is Sakura.

635
00:54:40,164 --> 00:54:42,113
What is her part in all this?

636
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,738
Not sure...

637
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,129
but she may be dragged into this mess.

638
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:48,034
I saw Shinji today.

639
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:50,797
I don't think he's given up on being a Master.

640
00:54:51,694 --> 00:54:52,885
I don't know what to do.

641
00:54:54,646 --> 00:54:58,543
Then how about you keep her safe at your place?

642
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,003
That'd be best,

643
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:08,662
especially if she's someone who means a great deal to you.

644
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,193
Sakura.

645
00:55:28,209 --> 00:55:29,582
Thank you for breakfast.

646
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:30,955
It was wonderful.

647
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,419
And you've even gone out of your way to make lunch for me.

648
00:55:35,637 --> 00:55:36,833
I am grateful.

649
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:40,336
Really? That's nice of you.

650
00:55:40,763 --> 00:55:41,660
That said...

651
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:44,811
I would like to assist you in any way that I can.

652
00:55:47,632 --> 00:55:48,670
Well, I...

653
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:54,210
Go! You can do it!

654
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:55,613
But I...

655
00:55:57,313 --> 00:56:00,211
Um, okay, in that case...

656
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:02,859
I'm home!

657
00:56:06,717 --> 00:56:09,032
I thought you might need a variety of things.

658
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:11,201
And here's your luggage.

659
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:15,622
I mean, they told me it arrived,
so I went and picked it up.

660
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,000
Oh, it's so cute.

661
00:56:19,604 --> 00:56:23,755
Man, I'm gonna owe Tohsaka one favor after another.

662
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:25,340
Shirou.

663
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:31,040
I understand that she needs some
daily necessities and things, but

664
00:56:31,246 --> 00:56:33,310
don't you think you bought too much?

665
00:56:33,517 --> 00:56:35,892
Oh, that's right. Fuji-nee...

666
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:40,188
I think it'd be a good idea to have
Sakura sleep over here for a while.

667
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,155
That's an out-of-the-blue request.

668
00:56:44,286 --> 00:56:45,350
What's going on?

669
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:47,428
The streets have been dangerous,

670
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:52,214
and from what I hear, Shinji's been so
busy lately, he hardly goes home anymore.

671
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:54,770
What do you say?

672
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:57,747
Well, I...

673
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,908
Oh. Hey, I have a better idea.

674
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:05,438
You talk,

675
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,273
and I'll get a head start on preparing Saber's room.

676
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:13,492
I'll go with her.

677
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,520
I see what you're doing.

678
00:57:20,722 --> 00:57:23,790
You don't wanna give Sakura the wrong idea about Saber.

679
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,195
You sly fox.

680
00:57:25,196 --> 00:57:27,214
The wrong idea about what?

681
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:35,174
Look, you didn't hear this from me, but Sakura has E-cups!

682
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:39,455
What does that have to do with anything?

683
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,335
Shirou, hurry. It's Sakura.

684
00:57:54,842 --> 00:57:55,937
Shirou?

685
00:57:58,489 --> 00:57:59,573
Forgive me.

686
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:02,270
These have already come in handy.

687
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,840
Don't worry. I'm not leaving yet.

688
00:58:14,323 --> 00:58:17,602
You're under my guard for another half-hour, so stay put.

689
00:58:21,622 --> 00:58:22,498
Okay.

690
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:26,181
Then please make sure to watch me, just as you said.

691
00:58:32,894 --> 00:58:33,926
Shirou.

692
00:58:35,696 --> 00:58:38,387
Regarding what we were talking about earlier...

693
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,085
I remember the part about me staying here for a while?

694
00:58:42,473 --> 00:58:43,811
Why'd you ask?

695
00:58:44,807 --> 00:58:46,189
Is it because...

696
00:58:46,928 --> 00:58:48,546
you're worried about me?

697
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:51,151
Yeah.

698
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:53,351
I am worried, Sakura.

699
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:55,990
But if you stay here,

700
00:58:56,187 --> 00:58:58,093
I can always make sure you're okay.

701
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:04,601
When you put it that way, how could I refuse?

702
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:06,283
Thanks.

703
00:59:24,515 --> 00:59:28,591
This is the work of something dark and abhorrent.

704
01:00:02,439 --> 01:00:05,066
Soichiro? Is something the matter?

705
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:09,827
Stay here with the others.

706
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:15,444
Assassin, show yourself.

707
01:00:17,003 --> 01:00:18,186
Assassin!

708
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:44,984
Lord Soichiro.

709
01:00:45,977 --> 01:00:46,865
Dear God.

710
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,067
This man...

711
01:00:55,212 --> 01:00:56,567
what is?

712
01:00:57,851 --> 01:01:00,138
First I cut head.

713
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:04,035
Then arms, legs, I cut.

714
01:01:05,172 --> 01:01:07,455
Belly, I sliced...

715
01:01:08,227 --> 01:01:10,855
but still moved.

716
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:13,633
You! You're the true Assassin!

717
01:01:20,729 --> 01:01:23,137
Unleash me...

718
01:01:23,879 --> 01:01:24,561
Witch.

719
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,414
There! I did it!

720
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:51,796
Are you happy now?!

721
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:53,771
Emiya...

722
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:02,541
Hey... don't be coy...

723
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:04,363
Emiya.

724
01:03:05,903 --> 01:03:08,525
Do with me as you like.

725
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:20,921
Tohsaka.

726
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:36,729
Shirou...

727
01:03:37,444 --> 01:03:38,713
what are you doing?

728
01:03:47,284 --> 01:03:49,580
Why am I having dreams like that?

729
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,996
Following the mysterious gas leak of the other day,

730
01:03:54,213 --> 01:03:57,458
another gas leak occurred in
the New City district of Fuyuki,

731
01:03:58,075 --> 01:04:01,789
more specifically a building on the
east side of the New City train station.

732
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:07,051
A security guard and several office
workers were found seriously ill and comatose.

733
01:04:07,738 --> 01:04:10,099
There was damage similar to the previous leak, and...

734
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:10,606
Saku...

735
01:04:13,899 --> 01:04:14,477
Hello.

736
01:04:15,148 --> 01:04:16,774
Oh, it's you, Fuji-nee.

737
01:04:19,045 --> 01:04:20,773
Right. You can't come today.

738
01:04:21,219 --> 01:04:21,862
Got you.

739
01:04:23,545 --> 01:04:24,132
What?

740
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:50,446
I went to Ryudou Temple last night.

741
01:04:52,811 --> 01:04:54,753
There was a flow of magical energy

742
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:58,018
starting at the New City incident,
heading straight to the temple.

743
01:04:58,714 --> 01:05:00,810
Since Archer is back in fighting form,

744
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,556
I thought I would check it out.

745
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,477
Here are my conclusions.

746
01:05:05,743 --> 01:05:08,904
Caster was hiding out in the temple until last night.

747
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:12,897
By the time I arrived there,

748
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:17,037
Caster had already been eliminated
by someone else and was gone.

749
01:05:18,058 --> 01:05:21,591
The residents had been stripped of
their magical energy and were comatose.

750
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:25,711
However, the only one murdered was Mr. Kuzuki.

751
01:05:27,035 --> 01:05:29,368
He was most likely Caster's Master.

752
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:39,424
Now on to the main subject.

753
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,122
Just this morning,

754
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,646
there was another comatose incident in New City.

755
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:47,731
Despite Caster already being gone, huh?

756
01:05:57,074 --> 01:06:00,206
Hey, Sakura ended up at your place, didn't she?

757
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:04,637
Oh, uh, yeah. She started
sleeping there last night actually.

758
01:06:08,815 --> 01:06:11,030
Emiya, let's team up.

759
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:12,253
What?

760
01:06:13,155 --> 01:06:15,291
This Grail War seems to be totally different

761
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:17,306
from what my father described to me,

762
01:06:17,595 --> 01:06:21,699
exactly what kind of war we're in this time around.

763
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:25,557
You're saying you want us to team up for the time being.

764
01:06:26,128 --> 01:06:28,064
Yes, that's what I'm asking.

765
01:06:38,071 --> 01:06:38,675
Rin.

766
01:06:40,087 --> 01:06:42,790
Fighting side by side is meaningless

767
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:44,723
with a weak Master.

768
01:06:45,137 --> 01:06:46,320
What did you say?

769
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:48,921
I stated a fact. That's all.

770
01:06:50,034 --> 01:06:53,676
Listen, Archer, as long as I'm
your Master, you'll follow my lead.

771
01:06:56,254 --> 01:06:59,473
Let's get started. Are you available tonight?

772
01:07:05,127 --> 01:07:07,648
You're partnering with Archer's Master?

773
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:11,735
Yeah. Sorry about how sudden it is.

774
01:07:11,983 --> 01:07:12,755
Don't be.

775
01:07:13,285 --> 01:07:14,206
Thing is...

776
01:07:14,587 --> 01:07:16,753
the faster we finish the Holy Grail War,

777
01:07:16,778 --> 01:07:19,910
the faster Sakura will be able to return to a normal life.

778
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,356
Shirou, I hate to say it,

779
01:07:24,483 --> 01:07:25,975
but maybe she's ill.

780
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,877
No, don't mind me.

781
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:31,268
I hope it's only my imagination.

782
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,894
Sakura, I heard the bell.

783
01:07:40,919 --> 01:07:42,015
Is someone here?

784
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,406
What's wrong, Emiya?

785
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,553
I am Sakura's big brother.

786
01:07:59,973 --> 01:08:03,818
What's the matter with coming to take
this cute little sister of mine back home?

787
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,981
What kind of big brother hits his sister?!

788
01:08:12,729 --> 01:08:14,952
You roped Mitsuzuri into this.

789
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:16,980
I can't trust you with Sakura.

790
01:08:18,031 --> 01:08:19,678
Now I see how it is.

791
01:08:19,944 --> 01:08:22,222
You didn't waste time getting handsy with her.

792
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:25,723
And you can't let go, because you
want to keep getting laid, right?

793
01:08:25,793 --> 01:08:26,683
Bastard!

794
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:30,428
Shirou!

795
01:08:36,599 --> 01:08:38,004
Shinji.

796
01:08:39,423 --> 01:08:41,793
Well done. That's a good look.

797
01:08:42,822 --> 01:08:43,873
Let's go then.

798
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:45,442
Time to finish this.

799
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:47,676
Stop it, big brother!

800
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:51,881
Sakura.

801
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:54,652
I'll do anything you ask,

802
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:58,717
but please don't do this, not in front of Shirou.

803
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:09,662
Sakura, here's a piece of advice.

804
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,272
Never forget what you just said.

805
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,757
I'm sorry.

806
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,250
I'm so sorry.

807
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,453
This isn't something you need to apologize for.

808
01:10:02,168 --> 01:10:04,658
No good. I can't concentrate.

809
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,664
Shirou...

810
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:12,082
are you in there?

811
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:15,365
Sakura?

812
01:10:27,194 --> 01:10:28,199
I just...

813
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,059
wanted to talk with you for a little while.

814
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:34,577
Uh, sure.

815
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,125
First, about earlier,

816
01:10:48,268 --> 01:10:51,069
I'm sorry for what my big brother did to you.

817
01:10:51,878 --> 01:10:53,815
I told you, don't worry about it.

818
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:02,613
It's cold in here.

819
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,548
Hold on. I'll take care of it.

820
01:11:09,988 --> 01:11:10,973
Come over here.

821
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:22,444
It's so warm.

822
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:25,107
You were finally able to fix it.

823
01:11:26,345 --> 01:11:27,187
Yeah.

824
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:30,155
But I gotta say it took me forever.

825
01:11:35,113 --> 01:11:37,928
Hey, Shirou, do you remember?

826
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:39,029
Wha?

827
01:11:40,515 --> 01:11:42,589
It's a story from long ago,

828
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,421
so long, in fact,

829
01:11:45,492 --> 01:11:48,258
that it's from before the two of us even met.

830
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,891
It was a bright red sunset.

831
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:57,001
The courtyard, hallway, and
everything else was bathed in red,

832
01:11:57,493 --> 01:11:59,723
beautiful, yet lonely.

833
01:12:01,338 --> 01:12:03,270
That's when I happened to see someone.

834
01:12:03,969 --> 01:12:06,905
He was high-jumping all alone in the courtyard.

835
01:12:09,112 --> 01:12:10,483
To tell you the truth,

836
01:12:10,508 --> 01:12:13,829
back in those days, I was not a good girl.

837
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:17,373
As I stood there watching that person,

838
01:12:17,764 --> 01:12:20,786
I couldn't help but think he should just screw up.

839
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:23,704
But...

840
01:12:40,406 --> 01:12:43,874
He couldn't make the jump, no matter how hard he tried.

841
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:48,169
In the end, the boy came to realize he couldn't jump,

842
01:12:48,638 --> 01:12:50,844
so he just cleaned up and left.

843
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,193
Hey, Sakura...

844
01:12:54,952 --> 01:12:56,994
are you saying that boy was...

845
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,362
Exactly.

846
01:12:58,743 --> 01:13:01,899
That person was the upperclassmen sitting here now.

847
01:13:03,401 --> 01:13:04,821
You didn't realize it,

848
01:13:04,846 --> 01:13:06,846
but I've known you since way back then.

849
01:13:07,304 --> 01:13:08,300
Surprised?

850
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:11,147
Uh, I see.

851
01:13:11,505 --> 01:13:13,195
This is the first I've heard of it.

852
01:13:17,608 --> 01:13:19,760
So, um, Shirou...

853
01:13:20,022 --> 01:13:21,276
If you don't mind,

854
01:13:21,301 --> 01:13:24,588
I have a question that may make you uncomfortable.

855
01:13:27,758 --> 01:13:31,527
I was talking to Ms. Fujimura the other day, and well...

856
01:13:32,004 --> 01:13:34,980
she told me that you were adopted into this family.

857
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:38,497
Yeah. I was.

858
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,960
I was wondering, does it ever bother you that you were?

859
01:13:44,107 --> 01:13:45,003
Not at all.

860
01:13:45,308 --> 01:13:47,585
It took me a while to get used to the idea,

861
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:49,216
but I never even think about it.

862
01:13:50,815 --> 01:13:52,228
You must feel that way

863
01:13:52,282 --> 01:13:55,347
because everyone around you has always been kind.

864
01:13:56,047 --> 01:14:00,102
Actually, the grown-ups around me were pretty unreliable.

865
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:03,801
I mean, Kiritsugu couldn't do any housework at all,

866
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,231
and you've seen Fuji-nee.

867
01:14:07,294 --> 01:14:08,659
They were hopeless,

868
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:11,780
and doing the housework has made me who I am today.

869
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,910
But still, I wanted to be like Kiritsugu.

870
01:14:21,952 --> 01:14:24,421
A hero of justice, right?

871
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:31,883
Oops.

872
01:14:35,468 --> 01:14:37,694
That's weird. What's wrong with it?

873
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:46,475
Shirou, I'd like to ask you one more question.

874
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:52,466
If at some point in the future, I became a bad person,

875
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:54,268
would you be mad at me?

876
01:14:58,014 --> 01:15:01,570
Yeah. If you did something bad, I'd be furious.

877
01:15:01,983 --> 01:15:03,320
You'd get an earful.

878
01:15:07,557 --> 01:15:08,462
I'm glad.

879
01:15:09,173 --> 01:15:12,174
I'd be fine with that if it was you.

880
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,162
I think I'll head to bed. Have a good night.

881
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:49,048
Miyama HQ to all paramedics. HQ to all paramedics.

882
01:15:49,168 --> 01:15:51,437
An emergency call has been received from the center.

883
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:55,772
Civilians are in need of rescue in the
building across from New City Station.

884
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:58,419
All available vehicles should head that way. Over.

885
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:02,061
Miyama Paramedic 2 to HQ.

886
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:26,818
Yo! Was all that commotion your handiwork?

887
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:47,452
Nah. No way a son of a bitch like
you could pull off such a great stunt.

888
01:17:22,118 --> 01:17:23,562
You won't get away.

889
01:19:32,674 --> 01:19:33,134
Come!

890
01:20:12,267 --> 01:20:13,275
Don't bother.

891
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:15,310
It's my nature.

892
01:20:15,418 --> 01:20:17,395
Your projectiles are useless.

893
01:20:19,436 --> 01:20:22,047
Protection from stray arrows, huh?

894
01:20:25,564 --> 01:20:28,587
Hiding weapons painted black within the shadows.

895
01:20:29,762 --> 01:20:30,784
Cheap trick.

896
01:20:57,568 --> 01:21:01,806
You saw my face just now, didn't you, Lancer?

897
01:21:02,481 --> 01:21:04,067
Oh, we'll get to that.

898
01:21:14,593 --> 01:21:16,228
Looks like we've reached the end.

899
01:21:17,585 --> 01:21:20,779
But why would a sand bug flee to a watering hole, huh?

900
01:22:05,165 --> 01:22:08,499
You should move, unless you'd prefer to be swallowed.

901
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:12,475
You idiot. Do you even know what the hell this is?

902
01:22:13,515 --> 01:22:14,250
Damn it.

903
01:22:36,486 --> 01:22:38,080
Noble Phantasm...

904
01:22:38,636 --> 01:22:41,956
Zabaniya!

905
01:22:54,357 --> 01:22:54,964
Damn it!

906
01:22:55,627 --> 01:22:56,778
It's a bit far, but...

907
01:22:56,859 --> 01:22:58,151
Noble Phantasm!

908
01:23:03,201 --> 01:23:03,895
Gae...

909
01:23:08,368 --> 01:23:08,971
Bolg!

910
01:23:17,599 --> 01:23:18,758
Checkmate.

911
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,670
You lose.

912
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:20,928
Yeah, I've got to admit...

913
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,844
things couldn't have turned out any worse.

914
01:25:01,576 --> 01:25:02,555
Shirou.

915
01:25:16,369 --> 01:25:17,403
Hey, Tohsaka.

916
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:21,270
Keep walking while we're talking, but,
just so you know, we're being monitored,

917
01:25:21,295 --> 01:25:23,339
so try not to do anything stupid.

918
01:25:33,449 --> 01:25:36,183
Am I right to assume the mayhem was your doing...

919
01:25:36,445 --> 01:25:37,840
elder of Matou?

920
01:25:48,217 --> 01:25:50,812
As expected of Tohsaka's heir.

921
01:25:52,101 --> 01:25:54,772
Your instincts are superbly excellent.

922
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,399
Wait. You're Zouken.

923
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,556
But I thought the Matou had been defeated.

924
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,885
While we may have lost the battle,

925
01:26:04,005 --> 01:26:07,310
I don't seem to recall saying that I'd lost the war.

926
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,024
Archer!

927
01:26:24,903 --> 01:26:26,070
Despicable.

928
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:29,085
To toy with the corpse of a Heroic Spirit...

929
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:30,970
how could you?!

930
01:26:43,209 --> 01:26:44,908
No, Saber! Watch out!

931
01:26:44,943 --> 01:26:45,846
Her sword is...

932
01:26:50,839 --> 01:26:52,595
Don't even touch her sword.

933
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:07,138
The sword probably undoes Magecraft.

934
01:27:08,299 --> 01:27:10,569
It could sever a pact with a Master.

935
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:12,791
Damn him.

936
01:27:16,235 --> 01:27:18,101
I was going to end this quickly,

937
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:19,737
but you left me no choice.

938
01:27:39,942 --> 01:27:44,228
As I suspected Caster's Magecraft
won't work on Saber at all.

939
01:27:44,403 --> 01:27:48,419
Although, what if it were used against the Master as well?

940
01:27:59,849 --> 01:28:00,608
What's that?

941
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:02,198
Impossible!

942
01:28:02,674 --> 01:28:03,523
What is it?

943
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,968
What's going on?

944
01:28:05,356 --> 01:28:07,451
Tohsaka, look there.

945
01:28:08,214 --> 01:28:10,666
It's coming, but what is it?

946
01:28:41,444 --> 01:28:43,769
Imaginary abyss?

947
01:28:44,714 --> 01:28:45,793
It can't be.

948
01:28:50,142 --> 01:28:52,833
It can't be. It can't be!

949
01:28:54,643 --> 01:28:55,341
Shit.

950
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,896
She vanished.

951
01:29:20,634 --> 01:29:21,480
But why?

952
01:29:26,712 --> 01:29:27,522
Watch out!

953
01:29:35,784 --> 01:29:36,759
Emiya!

954
01:29:38,339 --> 01:29:39,149
Shirou!

955
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:44,283
He didn't touch the body itself,

956
01:29:44,308 --> 01:29:47,347
so it should be nothing more
serious than catching an ague.

957
01:29:48,252 --> 01:29:49,508
Speak honestly.

958
01:29:49,768 --> 01:29:52,845
Do you know exactly what the entity we saw earlier was?

959
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,220
Not quite. But think about it.

960
01:29:56,292 --> 01:30:00,519
That shadow is probably what's stealing
magical energy from the people here.

961
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:03,637
You're awake.

962
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:09,946
Are you feeling all right, Emiya?

963
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:12,438
Y-Yeah.

964
01:30:13,327 --> 01:30:18,768
At this point, I'm in no position to
prioritize my personal grudges anymore.

965
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:36,862
I'm sorry, Sakura.

966
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,388
I let this happen even though I was with him.

967
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:40,756
Just leave him with me.

968
01:30:41,348 --> 01:30:42,443
And be quiet.

969
01:30:42,554 --> 01:30:44,269
You're only hurting him further.

970
01:31:08,851 --> 01:31:10,081
So you're here.

971
01:31:15,758 --> 01:31:17,263
Sorry to call for you.

972
01:31:17,602 --> 01:31:19,446
I arrived earlier than expected,

973
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:21,733
so I decided to grab a bite to eat.

974
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,082
It's fine.

975
01:31:34,827 --> 01:31:35,524
Want a bite?

976
01:31:35,549 --> 01:31:36,295
Like hell!

977
01:31:38,557 --> 01:31:39,708
Get on with it.

978
01:31:40,192 --> 01:31:41,144
What do you want?

979
01:31:51,976 --> 01:31:53,507
Shirou Emiya...

980
01:31:54,295 --> 01:31:56,001
what did you see last night?

981
01:32:01,167 --> 01:32:06,312
You see, I've been observing this Holy
Grail War from the day it first began,

982
01:32:06,992 --> 01:32:11,159
and I received reports from Rin
about the incident at Ryudou Temple.

983
01:32:13,249 --> 01:32:15,494
We engaged Zouken Matou in battle.

984
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,844
He brought Caster to the fight, but it...

985
01:32:20,907 --> 01:32:23,312
it looked like he was controlling a corpse.

986
01:32:23,962 --> 01:32:26,791
So it seems that elder is now on the move.

987
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,588
Listen carefully.

988
01:32:33,438 --> 01:32:37,065
What I am about to tell you
is something not even Rin knows.

989
01:32:37,339 --> 01:32:40,168
The night Caster was killed in Ryudou Temple,

990
01:32:40,294 --> 01:32:42,922
one Servant escaped from its barrier.

991
01:32:44,176 --> 01:32:45,684
Do you understand?

992
01:32:46,295 --> 01:32:47,019
No.

993
01:32:48,072 --> 01:32:49,500
It was Assassin.

994
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:53,128
How the hell do you know that?

995
01:33:00,842 --> 01:33:03,410
Simple. My Lancer witnessed it.

996
01:33:06,643 --> 01:33:09,083
I just said to you that in this Grail War,

997
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:10,804
I am a Master.

998
01:33:11,763 --> 01:33:12,962
That means, um...

999
01:33:13,074 --> 01:33:15,764
Damn it. I'm completely confused.

1000
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:18,008
I know what happened,

1001
01:33:18,103 --> 01:33:21,000
because I ordered Lancer to monitor Assassin.

1002
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:24,857
He tracked him to Ryudou Temple, but never returned.

1003
01:33:25,294 --> 01:33:27,134
Was he defeated by Assassin?

1004
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,024
Assassins rely greatly on their
Presence Concealment skills in battle,

1005
01:33:34,618 --> 01:33:37,166
but don't have very high combat skills.

1006
01:33:38,157 --> 01:33:42,688
Under ordinary circumstances, it
would be impossible for Lancer to lose.

1007
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,248
Shirou Emiya...

1008
01:33:49,785 --> 01:33:51,333
what you saw last night

1009
01:33:51,634 --> 01:33:55,618
was more than just Zouken Matou and Caster, wasn't it?

1010
01:34:08,482 --> 01:34:10,276
It's likely that Assassin

1011
01:34:10,681 --> 01:34:13,643
was able to lure Lancer directly into a trap.

1012
01:34:14,452 --> 01:34:17,673
And whatever's hiding there is not only killing Servants,

1013
01:34:17,961 --> 01:34:20,446
but also innocent civilians in the town.

1014
01:34:21,556 --> 01:34:27,081
If you liken Caster's ability to draw magical
energy from others to the act of drawing blood,

1015
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,779
then what that thing is doing...

1016
01:34:31,486 --> 01:34:33,459
is no different than eating.

1017
01:34:41,286 --> 01:34:43,432
If we don't do anything to stop it,

1018
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:45,668
the populace will be wiped out.

1019
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:56,386
The number of coma patients has gone up to 30?

1020
01:34:58,275 --> 01:35:01,179
The location is Miyama South in Block Four.

1021
01:35:01,854 --> 01:35:04,073
Would you happen to know what's in that area?

1022
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,316
Ryudou Temple.

1023
01:35:15,102 --> 01:35:16,101
What's the matter?

1024
01:35:16,379 --> 01:35:17,638
Aren't you going to eat?

1025
01:35:21,075 --> 01:35:23,194
You want me to eat a meal with you?

1026
01:35:23,249 --> 01:35:24,343
Not gonna happen.

1027
01:35:35,638 --> 01:35:36,472
Sakura?

1028
01:35:56,573 --> 01:35:57,785
It's starting to snow.

1029
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:03,730
Now then, let me confirm.

1030
01:36:03,755 --> 01:36:05,681
Sakura's at your place now, right?

1031
01:36:06,652 --> 01:36:08,581
Yeah, she is.

1032
01:36:09,542 --> 01:36:11,351
Good. That's reassuring.

1033
01:36:12,309 --> 01:36:16,854
This way, I won't have to worry about
her seeing anything that she shouldn't see.

1034
01:36:19,829 --> 01:36:21,358
I'm going after Zouken,

1035
01:36:22,234 --> 01:36:23,630
so I'm heading there now.

1036
01:36:24,761 --> 01:36:25,781
By yourself?

1037
01:36:26,713 --> 01:36:28,615
I have a history with the Matou.

1038
01:36:29,225 --> 01:36:33,108
It's fine. Leave the battle between archaic Mages to me.

1039
01:36:38,122 --> 01:36:40,113
Um, hey, Emiya...

1040
01:36:41,637 --> 01:36:43,962
What about you? What's your plan?

1041
01:36:45,605 --> 01:36:46,558
Saber...

1042
01:36:47,499 --> 01:36:48,444
First off,

1043
01:36:48,738 --> 01:36:52,111
I don't have the faintest idea
about what you and Shirou are doing.

1044
01:36:52,587 --> 01:36:55,753
I'm sure there are things you
couldn't answer, even if I asked you.

1045
01:36:57,469 --> 01:36:58,278
But still,

1046
01:36:59,056 --> 01:37:02,445
when you came home last night,
Shirou was terribly injured.

1047
01:37:05,215 --> 01:37:06,403
No more.

1048
01:37:06,776 --> 01:37:09,615
I don't want him to have to
face that kind of danger again.

1049
01:37:11,647 --> 01:37:15,162
I'm... I'm going after that thing we saw.

1050
01:37:15,865 --> 01:37:17,690
I can't just let it run wild.

1051
01:37:18,269 --> 01:37:20,584
Innocent people here are becoming victims.

1052
01:37:21,332 --> 01:37:22,110
I see.

1053
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,339
Then we'll keep the truce between us going for now.

1054
01:37:26,293 --> 01:37:27,332
Are you sure?

1055
01:37:28,063 --> 01:37:30,495
Yeah. I can't let it run loose, either.

1056
01:37:31,098 --> 01:37:33,376
That said, don't be reckless.

1057
01:37:35,177 --> 01:37:38,185
Until we know more, play it safe.

1058
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:40,408
Right.

1059
01:38:04,666 --> 01:38:08,119
Sakura has given me a bitter
pill to swallow about last night.

1060
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:13,659
I admit it was completely my fault
that I was unable to protect you.

1061
01:38:16,095 --> 01:38:18,725
Hey, I collapsed because I went off half-cocked.

1062
01:38:20,952 --> 01:38:23,920
The problem is my duty is to protect you.

1063
01:38:24,278 --> 01:38:27,435
However, I cannot restrain you from joining me in battle.

1064
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:30,871
That said, I will fight with you

1065
01:38:30,896 --> 01:38:32,340
and protect you, Shirou.

1066
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,533
That is my mission...

1067
01:38:38,418 --> 01:38:40,386
and my promise to Sakura.

1068
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,108
What the hell?

1069
01:39:08,296 --> 01:39:08,984
Shirou!

1070
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,152
Sabe...

1071
01:39:15,804 --> 01:39:17,272
Shirou, it's Assassin!

1072
01:39:17,486 --> 01:39:18,375
You stay there!

1073
01:39:20,343 --> 01:39:20,978
Saber!

1074
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:30,152
Like moths to a flame,

1075
01:39:30,279 --> 01:39:32,341
you are so predictable.

1076
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,176
Zouken...

1077
01:39:34,989 --> 01:39:35,886
Matou.

1078
01:39:54,797 --> 01:39:57,311
A direct hit by her wind would be fatal.

1079
01:39:57,336 --> 01:39:58,283
However...

1080
01:39:59,209 --> 01:40:00,215
O wind...

1081
01:40:02,448 --> 01:40:03,685
enrage!

1082
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:22,915
Protection Against Wind is a
necessity for those who cross the desert.

1083
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:29,936
Choosing to keep your distance is fine,

1084
01:40:29,978 --> 01:40:33,694
but know that your lord is
currently being entertained by mine.

1085
01:40:34,969 --> 01:40:35,865
Damn you.

1086
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:40,867
My only objective tonight was to
divert your attention from their meeting.

1087
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:03,018
Damn you, Assassin.

1088
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:04,573
You wretch.

1089
01:41:05,296 --> 01:41:08,716
Servants are incapable of opposing that shadow.

1090
01:41:09,352 --> 01:41:14,080
Merely touching it will cause one as
pure as yourself to lose your sanity.

1091
01:41:15,229 --> 01:41:16,726
But before that...

1092
01:41:18,492 --> 01:41:21,364
I will take your heart.

1093
01:41:26,277 --> 01:41:27,748
Trace on.

1094
01:41:34,222 --> 01:41:35,332
Pathetic.

1095
01:41:35,397 --> 01:41:38,808
What can that ruddy old stick do to aid you?

1096
01:41:50,102 --> 01:41:51,752
Zabaniya.

1097
01:42:14,997 --> 01:42:16,919
Saber!

1098
01:42:39,793 --> 01:42:43,057
I'd expect nothing less from the supreme Servant.

1099
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:48,285
She has chosen to confront her own
darkness instead of having her heart taken.

1100
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,060
It seems everything has been completed.

1101
01:43:12,969 --> 01:43:14,810
Can you tell, young Master?

1102
01:43:15,262 --> 01:43:17,397
Can you sense that your Servant

1103
01:43:17,548 --> 01:43:20,278
has been annihilated from this world?

1104
01:43:21,397 --> 01:43:22,643
Bastard!

1105
01:43:59,913 --> 01:44:02,850
I will leave the cleanup to you, Assassin.

1106
01:46:03,163 --> 01:46:04,346
You're all right.

1107
01:46:09,941 --> 01:46:11,226
How splendid.

1108
01:46:47,195 --> 01:46:48,151
Hey, Saber!

1109
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:52,481
Saber!

1110
01:47:28,759 --> 01:47:29,918
So you're back.

1111
01:47:30,650 --> 01:47:31,896
Start talking.

1112
01:47:32,052 --> 01:47:33,113
What are you?!

1113
01:47:54,393 --> 01:47:55,343
I see.

1114
01:47:56,252 --> 01:47:57,679
There's no denying it.

1115
01:47:59,004 --> 01:48:00,012
Officially...

1116
01:48:01,171 --> 01:48:03,092
I'm no longer a Master.

1117
01:48:24,019 --> 01:48:26,235
What the hell is going on?

1118
01:48:27,219 --> 01:48:29,627
These are supposed to be training grounds.

1119
01:48:34,092 --> 01:48:35,216
This place...

1120
01:48:36,378 --> 01:48:37,932
it's perverse.

1121
01:49:22,944 --> 01:49:24,421
Do you hate me?

1122
01:49:24,897 --> 01:49:29,651
Do you despise how I tether my
rotting body with the souls of others?

1123
01:49:32,452 --> 01:49:33,024
No.

1124
01:49:34,428 --> 01:49:36,182
Your obsession for life

1125
01:49:36,841 --> 01:49:39,935
is the very thing that makes you fit to be my lord.

1126
01:49:47,129 --> 01:49:48,573
There's a black kite.

1127
01:49:49,366 --> 01:49:51,751
Milady, a black kite, you said?

1128
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:53,795
Wheep! Takka takka takka!

1129
01:49:55,437 --> 01:49:58,350
Sara, get a car ready to go, would you?

1130
01:49:59,382 --> 01:50:02,387
Tomorrow morning, I will head out into the city.

1131
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,975
I'm not sure who you are.

1132
01:50:07,923 --> 01:50:11,081
However, that belongs to the Einzberns.

1133
01:50:24,608 --> 01:50:27,745
So have I lost?

1134
01:50:36,346 --> 01:50:37,528
What is that?

1135
01:50:41,349 --> 01:50:42,524
It can't be.

1136
01:50:47,567 --> 01:50:48,892
Don't bother.

1137
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:50,560
That is the Holy Grail!

1138
01:50:51,349 --> 01:50:52,484
I must seize it!

1139
01:50:52,993 --> 01:50:55,304
In order to do it with my own hands, I must...

1140
01:50:56,571 --> 01:50:57,643
I'm telling you,

1141
01:50:58,047 --> 01:50:59,641
don't bother with it.

1142
01:51:04,345 --> 01:51:05,241
Who's there?!

1143
01:51:05,648 --> 01:51:07,136
Do not get in my way!

1144
01:51:14,373 --> 01:51:16,461
Who's there, you ask?

1145
01:51:19,588 --> 01:51:21,007
That is something...

1146
01:51:22,842 --> 01:51:24,848
that should be obvious.

1147
01:52:13,643 --> 01:52:16,145
Oh, Shirou.

1148
01:52:22,349 --> 01:52:23,698
Where have you been?

1149
01:52:24,951 --> 01:52:27,571
Oh, just look at you. You're injured again!

1150
01:52:30,401 --> 01:52:31,803
You can't keep this up.

1151
01:52:32,033 --> 01:52:33,955
Please take care of yourself!

1152
01:52:40,184 --> 01:52:40,962
Sorry.

1153
01:52:42,991 --> 01:52:43,798
Sorry.

1154
01:52:46,928 --> 01:52:47,635
But hey...

1155
01:52:49,150 --> 01:52:51,658
at least I'm home, Sakura.

1156
01:52:56,959 --> 01:52:57,859
Yes.

1157
01:52:59,214 --> 01:53:02,029
So welcome back home, Shirou.

1158
01:53:19,614 --> 01:53:21,973
Hey, Kiritsugu...

1159
01:53:22,442 --> 01:53:23,950
I still don't get it.

1160
01:53:25,275 --> 01:53:27,498
What in the world do I have to do

1161
01:53:27,847 --> 01:53:30,880
in order to become a true hero of justice?

1162
01:59:25,632 --> 01:59:28,160
No, I can't end this just yet.

1163
01:59:28,694 --> 01:59:30,489
I know who I should fight.

1164
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:34,149
Shirou, you know what?

1165
01:59:36,223 --> 01:59:40,575
I thought I'd be able to see you if I
waited here for a while, big brother.

1166
01:59:41,512 --> 01:59:46,337
There were two children among the Tohsaka
family who had the potential for Magecraft.

1167
01:59:47,512 --> 01:59:50,516
This is the second time I've received something special

1168
01:59:50,938 --> 01:59:52,742
from someone who was dear to me.

1169
01:59:54,106 --> 01:59:57,211
You'd better die while you still can, girl.

1170
02:00:11,638 --> 02:00:13,080
I promise you...

1171
02:00:13,812 --> 02:00:14,582
that I'll...
