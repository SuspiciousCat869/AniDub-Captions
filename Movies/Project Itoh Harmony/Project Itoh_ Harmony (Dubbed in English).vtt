What you say is our

I'm afraid I don't.

"The people abandoned by God."

Only enemies and

A God that turns a blind eye

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.713 position:19% line:83% align:start

doesn't sound all that bad.

Hm.

[TUAN]
The "Medicine gods".

They're always watching.

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:28.958 position:19% line:83% align:start

too closely for my taste.

They can't see us in the desert.

We partake of your imperialist

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.120 position:16% line:83% align:start
If we do not, your gods
will collect our health data,

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:02.291 position:10% line:83% align:start

the name of "preserving life."

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.427 position:19% line:83% align:start
That is why we update

act of charity.

However, you no longer
practice what you preach.

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:32.321 position:13% line:83% align:start

then, what I know now,

I wasn't strong enough.

Miach was its

00:19:35.888 --> 00:19:38.724 position:13% line:83% align:start
She was a radical idealist

00:19:38.757 --> 00:19:40.225 position:21% line:89% align:start
and hated even more.

00:20:17.129 --> 00:20:20.432 position:5% line:83% align:start

a beautiful kind of solitude,

00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:23.435 position:10% line:83% align:start
shunning the various cliques
that invited her in.

Aside from me and Cian Reikado,

00:20:25.237 --> 00:20:29.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
she never spoke to anyone unless
it was absolutely necessary.

00:20:29.374 --> 00:20:32.044 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] If you're serious
about truly isolating yourself,

00:20:32.077 --> 00:20:34.745 position:24% line:83% align:start
paper media is the
best way to do it.

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:36.215 position:21% line:89% align:start
Movies'll work too,

00:20:36.248 --> 00:20:38.916 position:24% line:83% align:start

a physical book.

[TUAN]
Why is that?

00:20:41.019 --> 00:20:43.455 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because it's the most intimate.

00:20:43.488 --> 00:20:45.424 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just you and the pages.

00:20:45.457 --> 00:20:46.891 position:35% line:89% align:start
Isolated.

[TUAN] Tangible, paper books
had become all but obsolete.

00:20:52.297 --> 00:20:54.099 position:10% line:89% align:start
But that didn't deter Miach.

00:20:54.132 --> 00:20:56.435 position:16% line:83% align:start
She would download text
she wanted from the internet,

00:20:56.468 --> 00:20:58.970 position:19% line:83% align:start
take it to one of the
few remaining printers,

00:20:59.003 --> 00:21:01.073 position:24% line:83% align:start
and have them make
a physical copy.

00:21:01.106 --> 00:21:03.908 position:10% line:83% align:start
She spent her days swimming
through a vast sea of words,

00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:05.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
searching for anything

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.346 position:21% line:83% align:start

the edge she wanted.

Given the inclination,

00:25:32.343 --> 00:25:34.178 position:13% line:83% align:start
And of course, I still go
to Morality Sessions

00:25:34.211 --> 00:25:35.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
and Health Ethics
meetings online,

00:25:35.746 --> 00:25:37.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
but that's only
15 hours a month.

00:25:37.548 --> 00:25:39.183 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, really?

00:25:39.216 --> 00:25:40.684 position:5% line:89% align:start
You should come sometime, Tuan.

00:25:40.718 --> 00:25:42.386 position:27% line:89% align:start
They help a lot.

00:25:45.189 --> 00:25:46.122 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
Are you hungry?

00:25:46.156 --> 00:25:47.324 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why don't we grab a bite?

00:25:47.358 --> 00:25:50.394 position:7% line:83% align:start
There's a new restaurant near
my place that just opened.

00:25:50.427 --> 00:25:51.462 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Just us two?

00:25:51.495 --> 00:25:52.663 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
Yeah!

00:25:52.696 --> 00:25:55.064 position:10% line:83% align:start
And you can stay over after,
instead of going to a hotel.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.469 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Cian, my friend,

00:25:58.502 --> 00:26:01.572 position:7% line:83% align:start
who once tried to die with me
to rebel against this world,

00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:03.607 position:7% line:89% align:start
was now fully immersed in it.

00:26:03.641 --> 00:26:05.843 position:5% line:89% align:start
She had connected herself to it.

00:26:05.876 --> 00:26:09.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
Her WatchMe was tethered to
an Admedistration server,

00:26:09.178 --> 00:26:11.315 position:24% line:83% align:start
that told her how
to live her life.

00:26:11.348 --> 00:26:14.451 position:27% line:83% align:start
She had plunged
headfirst into adulthood.

00:26:14.485 --> 00:26:17.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
While here I stand,
stubbornly refusing to jump.

00:26:17.655 --> 00:26:19.490 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can't decide if
that's admirable,

00:26:19.523 --> 00:26:20.624 position:33% line:89% align:start
or pathetic.

00:26:20.658 --> 00:26:22.459 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps, grunts]

00:26:22.493 --> 00:26:24.828 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
Tuan! What's wrong?

00:26:24.862 --> 00:26:26.830 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you feel unwell,
Helix Inspector?

00:26:26.864 --> 00:26:29.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you'd like I'd be happy
to give you my seat.

00:26:31.267 --> 00:26:33.437 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] If I don't get the
hell out of this country fast,

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.507 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll wind up slashing my
wrists or killing someone.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.409 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't stand the kindness.

00:26:38.442 --> 00:26:40.711 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, that's not the
only reason I left.

00:26:40.744 --> 00:26:43.514 position:10% line:83% align:start
On the battlefield, I've met
all kinds of different people,

00:26:43.547 --> 00:26:45.783 position:30% line:83% align:start
from countries
all over the world.

00:26:45.816 --> 00:26:48.217 position:13% line:83% align:start
The medically standardized
population here,

00:26:48.251 --> 00:26:50.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
feels more like a
house of mirrors.

00:26:50.219 --> 00:26:51.655 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why'd you storm off like that?

00:26:51.689 --> 00:26:53.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was rude not to
accept her offer.

00:26:53.824 --> 00:26:56.594 position:7% line:83% align:start
With that high an S.A. score,
she might be a public official.

00:26:56.627 --> 00:26:57.795 position:30% line:89% align:start
I know, I saw.

00:26:57.828 --> 00:27:00.798 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Cian and I took different
paths after Miach's death.

00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:02.265 position:13% line:89% align:start
She let go of her defiance

00:27:02.298 --> 00:27:04.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
and conformed to what
society wanted of her.

00:27:04.702 --> 00:27:07.203 position:19% line:83% align:start
It had all been like a
rite of passage for her,

00:27:07.236 --> 00:27:10.507 position:10% line:83% align:start
a phase she grew out of and
discarded once she grew up.

00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:11.508 position:27% line:89% align:start
On the surface,

00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:13.911 position:19% line:83% align:start
it appeared as though
I'd done the same thing.

00:27:13.944 --> 00:27:16.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
I went out with friends,
got good grades.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.750 position:13% line:83% align:start
Eventually, I took Miach's
place at the head of the class.

00:27:19.783 --> 00:27:21.752 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, the whole time,
I secretly clung

00:27:21.785 --> 00:27:24.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the heretical ideas
she had instilled in me.

00:27:24.655 --> 00:27:25.656 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:27:38.736 --> 00:27:40.303 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
Wow, this takes me back.

00:27:40.336 --> 00:27:42.640 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's been a while since
we ate lunch together.

00:27:42.673 --> 00:27:44.474 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
That it has.

00:27:49.512 --> 00:27:51.614 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:57.420 position:7% line:83% align:start
Doesn't it feel weird, though?
With just the two of us?

00:27:57.453 --> 00:27:58.856 position:30% line:89% align:start
Without Miach?

00:27:58.889 --> 00:28:01.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess, but she's
been gone for a while.

00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:07.731 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] She always finished
eating way before us.

00:28:07.765 --> 00:28:09.666 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then she'd make paper
airplanes just like that,

00:28:09.699 --> 00:28:11.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
Remember?

00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:13.202 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
No, I'd forgotten.

00:28:15.939 --> 00:28:19.442 position:21% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] You grew your
hair out. It's nice.

00:28:19.475 --> 00:28:21.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Makes you look more like Miach.

00:28:24.414 --> 00:28:26.649 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] You guys already knew
each other when we met, right?

00:28:26.683 --> 00:28:29.719 position:21% line:83% align:start
Had you been friends
for a long time?

00:28:29.752 --> 00:28:33.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] I wouldn't say "friends."
More like she took me hostage.

00:28:33.423 --> 00:28:35.558 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
What does that mean?

00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:37.360 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
I've never told you this?

00:28:37.393 --> 00:28:39.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
One day in the park, she
just ran up and grabbed me.

00:28:39.997 --> 00:28:43.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
She wouldn't let go until I
listened to what she had to say.

00:28:43.033 --> 00:28:44.467 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
Sounds like her.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
How she could just snare
someone in her web.

00:28:48.038 --> 00:28:49.106 position:16% line:89% align:start
Maybe when she saw you,

00:28:49.139 --> 00:28:51.641 position:10% line:83% align:start
she knew you were the friend
she'd been waiting for,

00:28:51.674 --> 00:28:53.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
and she didn't want to lose you.

00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:55.244 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't think so.

00:28:55.278 --> 00:28:56.212 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
Hm?

00:28:56.245 --> 00:28:58.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Miach wasn't
looking for a friend,

00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:01.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
she wanted to find
a kindred spirit.

00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:03.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] Aren't those pretty
much the same thing?

00:29:03.954 --> 00:29:05.321 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Not really.

00:29:05.354 --> 00:29:06.889 position:10% line:89% align:start
Friends are your companions,

00:29:06.923 --> 00:29:10.593 position:10% line:83% align:start
whereas kindred spirits are
people who share your beliefs.

00:29:10.626 --> 00:29:11.961 position:7% line:89% align:start
More like "comrades in arms,"

00:29:11.995 --> 00:29:13.997 position:24% line:83% align:start
who want to fight
for the same causes.

00:29:14.031 --> 00:29:16.332 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, you mean like soldiers.

00:29:16.365 --> 00:29:18.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
Guess we didn't turn out to
be what she'd hoped for,

00:29:18.534 --> 00:29:20.336 position:19% line:89% align:start
or at least I didn't.

00:29:21.738 --> 00:29:23.272 position:35% line:89% align:start
Guess not.

00:29:28.878 --> 00:29:32.782 position:21% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] Tuan, there's
something I need to tell you.

00:29:32.815 --> 00:29:35.318 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have a confession to make.

00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:36.919 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
What is it?

00:29:36.953 --> 00:29:39.589 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] I never took any
of the pills Miach gave me.

00:29:39.622 --> 00:29:42.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
I put the first one in my mouth
that day, but I didn't swallow.

00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:45.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then, I told my mom
and ratted you out.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.665 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
I didn't know that.

00:29:49.699 --> 00:29:53.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] I was too scared
to go through with it.

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:56.339 position:10% line:89% align:start
Tuan? Aren't you mad at me?

00:29:56.372 --> 00:29:57.974 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
We were kids.

00:29:58.007 --> 00:30:01.344 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't really blame you.
I owe you my life.

00:30:01.377 --> 00:30:03.546 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you for saying that,

00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:05.948 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I don't deserve
your forgiveness.

00:30:05.982 --> 00:30:09.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
I betrayed both of you,
and it still didn't save her.

00:30:09.452 --> 00:30:10.987 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
It wasn't your fault, Cian.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.689 position:30% line:83% align:start
[CIAN grunts]
It was though.

00:30:13.723 --> 00:30:15.424 position:10% line:89% align:start
I felt like I was paralyzed.

00:30:15.458 --> 00:30:18.594 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't take the pills, but
I didn't tell right away either.

00:30:18.628 --> 00:30:21.631 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fear overwhelmed me and I
locked myself in my room.

00:30:21.664 --> 00:30:24.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
After a few days, my mom took me
to the Emergency Ethics Center.

00:30:24.934 --> 00:30:27.036 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, before I could even
see one of the counselors,

00:30:27.069 --> 00:30:28.671 position:16% line:89% align:start
it all came pouring out.

00:30:28.704 --> 00:30:30.540 position:27% line:83% align:start
My mom told the
counselors immediately,

00:30:30.573 --> 00:30:32.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
so of course they
called your mom.

00:30:32.108 --> 00:30:34.377 position:24% line:83% align:start
They were able to
get to you in time.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.511 position:30% line:89% align:start
But not Miach.

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:39.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
By the time anyone made
it over to check on her,

00:30:39.482 --> 00:30:40.416 position:27% line:89% align:start
it was too late.

00:30:40.449 --> 00:30:42.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
She'd been taking those
stupid pills so long

00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:44.353 position:10% line:89% align:start
that she'd become emaciated

00:30:44.387 --> 00:30:47.857 position:19% line:83% align:start
and her organs started
shutting down one by one.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.458 position:16% line:89% align:start
Her body was so damaged,

00:30:49.492 --> 00:30:52.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
they wouldn't even allow
her parents to bury her.

00:30:52.495 --> 00:30:56.799 position:16% line:83% align:start
No burial? So, then what
did they do with her body?

00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:59.135 position:16% line:83% align:start
Miach's mom told us they
donated it to science

00:30:59.168 --> 00:31:01.571 position:19% line:89% align:start
for medical research.

00:31:01.604 --> 00:31:04.774 position:10% line:83% align:start
[sniffs] Visiting her after
the funeral was hard,

00:31:04.807 --> 00:31:07.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I wanted to beg
her forgiveness.

00:31:07.109 --> 00:31:09.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe this is too hard for you.

00:31:09.478 --> 00:31:13.082 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
No, I want to talk about it.

00:31:13.115 --> 00:31:14.650 position:13% line:89% align:start
Even when Miach was alive,

00:31:14.684 --> 00:31:17.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
I used to wonder sometimes
why I was her friend.

00:31:17.553 --> 00:31:18.988 position:19% line:89% align:start
We were so different.

00:31:19.021 --> 00:31:22.158 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why did I wanna hang
out with her all the time?

00:31:22.191 --> 00:31:23.893 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Ever figure it out?

00:31:23.926 --> 00:31:25.628 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
Strange as it sounds,

00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:28.664 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think it's because I
felt like she needed me.

00:31:28.698 --> 00:31:30.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not to say we had
nothing in common,

00:31:30.766 --> 00:31:32.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wasn't sure where

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
Inspector Kirie's
impending visit.

00:40:56.396 --> 00:40:58.098 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Back then,
it hadn't occurred to me

00:40:58.131 --> 00:41:00.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
to wonder about
Miach's parents.

00:41:00.434 --> 00:41:02.002 position:24% line:83% align:start
We never met each
other's families,

00:41:02.035 --> 00:41:04.004 position:13% line:89% align:start
or even talked about them.

00:41:04.037 --> 00:41:06.339 position:7% line:89% align:start
It just never mattered to us.

00:41:23.256 --> 00:41:24.724 position:21% line:89% align:start
Throughout history,

00:41:24.758 --> 00:41:27.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
people have made a habit of
letting outside influences

00:41:27.561 --> 00:41:29.029 position:21% line:89% align:start
control their lives.

00:41:29.062 --> 00:41:32.032 position:27% line:83% align:start
Their families,
careers, religion.

00:41:32.065 --> 00:41:36.269 position:5% line:89% align:start
And perhaps worst of all, money.

00:41:36.303 --> 00:41:40.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yet money used to be made of
nothing more than flimsy paper.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.441 position:10% line:89% align:start
Back then, people would say,

00:41:41.475 --> 00:41:45.345 position:10% line:83% align:start
"Money can't buy happiness,"
but no one actually believed it.

00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:48.482 position:24% line:83% align:start
Money's sent many
great nations to war.

00:41:48.515 --> 00:41:51.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
Money's made women and
girls sell their bodies.

00:41:51.451 --> 00:41:56.122 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nearly all aspects of everyday
life somehow revolved around it.

00:41:57.757 --> 00:42:02.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] But, WatchMe is far more
dangerous than money ever was.

00:42:02.229 --> 00:42:03.797 position:10% line:89% align:start
It permeates our every cell,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.233 position:24% line:83% align:start
holding our bodies
as its hostage.

00:42:06.266 --> 00:42:07.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
And in the process,

00:42:07.267 --> 00:42:10.670 position:16% line:83% align:start
it robs us of something
that money never could.

00:42:15.308 --> 00:42:17.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] What kind of
people are Miach's parents,

00:42:17.544 --> 00:42:19.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
to have raised a
daughter like that?

00:42:19.713 --> 00:42:23.149 position:16% line:83% align:start
A girl who romanticized
the downfall of humanity,

00:42:23.183 --> 00:42:24.618 position:21% line:83% align:start
who delighted at how
easy it would be

00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:27.454 position:7% line:89% align:start
to poison thousands of people.

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:42.502 position:38% line:83% align:start
[REIKO]
Yes? How may I help you?

00:42:42.536 --> 00:42:45.104 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] I'm a Helix
Inspector with the W.H.O.

00:42:45.137 --> 00:42:47.206 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're investigating
yesterday's mass suicides,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I was hoping you could
answer some questions--

00:42:49.174 --> 00:42:50.377 position:38% line:83% align:start
[REIKO]
Such a tragedy.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.077 position:21% line:83% align:start
I heard about it on
the news this morning,

00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:52.879 position:16% line:89% align:start
but what's that got to--

00:42:52.913 --> 00:42:55.749 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
It's about your daughter.

00:42:55.782 --> 00:42:57.182 position:38% line:83% align:start
[REIKO]
I don't understand.

00:42:57.216 --> 00:42:59.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
She passed away
over ten years ago.

00:42:59.386 --> 00:43:00.620 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
I'm aware.

00:43:00.654 --> 00:43:04.123 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'd like to ask you about what
she was like before her death.

00:43:04.156 --> 00:43:05.492 position:38% line:83% align:start
[REIKO]
Before?

00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:09.128 position:38% line:83% align:start
[REIKO]
All right, please come in.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.097 position:38% line:83% align:start
[REIKO]
It's not a pleasant story.

00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:15.368 position:7% line:83% align:start
She tried to kill herself many
times before she succeeded.

00:43:15.402 --> 00:43:19.606 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Yes, our records show
she made prior attempts.

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.307 position:7% line:89% align:start
Miach was beyond our control.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
She was incredibly
strong-willed and clever.

00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:27.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
However, she was also
a sensitive child.

00:43:27.346 --> 00:43:29.148 position:5% line:89% align:start
A delicate, fragile little girl

00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:31.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
we loved as much as
we possibly could.

00:43:31.685 --> 00:43:34.487 position:13% line:83% align:start
When she came to us, they
said that would be enough.

00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:35.889 position:33% line:89% align:start
Came to you?

00:43:35.922 --> 00:43:39.124 position:24% line:83% align:start
We adopted Miach.
When she was eight.

00:43:39.158 --> 00:43:40.594 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:43:41.628 --> 00:43:42.829 position:27% line:89% align:start
She was adopted?

00:43:42.862 --> 00:43:44.698 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's not in her records.

00:43:44.731 --> 00:43:46.566 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Admedistration
had launched a campaign

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
urging childless
couples to adopt.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.770 position:16% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you remember the
conflict in Chechnya?

00:43:50.804 --> 00:43:51.605 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Of course.

00:43:51.638 --> 00:43:54.139 position:21% line:83% align:start
Conditions are still
horrible there.

00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:55.140 position:10% line:89% align:start
The day we brought her home,

00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:56.910 position:19% line:83% align:start
they told us she came
from an ethnic minority

00:43:56.943 --> 00:44:00.512 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the region and that she'd
been found in a refugee camp.

00:44:00.547 --> 00:44:02.481 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
She was a war orphan.

00:44:02.514 --> 00:44:04.483 position:38% line:83% align:start
[REIKO]
They gave us few other details.

00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:07.186 position:7% line:83% align:start
All they said was she had been
through some truly horrific

00:44:07.219 --> 00:44:09.856 position:24% line:89% align:start
experiences there.

00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:10.857 position:16% line:89% align:start
Long before we got her,

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:14.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
she'd already undergone
intense trauma therapy.

00:44:14.628 --> 00:44:16.528 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, because
she was so young,

00:44:16.562 --> 00:44:19.298 position:7% line:83% align:start
the doctors believed she could
still grow up to be a productive

00:44:19.331 --> 00:44:24.203 position:5% line:83% align:start
member of society. That all she
needed was a warm, loving home.

00:44:24.236 --> 00:44:29.174 position:7% line:83% align:start
They said it would be enough,
but they were wrong. [sobs]

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:31.176 position:21% line:83% align:start
Time and time again
we stopped her

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
and sent her back to treatment.

00:44:33.245 --> 00:44:34.814 position:21% line:89% align:start
She was determined.

00:44:34.848 --> 00:44:37.616 position:10% line:89% align:start
Eventually, she found a way.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:38.852 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
I never knew Miach carried

00:44:38.885 --> 00:44:41.921 position:27% line:83% align:start
such a profound
darkness inside her.

00:44:41.955 --> 00:44:44.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
It wasn't something
she shared with me.

00:44:44.657 --> 00:44:45.792 position:27% line:83% align:start
After all she'd
been through,

00:44:45.825 --> 00:44:49.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
that she could still hate
Japan so much spoke volumes.

00:44:49.595 --> 00:44:52.264 position:16% line:83% align:start
She was a child of war,
yet, it was like

00:44:52.297 --> 00:44:55.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
she preferred that true hell
to this false heaven.

00:44:57.336 --> 00:44:59.839 position:5% line:83% align:start
[REIKO] The doctors recommended
we get rid of anything she had

00:44:59.873 --> 00:45:02.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
that might remind her
of her former life.

00:45:02.976 --> 00:45:07.212 position:13% line:83% align:start
But, I just couldn't bring
myself to throw that away.

00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:11.450 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:18.357 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Ever seen a business card?

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.393 position:16% line:83% align:start
People used to use these
to share information.

00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:24.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
But only with who
they wanted to.

00:45:24.864 --> 00:45:27.232 position:16% line:89% align:start
The picture is our logo.

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:28.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's so cute!

00:45:28.467 --> 00:45:29.702 position:35% line:89% align:start
I like it!

00:45:29.735 --> 00:45:31.470 position:21% line:89% align:start
[TUAN, CIAN giggle]

00:45:33.872 --> 00:45:35.674 position:7% line:89% align:start
May I ask about Miach's body?

00:45:35.708 --> 00:45:38.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
Her death certificate lists
no place of interment.

00:45:38.477 --> 00:45:40.612 position:7% line:89% align:start
Was she returned to Chechnya?

00:45:40.646 --> 00:45:42.614 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, a researcher
from a university

00:45:42.648 --> 00:45:45.417 position:24% line:83% align:start
asked if he could
have her remains.

00:45:45.451 --> 00:45:46.518 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just before she died,

00:45:46.552 --> 00:45:49.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
she said she wanted to
donate her body to science.

00:45:49.354 --> 00:45:51.423 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Who was this researcher?

00:45:51.457 --> 00:45:53.592 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I don't know his name.

00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:55.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
We never had any direct contact.

00:45:55.894 --> 00:45:58.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is an investigation,
so I need to know.

00:45:58.564 --> 00:46:00.365 position:27% line:83% align:start
And my authority
as a Helix Inspector

00:46:00.399 --> 00:46:02.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
allows me to access
confidential information.

00:46:02.901 --> 00:46:04.002 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, if you don't mind,

00:46:04.037 --> 00:46:05.404 position:7% line:89% align:start
this will just take a moment.

[TUAN]
Keita Saeki?

00:46:23.088 --> 00:46:25.824 position:10% line:83% align:start
His theoretical research on
pharmacology and Medicules

00:46:25.858 --> 00:46:27.960 position:13% line:89% align:start
was the basis for WatchMe.

00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:32.831 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] And the man who used
to call himself my father,

00:46:32.865 --> 00:46:35.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nuada Kirie, once
worked in his lab.

00:46:35.868 --> 00:46:39.371 position:7% line:83% align:start
He walked out on us, never to
be seen or heard from again.

00:46:39.404 --> 00:46:40.639 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thirteen years ago.

00:46:40.672 --> 00:46:45.010 position:7% line:83% align:start
Immediately after, I tried to
die alongside my two friends.

[KEITA]
Please, come in.

00:46:49.014 --> 00:46:50.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've been expecting you.

00:46:51.984 --> 00:46:53.852 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Thank you for
seeing me, Professor.

00:46:53.886 --> 00:46:55.487 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're looking well.

00:46:55.521 --> 00:46:57.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KEITA] Looking well is a
given in this day and age.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks to WatchMe, who doesn't?

00:47:00.526 --> 00:47:01.727 position:10% line:89% align:start
The once harsh realities of

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.062 position:19% line:83% align:start
illness and aging are
things of the past.

00:47:04.096 --> 00:47:06.498 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] It's an antiquated
turn of phrase, perhaps,

00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:08.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
but it's something I've
always wanted to say

00:47:08.066 --> 00:47:09.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
to the father of WatchMe.

00:47:09.735 --> 00:47:12.004 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KEITA] I never imagined a
voraciously health-conscious

00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:14.907 position:24% line:83% align:start
society would use
it the way it has,

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.775 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the Maelstrom
changed everything.

00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:18.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
The result is the
world we now live in.

[TUAN]
What do you mean?

00:47:19.945 --> 00:47:22.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
People didn't always
want this kind of future?

00:47:22.815 --> 00:47:24.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KEITA] What happened
over 50 years ago,

00:47:24.583 --> 00:47:27.519 position:24% line:83% align:start
was a cataclysm of
apocalyptic proportions.

00:47:27.553 --> 00:47:30.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
More than ten million lives
lost in North America alone.

00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:33.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
The chaos and nuclear
war that followed

00:47:33.425 --> 00:47:34.960 position:10% line:89% align:start
nearly destroyed the planet.

00:47:34.993 --> 00:47:38.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
There was violence and
terrorism on a global scale.

00:47:38.597 --> 00:47:41.500 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fear reigned supreme, and
the world as we know it,

00:47:41.533 --> 00:47:43.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
with its WatchMe
and Admedistrations,

00:47:43.702 --> 00:47:45.804 position:19% line:89% align:start
was born of that fear.

00:47:45.838 --> 00:47:49.007 position:21% line:83% align:start
A fear that's never
fully gone away.

00:47:49.041 --> 00:47:52.410 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I'm certain you didn't
come here for a history lesson.

00:47:52.443 --> 00:47:54.746 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, what can I do for
you, Helix Inspector?

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
I assume this is about
yesterday's mass suicides?

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.919 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's about Miach Mihie.

00:48:00.953 --> 00:48:03.755 position:16% line:83% align:start
You took custody of her
remains after her death.

00:48:05.657 --> 00:48:08.994 position:16% line:83% align:start
Her body was supposed to
be delivered to this lab,

00:48:09.027 --> 00:48:10.229 position:30% line:89% align:start
but it wasn't.

00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:13.131 position:7% line:83% align:start
All specimens passing through
this facility get processed

00:48:13.165 --> 00:48:16.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
and cataloged, yet
there's no record of her.

00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:18.770 position:27% line:89% align:start
The reason why?

00:48:18.804 --> 00:48:20.973 position:21% line:83% align:start
You didn't actually
take Miach's body!

00:48:21.006 --> 00:48:23.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, my father,
Nuada Kirie, did!

00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:25.978 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hold on, now. When did your
father come in to this?

00:48:26.011 --> 00:48:27.713 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't have time for games.

00:48:27.746 --> 00:48:28.780 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tell me the truth.

00:48:28.814 --> 00:48:30.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
Where did he take her,
what did he want with her,

00:48:30.883 --> 00:48:35.486 position:10% line:83% align:start
and is any of this connected
to what happened yesterday?

00:48:35.519 --> 00:48:37.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
Fine. I'll get a warrant
if that's what it takes.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nuada's little girl grew
into a real ball breaker.

00:48:40.893 --> 00:48:41.827 position:30% line:89% align:start
He'd be proud.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't know. It's an
occupational hazard,

00:48:44.562 --> 00:48:47.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
though I've been known to
break more than just balls.

00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:51.003 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KEITA sighs]
He's in Baghdad.

00:48:51.036 --> 00:48:54.973 position:13% line:83% align:start
At one of the labs of the
SEC Neuroscience Consortium.

00:48:55.007 --> 00:48:58.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
My one-time student has
now surpassed his teacher.

00:48:58.043 --> 00:49:00.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
He moved on to far
more advanced research.

00:49:00.711 --> 00:49:02.580 position:24% line:83% align:start
The two of us have
had no communication

00:49:02.613 --> 00:49:04.482 position:19% line:89% align:start
since the day he left.

00:49:04.515 --> 00:49:07.152 position:16% line:89% align:start
What was he researching?

00:49:07.185 --> 00:49:09.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KEITA] A few years back,
a Russian scientist

00:49:09.221 --> 00:49:11.990 position:13% line:83% align:start
published a groundbreaking
thesis on the mesencephalon

00:49:12.024 --> 00:49:15.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
and how its neurological
synapses affect human will.

00:49:15.794 --> 00:49:18.596 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sounds rather complicated,
but in layman's terms,

00:49:18.629 --> 00:49:21.799 position:13% line:83% align:start
it's simply the theory of
"why we do what we do."

00:49:21.833 --> 00:49:25.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
This area here is the
mesencephalon, or midbrain.

00:49:25.137 --> 00:49:27.538 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sometimes known as the
mind's reward center,

00:49:27.571 --> 00:49:29.807 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's where structures
called Substantia Nigra

00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:32.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
supply the brain with dopamine.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.880 position:7% line:83% align:start
People tend to think of human
will as singular and focused,

00:49:34.913 --> 00:49:36.747 position:7% line:89% align:start
like a soul with a conscience.

00:49:36.781 --> 00:49:38.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have an angel and
a devil on each shoulder,

00:49:38.849 --> 00:49:41.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the only choice is
between right or wrong.

00:49:41.286 --> 00:49:42.720 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
But, it's not that simple.

00:49:42.753 --> 00:49:44.189 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KEITA]
Not even remotely.

00:49:44.222 --> 00:49:46.891 position:13% line:83% align:start
Picture a crowded business
meeting with lots of individuals

00:49:46.925 --> 00:49:49.027 position:27% line:83% align:start
clamoring to get
their point across.

00:49:49.061 --> 00:49:51.729 position:10% line:83% align:start
The vast variety of desires
the brain experiences,

00:49:51.762 --> 00:49:53.497 position:10% line:89% align:start
function much the same way.

00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:55.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
They shout and kick,
or piss and moan,

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
competing with each other
to get our attention.

00:49:57.935 --> 00:49:59.837 position:27% line:83% align:start
Out of all these
possible motivations,

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.239 position:21% line:89% align:start
we only act on one.

00:50:01.273 --> 00:50:03.641 position:30% line:83% align:start
Deciding which
one is our will.

00:50:03.674 --> 00:50:05.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
But behind the decision,
our brain's reward center

00:50:05.977 --> 00:50:08.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
has trained us with
dopamine to respond.

00:50:08.913 --> 00:50:11.882 position:7% line:89% align:start
Like giving a treat to a dog.

00:50:11.916 --> 00:50:13.551 position:10% line:89% align:start
This fascinated your father.

00:50:13.584 --> 00:50:15.820 position:16% line:83% align:start
He became obsessed with
what might be possible

00:50:15.853 --> 00:50:20.158 position:7% line:83% align:start
if this chemical reward system
were artificially influenced.

00:50:20.192 --> 00:50:22.493 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
You mean mind control.

00:50:23.728 --> 00:50:24.829 position:35% line:89% align:start
Big shock.

00:50:24.862 --> 00:50:27.898 position:7% line:83% align:start
Had a feeling he had something
to do with the suicides.

00:50:27.932 --> 00:50:29.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's no evidence of that.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
And I'm rather surprised

00:50:30.835 --> 00:50:32.603 position:24% line:83% align:start
you could possibly
suspect your own father.

00:50:32.636 --> 00:50:34.805 position:27% line:83% align:start
He stopped being
my father years ago.

00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:35.940 position:16% line:89% align:start
As far as I'm concerned,

00:50:35.973 --> 00:50:39.211 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know who he is or
what he may be capable of.

00:50:40.945 --> 00:50:42.314 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't be so quick to judge him.

00:50:42.347 --> 00:50:45.082 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is the science behind
the human soul itself.

00:50:45.116 --> 00:50:48.220 position:13% line:83% align:start
Many researchers have long
been tempted to pursue it.

00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:49.221 position:16% line:89% align:start
We only seek the truth.

00:50:49.254 --> 00:50:50.688 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm leaving for Baghdad,

00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:52.990 position:27% line:83% align:start
to ascertain the
whereabouts of Miach Mihie.

00:50:53.024 --> 00:50:54.658 position:7% line:89% align:start
I intend to find her remains,

00:50:54.692 --> 00:50:56.961 position:27% line:83% align:start
even if it means
confronting him.

Hm?

Baghdad awaits, yes?

00:51:11.976 --> 00:51:14.812 position:21% line:83% align:start

Everyone's afraid of
what might happen next.

00:51:47.178 --> 00:51:48.145 position:21% line:89% align:start
Until the other day,

00:51:48.179 --> 00:51:51.749 position:19% line:83% align:start
almost no one had seen
death for themselves.

00:51:51.782 --> 00:51:54.085 position:10% line:83% align:start
They all assumed they would

00:51:54.118 --> 00:51:55.786 position:24% line:83% align:start
People dying right
in front of you

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.856 position:21% line:83% align:start
isn't something that
should happen anymore.

00:51:58.889 --> 00:52:02.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yet it did, and therapy
centers have reached capacity.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.396 position:10% line:83% align:start
Admedistration citizens were
happy in their ignorance,

00:52:05.429 --> 00:52:07.098 position:30% line:83% align:start
confident that
nothing unpleasant

00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:09.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
would ever knock on their doors.

00:52:09.333 --> 00:52:11.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
We are conditioned to
care for one another

00:52:11.335 --> 00:52:13.637 position:7% line:89% align:start
and protect life at all costs.

00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:16.040 position:21% line:83% align:start
That belief has kept
our society running.

00:52:16.073 --> 00:52:17.241 position:19% line:89% align:start
But now everyone knows

00:52:17.274 --> 00:52:20.845 position:13% line:83% align:start
this world has never been
the Utopia it appeared to be.

Of course it does.

00:52:30.287 --> 00:52:32.056 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right now, most
people are terrified

of what they don't know,

00:52:33.257 --> 00:52:35.092 position:30% line:83% align:start
while I'm more
afraid of what I do.

00:52:35.126 --> 00:52:38.162 position:13% line:83% align:start
The group Interpol's been
surveilling for instance.

00:52:38.195 --> 00:52:39.096 position:33% line:89% align:start
What group?

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:41.065 position:24% line:83% align:start
A WatchMe research
consortium called the

00:52:41.098 --> 00:52:43.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
Next-Gen Human Behavior
Monitoring Group.

00:52:43.367 --> 00:52:46.170 position:10% line:83% align:start
My division has been keeping
an eye on it for a while.

00:52:46.203 --> 00:52:48.739 position:13% line:83% align:start
Amid all of the scientists
you would expect to find,

00:52:48.772 --> 00:52:50.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
are heads of medical
tech companies

00:52:50.341 --> 00:52:52.676 position:33% line:83% align:start
and powerful
Admedistration elders.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not exactly the lineup
of usual suspects.

00:52:55.813 --> 00:52:58.682 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a long name for
a secret society.

00:52:58.716 --> 00:53:00.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're more concerned
with their ideology

00:53:00.718 --> 00:53:02.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
and why they've been trying
to fly under the radar.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
They seem to have strong
memories of the Maelstrom.

00:53:05.923 --> 00:53:08.225 position:24% line:83% align:start
Historians may not
agree on how it began,

00:53:08.259 --> 00:53:10.728 position:13% line:83% align:start
but there's no doubt about
how fast it went wrong.

00:53:10.761 --> 00:53:13.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
Humanity reverted to
savagery and barbarism

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:15.698 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the blink of an eye.

00:53:15.732 --> 00:53:18.302 position:13% line:83% align:start
No one thought our species
was still capable of that.

00:53:18.335 --> 00:53:20.471 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not until several
millions of people died.

00:53:20.504 --> 00:53:22.406 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, now this group
wants to use WatchMe

00:53:22.439 --> 00:53:24.475 position:24% line:83% align:start
to ensure it never
happens again.

00:53:24.508 --> 00:53:27.178 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Hmph. That's quite
the conspiracy theory.

00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:29.146 position:24% line:83% align:start

This one group has the entire
planet under observation.

They don't trust people
to control themselves,

00:53:40.324 --> 00:53:42.092 position:24% line:83% align:start
so they exploited
a hole in WatchMe,

00:53:42.126 --> 00:53:43.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
which allows them
to manually override

killing each other,

00:53:55.472 --> 00:53:58.242 position:19% line:83% align:start

01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:04.372 position:13% line:83% align:start
When push comes to shove,
right and wrong are just words.

01:00:04.407 --> 01:00:08.544 position:10% line:83% align:start
What matters is what you do,
how you act, what you believe.

01:00:08.578 --> 01:00:11.279 position:10% line:83% align:start
What matters is making sure
the world keeps spinning,

01:00:11.313 --> 01:00:12.715 position:10% line:89% align:start
making sure family goes on,

01:00:12.748 --> 01:00:15.317 position:24% line:83% align:start
happiness goes on,
peace goes on.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:18.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
Doing what needs to be
done to make life go on.

01:00:18.721 --> 01:00:22.357 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what's right. Right?

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.292 position:13% line:89% align:start
Except life doesn't go on.

01:00:24.326 --> 01:00:26.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing lasts forever.

01:00:26.261 --> 01:00:31.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're born, we grow up, we grow
old, we get sick... and we die.

01:00:31.934 --> 01:00:33.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's nature.

01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:37.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
And there is no right or
wrong in nature, only change.

01:00:37.172 --> 01:00:40.141 position:27% line:83% align:start
But, I guess...
things are different now.

01:00:40.175 --> 01:00:41.844 position:16% line:89% align:start
WatchMe changed nature.

01:00:41.877 --> 01:00:44.279 position:24% line:83% align:start
Illness and aging,
as the world once knew them,

01:00:44.312 --> 01:00:46.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
have been virtually eliminated.

01:00:46.381 --> 01:00:49.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well-being trumps all.
Health is the new god.

01:00:49.819 --> 01:00:51.020 position:24% line:89% align:start
In ancient times,

01:00:51.053 --> 01:00:54.356 position:10% line:83% align:start
kings and queens threatened
to execute any who opposed them.

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:57.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
They ruled by force.
Might made right.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, the Bastille fell and tea
was dumped in Boston Harbor,

01:01:01.196 --> 01:01:04.399 position:13% line:83% align:start
And "power of the people,"
became the order of the day.

01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:09.371 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] But, what if
people are the problem?

01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:12.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
How do we fight the
enemy within ourselves?

01:01:12.808 --> 01:01:15.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
When we let our bodies
decide what's right for us,

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:18.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
the question and the
answer are both the same.

come with me, Cian.

a Dr. Nuada Kirie, who I'm

I do not, sadly.

01:04:44.886 --> 01:04:46.453 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
You're sure?

01:04:47.822 --> 01:04:50.490 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why such an interest?

01:04:50.525 --> 01:04:54.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
Dr. Kirie's my father,
but you know that.

01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:57.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
[GABRIELLE] Of course.

So, if you are not here

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've come all the way
to Baghdad for a...

01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:04.806 position:13% line:89% align:start
...family reunion, is it?

01:05:04.839 --> 01:05:07.709 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] I'm here as part of
an official investigation.

01:05:07.742 --> 01:05:09.811 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your cooperation
is not optional.

01:05:09.844 --> 01:05:11.511 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tell me about the
research you're doing

01:05:11.545 --> 01:05:13.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
and how my father was involved.

01:05:14.849 --> 01:05:18.585 position:21% line:83% align:start
Very well, our focus
is value judgements.

01:05:18.619 --> 01:05:21.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
For instance, I offer you
ten thousand credits now,

01:05:21.555 --> 01:05:24.726 position:13% line:83% align:start
or twenty thousand credits
one year from now.

01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:26.194 position:10% line:89% align:start
Which amount do you choose?

01:05:26.227 --> 01:05:28.029 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Probably the former.

01:05:28.062 --> 01:05:29.130 position:33% line:83% align:start
[GABRIELLE]
Most do.

01:05:29.163 --> 01:05:30.365 position:24% line:89% align:start
Given the choice,

01:05:30.397 --> 01:05:33.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
the majority of human beings
prefer instant gratification.

01:05:33.902 --> 01:05:37.005 position:13% line:83% align:start
But so do other primates,
birds, dogs, and cats.

01:05:37.038 --> 01:05:38.907 position:19% line:83% align:start
Organisms that exhibit
this behavior,

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.110 position:19% line:83% align:start
tend to overvalue that
which is easily obtained.

01:05:42.143 --> 01:05:43.443 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Hm...

01:05:43.477 --> 01:05:46.446 position:33% line:83% align:start
[GABRIELLE]
It's genetic programming.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.849 position:24% line:89% align:start
Consider a heron.

01:05:47.882 --> 01:05:50.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it doesn't eat the
fish it sees immediately,

01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:52.954 position:16% line:83% align:start
that fish will be eaten
by another heron.

01:05:52.987 --> 01:05:55.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, if another fish
doesn't come along,

01:05:55.123 --> 01:05:57.524 position:27% line:83% align:start
the first heron
starves to death.

01:05:57.557 --> 01:05:59.626 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is not survival
of the most fit.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's an ongoing conflict between
small short-term desires

01:06:02.964 --> 01:06:04.933 position:7% line:89% align:start
and larger long-term desires.

01:06:04.966 --> 01:06:08.568 position:21% line:83% align:start
An illogical game of
choice we call "will."

01:06:08.602 --> 01:06:10.071 position:30% line:83% align:start
In accordance
with this theory,

01:06:10.104 --> 01:06:12.673 position:19% line:83% align:start
even pain is something
we choose to feel.

01:06:12.706 --> 01:06:13.942 position:30% line:89% align:start
Explain that.

01:06:13.975 --> 01:06:15.043 position:33% line:83% align:start
[GABRIELLE]
The pain we experience

01:06:15.076 --> 01:06:17.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
the moment we prick a
finger is a feedback agent,

01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:20.480 position:13% line:83% align:start
a short-term desire trying
to leave an impression

01:06:20.514 --> 01:06:22.549 position:21% line:83% align:start
on the mind, and get
us to take action.

01:06:22.582 --> 01:06:24.618 position:10% line:89% align:start
Usually, to stop said pain.

01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:27.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, I'm sure you've
heard of instances where

01:06:27.121 --> 01:06:30.158 position:10% line:83% align:start
a machinist or construction
worker has sliced off a finger,

01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:31.993 position:27% line:83% align:start
and not noticed
right away because

01:06:32.026 --> 01:06:34.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
they were concentrating
on something else.

01:06:34.195 --> 01:06:36.830 position:19% line:83% align:start
This phenomenon occurs
when the agent for pain,

01:06:36.863 --> 01:06:39.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
competes with the agent
for focus and loses.

01:06:39.566 --> 01:06:42.971 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thus, the consciousness
delays giving it attention.

01:06:43.004 --> 01:06:45.672 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, our reality's not
shaped by our experiences,

01:06:45.706 --> 01:06:47.008 position:27% line:89% align:start
it's subjective.

01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:49.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
All the various feedback

01:14:14.486 --> 01:14:18.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
Pretty sure your friend, Miach,
deserves some of the blame.

[gasps]

Why her? Why Miach?

[NUADA]
Even before recent events,

01:14:34.139 --> 01:14:37.376 position:13% line:83% align:start
the teen suicide rate was
going up year after year.

01:14:37.409 --> 01:14:40.546 position:13% line:83% align:start
You tried it. Your friend,
Cian, considered it.

01:14:40.579 --> 01:14:43.015 position:24% line:83% align:start
Miach was ready to
go through with it.

01:14:43.048 --> 01:14:46.084 position:7% line:83% align:start
Many children rejected WatchMe
when it was first introduced

01:14:46.118 --> 01:14:48.620 position:19% line:83% align:start
and became determined
to hurt themselves.

01:14:48.654 --> 01:14:50.556 position:7% line:89% align:start
Lacking any kind of solution,

01:14:50.589 --> 01:14:52.224 position:5% line:89% align:start
all the Admedistration could do

01:14:52.257 --> 01:14:55.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
was round up the kids and
put them into treatment.

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:57.262 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Next-Gen Human
Behavior Monitoring Group

01:14:57.296 --> 01:15:00.599 position:13% line:83% align:start
took custody of especially
resolute individuals

01:15:00.632 --> 01:15:02.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
who made multiple attempts.

01:15:02.734 --> 01:15:06.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
They were singled out to receive
an experimental treatment.

01:15:06.505 --> 01:15:07.673 position:16% line:89% align:start
We needed strong-willed

01:15:07.706 --> 01:15:10.409 position:16% line:83% align:start
guinea pigs to test the
Harmony Program on.

01:15:10.442 --> 01:15:13.345 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your friend, Miach, was
the perfect candidate.

01:15:16.482 --> 01:15:20.352 position:21% line:83% align:start
[gasps] What is this
"Harmony Program?"

01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:21.520 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NUADA]
Harmony.

01:15:21.553 --> 01:15:25.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
As in synchronicity,
order, coordination.

01:15:25.524 --> 01:15:29.361 position:10% line:83% align:start
Like musical notes blending
together to form a chord.

01:15:29.394 --> 01:15:30.796 position:13% line:89% align:start
Except what we were after,

01:15:30.829 --> 01:15:34.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
was a means to unify the
synapses in the human mind.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.401 position:10% line:89% align:start
The intent was to find a way

01:15:36.435 --> 01:15:39.371 position:21% line:83% align:start
to save mankind from
its own savagery.

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:41.573 position:21% line:83% align:start
While working under
Professor Saeki,

01:15:41.607 --> 01:15:43.675 position:21% line:83% align:start
I began a thesis on
the brain mechanics

01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:46.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
behind choice and determination.

01:15:46.612 --> 01:15:49.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
When word of my research
came to the attention

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.649 position:13% line:89% align:start
of certain top officials,

01:15:50.682 --> 01:15:52.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
who feared a repeat
of the Maelstrom,

01:15:52.684 --> 01:15:55.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
they asked me to
join their consortium.

01:15:57.422 --> 01:15:59.258 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's how it started.

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:01.493 position:19% line:83% align:start
And eventually it led
to my choosing Miach,

01:16:01.527 --> 01:16:05.631 position:13% line:83% align:start
whose rejection of society
made her an ideal subject.

01:16:05.664 --> 01:16:07.566 position:19% line:83% align:start
I believed if we could
conquer her mind,

01:16:07.599 --> 01:16:10.669 position:16% line:83% align:start
somehow refocus it away
from its relentless pursuit

01:16:10.702 --> 01:16:11.870 position:24% line:89% align:start
of her own death,

01:16:11.904 --> 01:16:15.340 position:7% line:83% align:start
the program would be powerful
enough to control anyone.

01:16:18.477 --> 01:16:21.380 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NUADA chuckles] That was
the presumption, at least.

01:16:21.413 --> 01:16:23.415 position:7% line:89% align:start
Perhaps we over-simplified it.

01:16:23.448 --> 01:16:26.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, welcome to my
humble abode. Come on in.

01:16:31.122 --> 01:16:33.559 position:24% line:83% align:start
Assume you're not
opposed to caffeine?

01:16:39.831 --> 01:16:42.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
You do your research here?

01:16:42.801 --> 01:16:44.201 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NUADA]
No, not here.

01:16:44.235 --> 01:16:48.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
Until recently, I had
a lab at Dian Cecht.

01:16:48.205 --> 01:16:50.107 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's where you took Miach?

01:16:52.411 --> 01:16:53.879 position:16% line:89% align:start
There were side-effects.

01:16:53.912 --> 01:16:55.279 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Huh?

01:16:56.448 --> 01:17:00.719 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NUADA] The Harmony Program
has one very serious flaw.

01:17:00.752 --> 01:17:02.888 position:24% line:83% align:start
In hindsight, the
result was obvious.

01:17:02.921 --> 01:17:06.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
We should've anticipated
what would happen,

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:10.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
but we were on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:12.698 position:16% line:83% align:start
We created a human mind
where the brain's entire

01:17:12.731 --> 01:17:17.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
feedback matrix worked in
perfect harmonious accord.

01:17:17.569 --> 01:17:21.873 position:19% line:83% align:start
However, Consciousness
...was destroyed.

01:17:21.907 --> 01:17:23.140 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:17:23.174 --> 01:17:24.576 position:13% line:89% align:start
Prior to testing on Miach,

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:27.345 position:27% line:83% align:start
we were unaware
of this consequence.

01:17:27.378 --> 01:17:30.147 position:19% line:83% align:start
It wasn't detected in
any trials before hers.

01:17:30.181 --> 01:17:31.917 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can a person even
live like that?!

01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:33.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, what happened once
you were done with her?

01:17:33.952 --> 01:17:36.888 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did she end up drooling
in a wheelchair?

01:17:36.922 --> 01:17:41.425 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, nothing like that.
I'll try to explain.

01:17:41.459 --> 01:17:45.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
Going shopping, eating, living.
That goes on as usual.

01:17:45.664 --> 01:17:48.265 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just... no choice.

01:17:48.299 --> 01:17:49.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:54.873 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NUADA] Decision making
is no longer necessary,

01:17:54.906 --> 01:17:58.409 position:13% line:83% align:start
because competing feedback
agents have been removed.

01:17:58.442 --> 01:18:00.746 position:24% line:83% align:start
From the outside,
it's impossible to tell

01:18:00.779 --> 01:18:01.713 position:19% line:89% align:start
who has consciousness,

01:18:01.747 --> 01:18:04.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
and who's simply going
through the motions.

01:18:04.482 --> 01:18:06.617 position:24% line:89% align:start
They act the same.

01:18:06.651 --> 01:18:08.586 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Did Miach?

01:18:08.619 --> 01:18:12.289 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NUADA] She appeared to be
living a typical, average life.

01:18:12.323 --> 01:18:15.861 position:10% line:83% align:start
She did homework, ate meals,
carried on conversations.

01:18:15.894 --> 01:18:16.995 position:19% line:83% align:start
When we first brought
her out of it,

01:18:17.029 --> 01:18:21.432 position:7% line:83% align:start
she described what she'd gone
through as pure ecstasy.

01:18:21.465 --> 01:18:23.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
After her consciousness
was restored,

01:18:23.734 --> 01:18:26.270 position:13% line:83% align:start
she couldn't remember any
details about what happened

01:18:26.303 --> 01:18:27.672 position:27% line:89% align:start
during the test.

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.708 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NUADA]
Nevertheless,

01:18:30.741 --> 01:18:33.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
She recalled the sensation
of being in a blissful,

01:18:33.644 --> 01:18:34.612 position:33% line:89% align:start
happy place.

01:18:34.645 --> 01:18:37.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
She characterized it as
a positive experience.

01:18:40.518 --> 01:18:43.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, living without free
will is a kind of death.

01:18:43.454 --> 01:18:45.891 position:10% line:83% align:start
Given such serious concerns,
we thought the authorities

01:18:45.924 --> 01:18:49.860 position:19% line:83% align:start
should decide how best
to proceed, and they did.

01:18:49.895 --> 01:18:53.531 position:5% line:83% align:start
Using WatchMe, they uploaded the
Harmony Program to every man,

01:18:53.564 --> 01:18:56.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
woman, and child throughout
the Admedistration.

01:18:56.333 --> 01:19:00.404 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's in both you and me,
whether we like it or not.

01:19:00.438 --> 01:19:03.441 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's not activated, obviously,
but it's there in our brains

01:19:03.474 --> 01:19:08.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
as a safety mechanism
in case of emergency.

01:19:08.279 --> 01:19:10.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
If war and chaos,
like the Maelstrom,

01:19:10.414 --> 01:19:12.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
were to threaten mankind again,

01:19:12.383 --> 01:19:15.920 position:30% line:83% align:start
Harmony can be
turned on to stop it.

01:19:15.953 --> 01:19:17.755 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, that's...

01:19:17.788 --> 01:19:21.358 position:7% line:83% align:start
For the time being, at least,
it's going to stay off.

01:19:21.392 --> 01:19:25.930 position:10% line:83% align:start
Depriving humanity of their
souls, is a last resort.

01:19:25.963 --> 01:19:29.366 position:16% line:83% align:start
Though, some within the
organization disagree.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.803 position:16% line:83% align:start
They think we should be
using the program now.

01:19:32.837 --> 01:19:35.940 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course they do.
Miach's one of them.

01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:21.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, if I remove him
from the equation,

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ELDER A] History seems
poised to repeat itself.

01:30:39.968 --> 01:30:42.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
We stand on the brink
of another Maelstrom.

01:30:42.404 --> 01:30:45.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ELDER B] Is this simply
the fate of humanity?

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:47.542 position:16% line:83% align:start
To plunge into violence
over and over?

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:49.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
After all we did to prevent it,

01:30:49.511 --> 01:30:53.148 position:24% line:83% align:start
how could this be
happening again?

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:55.283 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Next-Gen Group.

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:57.452 position:27% line:83% align:start
[ELDER C] Peace.
For over half a century,

01:30:57.485 --> 01:31:01.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
we carefully molded and crafted
a society to sustain it,

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:04.692 position:19% line:83% align:start
but all we truly built
was a house of cards.

01:31:04.726 --> 01:31:06.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
[ELDER D] And now,
thanks to a few terrorists,

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.496 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's about to come
crashing down.

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:10.298 position:21% line:89% align:start
You know who we are.

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:13.201 position:10% line:83% align:start
Assembled before you are the
members of a council responsible

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:16.438 position:30% line:83% align:start
for protecting
humanity from itself.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:19.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
[gasps] So, it was all true.

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:21.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
[OS CARA] Your father
was a respected member

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:22.744 position:21% line:89% align:start
of our science team.

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:27.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
His untimely death was
truly unfortunate.

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.683 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ELDER E] When the rift
within our organization

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:33.321 position:10% line:83% align:start
became a divide, Nuada Kirie
became a marked man.

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:36.424 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] But he wasn't the
only one under surveillance.

01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:40.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were hoping Miach Mihie would
establish contact with you.

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:42.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
Or, that somewhere over the
course of this investigation,

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:43.731 position:21% line:89% align:start
you would find her.

01:31:43.765 --> 01:31:46.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
You and she were friends, once.

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:50.472 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which explains why you gave me
five days without much fight.

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:52.173 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ELDER A]
Despite being in hiding,

01:31:52.207 --> 01:31:55.109 position:7% line:83% align:start
Mihie and her accomplices have
still been able to hack into the

01:31:55.143 --> 01:31:59.681 position:7% line:83% align:start
brain feedback mechanisms of a
limited number of individuals.

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:01.716 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ELDER B] They have the
means to control far fewer

01:32:01.749 --> 01:32:04.686 position:10% line:83% align:start
people than they claim, yet
they are using their power

01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:07.489 position:27% line:83% align:start
to incite chaos
throughout the world.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:11.593 position:7% line:83% align:start
What Miach Mihie wants, or why
she is doing this, unclear.

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:13.394 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ours is a peaceful society,

01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:16.264 position:27% line:83% align:start
dedicated to the
preservation of life.

01:32:16.297 --> 01:32:18.700 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why would she want
to destroy that?

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:22.203 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is her end game?

01:32:22.237 --> 01:32:24.405 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're one of the few
she's let get close to her.

01:32:24.439 --> 01:32:27.175 position:16% line:83% align:start
We need you to learn her
true motives, Inspector Kirie,

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:28.776 position:30% line:89% align:start
and stop her.

01:32:32.112 --> 01:32:33.648 position:27% line:89% align:start
[TUAN chuckles]

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:35.517 position:35% line:83% align:start
[OS CARA]
Find something funny?

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:36.618 position:35% line:89% align:start
A little.

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:40.120 position:16% line:83% align:start
You see, my father said
almost the exact same thing.

01:32:40.153 --> 01:32:42.457 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, If you don't mind...

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:44.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
We don't have time
for this, Tuan!

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:51.064 position:10% line:83% align:start
The fate of the entire world
rests on your shoulders.

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:54.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then, I must be
pretty important.

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:59.274 position:24% line:83% align:start
We are begging you
for your help, please.

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:00.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't give a damn
about helping you

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:03.110 position:7% line:89% align:start
or saving your precious world.

01:33:03.143 --> 01:33:04.345 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will find Miach,

01:33:04.379 --> 01:33:07.582 position:10% line:83% align:start
but my reasons for doing so
are no one else's but my own.

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:11.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
My father and Cian
Reikado are dead.

01:33:11.386 --> 01:33:16.624 position:7% line:83% align:start
She killed them. There's only
one thing I care about now.

01:33:16.658 --> 01:33:19.293 position:30% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Tuan!

01:33:19.326 --> 01:33:20.495 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:30.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ELDERS] Life must be
preserved at all costs.

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:35.275 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, is life without
a soul, truly life?

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:37.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
There can be no
second Maelstrom.

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:41.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
The world cannot
descend into chaos again.

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:45.653 position:16% line:83% align:start
If mankind can no longer
repress its savage nature,

01:33:45.687 --> 01:33:49.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
we must activate the
plan of last resort.

01:34:01.703 --> 01:34:03.403 position:13% line:89% align:start
Give that to Miach Mihie.

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:06.206 position:21% line:83% align:start
She'll know who it's
from and what it means.

[UWE]
Dealing with the Anti-Russian

Freedom Front now, huh?

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:16.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
I brought the WarDog,
just like you asked me.

01:34:16.416 --> 01:34:18.318 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's fully equipped.

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:21.455 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Thank you, Uwe.

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Back when we
were young and defiant,

01:34:31.633 --> 01:34:33.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miach and I agreed on something.

01:34:33.935 --> 01:34:37.805 position:10% line:83% align:start
We wanted a world without a
society that would stifle us.

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:40.607 position:16% line:83% align:start
We wanted a world where
our bodies were our own,

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:43.878 position:19% line:83% align:start
where we had more of a
choice in our own destinies.

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:46.814 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why would she want
something so different now?

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:50.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why would she want a world where
we ceased to be ourselves?

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.355 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Coordinates.

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:57.557 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh, "Alone".

01:34:59.459 --> 01:35:01.829 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
That goes without saying, Miach.

01:35:01.863 --> 01:35:05.632 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been alone ever since
the day I thought you died.

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:18.745 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Chechnya.

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:21.715 position:7% line:89% align:start
The place where you were born.

01:35:21.748 --> 01:35:24.919 position:30% line:83% align:start
The place your
consciousness was born.

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:27.821 position:19% line:83% align:start
You once described it
as a hell on Earth.

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:28.855 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NUADA]
Decades ago,

01:35:28.890 --> 01:35:31.558 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the midst of the
Russian-Chechen conflict,

01:35:31.591 --> 01:35:34.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
an isolated ethnic minority
group was discovered.

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:37.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anthropologists had no
official records of them.

01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:39.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
Their existence was
largely unknown.

01:35:39.599 --> 01:35:42.369 position:10% line:83% align:start
The mountain villages where
they lived were remote.

01:35:42.402 --> 01:35:44.237 position:5% line:89% align:start
In such a secluded environment,

01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:46.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
and having little
contact with outsiders,

01:35:46.473 --> 01:35:49.010 position:19% line:83% align:start
The people inbred over
many generations.

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:51.778 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] What are you
trying to tell me, Dad?

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:53.613 position:24% line:83% align:start
[NUADA] Because of
their pure bloodlines,

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:55.315 position:30% line:83% align:start
the members of
this minority group

01:35:55.348 --> 01:35:57.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
all share a certain
recessive trait.

01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:00.454 position:7% line:83% align:start
Though this trait can be found
in the general population,

01:36:00.487 --> 01:36:03.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
the likelihood of it
occurring is extremely rare.

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:06.027 position:16% line:83% align:start
The trait I'm referring
to is a chromosomal anomaly,

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
which results in a missing gene.
The gene for the human soul.

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:12.733 position:21% line:83% align:start
The gene in control
of consciousness.

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.568 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
So, these people's natural state

01:36:14.601 --> 01:36:17.537 position:13% line:83% align:start
is the same as the Harmony
Program's side effect?

01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:19.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NUADA] Yes, though
it didn't seem to inhibit

01:36:19.372 --> 01:36:22.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
them from living their lives or
developing their own culture.

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:26.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
They were just extremely
adept at logical thinking.

01:36:26.413 --> 01:36:28.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
These people evolved
without a consciousness,

01:36:28.548 --> 01:36:30.450 position:27% line:83% align:start
because they had
no need for one.

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:33.019 position:16% line:83% align:start
A self-reinforcing cycle
of natural selection,

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:35.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
resulting in an innate
state of harmony.

01:36:35.555 --> 01:36:38.325 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] What's this
got to do with Miach?

01:36:38.358 --> 01:36:40.827 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NUADA] Miach came from
that ethnic minority.

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.829 position:7% line:89% align:start
When she was eight-years-old,

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:46.700 position:13% line:83% align:start
Russian troops raided her
village and kidnapped her.

01:36:46.733 --> 01:36:49.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
They took her to a camp
for human trafficking,

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:51.505 position:13% line:89% align:start
a truly unspeakable place.

01:36:51.538 --> 01:36:53.440 position:21% line:83% align:start
I told her she could
open up about it to me,

01:36:53.473 --> 01:36:55.509 position:16% line:89% align:start
but she never said much.

01:36:55.542 --> 01:36:57.944 position:10% line:83% align:start
Only that her consciousness
had awakened there.

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:01.481 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Awakened?

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:04.084 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NUADA] When she wasn't being
physically abused or tortured,

01:37:04.117 --> 01:37:08.555 position:7% line:83% align:start
she remained in constant fear.
Her mind needed a way to cope.

01:37:08.588 --> 01:37:10.957 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thus, it created a
consciousness, or...

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:12.626 position:19% line:89% align:start
...something like one.

01:37:12.659 --> 01:37:15.495 position:7% line:83% align:start
A region in her cerebrum began
to emulate the functions

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:17.030 position:7% line:89% align:start
of the chemical reward system,

01:37:17.063 --> 01:37:20.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
functions typically
handled by the midbrain.

01:37:20.867 --> 01:37:24.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Not a true
consciousness, a replica.

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:27.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
An imitation of a
consciousness,

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:30.544 position:16% line:89% align:start
an imitation of a soul.

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:35.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] I've decided to burn my
books, every last one of them.

01:37:35.582 --> 01:37:38.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to. They are
very precious to me.

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:41.488 position:24% line:83% align:start
As long as they're
here, I can't leave.

01:37:41.521 --> 01:37:44.390 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Does that mean
you're almost ready?

01:37:44.424 --> 01:37:45.992 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Yep.

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:48.829 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know in China, when a
new emperor came to power,

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:50.664 position:27% line:83% align:start
they would burn
all the old scrolls

01:37:50.697 --> 01:37:52.499 position:7% line:89% align:start
containing historical records,

01:37:52.532 --> 01:37:54.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
so that they could
write a new history.

01:37:56.803 --> 01:37:59.940 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you know why people
began writing things down?

01:37:59.973 --> 01:38:01.641 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
No, why?

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.375 position:13% line:89% align:start
Because words will remain.

01:38:03.409 --> 01:38:06.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
Long after their writers
have left this world.

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:09.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] The verses in the
Bible and the engravings

01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:12.418 position:21% line:83% align:start
on the pyramids were
meant to be immortal.

01:38:12.451 --> 01:38:14.621 position:13% line:83% align:start
People have always sought
to have a piece of themselves

01:38:14.654 --> 01:38:16.656 position:30% line:89% align:start
go on forever.

01:38:19.726 --> 01:38:22.394 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Would you mind doing the rest?

01:38:22.428 --> 01:38:24.731 position:19% line:89% align:start
I just can't seem to.

01:38:24.764 --> 01:38:28.134 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] You love these books, I
can't imagine you without them.

01:38:38.945 --> 01:38:40.113 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Before the Maelstrom,

01:38:40.146 --> 01:38:42.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
they used to burn
the dead like this.

01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:44.583 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was called cremation.

01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.688 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
They had a custom.

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:50.857 position:13% line:83% align:start
They would place someone's
cherished possessions

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:53.793 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the coffin to be
burned with them.

01:39:01.835 --> 01:39:05.805 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
This is my cremation.

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:08.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
My books are the
source of my power,

01:39:08.474 --> 01:39:10.576 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I'm taking them with me.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.955 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Everything they've built,

01:39:21.988 --> 01:39:25.058 position:16% line:83% align:start
That they are so certain
will last forever,

01:39:25.091 --> 01:39:28.061 position:24% line:89% align:start
I want to destroy.

01:39:28.094 --> 01:39:30.629 position:16% line:83% align:start
They think this perfect
moment in human history

01:39:30.663 --> 01:39:33.832 position:24% line:89% align:start
is frozen in time.

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:38.437 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want to hit them where it
hurts, and shatter that moment.

01:39:48.614 --> 01:39:49.983 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
As long as the world turns,

01:39:50.016 --> 01:39:53.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
society will continue
to evolve, to change.

01:39:53.219 --> 01:39:54.988 position:7% line:89% align:start
Previously acceptable concepts

01:39:55.021 --> 01:39:57.790 position:27% line:83% align:start
become repugnant
and are disregarded.

01:39:57.823 --> 01:39:59.491 position:19% line:83% align:start
Who's to say we won't
outgrow the need

01:39:59.525 --> 01:40:01.127 position:13% line:89% align:start
for consciousness as well?

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:04.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why mustn't we tamper
with free will?

01:40:04.797 --> 01:40:05.731 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why am I fighting it?

01:40:05.764 --> 01:40:08.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where is it written that
I must have a soul?

01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:28.121 position:7% line:83% align:start
Guess I'm on my own from here.
Wait for me, I'll be back.

01:40:32.158 --> 01:40:34.626 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
All right, Miach, I'm here.

01:41:36.188 --> 01:41:38.690 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
It's been a long time, Tuan.

01:41:38.724 --> 01:41:40.759 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thirteen years.

01:41:43.896 --> 01:41:46.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] Put the gun
down, you don't need it.

01:41:46.765 --> 01:41:50.202 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're the only ones
here, just you and me.

01:41:55.174 --> 01:41:58.177 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
I knew it, I knew you'd come.

01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:01.914 position:7% line:83% align:start
And, I knew you'd come alone,
even if I hadn't asked you to.

01:42:14.893 --> 01:42:15.894 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:42:25.804 --> 01:42:27.940 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Over here, Tuan!

01:42:27.973 --> 01:42:29.141 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TUAN gasps]

01:42:43.388 --> 01:42:45.858 position:30% line:83% align:start
You grew your
hair out like mine.

01:42:45.891 --> 01:42:47.392 position:30% line:89% align:start
It suits you.

01:42:53.332 --> 01:42:57.302 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry about your father.

01:42:57.336 --> 01:42:58.303 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's all you got?

01:42:58.337 --> 01:43:01.039 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're not gonna tell me
it couldn't be helped?

01:43:01.073 --> 01:43:04.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
Right, his death...
couldn't be helped.

01:43:16.421 --> 01:43:19.391 position:21% line:83% align:start
Liar. There's always
another way.

01:43:19.424 --> 01:43:22.727 position:7% line:89% align:start
My father didn't have to die.

01:43:22.761 --> 01:43:24.329 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
True.

01:43:24.363 --> 01:43:27.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] Then, why?
The suicides, the murders.

01:43:27.366 --> 01:43:29.201 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's the point
of this violence?

01:43:29.234 --> 01:43:30.169 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
We had to.

01:43:30.202 --> 01:43:31.702 position:7% line:89% align:start
If we didn't, those geezers in

01:43:31.736 --> 01:43:34.439 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Next-Gen Group were
never gonna push the button.

01:43:35.974 --> 01:43:38.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
We had to make sure
they were terrified,

01:43:38.076 --> 01:43:40.745 position:16% line:83% align:start
otherwise they wouldn't
activate the program.

01:43:42.381 --> 01:43:47.953 position:16% line:83% align:start
This time, I'm going all
the way. No turning back.

01:43:51.156 --> 01:43:54.059 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] We will create
a brave new world.

01:43:54.092 --> 01:43:55.726 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
What does that mean?

01:43:57.229 --> 01:44:00.098 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] Tuan, I don't
know if you're aware,

01:44:00.132 --> 01:44:02.800 position:30% line:83% align:start
but I was born
without a consciousness.

01:44:08.106 --> 01:44:12.144 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
I am, my father told me.

01:44:12.177 --> 01:44:13.345 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh.

01:44:16.315 --> 01:44:18.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] The Russian army
used this building as

01:44:18.183 --> 01:44:21.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
a base of operations for
their prostitution ring.

01:44:21.786 --> 01:44:24.256 position:10% line:83% align:start
They would kidnap women and
girls fleeing from the horrors

01:44:24.289 --> 01:44:29.027 position:16% line:83% align:start
of war, bring them here,
and rape them every single day.

01:44:29.061 --> 01:44:32.464 position:27% line:83% align:start
One of the girls
they stole, was me.

01:44:32.497 --> 01:44:35.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was only eight-years-old,
and I didn't have the ability

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.238 position:27% line:83% align:start
to feel pain and
fear like I do now.

01:44:39.271 --> 01:44:42.407 position:7% line:83% align:start
There was an officer who took
a particular interest in me.

01:44:42.441 --> 01:44:46.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
His prized possession
was an antique Tokarev.

01:44:46.178 --> 01:44:51.015 position:10% line:83% align:start
He would make me stroke the
gun while he penetrated me.

01:44:51.048 --> 01:44:55.853 position:13% line:83% align:start
"This is a gun," he'd say.
"This is steel. This is power."

01:44:55.886 --> 01:44:57.788 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then he'd shove
the barrel down my throat

01:44:57.822 --> 01:44:59.957 position:10% line:89% align:start
and force me to suck on it.

01:45:01.959 --> 01:45:06.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] Over and over
and over, he did this.

01:45:10.502 --> 01:45:12.136 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Until one day,

01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:14.406 position:21% line:83% align:start
with his hard flesh
inside my body,

01:45:14.439 --> 01:45:19.210 position:10% line:83% align:start
and his cold steel inside my
mouth, covered in my saliva,

01:45:19.244 --> 01:45:21.979 position:13% line:89% align:start
My consciousness awakened.

01:45:26.083 --> 01:45:29.253 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] Look at the concrete
floor beneath your feet.

01:45:29.288 --> 01:45:35.026 position:7% line:83% align:start
It is permanently stained with
blood, sweat, tears, piss,

01:45:35.059 --> 01:45:38.829 position:7% line:89% align:start
and semen. All mixed together.

01:45:38.863 --> 01:45:40.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
That liquid of evil and despair,

01:45:40.465 --> 01:45:44.436 position:13% line:83% align:start
became the amniotic fluid
from which I was reborn.

01:45:44.469 --> 01:45:49.840 position:16% line:83% align:start
Enough, Miach. Stop it,
I've heard enough.

01:45:49.874 --> 01:45:51.576 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please, no more.

01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:02.521 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Here in Chechnya,

01:46:02.554 --> 01:46:07.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
I learned the true evil of man.
The true cruelty of man.

01:46:07.291 --> 01:46:10.161 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, in its own way,
Japan was worse.

01:46:10.194 --> 01:46:13.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
They kill you with
kindness, not cruelty.

01:46:13.197 --> 01:46:16.468 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just another type of hell.

01:46:16.501 --> 01:46:19.003 position:16% line:83% align:start
When I was 12 years old,
a boy from my neighborhood

01:46:19.036 --> 01:46:22.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
committed suicide
by hanging himself.

01:46:22.306 --> 01:46:24.509 position:10% line:89% align:start
He said he hated this world.

01:46:24.543 --> 01:46:27.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
He said he always knew
he didn't belong here.

01:46:27.679 --> 01:46:30.314 position:24% line:89% align:start
And then, he died.

01:46:30.348 --> 01:46:31.516 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sobs]

01:46:37.922 --> 01:46:39.090 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:46:40.659 --> 01:46:43.327 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] You remember what
that felt like, Tuan.

01:46:43.361 --> 01:46:45.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were once young,
and frustrated.

01:46:45.664 --> 01:46:49.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
Rejecting this world and what
it wanted to make you become.

01:46:57.508 --> 01:47:01.479 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps] I do...

01:47:01.512 --> 01:47:04.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
...but, I still don't understand
why you're doing this, Miach.

01:47:04.482 --> 01:47:08.419 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is it because you hate
the world that much?

01:47:08.452 --> 01:47:10.287 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, Tuan, I used to hate it,

01:47:10.321 --> 01:47:13.224 position:24% line:83% align:start
but now, I love it
with all my heart.

01:47:13.257 --> 01:47:15.526 position:19% line:83% align:start
This world's infected
with "me's" and "I's".

01:47:15.559 --> 01:47:18.396 position:16% line:83% align:start
Souls who don't fit in,
tortured by self-consciousness.

01:47:18.429 --> 01:47:21.966 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want to save them, I want
to give them perfect harmony!

01:47:27.438 --> 01:47:30.374 position:10% line:83% align:start
People are dying. They take
their lives every day because

01:47:30.408 --> 01:47:33.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
they can't cope with the world,
only those who adapt survive.

01:47:33.677 --> 01:47:36.414 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's human nature.

01:47:36.447 --> 01:47:38.082 position:24% line:83% align:start
And since we can't
change our nature,

01:47:38.115 --> 01:47:40.518 position:13% line:89% align:start
we must stop being human.

01:47:40.551 --> 01:47:42.186 position:27% line:89% align:start
And become what?

01:47:42.219 --> 01:47:45.122 position:10% line:89% align:start
Living beings without souls?

01:47:45.156 --> 01:47:46.323 position:38% line:89% align:start
Exactly.

01:47:46.357 --> 01:47:48.325 position:10% line:83% align:start
Though, the thought of that
scared some of the old folks

01:47:48.359 --> 01:47:50.561 position:19% line:83% align:start
at the Next-Gen group,
including your father.

01:47:50.594 --> 01:47:53.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
They felt a person's
soul is their life.

01:47:54.265 --> 01:47:57.034 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, they were all against it.

01:47:57.067 --> 01:47:58.636 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

01:47:58.669 --> 01:48:01.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't blame them.
What about the people

01:48:01.272 --> 01:48:04.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
who are happy with the
world the way it is?

01:48:04.675 --> 01:48:07.578 position:24% line:89% align:start
People like Cian.

01:48:07.611 --> 01:48:09.180 position:16% line:89% align:start
You think she was happy?

01:48:09.213 --> 01:48:10.714 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you certain?

01:48:13.551 --> 01:48:15.319 position:19% line:89% align:start
What about you, Tuan?

01:48:15.352 --> 01:48:19.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you happy? Do you want this
world to stay the way it is?

01:48:19.723 --> 01:48:22.426 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:24.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] Human beings are
still animals at heart.

01:48:24.695 --> 01:48:25.529 position:21% line:89% align:start
Beneath the surface,

01:48:25.563 --> 01:48:28.499 position:24% line:83% align:start
we are savage and
primal creatures.

01:48:28.532 --> 01:48:29.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
But, we can change.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.470 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can evolve beyond the
emotion and irrationality

01:48:32.503 --> 01:48:36.440 position:7% line:83% align:start
our brains are hardwired for.
We can stop self-regulating.

01:48:36.474 --> 01:48:38.542 position:21% line:83% align:start
We already have the
software for it.

01:48:38.576 --> 01:48:40.009 position:16% line:89% align:start
Humanity has outsourced

01:48:40.044 --> 01:48:42.112 position:21% line:83% align:start
everything else that
makes us human.

01:48:42.146 --> 01:48:45.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, why do we even need
a consciousness anymore?

01:48:45.349 --> 01:48:47.518 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MIACH laughs]
With the world teetering

01:48:47.551 --> 01:48:50.488 position:10% line:83% align:start
on the brink of destruction,
the elders will have no choice

01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:54.091 position:10% line:83% align:start
but to activate the Harmony
Program! It'll be perfect!

01:48:54.124 --> 01:48:56.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just like the world I once knew!

01:48:56.227 --> 01:49:00.097 position:13% line:83% align:start
A world without suffering.
A world without uncertainty!

01:49:00.130 --> 01:49:12.108 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

01:49:24.555 --> 01:49:29.226 position:16% line:83% align:start
Miach, you never change.
It's comforting in a way.

01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:31.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
Still smart, self-righteous,

01:49:31.729 --> 01:49:33.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still trying to push
the world away.

01:49:33.764 --> 01:49:37.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
And yet you don't
wanna be alone.

01:49:37.401 --> 01:49:39.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
This isn't about
making a better world.

01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:40.738 position:16% line:89% align:start
You just wanna go home.

01:49:40.771 --> 01:49:43.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the life you had
before consciousness.

01:49:43.674 --> 01:49:47.444 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MIACH sighs]

01:49:47.478 --> 01:49:52.248 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TUAN] So, has the real reason
I came here occurred to you yet?

01:49:52.282 --> 01:49:54.718 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or are you blinded
by what you want?

01:49:57.755 --> 01:50:00.089 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you envisioning utopia?

01:50:00.123 --> 01:50:03.427 position:7% line:83% align:start
A world without individuality
or free will? Really,

01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:06.530 position:19% line:83% align:start
is that the heaven you
think everyone would want?

01:50:06.564 --> 01:50:10.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come with me. Let's go
to harmony together.

01:50:12.168 --> 01:50:13.336 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Hm.

01:50:25.583 --> 01:50:29.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

01:50:29.352 --> 01:50:32.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wherever you lead me,
I will always follow.

01:50:32.523 --> 01:50:35.124 position:13% line:89% align:start
Even to the gates of hell.

01:50:35.158 --> 01:50:37.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you want the world
to have harmony,

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.330 position:27% line:83% align:start
then I won't do
anything to stop it.

01:50:40.363 --> 01:50:44.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll let it become
a reality. [sobs]

01:50:46.402 --> 01:50:49.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
But, I can't allow you
to be a part of it.

01:50:49.873 --> 01:50:53.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, you have to
stay the Miach I loved!

01:51:03.486 --> 01:51:05.689 position:24% line:89% align:start
I love you, Miach.

01:51:07.825 --> 01:51:10.193 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gunshot]

01:52:41.584 --> 01:52:43.419 position:21% line:89% align:start
[TUAN, CIAN giggle]

01:52:43.453 --> 01:52:44.921 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
Ever seen a business card?

01:52:44.954 --> 01:52:47.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
People used to use these
to share information.

01:52:47.657 --> 01:52:49.992 position:24% line:83% align:start
But, only with who
they wanted to.

01:52:50.027 --> 01:52:51.260 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN
It's so cute!

01:52:51.294 --> 01:52:52.995 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIAN]
I like it!

01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:54.330 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIACH]
I thought you would.

01:52:54.363 --> 01:52:55.898 position:16% line:89% align:start
Take a look at the back.

01:52:55.932 --> 01:52:58.468 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CIAN] What's this picture?
Did you draw it, Miach?

01:52:58.501 --> 01:53:01.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] It's a symbol I
designed, our logo.

01:53:01.604 --> 01:53:02.538 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TUAN]
Ours?

01:53:02.572 --> 01:53:05.641 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIACH] Yeah, It stands
for the three of us.

01:53:05.675 --> 01:53:09.512 position:24% line:89% align:start
Cian, me, and you.

01:53:09.545 --> 01:53:10.713 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TUAN gasps]

01:53:10.747 --> 01:53:13.516 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ALL giggle]
