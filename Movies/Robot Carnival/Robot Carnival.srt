00:44:13,454 --> 00:44:16,204
(spoon rattling)

348
00:44:18,774 --> 00:44:21,357
(man slurping)

349
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:23,703
- Good soup.

350
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:29,796
(silverware rattling over
expressive piano music)

351
00:44:33,163 --> 00:44:35,287
But you usually serve it piping hot,

352
00:44:35,287 --> 00:44:38,397
and this time, it's almost cold, curious!

353
00:44:38,397 --> 00:44:42,730
(expressive and somber piano music)

354
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:49,490
(footsteps pattering)

355
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,840
- Mother, I'm leaving now.

356
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,636
After class, I'll come right home.

357
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:56,145
(footsteps pattering)

358
00:44:56,145 --> 00:44:56,978
- Ta-ta!

359
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,140
(car buzzing)

360
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,870
Ever since my wife got a promotion,

361
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,550
she's always on the go.

362
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,220
She's what you might
call a true career woman.

363
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,830
I almost envy her.

364
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,440
Well, no, it's not that I'm jealous,

365
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,970
but she's an aggressive business woman

366
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,929
and generally more meticulous
than her male coworkers.

367
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:17,000
(car humming)

368
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,230
They accuse her of being un-ladylike,

369
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,510
but that's only because
she's so self-assured.

370
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,193
Men aren't used to that, I
suppose it makes them insecure.

371
00:45:25,193 --> 00:45:27,693
(dog barking)

372
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:33,273
(children laughing)

373
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:36,940
- [Shepherd] Thanks!

374
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,350
- My colleagues think
that I let our situation

375
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,101
get out of hand, that I'm
a bit too pro-feminist.

376
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:45,684
(cars buzzing)

377
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,200
(water bubbling)

378
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,220
Well, just because my
consciousness about women

379
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,620
has been raised higher than theirs

380
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,247
doesn't mean I haven't
got a mind of my own.

381
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:07,997
(birds chirping)

382
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:23,604
(arm snapping)

383
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:24,437
(water splashing)

384
00:46:24,437 --> 00:46:25,644
(chuckles) Right.

385
00:46:25,644 --> 00:46:29,204
(birds chirping)

386
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,454
(bot buzzing)

387
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,213
- [Robotic Voice] Break time terminated.

388
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:34,100
- Hey, don't sneak up on me like that!

389
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,780
- [Robotic Voice] Absent from
workstation, explanation?

390
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,010
- None.

391
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,250
- [Robotic Voice] Return to workstation.

392
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,782
- Yes, right then, I hear you!

393
00:46:41,782 --> 00:46:43,321
(footsteps clacking)

394
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:46,211
(bot buzzing)

395
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:48,081
(birds chirping)

396
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:51,310
(footsteps crunching)

397
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:55,150
I have a secret, I suppose
you could call it a project,

398
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,449
something I've been working on for years.

399
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:01,782
(expressive and somber piano music)

400
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,020
(door creaking)

401
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,353
(expressive and somber piano music)

402
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,343
Of course, my family
knows nothing about it.

403
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,273
(footsteps clacking)

404
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,322
I suppose I could trace it all
the way back to my childhood.

405
00:47:56,322 --> 00:48:00,655
(expressive and somber piano music)

406
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:13,671
(footsteps clacking)

407
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:16,504
(tools crunching)

408
00:48:21,082 --> 00:48:25,415
(expressive and somber piano music)

409
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:30,010
(man sighs)

410
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,600
I never knew my mother,
never experienced the warmth

411
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,350
of parental love and understanding.

412
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,570
Ever since I can remember,

413
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,590
I've longed to be happily married

414
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,390
and to raise a family of my own,

415
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,605
and in that way, to know
what it is to be loved.

416
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:49,605
(rain pattering over expressive
and somber piano music)

417
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,460
But now, I know that it wasn't
really marriage I longed for,

418
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,563
but something more
basic, more fundamental.

419
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:09,970
(footsteps clacking)

420
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,760
- [Man] We're on our way to the club.

421
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,853
- [Man] You go ahead.

422
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:14,030
(footsteps pattering)

423
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,010
(water splashing)

424
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,240
- [Man] See you later then,
we'll save you a seat!

425
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,765
- Yes, you do that!

426
00:49:18,765 --> 00:49:21,954
(footsteps pattering)

427
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:24,704
(birds chirping)

428
00:49:37,045 --> 00:49:40,128
(footsteps clacking)

429
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:52,021
(clock ticking)

430
00:50:05,674 --> 00:50:10,674
- [Girl] (giggles) When are
you going to give me a name?

431
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,805
- [Man] Meow, meow, meow!

432
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:16,043
- (laughs) Hmm.

433
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:23,270
I'm not a pet!
(man gasps)

434
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,804
- [Man] Of course not, you're a machine.

435
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:30,190
(clock ticking)

436
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,740
- You see, I want someone to love me,

437
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,018
and for that, I need a name.

438
00:50:35,018 --> 00:50:36,960
- What, why did you say that?

439
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,270
How could you say that?

440
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,911
I never programmed you to say those words.

441
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:43,578
(clock ticking)

442
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,031
- You must be very lonely.

443
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:50,630
- (scoffs) Psychoanalyzed
by a machine, what next?

444
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,390
Just out of curiosity, what
led you to that conclusion?

445
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,210
- [Girl] Your voice
tells me that you, too,

446
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:58,713
are new to this world,
that we are both children.

447
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,410
- You heard all that in my voice, did you?

448
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,313
Amazing!
(clock ticking)

449
00:51:05,794 --> 00:51:08,544
(metal rattling)

450
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,922
(footsteps pattering)

451
00:51:12,922 --> 00:51:16,605
(clock ticking over somber piano)

452
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:21,175
(man gasps over shattering glass)

453
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:24,275
- Make me feel that I'm alive.

454
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:27,413
Talk to me, respond to my existence!

455
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:33,166
(toy buzzing over somber piano music)

456
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,973
For what purpose do I exist?

457
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,403
To be alone is to be in pain.

458
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,290
- [Man] A machine feels no pain,

459
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,197
a machine can't feel at all!

460
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,626
You'll never know the sensual
pleasure of a fine meal

461
00:51:56,626 --> 00:51:59,626
or possess a real identity of your own.

462
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:01,970
(toy buzzing)

463
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:02,870
- You believe that you know

464
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,333
your own desires and
dreams better than anyone.

465
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,010
Why shouldn't I believe the same thing?

466
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,964
You didn't create yourself
any more than I did.

467
00:52:11,964 --> 00:52:14,450
(toy buzzing)

468
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,123
I want to experience life,

469
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,763
the excitement of living for myself!

470
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:25,975
Such a strange look, I don't
understand what it means.

471
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:30,308
(expressive and somber piano music)

472
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,237
(toy rattling)

473
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:40,508
(screws tinging on floor)

474
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:44,425
(footsteps pattering on floor)

475
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:49,457
(expressive and somber piano music)

476
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,498
(man gasps)

477
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:52,850
(toy tinging on floor)

478
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,517
(toys rattling)

479
00:52:57,162 --> 00:53:00,079
(glass shattering)

480
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,184
(dress rustling)

481
00:53:03,184 --> 00:53:04,435
(footsteps clacking)

482
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:07,185
(trunk thudding)

483
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:12,033
(glass tinging)

484
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,924
(man gasping desperately)

485
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:37,979
(expressive and somber piano music)

486
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:51,404
(man gasping)

487
00:53:55,086 --> 00:53:58,174
(wrench rattling)

488
00:53:58,174 --> 00:53:59,995
(pulsing electronic effects)

489
00:53:59,995 --> 00:54:03,024
(expressive and somber piano music)

490
00:54:03,024 --> 00:54:08,024
(toys rattling over expressive
and somber piano music)

491
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:29,294
(birds chirping over expressive
and somber piano music)

492
00:54:38,534 --> 00:54:41,701
(distant car buzzing)

493
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,074
(birds chirping)

494
00:54:51,857 --> 00:54:53,690
(door rattling)

495
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,138
(girl gasping)

496
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:56,652
- [Man] Leaving so soon?

497
00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:59,673
- Afraid so, but we'll be
back again soon, Father.

498
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,343
Now you be nice to Mother.

499
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
Darling, come say goodbye to Grandpa.

500
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,990
(birds chirping)

501
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,743
- Goodbye, Grandpa.

502
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,467
Next time, you must make me a toy!

503
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:18,263
- Only if you promise to take
good care of your mother, hmm?

504
00:55:18,263 --> 00:55:19,096
- Kay!

505
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:22,263
(footsteps pattering)

506
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:24,995
Goodbye!

507
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:28,744
(birds chirping)

508
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:36,206
(toy rattling)

509
00:55:43,922 --> 00:55:47,672
(distant whistle screeching)

510
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,483
(toy rattling)

511
00:56:06,524 --> 00:56:10,274
(distant whistle screeching)

512
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:14,823
(birds chirping)

513
00:56:22,274 --> 00:56:26,607
(expressive and somber piano music)

514
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:32,034
(toy rattling)

515
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:36,367
(expressive and somber piano music)

516
00:57:04,913 --> 00:57:07,996
(explosion rumbling)

517
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,780
- [Girl] I'm still waiting for my prince

518
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,413
to rescue me from my solitude.

519
00:57:16,924 --> 00:57:18,495
(liquid bubbling)

520
00:57:18,495 --> 00:57:21,662
(explosions rumbling)

521
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:26,621
(somber piano music)

522
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:33,682
(liquid bubbling over somber piano music)

523
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,898
(knees thudding to ground)

524
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:47,648
(metal jingling)

525
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:51,158
(face clanging to ground)

526
00:57:51,158 --> 00:57:54,575
(expressive piano music)

527
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,080
- [Man] I was never strong enough

528
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,013
to be your knight in shining armor.

529
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,270
Forgive me.

530
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,687
(expressive piano music)

531
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:27,675
(door creaking)

532
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:30,758
(footsteps clacking)

533
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:41,806
(wind howling over expressive piano music)

534
00:59:23,243 --> 00:59:25,527
(tear clacking)

535
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:30,444
(wind howling over expressive piano music)

536
01:00:13,473 --> 01:00:17,373
- Sweetheart, the wind
is starting to pick up.

537
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,983
Why don't you come in now, Dear.

538
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,059
(window rattling)

539
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:25,642
(wind howling)

540
01:00:35,637 --> 01:00:38,220
(toy rattling)

541
01:00:39,874 --> 01:00:42,457
(wind howling)

542
01:01:04,154 --> 01:01:08,821
(expressive electronic music and piano)

543
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,927
Come, Dear, don't be difficult.

544
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:20,927
If you stay outside any longer,
you'll catch your death!

545
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:22,208
Darling?

546
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:25,375
(hopeful piano music)

547
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:27,559
Sweetheart?

548
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,070
(woman gasps)

549
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,237
(hopeful piano music)

550
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,298
(woman gasping)

551
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:41,465
(flowing and hopeful piano music)

552
01:01:45,342 --> 01:01:48,216
(toy rattling)

553
01:01:48,216 --> 01:01:52,383
(flowing and hopeful piano music)

554
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:06,803
(toy rattling over hopeful piano music)

555
01:02:14,827 --> 01:02:17,577
(metal clanging)

556
01:02:31,907 --> 01:02:34,409
(townspeople screaming)

557
01:02:34,409 --> 01:02:35,537
- Out of my way!

558
01:02:35,537 --> 01:02:39,954
(townspeople shouting and screaming)

559
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:45,650
Of all the nerve!

560
01:02:47,618 --> 01:02:51,701
(building cracking and rumbling)

561
01:02:53,287 --> 01:02:58,204
(rhythmic and percussive electronic music)

562
01:03:07,906 --> 01:03:11,161
(Jonathan cackling maniacally)

563
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:12,744
- Destroy, destroy!

564
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,970
Let this heathen's haven be
smashed to pieces (cackles)!

565
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:23,070
Their fate is in our hands,
my beautiful Automoton!

566
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,910
My walking doll, my Tinkerbelle (cackles)!

567
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,493
Let's go get 'em (cackles)!

568
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:34,332
Nothing is impossible
for a genius like me!

569
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:38,082
(wood cracking and rumbling)

570
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:44,090
This avaricious, greedy nation, Japan,

571
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,422
will soon be under my control!

572
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,887
A millennium of glory is at hand (laughs)!

573
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,444
A vast expanse of gold as
far as the eye can see!

574
01:03:55,444 --> 01:03:57,503
Where shall I strike next?

575
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,520
- Enough's enough, that's it!

576
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,780
The time has come to defend our honor!

577
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,613
Yaori, you ready?

578
01:04:03,613 --> 01:04:04,760
- Sure, but I don't think this machine

579
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,420
was built to defend anyone's honor.

580
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,930
- She's right, this machine
was built for the parade.

581
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:11,080
- [Kichi] That's our point, you nitwit!

582
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,442
Chubby, start shoveling that coal!

583
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:14,840
- You got it!

584
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,620
- [Kichi] Denjiro, all set down there?

585
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,020
- I'm set.

586
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,020
- Right, attack!

587
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,055
Forward!

588
01:04:21,055 --> 01:04:23,805
(robot rumbling)

589
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,593
(rousing percussion music)

590
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:39,226
- What?

591
01:04:39,226 --> 01:04:43,180
(rousing percussion music)

592
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,013
- Whoever you are,

593
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,040
you're messin' around with
the wrong bunch, mister!

594
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,453
You've had it, understand?

595
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,710
How dare you disturb the
peace and tranquility

596
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:53,170
of this special day when
our entire community

597
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:56,940
is preparing to celebrate the
opening of the new harbor!

598
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:59,550
This steam-driven behemoth
is under my command,

599
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:02,153
and I will use it to drive you
and your bloated monstrosity

600
01:05:02,153 --> 01:05:04,420
back to wherever you came from!

601
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,620
Prepare to be destroyed!

602
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,049
Engage the enemy!

603
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:11,800
(whistle screeching)

604
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,809
Now Denjiro, right leg up!

605
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,441
- Okay.

606
01:05:15,441 --> 01:05:17,901
(wood rattling and rumbling)

607
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:19,301
(kick thwacking)

608
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,060
(house rumbling and cracking)

609
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,730
Aw, you jackass!

610
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:24,940
We can't fight the enemy with sawdust!

611
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,733
Take it easy.
(footstep rumbling)

612
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:29,653
- [Villager] What the hell is happening?

613
01:05:29,653 --> 01:05:31,750
(buildings rumbling)

614
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:35,340
- (growls) This is unforgivable!

615
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,620
Do you think that you
can move and maneuver

616
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,950
in the same way as my own machine,

617
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:42,270
a device which was created by me,

618
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:45,020
the world's greatest genius, do you?

619
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,904
Come on, get out of the way!

620
01:05:46,904 --> 01:05:51,606
(growls) I'll show you, you dilettante!

621
01:05:51,606 --> 01:05:52,840
- [Denjiro] Hey, Kichi,

622
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,970
somebody just came out of that thing!

623
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,983
- What, hold it right there, Denjiro!

624
01:05:57,983 --> 01:06:01,170
Hmm, let's see now, where is he?

625
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,266
Where is he?

626
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:04,770
(gasps) I see him, I see him!

627
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,304
Oh my gosh (gulps)!

628
01:06:06,304 --> 01:06:08,810
Toki, there's a foreigner,
what do we do now?

629
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:10,899
- [Toki] I say we see what he's up to.

630
01:06:10,899 --> 01:06:14,950
- Hear this, I am the world's
most brilliant scientist,

631
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:16,877
Jonathan Jamison Volkeson III!

632
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,140
No doubt, the world's greatest genius!

633
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,540
I will not allow the course

634
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,400
chartered by my fearless intellect

635
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,220
to be changed by anyone, including you!

636
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,030
If you do not retreat at once,

637
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,410
I warn you, you will be annihilated.

638
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:33,210
I'll give you, let's see now, um,

639
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:36,283
ah, just three seconds more.

640
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:38,920
Three, two, one.

641
01:06:40,493 --> 01:06:43,560
What a terribly unfortunate situation!

642
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,185
I pray that your souls may rest with God,

643
01:06:46,185 --> 01:06:48,690
but time's up, I'm afraid!

644
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:49,632
- [Kichi] What a predicament!

645
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:50,724
What's he saying, Toki?

646
01:06:50,724 --> 01:06:53,130
- Whoa, foreign language is
hard enough to translate,

647
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:56,433
but English through a
megaphone is impossible!

648
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:59,266
(cannon rumbling)

649
01:07:01,072 --> 01:07:01,964
(explosion rumbling)

650
01:07:01,964 --> 01:07:03,558
- (gasps) Oh!

651
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:04,896
(Denjiro gasping)

652
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:07,308
- [Kichi] Chubby, they're
firing, they're shooting at us!

653
01:07:07,308 --> 01:07:09,200
Get up here on the double!

654
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:13,120
(crank rattling)

655
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,240
- Domination angle, 12 degrees.

656
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,803
Wind speed, three knots.

657
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:19,712
Fire!

658
01:07:19,712 --> 01:07:22,253
(cannon rumbling)

659
01:07:22,253 --> 01:07:23,130
(Yaori gasps)

660
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,674
(explosion rumbling)

661
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,600
- What's going on here?

662
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,604
- The bastard hit us, that's what!

663
01:07:29,604 --> 01:07:31,468
- Just what the hell is going on here?

664
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:33,127
- I just answered that question!

665
01:07:33,127 --> 01:07:34,397
- Excuse me!

666
01:07:34,397 --> 01:07:36,355
(rousing electronic music)

667
01:07:36,355 --> 01:07:38,889
- Yo, Kichi, here I am, boss.

668
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:39,722
(wood cracking)

669
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,707
(gasps) That's for launching
fireworks, that's no good!

670
01:07:42,707 --> 01:07:45,387
- Wrong, it's our secret weapon.

671
01:07:45,387 --> 01:07:49,279
(Jonathan chuckling over rustling brush)

672
01:07:49,279 --> 01:07:51,627
Right, you ready?
(Chubby grunts)

673
01:07:51,627 --> 01:07:53,187
- We show him!
(fuse hissing)

674
01:07:53,187 --> 01:07:54,528
(cannon rumbling)

675
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,628
(fireworks screeching)

676
01:07:56,628 --> 01:07:59,885
(explosion rumbling and popping)

677
01:07:59,885 --> 01:08:01,161
(both cheering)

678
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:03,157
- Huh, what the?

679
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:04,900
- [Chubby] Look at that,
it's still standing!

680
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
What's it made of?

681
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,734
- [Kichi] That thing's
wow, well-built indeed!

682
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:08,962
(cannon rumbling)

683
01:08:08,962 --> 01:08:10,801
(cannonball screeching)

684
01:08:10,801 --> 01:08:13,178
(explosion rumbling)

685
01:08:13,178 --> 01:08:16,153
- I'm not into the all dying one, ah well!

686
01:08:16,153 --> 01:08:18,440
- So what do we do now, boss?

687
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,763
- We have no choice, we
keep on firing at him!

688
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,358
- That just might kill him, you know!

689
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:24,690
- (growls) You're gonna do
it, do you understand me?

690
01:08:25,678 --> 01:08:28,183
Ready, aim,
(fuse hissing)

691
01:08:28,183 --> 01:08:29,681
fire!
(cannon rumbling)

692
01:08:29,681 --> 01:08:32,764
(explosion rumbling)

693
01:08:33,732 --> 01:08:37,503
- (cackles) Their puny
little weapons can't hurt us,

694
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,836
can they, my pretty one (laughing)?

695
01:08:42,738 --> 01:08:45,796
Huh?
(pounding timpani accents)

696
01:08:45,796 --> 01:08:49,963
(explosions popping and rumbling)

697
01:08:53,022 --> 01:08:56,540
(coughing) I won't allow it!

698
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,517
This can't be happening (coughs)!

699
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,010
- All right!
- Yes!

700
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,770
- Hey, boss, you really
clobbered that guy!

701
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,220
- Ha, that's nothing.

702
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,420
This next shot'll turn
that clown into dust!

703
01:09:07,722 --> 01:09:09,190
(robot cracking and rumbling)

704
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:13,185
- Now you'll learn the true
power of my incredible genius!

705
01:09:13,185 --> 01:09:15,175
- Hold on, what do you think you're doing?

706
01:09:15,175 --> 01:09:16,140
- (groans) What's wrong?

707
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,680
- All you've done so far is destroy

708
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,490
half the buildings in the neighborhood!

709
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,190
- Oh, is that so?

710
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,333
Listen, pig slop!
- You egotistical gloryhound!

711
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,630
- [Toki] Excuse me!
(Kichi growling)

712
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,530
- I'm busy now!

713
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:28,510
- Ha, would you listen to Mister It, you--

714
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:30,552
- I've had just about enough of this!

715
01:09:30,552 --> 01:09:32,179
(gears rattling)

716
01:09:32,179 --> 01:09:35,293
- It appears that last
volley affected our mobility!

717
01:09:35,293 --> 01:09:36,170
- [Kichi] Save it for later.

718
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,978
I told you I'm busy!

719
01:09:37,978 --> 01:09:40,020
- (groans) You never listen!

720
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,720
Why don't you shut that big mouth of yours

721
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,910
for once and learn something?

722
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,879
- [Kichi] Ha, from you,
don't make me laugh!

723
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:46,880
- Your head should be stuffed and shown

724
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,430
in a museum somewhere so
that everyone will know

725
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,640
what a real pea-brained
idiot looks like, so there!

726
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,370
- [Kichi] And if they had an ugly museum,

727
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:55,730
you'd be the prime exhibit!

728
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,563
Why you, I oughta!
(Yaori blows a raspberry)

729
01:09:56,563 --> 01:09:59,010
- Sheez, they're really
going at it this time!

730
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:00,494
I gotta break this up.

731
01:10:00,494 --> 01:10:03,244
(gears rattling)

732
01:10:05,174 --> 01:10:06,970
(footsteps clacking)

733
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,882
Stop arguing!

734
01:10:08,882 --> 01:10:10,140
- Ya!

735
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,405
- On the other hand, if
you wanna argue, you can--

736
01:10:12,405 --> 01:10:13,523
(shoe thwacking)

737
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:17,993
(robot rumbling and creaking)

738
01:10:17,993 --> 01:10:18,826
- What?

739
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:21,510
I don't believe it!

740
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:24,240
All of the batteries have gone dead!

741
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,930
- Excuse me, Kichi,
but can we go home now?

742
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:26,820
We're out of coal.

743
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,640
- [Kichi] So, rip out
anything made of wood

744
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,298
and use that instead!

745
01:10:30,298 --> 01:10:33,298
(Jonathan groaning)

746
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:36,080
(wood cracking)

747
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,663
(rousing orchestral music)

748
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:43,970
(footstep rumbling)

749
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:47,553
(rousing orchestral music)

750
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:50,958
- I'll never give up, not ever!

751
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,047
- I'll never give up (groans)!

752
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,490
(Jonathan groaning)

753
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:01,869
- Now you will see the power
of my genius unleashed!

754
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:04,560
(robot groaning and creaking)

755
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,393
- [Kichi] Right arm forward!

756
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:07,029
- Oh, right!

757
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:10,347
(gears clanking)

758
01:11:10,347 --> 01:11:12,787
(arms rumbling)

759
01:11:12,787 --> 01:11:13,620
- We've got him now!

760
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,931
Yaori, move the left arm forward!

761
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:17,331
- At once.
- Good!

762
01:11:17,331 --> 01:11:18,434
- [Yaori] Emperor Kichi.

763
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:20,512
- Huh, what did she mean by that?

764
01:11:20,512 --> 01:11:23,847
(wood creaking)

765
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,290
- A-ha, I think I got him!

766
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,123
- [Kichi] Don't let go!

767
01:11:26,123 --> 01:11:27,600
Hang on, Toki, hang on!

768
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,670
- Whatever you say!

769
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,766
- [Kichi] Hold on, it's
gonna be a rough ride!

770
01:11:30,766 --> 01:11:32,027
(Chubby gasping)

771
01:11:32,027 --> 01:11:33,106
Ready, Denjiro?

772
01:11:33,106 --> 01:11:34,490
- Any time you are.

773
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,246
- Now left leg back, Denjiro.

774
01:11:36,246 --> 01:11:37,857
(gears clanking)

775
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:41,774
(wood shuddering and creaking)

776
01:11:43,543 --> 01:11:46,662
Banzai!
(wood creaking)

777
01:11:46,662 --> 01:11:49,329
(wood snapping)

778
01:11:50,635 --> 01:11:54,145
(wood rumbling and cracking)

779
01:11:54,145 --> 01:11:56,978
(water splashing)

780
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:02,854
(robot rumbling to ground)

781
01:12:02,854 --> 01:12:05,521
(water roaring)

782
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:12,980
- Oh, so many beautiful buildings in ruin,

783
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,840
it's just horrible!

784
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,166
On the other hand, this side looks okay.

785
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,749
(playful orchestral music)

786
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,240
- We won!

787
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,750
- Oh, yeah, some victory.

788
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,523
- So much for the parade.

789
01:12:26,523 --> 01:12:27,920
- At least we're all alive.

790
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,540
- Hey, look at that!

791
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:30,913
The rising sun of Japan!

792
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:33,433
- The sun is setting, dimwit!

793
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:36,929
(Kichi growling)

794
01:12:36,929 --> 01:12:40,090
Oh, you mean symbolically, sort of.

795
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,870
- The fighting's over, and
we've defeated the invader,

796
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,920
and our beloved town is peaceful again.

797
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,510
If you ask me, not a bad day's work, huh?

798
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:48,343
- Huh?

799
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:52,028
- Ya wanna?
(Yaori growling)

800
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:53,129
(strike crunching)

801
01:12:53,129 --> 01:12:55,829
(Kichi growling)

802
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:56,973
Ya!

803
01:12:56,973 --> 01:13:00,806
(piercing percussion accents)

804
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:09,180
- Ha, so the fools think that
they've beaten me (cackles)!

805
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,760
But they haven't seen the last of me!

806
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,800
Not by a longshot, and
speaking of longshots,

807
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,670
just wait till they face my self-propelled

808
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:18,280
autotargeting artillery!

809
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,820
Nothing is impossible for
a genius like me, right?

810
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,403
Of course, I'm right!

811
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:28,070
I'm always right (cackling maniacally)!

812
01:13:32,265 --> 01:13:36,015
(thudding percussion accent)

813
01:13:42,576 --> 01:13:47,576
(crowd muttering over
muffled traffic humming)

814
01:13:55,226 --> 01:13:58,893

815
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:10,903
