Damn it all! Why couldn't
I have been born a
cat-user instead?

00:19:12.843 --> 00:19:14.011 position:66% line:89% align:start
Cat user?!

00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:18.048 position:5% line:77% align:start
Why, you ask? Because
Kiba is a cat lover
through and through.

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:19.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
Also-

00:19:19.516 --> 00:19:23.887 position:5% line:71% align:start
So. What were you two
doing here? I hope for
your sake it's not a
date.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.122 position:66% line:89% align:start
What...?!

00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:28.892 position:33% line:83% align:start
Of course not, Hinata,
what are you saying?

00:19:28.925 --> 00:19:32.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you lay your hands on
him... I'll kill you.

00:19:32.929 --> 00:19:34.798 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh---

00:19:35.532 --> 00:19:37.134 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, just confess!

00:19:37.167 --> 00:19:38.201 position:33% line:89% align:start
I didn't do anything!

00:19:38.235 --> 00:19:40.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone just calm down,
okay?!

00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:44.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right... why are you
trying to cover for her?!

00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:48.078 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, Sakura? I think maybe
we should-

00:19:48.111 --> 00:19:50.047 position:47% line:89% align:start
Yeah... gotta go.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.884 position:5% line:77% align:start
Incidentally, a male and
a female alone together
implies--

00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:59.022 position:27% line:77% align:start
They're running away?! I
knew it was a date! Hold
it, you two!

00:19:59.923 --> 00:20:02.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hate the sound of bugs.

What was that all about?!

00:20:22.146 --> 00:20:24.982 position:33% line:77% align:start
Those guys sure didn't
seem like themselves,
did they?

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.583 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.554 position:80% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:29.586 --> 00:20:33.657 position:5% line:71% align:start
Please, let's go to
Barbe-Q's! They're doing
this all-you-can-eat
special for only fifteen

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.796 position:5% line:71% align:start
hundred ryo per table.
So, even if we just split
it between the three of
us, then that only comes

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.663 position:5% line:89% align:start
out to be, like, uh...

00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:41.532 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's see... It's, uh...
I don't know--

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:43.768 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's five hundred ryo
each!

00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:46.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway. I don't want some
all-you-can-eat deal!

00:20:46.804 --> 00:20:50.808 position:5% line:71% align:start
I just get full too
easily. It would be a
complete waste of my
money!

00:20:50.842 --> 00:20:52.743 position:13% line:89% align:start
What? I don't get it...!

00:20:52.777 --> 00:20:57.583 position:19% line:71% align:start
Don't you see? Even if
you only eat enough for
five people, it's still a
bargain at that price!

00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:00.284 position:24% line:77% align:start
But how am I ever
supposed to eat that
much?!

00:21:00.318 --> 00:21:01.553 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come on, you guys...

00:21:01.587 --> 00:21:02.753 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggling awkwardly]

00:21:04.322 --> 00:21:06.824 position:35% line:71% align:start
Shikamaru, Choji! You
shouldn't be fighting!
You're both friends,
right?

00:21:06.858 --> 00:21:09.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wait, hold on... Did she
just giggle a little bit?

00:21:09.827 --> 00:21:11.028 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:21:13.097 --> 00:21:14.632 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:18.002 position:21% line:83% align:start

What...?!

00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:23.575 position:5% line:71% align:start
Oh, please come along

better when you  eat it
with friends, right?

00:21:23.609 --> 00:21:27.979 position:5% line:5% align:start
What's her deal?
Everyone has been strange

00:21:28.012 --> 00:21:30.014 position:44% line:89% align:start
You're tellin' me.

00:21:31.816 --> 00:21:37.121 position:30% line:71% align:start

Listen, Madara just showed
up in the village and
attacked us.

00:21:37.155 --> 00:21:40.791 position:41% line:83% align:start
Madara did?! What's
Madara?

00:21:40.825 --> 00:21:44.128 position:16% line:77% align:start
Oh, I know what that is!
The fish you put in hot
pots.

00:21:44.163 --> 00:21:45.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah!

00:21:45.164 --> 00:21:46.797 position:35% line:83% align:start

fish!

00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:49.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come on, guys! You really
don't know who he is?

00:21:49.967 --> 00:21:52.837 position:5% line:5% align:start

You're acting weird

Hm?

Even Sasuke?!

But if Sasuke's the same,
maybe Lee is...

You're right. We'd better

be giving lectures?!

00:27:11.292 --> 00:27:17.332 position:5% line:71% align:start
No! You have it wrong! I
was merely training,
jumping between roofs, my
foot caught on something,

00:27:17.365 --> 00:27:18.098 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:27:18.131 --> 00:27:19.934 position:5% line:83% align:start

When Madara used his
jutsu, we were brought
into a whole other world.

It's the only thing that
makes sense.

What do you mean, "a
whole other world?"

00:28:27.168 --> 00:28:32.073 position:5% line:5% align:start

00:28:36.311 --> 00:28:38.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's right.

00:28:38.112 --> 00:28:42.283 position:5% line:71% align:start
So for a while, You're

serious? Why?

00:28:44.687 --> 00:28:47.723 position:5% line:83% align:start

00:28:47.756 --> 00:28:51.327 position:5% line:77% align:start
Work with me so that we

Of course! Take it and

Using the power of our

our goal of obtaining the
Nine Tails.

00:38:03.183 --> 00:38:07.654 position:5% line:77% align:start

Naruto and take the Nine
Tails whenever we want?

00:38:07.687 --> 00:38:10.790 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no need to
rush. All in good time.

00:38:10.824 --> 00:38:18.098 position:5% line:71% align:start

Someone has been

00:38:56.904 --> 00:39:01.209 position:5% line:71% align:start
heard the news going

Did you say a masked man?

He's an S-rank criminal
wanted internationally.

him, right?

00:39:15.423 --> 00:39:16.958 position:69% line:89% align:start
It must.

Please tell me... What
about this scroll?

00:40:31.799 --> 00:40:37.139 position:5% line:71% align:start
Before he died, Jiraiya

Myoboku.

without being able to make
it back to the village.

00:40:59.796 --> 00:41:02.964 position:5% line:77% align:start

this Red Moon Scroll now,
do you know?

00:41:02.998 --> 00:41:07.002 position:24% line:77% align:start
Most likely it was hidden
close to our border with
the Land of Grass.

soon have a crisis to
contend with.

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.562 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a pity.

01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:05.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
And we were so close to
obtaining the Nine Tails.

01:41:17.144 --> 01:41:21.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
To think that prophecy
was accurate...

01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:42.603 position:5% line:71% align:start

How could Madara pull
something like this
inside the village?

01:41:43.105 --> 01:41:47.508 position:5% line:71% align:start
From what I've heard, I
believe that it was some
type of transportation

relieved that you're all
safe...

01:41:53.581 --> 01:41:58.420 position:5% line:77% align:start
However, if this incident
is made public, it'll be
chaos in the village.

01:41:59.087 --> 01:42:03.657 position:47% line:71% align:start
Until we've taken
countermeasures I believe
that it may be better to
keep these events secret.
