00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,352
(thunder booming)

2
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,617
(airplane buzzing)

3
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,684
(thunder cracking)

4
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,113
- [Phantom Narrating] My
name is Phantom F. Harlock.

5
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,840
It was when I was flying in a thunderstorm

6
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,780
from Port Moresby across New Guinea

7
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,463
heading for Rabaul in New Britain.

8
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,660
As an ariel explorer my
life long cherished dream

9
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,333
was to conquer the air
throughout the whole world.

10
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,840
The only thing that stood in my way

11
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,293
were the Owen Stanley Mountains.

12
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,830
With its highest peak soaring up

13
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,200
to 5,030 meters above sea level

14
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,300
the mountain people feared

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,253
calling it the Witch of
the Owen Stanley range.

16
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,390
My name is Phantom F.
Harlock and this plane

17
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,473
I call Arcadia is like
my own flesh and blood.

18
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
My companion to share my
fate and my youth in Arcadia.

19
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,620
Sharing those precious youthful days.

20
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,333
Flying high in the sky.

21
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:45,230
If it ever ceases to fly my
life will come to and end.

22
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,910
With a full load of fuel the
plane was heavy that day.

23
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,810
I couldn't gain any altitude

24
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,513
and Arcadian's engine gasped desperately.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,540
The sound from the gasping cylinders

26
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,593
was almost like my aged
irregular heartbeat.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,983
I and my Arcadia flew through
ravines wherever possible.

28
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:18,545
(airplane buzzing)
(dramatic music)

29
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,700
But the Owen Stanley
Mountains just stood there

30
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,700
high and rigid and cold, totally
dominating Arcadia and me.

31
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:52,324
(tense music)

32
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,610
Arcadia and me, we had
to face bitter defeat

33
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,673
for the first time in our
entire life in the sky.

34
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,400
While turning back swallowing my pride

35
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,766
something made me look back.

36
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,683
(echoing laughing)

37
00:04:56,972 --> 00:05:00,063
The mountain, the mountain was laughing.

38
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,940
With my Arcadia I had
been continuously blind

39
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,790
believing we could never be defeated.

40
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,400
I jettisoned all the fuel only

41
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,010
leaving enough for 10 minutes of flight.

42
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,450
Lightening the plane I'd staked

43
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,463
everything on those last 10 minutes.

44
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:24,907
(dramatic music)

45
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,560
My name is Phantom F. Harlock.

46
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,150
The plane and I shared
every moment of my life.

47
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,470
My youth and Arcadia, the life I lived

48
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,363
flying in the sky with conviction.

49
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,760
There is no regret so
long as men do not abandon

50
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,417
their dreams their
dreams will never vanish.

51
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:06,318

- [Man] The third clock,
impact gun damaged.

60
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,070
- [Man] Starboard rear
engine room damaged.

61
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,390
- [Man] The ship's thrust 80%.

62
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,060
- [Man] An enemy's ship approaching.

63
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,313
Take phase three combat position.

64
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:27,495
(dramatic music)

65
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,540
- [Phantom] The dream is over now.

66
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,940
Earth is the only place
where Earthmen can live.

67
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,333
We must submit to defeat,
but have we done our best?

68
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,125
Hmm.

69
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,690
- [Man] This is Illumidus
Earth Occupation Force calling.

70
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,783
Follow our instructions and
land your ship at base 446.

71
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,390
If you resist we will take immediate

72
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,530
measures to destroy your ship.

73
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,330
Six minutes, 55 seconds before touchdown.

74
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,360
Maintain present course
and strike your colors.

75
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,357
Do not attempt to resist.

76

- [Maya On Radio] Broadcasting
on frequency band 6050.

With variable micro-frequency.

78
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,810
The sun disappeared yesterday,

79
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,720
but the sun will rise again today.

80
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,707
Continue to have faith
in the ever rising sun.

81
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,950
- That, that voice is--
- Believe in our future.

82
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,583
Everyone living on Earth.

83
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,735
Although the ground has been burnt--

84
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:00,568
- [Phantom] Maya.

85
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:02,440
- [Maya On Radio] Turning
everything into ashes.

86
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,700
All will revive again.

87
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,890
The sky is ever so blue.

88
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,040
The sound of the ocean unchanged.

89
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,147
This is our own planet, Earth,

90
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,753
so long as we keep our dreams.

91
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,123
- Oh, listen, that's the
underground radio from Earth.

92
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,152
- [Maya On Radio] It will never disappear.

93
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,600
- That's right, it's the
voice of Radio Free Arcadia

94
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,400
broadcasting from somewhere
on occupied Earth.

95
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,122
- [Maya On Radio] Keep a song
in your heart for tomorrow.

96
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:40,580
Let us stop crying and
stand firmly on the ground

97
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,327
for we shall all have a wonderful future.

98
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:47,425

99
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,329

(whirring)

102
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,189
- Stupid landing.
- That stumblebum.

103
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,480
No wonder we lost the battle.

104
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
- [Man] The Solar Federation.
(mocking laughing)

105
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,603
Some invincible armada.

106
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:20,314
- Move, move.
(gasping)

107
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,147
- Move.

108
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,846
(footsteps rapidly thudding)

109
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:30,846
(suspenseful music)

110
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,193
- Captain, isn't your name Harlock?

111
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,750
Remember you're surrendering.

112
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,603
I'll take your sidearm.

113
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,310
A very amateurish landing,

114
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,520
but I guess it was inevitable

115
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,290
due to the poor condition of the runway.

116
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,320
Still, I think your secret
purpose was to disable your ship.

117
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,153
- That's right.

118
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,110
- [Zoll] You are to present
yourself to headquarters

119
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,210
and that will conclude all of your duties.

120
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,083
- Haven't we met before?

121
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,900
- During the battle at the
Castlemagne Star Cluster

122
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,963
you disabled my ship by
blowing a hole in the hull.

123
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,900
- I see.

124
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Now that you've won you must feel great.

125
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,100
- It was a very long battle

126
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,380
and many times I felt
my last hour had come.

127
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,550
You were a formidable
adversary, especially your ship.

128
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,383
- Thank you.

129
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:38,180
And what is your name?

130
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,603
- Zoll, of Tokarga.
- Torkarga.

131
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,470
Planet Torkarga?

132
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,870
That lost the war against
Illumidus a long time ago?

133
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,703
- That's right.

134
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:51,196
(suspenseful music)

135
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,952
Report at 10 o'clock.

136
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,273
Wait.

137
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,700
Didn't you hear me?

138
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,853
I told you to report to headquarters.

139
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,220
- [Phantom] I still have
two hours before 10 o'clock

140
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,870
and there's a place I wish to go.

141
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,373
- Your families' place?

142
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,743
- I have no family.

143
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,490
- Remember to report at 10 o'clock.

144
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,830
- I will be there.

145
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,420
What's wrong, don't you trust my word?

146
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,210
- Just be careful walking in the streets.

147
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,453
If you get killed and fail to
return I'll be responsible.

148
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,993
- [Maya On Radio] This is
the voice of Free Arcadia.

149
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,593
The sun set but it will rise again.

150
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,813
There's no future for those who
don't believe in the future.

151
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,010
The ones who believe have endured.

152
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,360
Some day we will meet again
and some day join forces

153
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,213
to start living our future together.

154
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,903
Don't let the fire die down.

155
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,940
Keep even the faintest spark

156
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,960
with a firm belief in our future.

157

(screaming)

160
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:40,677
- [Man] Over here.

00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:04,176
(gun firing)

166
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:06,343
(yelling)

167
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:11,003
(clanging)

168
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:13,753
(dramatic music)

169
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,010
- I see no reason not to use a man

170
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,900
who won the highest hero medal in combat.

171
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,733
- Sir.

172
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,193
- Apparently Zoll you thought
too highly of the Earth man.

173
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:13,805
(dramatic music)

174
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,653
- I am here.

175
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,283
What do you want of me?

176
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,610
- This is the Illumidus Occupation Forces'

177
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,333
supreme commander General Zeda.

178
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,883
- And I am Harlock.

179
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,570
The captain of the Death Shadow.

180
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,670
And there's nothing more to say.

181
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,763
- Don't get smart Earth man.

182
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:52,152
(bones cracking)
(groaning)

183
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,273
- Let go of him Harlock.

184
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,330
Reading books is not going
to help you win any battles.

185
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,093
Books will never help you win against us.

186
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,290
- We've gathered a
staggering amount of data

187
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,282
on you Earthmen since our occupation

188
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:27,610
and according to our computer analysis

189
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,450
Earthmen are easily acclimated
to a new environment.

190
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,350
In other words even though
they've been hostile

191
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,820
up until today now they're
wagging their tails at us.

192
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,883
- But the fact is Earthmen
are definitely not cowards.

193
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,207
- [La Mime] Let me present
Prime Minister Triter

194
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,043
of the Illumidus Occupation cabinet.

195
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,280
- Ah, good evening.
- Prime Minister Triter

196
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,050
I see you have failed to
capture The Rose once again.

197
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,860
- Ah well, I assure you that I will

198
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,590
arrest and execute her the next time.

199
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,660
- My orders are to identify the voice

200
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,180
of Free Arcadia at any
cost, not to execute anyone.

201
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,340
And once we find out there are ways

202
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,640
of taking advantage of it.

203
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:10,120
- Oh, this man is--

204
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,720
- The ex-captain of the evacuation ship.

205
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,873
- Ah, Harlock, this man is dangerous.

206
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,573
(gasping)

207
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,693
Well, if you'll excuse
me, I have things to do.

208
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,013
- A useless individual.

209
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,090
- By the way Harlock General Zeda

210
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,580
has seen your combat record

211
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,880
and is willing to give you work,

212
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,850
that is if you want the job.

213
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,040
- I decline.

214
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,563
- So you are also stubborn, you may leave.

215
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,910
- Take your food coupons and get lost.

216
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,150
Go anywhere, there is
nothing for you to do.

217
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,150
You will never have another
chance to fly again, understand?

218
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,293
La Mime, give him some coupons.

219
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,370
- [La Mime] Just a moment please.

220
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,550
Your food coupons.

221
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,493
Keep your temper and eat while you can.

222
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,840
The provisions on Earth are running short.

223
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,853
Eat now or you'll starve to death.

224
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:34,544
(jazz music)
(chattering)

225
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,180
- Hey, this guy has a black collar.

226
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,790
Why don't we show him some fun?

227
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,010
- Leave him alone, he might be the one

228
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,710
who scratched one of our ships in battle.

229
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,920
- Scratched our ship?

230
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,793
I bet you're right.
(laughing)

231
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:22,424
- Hmm?

232
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:25,174
(dramatic music)

233
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:39,579
- [Phantom Thinking] I know how you feel.

234
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,860
All we can do now is eat and wait.

235
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,333
We've been defeated but we still exist.

236
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,393
- Just don't die.

237
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:15,700
(laughing)

238
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,900
- [Phantom] And I was
feeling sorry for him.

239
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:26,836
(groaning)

240
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,493
- Why you dirty yellow rat.

241
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,443
Take that and go back to
the gutter where you belong.

242
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,130
And now you're stealing my food.

243
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:50,364
(groaning)

244
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:55,364
- That'll fix him.
(laughing)

245
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:57,611
(groaning)

246
00:24:57,611 --> 00:24:58,444
- Well?

247
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,168
(groaning)

248
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,629
(laughing)

249
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,699
(thumping)

250
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:16,141
(chuckling)

251
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,303
(grunting)

252
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:19,553
(thumping)

253
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,332
- Go get him!

254
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:42,919
(angry shouting)

255
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:46,315
(thudding)

256
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,237
(bonking)

257
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,705
(groaning)

258
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,850
(laughing)

259
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,391
(thumping)

260
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:21,044
- Now that things have gone
this far, drop dead all of you!

261
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:23,294
(laughing)

262
00:26:27,123 --> 00:26:29,373
(thumping)

263
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:35,098
Whoa.

264
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:39,104
(thumping)

265
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:41,354
(laughing)

266
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,435
- [Woman] Huh?

267
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:47,018
What are you doing?

268
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:51,378
(sirens blaring)

269
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,463
(laughing)

270
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:55,470
- That was fun.

271
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,940
My name is Tochiro and I'm leaving now.

272
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,248
- So am I.

273
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:01,998
(sirens blaring)

274
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:13,552
(cat scowling)

275
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:17,278
(glass shattering)

276
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:18,528
- What a waste.

277
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,403
- But why, why do you go
around acting like a beggar?

278
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,350
- [Tochiro] You could call
it a single handed revolt.

279
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,183
- Revolt?

280
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,470
- [Tochiro] That's right.

281
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,303
- [Phantom] How can you call it

282
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:35,973
a revolt without any weapons?

283
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,770
- [Tochiro] If you had a
weapon would you revolt?

284
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,603
- Weapon?

285
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,685
But they're impossible to get.

286
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:47,000
(laughing)

287
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,650
- [Tochiro] But there's
always a way to get anything.

288
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,753
Here.

289
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,880
- Why that's-- Sort of old though.

290
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,343
But how did you?
- Better than nothing.

291
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:04,577
(vehicle screeching)

292
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,509
- Someone is coming.

293
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,926
(gun firing)

294
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,210
- [Zoll] Brought you here
because the memory areas

295
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,460
of both of your genes were

296
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,740
put through analysis simultaneously

297
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,910
and we analyzed 3,000 years of your past.

298
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,180
- Why'd you do that?

299
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,040
- Is this a torture? (yelling)

300
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,550
- [Zoll] Listen to me.

301
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,963
You both have the same common gene factor.

302
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,250
See where those two lines
overlap now and then,

303
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,710
the place where it sparkles.

304
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,820
- [Phantom] What does that mean?

305
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,710
- [Zoll] It indicates your memories.

306
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,400
Both of you have inherited
some identical memory genes

307
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,543
going back to your distant ancestors.

308
00:28:53,537 --> 00:28:55,010
- Identical?

309
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,170
- With me?

310
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,840
- Some time ago I happened to obtain

311
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,113
some strange data on both of your genes.

312
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,090
Both of you show the same

313
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,170
memory based on a common experience.

314
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,313
Now I am going to revive
that memory for you to see.

315
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,582
(machine whirring)

316
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:35,388
(dramatic music)

317
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,126
(gun firing)

318
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:54,970
- Follow me.

319
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,643
We'll land on the autobahn for refueling.

320
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:03,989
(airplanes buzzing)

321
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:16,821
(screaming)

322
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:23,296
(clanging)

323
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:31,012
Well I guess that does it this time.

324
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,840
- [Tochiro] Why are you waiting there?

325
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,640
Get out of there before it blows up.

326
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,460
- This, I've got to...

327
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,860
- Ah, a C-12-D.

328
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,010
- [Phantom] This gun
sight has never failed me.

329
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,963
In the Battle of Britain or in Africa.

330
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,260
What are you doing?

331
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:55,335
(flames whooshing)

332
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,880
(explosion booming)

333
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,825
(dramatic music)

334
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,720
- It's too bad your plane
was destroyed like that.

335
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,313
- Ah, I never thought that would happen.

336
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,150
- Your landing gear wasn't strong enough.

337
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,433
It's not your fault.

338
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,500
- Are you Japanese?

339
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,350
- Yes.

340
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,840
I came on a technical exchange

341
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,260
as an optical instrument designer.

342
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,930
My name is Tochiro Oyama.

343
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,990
- I'm Phantom F. Harlock Junior.

344
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,910
- Harlock, then you're the
one who wrote this book huh?

345
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,870
- My father wrote it.

346
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,130
- I see, My Youth in Arcadia.

347
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,720
Only real men could understand this book.

348
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,553
- Maybe.

349
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,570
- [Tochiro] But why are you
flying an Iron Cross plane?

350
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,420
- I'm just doing it to pay the rent.

351
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,060
By the way Tochiro are you a samurai?

352
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,710
- [Tochiro] My father's a farmer.

353
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,330
The first manned rocket in the world.

354
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:16,210
(explosion booming)

355
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,630
- I guess it ran out of fuel.

356
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,320
- A lot of things are
running out fuel these days.

357
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,383
- But my battle's not finished yet.

358
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,180
- [Man] We've put all the
remaining fuel in that new one.

359
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,433
It's the only plane left.

360
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:32,983
(dramatic music)

361
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:46,480
(gasping)

362
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,210
- Why did you do that?

363
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,420
No wonder this country isn't
going to last much longer.

364
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,743
- [Phantom] Are you interested
in things like that?

365
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,503
- That's right.

366
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:02,270
My work is to develop
a new precision sight.

367
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,240
I was handling it very carefully,

368
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,320
but your rough landing on the
road caused it to be smashed.

369
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,370
- I'm sorry.
- This is a stupid war.

370
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,573
- I guess we're both feeling frustrated.

371
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,490
- If they'd only let me work
without all this fighting

372
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,900
I could work on a great project

373
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,880
with a future in it
like going to the moon.

374
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,460
- There'll come a time some day

375
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,123
when man will be able to go there.

376
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:38,892
(airplanes buzzing)
(guns firing)

377
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,810
Tochiro what's wrong?

378
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,790
Hurry and go.

379
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,330
- But there's no place where I can go.

380
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,740
- Go to Wiesbaden and then to Switzerland.

381
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,370
- The Allies already
took Wiesbaden last week

382
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,170
and they're between here and
the Swiss border right now.

383
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,978
But I sure wish I could continue
my research in Switzerland.

384
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,858
(bomb whistling)

385
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:28,858
(explosion booming)

386
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:37,690
- [Phantom] There's not
much room, but get in there.

387
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,680
It's not bulletproof so if
you get hit don't blame me.

388
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,730
- [Tochiro] Don't worry, I'll be alright.

389
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,700
(suspenseful music)

390
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:51,348
(gasping)

391
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:55,191
(suspenseful music)

392
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,754
- Hang on, here they come.

393
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:13,251
(guns firing)

394
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:41,127
Tochiro, you alright?

395
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:44,241
- [Tochiro] I've got a good view.

396
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:45,987
Here comes a Spitfire on the right.

397
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:47,283
- And here we go.

398
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,547
And now.

399
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:02,964
(gun firing)

400
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,237
Strange, no rudder.

401
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,833
Tochiro are there any
broken wires back there?

402
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,033
- Everything is fine.
- Is it?

403
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:20,063
A strange reaction.

404
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,123
Got to get lower.

405
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,003
So, I'm the only one left.

406
00:36:32,202 --> 00:36:34,952
(dramatic music)

407
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,243
Switzerland.

408
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,753
10 more minutes.

409
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,660
Tochiro, you want to go back to Japan?

410
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,091
- [Tochiro] Of course I do.

411
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:14,010
Harlock, don't you want to go home?

412
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,843
- I do.

413
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,453
And I want to return to Arcadia,

414
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,340
the home of forests and lakes

415
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,120
and a beautiful paradise like
the one in ancient Greece

416
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,450
where my memories of youth go racing

417
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,203
through the rich green fields.

418
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,773
The home of the pirate
knight Harlock family.

419
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,600
As the end of the journey approaches

420
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,603
all my clansmen yearn to
return to our lovely home.

421
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,700
We all hear the voice of the spirit

422
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,320
of the pirate knight of Arcadia.

423
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,282
(engine rumbling)

424
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:01,865
(wind howling)

425
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,590
Tochiro, next stop Switzerland.

426
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:21,497
500 meters.

427
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:34,430
Tochiro Switzerland is just on
the other side of that river.

428
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,263
Hurry up.

429
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,120
Come on out.

430
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,953
What's wrong?

431
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:46,841
(suspenseful music)

432
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,091
(groaning)

433
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,743
Tochiro, your hands.

434
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,753
You held the broken wire
together with your bare hands.

435
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,683
That's why the pedals felt so strange.

436
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,730
I'm sorry Tochiro, I didn't know.

437
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,350
- But I'm not dead.

438
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,450
It's just my hands, they're a little numb.

439
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,070
- Wait for a second.

440
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:22,022
- [Man] Hey over here.

441
00:39:22,022 --> 00:39:24,002
I found them, over by the wrecked plane.

442
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:25,940
(gun firing)
- Somebody's coming.

443
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,910
- They're French resistance

444
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,770
who penetrated into German territory.

445
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,087
Don't worry I'll help you across.

446
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:35,017
(dramatic music)

447
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:52,530
Tochiro take this with you.

448
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,030
- Why that's--
- It's the one from the plane.

449
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,997
Take it with you.

450
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:00,280
- But this is your--

451
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,410
- I would only give this to

452
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,210
someone whom I could really trust.

453
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,250
Someone who was truly a friend.

454
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,443
Someone I could believe in.

455
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:08,276
- Harlock.

456
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,343
- [Phantom] Here.

457
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:17,770
(gun firing)

458
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,603
Farewell.

459
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,223
- Harlock what are you going to do now?

460
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,930
- I'm not the type who
would run off like a coward.

461
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,570
A pirate must always be ready

462
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,203
to answer for what he has done.

463
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,570
Tochiro never give up your dream

464
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,741
and make the most of your life.

465
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:38,833
(gun firing)
(gasping)

466
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:39,666
- Harlock.

467
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:45,190
- I'm glad I could meet you
at the end of this stupid war.

468
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,793
I wish we'd met in different times.

469
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,390
- [Man] He's down in the river.

470
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,820
Circle around to the right.

471
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,653
- Harlock.

472
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,783
Stay alive!

473
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:02,540
Harlock, I'll remember you
for the rest of my life.

474
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,100
My whole family will never forget you.

475
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,900
Our friendship will never never die.

476
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,173
Never die.

477
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:27,100
(birds squawking)

478
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
- [Tochiro] Over a thousand years ago

479
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,053
our ancestors had been friends.

480
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,223
- But I wonder why Zoll
gave the book back to me.

481
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,200
- Harlock congratulations.

482
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,400
My suspecting you of
being in the underground

483
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,887
has all been cleared up.

484
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:52,543
- [Zeda] And I am quite pleased.

485
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,565
- According to Zoll's report

486
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:58,450
the results of the analysis
proved you totally innocent

487
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,850
along with your friend here.

488
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,500
- I must ask your friend to leave us alone

489
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,560
for I wish to talk to Harlock.

490
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:22,200
- Harlock.

491
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:28,470
We must have you pledge your
loyalty to Earth once again.

492
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,330
- I have always fought for this planet

493
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,360
in accordance with the laws
and rules of Earth at the time.

494
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,063
- Alright, good enough.

495
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,540
We have decided to send a volunteer army

496
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,240
to the planet Tokarga.
- Tokarga?

497
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:44,470
- And I am assigning you the task

498
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,910
of transporting the troops.

499
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,710
- Why are you sending an army there?

500
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,243
Why must Earthmen have to
go to Tokarga to fight?

501
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,720
- Let me remind you that you have

502
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,520
pledged your loyalty
to Earth and so have I.

503
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,210
And now we are being
forced into a position

504
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,310
where we must either
allow the mother to die

505
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,820
or kill the stray dog.

506
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,650
- So now Earth is the mother
and Tokarga is the stray dog.

507
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,357
- For Illumidus the entire planet

508
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,710
of Tokarga is of no further use.

509
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:18,370
- You intend to annihilate
Torkarga, to liquidate it?

510
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,350
And who in the universe can decide

511
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,543
whether a planet is useless or not?

512
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,060
Every single living thing in the universe

513
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,740
has a right to life and now the mission

514
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,560
to destroy Torkarga has to be carried out

515
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,290
by Earthmen using my hands?

516
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,960
The whole idea stinks.

517
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,793
- Come back.

518
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,860
We must cooperate with the Illumidus

519
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,650
by sending a volunteer army.

520
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,220
It's the only way they'll guarantee

521
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,920
the safety of the Earth.

522
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,000
You think the whole idea stinks,

523
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,330
then tell me if you
think it's a better idea

524
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,963
to sacrifice the Earth for
another planet's safety?

525
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:57,324
(ship rumbling)

526
00:44:21,663 --> 00:44:24,246
(wind howling)

527
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,270
- [Tochiro] Hmm?

528
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,620
- I am Emeraldas, a
freelance space trader,

529
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,603
and I hold a legitimate license.

530
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,800
I am no one's enemy and no one's ally.

531
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,050
I'm a free space trader.

532
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:52,903
Who are you?

533
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,360
- [Tochiro] My name is Tochiro.

534
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:59,987
- And what do you want?
- I'm looking for my friend.

535
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,193
But your ship, she's
scorched pretty badly.

536
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,380
- [Emeraldas] I made an error in crossing

537
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,160
the Flame Stream Prominence.

538
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,493
It's called the Owen
Stanley Witch of Space.

539
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,730
Not only is there tremendous heat energy,

540
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,913
but super gravitation that
pulls in any life reaction.

541
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,869
(wind howling)

542
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:38,745
(panting)

543
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:40,665
- [La Mime] Zoll.

544
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:41,498
(gasping)

545
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:42,730
- What's wrong La Mime?

546
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,003
It's dangerous to come here.

547
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,700
- [La Mime] I know that, but--

548
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,850
- Tell me what's wrong?

549
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,890
- [La Mime] I heard the
top secret coded order

550
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:58,445
sent to the general commander.

551
00:45:58,445 --> 00:45:59,362
- Ah?
- Hmm?

552
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,140
- [La Mime] It's Torkarga.

553
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:09,973
- What about it?

554
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,980
- [La Mime] They're going to...

555
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,380
- [Maya On Radio] No matter how great

556
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,940
the bitter agony may be
consider it as the sigh

557
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,050
of the beautiful future yet to come.

558
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,510
Do not let despair lure you to defeat.

559
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,943
The crisp air at dawn, the
fresh wind, remember it all.

560
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:37,110
Remember the time we ran hand and hand

561
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:42,110
over the green, green fields,
remember with love, remember.

562
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:46,641
(dramatic music)

563
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:57,318
(panting)

564
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:58,659
(suspenseful music)

565
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:00,231
(guns firing)
(yelling)

566
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,258
(thumping)
(groaning)

567
00:47:02,258 --> 00:47:03,856
(gun firing)

568
00:47:03,856 --> 00:47:05,296
(yelling)

569
00:47:05,296 --> 00:47:07,796
(guns firing)

570
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:18,825
(yelling)

571
00:47:18,825 --> 00:47:21,325
(guns firing)

572
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,613
- Harlock.

573
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:38,346
- Maya, look out, take cover.

574
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:40,856
Maya.

575
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:45,539
Maya!

576
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:48,039
(guns firing)

577
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,250
(yelling)

578
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:54,707
(guns firing)

579
00:47:56,618 --> 00:47:57,451
- Harlock!

580
00:47:58,638 --> 00:47:59,471
- Maya.

581
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:03,549
Maya.

582
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:09,565
(gun firing)
(dramatic music)

583
00:48:09,565 --> 00:48:10,398
Maya.

584
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:22,537
(gun firing)
(groaning)

585
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:03,089
- Harlock.

586
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,680
No.

587
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,073
Don't come closer.

588
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,041
Your coming this far,

589
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,553
it's more than enough to make me happy.

590
00:49:13,882 --> 00:49:15,465
Hurry and get away.

591
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:22,113
- How can I leave without you?

592
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,113
- Oh no.

593
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,590
Don't come any closer.

594
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,489
Don't, don't throw your life away.

595
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:31,323
(groaning)

596
00:49:31,323 --> 00:49:35,483
Stay alive and someday I
know we'll be together again.

597
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,093
Harlock, please don't.

598
00:49:44,505 --> 00:49:46,636
Don't come any closer.

599
00:49:46,636 --> 00:49:47,469
Harlock.

600
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:51,159
(dramatic music)

601
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:04,457
Please don't. (crying)

602
00:50:04,457 --> 00:50:05,750
- [Man] Fire!

603
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,167
- [Phantom] Maya!

604
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:29,875
(strained breathing)

605
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,723
- Harlock, what's wrong?

606
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,480
- A little man called Tochiro,

607
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,980
have you seen him around here?

608
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,640
- [Tochiro] Hey, you finally came.

609
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,660
- [Emeraldas] And just
where have you been hiding?

610
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,660
- [Tochiro] I've been repairing the ship.

611
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,190
I still need one part to make it perfect,

612
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:49,640
but even without it she's ready to fly.

613
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,450
- [Phantom] You mean you
fixed it, it's ready to go?

614
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,850
- [Tochiro] Don't you believe me?

615
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,573
- It's not that, can she fly?
- She sure can.

616
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,110
Hey why don't you come aboard and see?

617
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,297
(groaning)

618
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:05,550
- Harlock.
- Harlock.

619
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:09,503
Harlock, what's wrong?
(unsettling music)

620
00:51:14,553 --> 00:51:18,660
- [Maya On Radio] This is
the voice of Free Arcadia.

621
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,310
If you let it burn only ashes will remain,

622
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:27,740
but a true living fire of
hope will never die out.

623
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,430
Some day like a forest fire it will spread

624
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:35,130
from one to the other increasing its power

625
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:39,103
and that hope will create
a new and beautiful future.

626
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:43,430
Even if you set off
tomorrow to a distant place

627
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,660
no one will think badly of you

628
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:50,199
for people do have faith in
you that you will return.

629
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:52,116
(glass cracking)

630
00:51:52,116 --> 00:51:54,283
(gasping)

631
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:02,758
(suspenseful music)

632
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,490
- [Tochiro] She's been captured.

633
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,293
- I can almost picture that poor girl.

634
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,090
In her heart she's not
only holding the torch

635
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,860
for her oppressed people,

636
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,730
but she seems to be in love
with a particular person.

637
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,380
That broadcast we just heard

638
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,063
must've been a personal message.

639
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:28,223
She put her life in danger to
send that message to someone.

640
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:31,576
- Emeraldas.

641
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,520
Would you do me a favor
and let me steal your ship?

642
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,870
- [Tochiro] What did you say?

643
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:42,260
- Because I must escape from Earth.

644
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,910
- [Zoll] I can't let you do that.

645
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,310
- You're just as rotten
as the rest of them.

646
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,850
You've turned yourself
into a Illumidus dog.

647
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,153
- [La Mime] Harlock, wait a moment.

648
00:53:01,153 --> 00:53:03,233
Zoll didn't come here to arrest you.

649
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,343
We've come to take over Emeraldas' ship.

650
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,080
Our people want to go back to Torkarga.

651
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,290
- That's enough La Mime.

652
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,760
They've got nothing to do with this.

653
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,603
- Oh?

654
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:23,323
- [La Mime] My planet was
totally destroyed by Illumidus

655
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,563
and reverted to a primitive state.

656
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,133
The sight I saw from the refugee ship.

657
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,070
I can never forget the grief I felt

658
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,840
when our planet lost its glow.

659
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,010
And now Zoll and all the
other Torkarga people

660
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,793
are facing the same tragedy.

661
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,513
If Zoll and the others escape
Illumidus will retaliate.

662
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,333
Still they're driven by their
love for their mother planet.

663
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,760
If destruction is inevitable they want

664
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,423
to perish on Torkarga with their families.

665
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,280
They need a ship to return to Torkarga

666
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,003
and that's why we've come.

667
00:54:04,237 --> 00:54:06,987
(dramatic music)

668
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,770
The same thing will
happen to Earth some day.

669
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,193
For now I beg of you, let
Zoll and the others go.

670
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,390
- I'm sorry for what I've said.

671
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,233
I understand.

672
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,390
- [Murigson] All our forces
have taken emergency positions.

673
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:37,290
- Hmm, I have been overlooking
those underground broadcasts

674
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:41,060
so far thinking it would give
the Earthmen a will to work.

675
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,870
- Yes, but I thought today's broadcast

676
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,270
sounded like a message to start

677
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,920
a full scale revolt here on Earth

678
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,940
or possibly urging them to escape.

679
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,150
- Don't worry they can't go anywhere.

680
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,760
They're like rats in a cage making

681
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,033
a lot of noise, but they can't escape.

682
00:54:57,685 --> 00:54:59,390
- If Tochiro hadn't repaired my ship

683
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:03,010
it would've been abandoned,
therefor take it.

684
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,120
- [Tochiro] Wait, if you use this ship

685
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,970
no matter what she says
Emeraldas will lose

686
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,623
her free space traders license.

687
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,890
Also as soon as Zoll takes off

688
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,060
they will immediately
commence to attack Torkarga.

689
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,360
So we'll use another ship.

690
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:22,850
Harlock, let us go to Torkarga

691
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,450
in place of Zoll and the others.

692
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:31,033
I've been waiting a long
time, such a long time.

693
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,160
Struggling to stay alive,
living like a beggar.

694
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,933
I've been waiting for this chance.

695
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,780
Waiting for the day when I

696
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,673
could set out in my own spaceship.

697
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,640
- In your own spaceship?

698
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,050
- [Tochiro] I've been
looking for a captain

699
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:57,550
worthy enough to entrust
him with my spaceship.

700
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,123
- This spaceship, where is it?

701
00:56:01,474 --> 00:56:03,690
(laughing)

702
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,023
- I got one, I've got one. (laughing)

703
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,423
- Your, you really are incredible.

704
00:56:16,716 --> 00:56:18,090
- Zoll, what do you say?

705
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:22,060
With their spaceship and with
their help perhaps we could--

706
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,820
- No this is strictly a Torkarga problem.

707
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,140
Just let us have the use of the ship.

708
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,163
- [Tochiro] No I can't let you do that.

709
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,650
The ship is me, every bit of it is me

710
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,100
and it won't move without me.

711
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,263
- [La Mime] Zoll let me go in your place.

712
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,623
Please, and ask Harlock and
Tochiro to go to Torkarga.

713
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,340
In return you stay here
and pretend loyalty

714
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,113
to Illumidus and protect the Earthmen.

715
00:56:55,986 --> 00:56:58,560
Illumidus is much too strong as an enemy.

716
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,440
The only way to ruin them is
to take invisible measures

717
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,700
like bacteria spoiling it from inside.

718
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,425
- You want me to be the
bacteria here on Earth?

719
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:08,423
- [La Mime] Yes.

720
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,023
- And we'll be the bacteria on Torkarga.

721
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:16,460
- Zoll I will go with them on the ship

722
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,173
as a delegate of Torkarga
and you take over here.

723
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:27,370
- I've been a dog, a dog begging
for the lives of my people,

724
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:31,620
a dog that fights as
instrument of Illumidus.

725
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,743
The people who remained on Torkarga

726
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:36,193
have been dreaming of
a day of deliverance.

727
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,960
Believing that we will come
back to rescue them some day

728
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,833
as they hold their breath
under Illumidus's oppression.

729
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,780
When I close my eyes I
can see my little brother

730
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,430
and sister praying and
waiting for my return

731
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,410
bearing so much bitterness and yet

732
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,563
praying for me to come back and save them.

733
00:57:55,785 --> 00:57:58,535
(dramatic music)

734
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,992
Tochiro hurry to Torkarga.

735
00:58:07,992 --> 00:58:10,075
(crying)

736
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,080
I am grateful to you for
making all this possible.

737
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,913
Thank you.

738
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:29,571
(crying)
(dramatic music)

739
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,140
- Now for the future of Torkarga

740
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,155
and to the men of true courage,

741
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:44,843
Zoll of Torkaraga, for
Harlock, Tochiro and La Mime

742
00:58:44,843 --> 00:58:47,570
and all the rest of you brave men.

743
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,780
(speaking in a foreign language)

744
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,080
- [La Mime] It's a Torkargan word

745
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,943
to toast with true friends.

746
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:58,213
It means we pledge true
friendship with our blood.

747
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,863
(speaking in a foreign language)

748
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:19,444
(guns firing)

749
00:59:30,974 --> 00:59:35,641
(yelling)
(guns firing)

750
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:51,034
(wind howling)

751
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:19,967
- Take this to Harlock, please hurry.

752
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:22,217
(coughing)

753
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:26,082
(suspenseful music)

754
01:00:43,662 --> 01:00:48,329
(guns firing)
(yelling)

755
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,273
- Interesting, let's see
just how far they can go.

756
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,330
- [Man] Maya sent this.

757
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,823
She made it especially for
you and asked that you use it.

758
01:01:32,113 --> 01:01:34,063
- [Tochiro] Harlock we've got to hurry.

759
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,843
- Don't worry, we'll protect Maya.

760
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,860
Farewell and I wish you a successful trip.

761
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:50,972
- Harlock.

762
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,159
(suspenseful music)

763
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:38,103
Down here.

764
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:42,252
(suspenseful music)

765
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,503
- Maya, you shouldn't be up.

766
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:57,050
- I haven't got too much longer to live

767
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,393
so please let me see Harlock take off.

768
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,870
- [Tochiro] And this, the
ship I built to fulfill

769
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:10,373
our ancestor's dream
and I named her Arcadia.

770
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,710
- Arcadia?

771
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,660
- Only the name Arcadia would be suitable

772
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,163
for a ship that we launch.

773
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,133
- Arcadia.

774
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:23,400
- And this is our ship.
- Arcadia.

775
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,383
Our own ship.

776
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:36,064
And you built this?
- That's right.

777
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,850
A ship I built with the technology

778
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:41,000
I inherited from my ancestors.

779
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,977
It took a long time, but Harlock

780
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,183
this is the ship to achieve our dream.

781
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:51,889
(dramatic music)

782
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,293
What's that?

783
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,703
It's fantastic.

784
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:39,090
Do you want to go and see Maya?

785
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,240
- She wouldn't want me to do that.

786
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,780
She'd be upset.

787
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,613
- But...

788
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,343
- With this flag flying
from the mast we'll leave.

789
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,820
- [Murigson] The rebellious
Earthmen are being put under

790
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:59,593
our control but we can't
find Harlock anywhere.

791
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,540
- Anyway he's like a rat in a trap.

792
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,854
(rumbling)

793
01:05:04,854 --> 01:05:07,360
What?

794
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,520
- Launching angle 40 degrees.

795
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,260
Balance normal.

796
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,430
Release all circuit seals.

797
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:16,090
Release armament safety circuit.

798
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:20,500
Cylinder exercitation rate
360 million per second.

799
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,010
All systems normal.

800
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,810
Release thrust conductor valve.

801
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:25,960
Energize artificial gravity.

802
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,363
Activate rifle radar.

803
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,214
Throttle slow to full speed ahead.

804
01:05:32,214 --> 01:05:34,464
(rumbling)

805
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,947
- [Phantom] Arcadia, lift off.

806
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:45,388
(tense music)

807
01:06:03,432 --> 01:06:05,599
(yelling)

808
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:11,950
(screaming)

809
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,080
- Where the devil did that come from?

810
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:20,663

828
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,350
Stop that ship.

829
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:48,833
Stop that ship immediately!

830
01:08:49,757 --> 01:08:52,840
(electronic buzzing)

831
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,350
- That's the Illumidus
Occupation Force radio.

832
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:01,631
(gasping)

833
01:09:01,631 --> 01:09:02,464
Emeraldas.

834
01:09:08,654 --> 01:09:11,390
- [La Mime] Maya.

835
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:14,150
- By six a.m. Earth time tomorrow

836
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,050
if you do not return
to Earth and surrender

837
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:20,470
these two female rebels
will be publicly executed.

838
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:21,370
- Why the--

839
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:24,153
- To prevent another uprising
from happening again.

840
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,480
They will be executed by a firing

841
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,113
squad at the crack of dawn.

842
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,060
- [Tochiro] No!

843
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,230
- [La Mime] We must go back.

844
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,780
We can't let them be sacrificed.

845
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,390
- An execution will definitely

846
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,230
provoke the Earthmen to revolt.

847
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,870
That spaceship is not coming back.

848
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,520
They've abandoned those two women

849
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,180
and that's enough for
us to use as propaganda.

850
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,520
- Just the opposite.

851
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,960
We've got to set an example

852
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,080
otherwise the rebels
will get more aggressive.

853
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,210
- If you cancel the execution

854
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,160
I cannot guarantee we'll have full control

855
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,030
over the Earthmen anymore.

856
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:32,099
(birds squawking)

857
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,866
(wind howling)

858
01:11:01,538 --> 01:11:03,860
- Earthmen executing Earthmen?

859
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,343
They've turned into Illumidus dogs.

860
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:10,246
(dramatic music)

861
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,303
- Are they really going to do it?

862
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,973
- After all, the spaceship did not return.

863
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:58,070
(laughing)

864
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:01,090
it seems your friends have abandoned you.

865
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,440
- The entire proceedings of this execution

866
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,133
are being transmitted to
your friends' spaceship.

867
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:13,040
This will be your last
chance to plead with them.

868
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,909
Ask them to return and save you.

869
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:16,970
- Sorry to disappoint you,

870
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:19,834
but neither of us is going to do that.

871
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:22,710
Harlock and the others
wouldn't return anyway.

872
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,090
- It bois down to the fact

873
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,210
that they are nothing
but a bunch of cowards.

874
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,860
- You wouldn't know the
real meaning of being brave.

875
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,240
You're just an ignorant alien

876
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,728
who knows nothing about Earthmen.

877
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:34,561
- What?

878
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,677
(slap thwacking)
(gasping)

879
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:46,941
You may proceed.

880
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:53,136
- Ready.

881
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:55,719
(guns cocking)

882
01:12:58,023 --> 01:12:59,532
- Harlock.

883
01:12:59,532 --> 01:13:02,532
(suspenseful music)

884
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:19,361
- Fire.
(guns firing)

885
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:22,347
(birds squawking)

886
01:13:22,347 --> 01:13:24,066
(shouting)

887
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,812
- Stop them.

888
01:13:25,812 --> 01:13:27,395
- Fire, fire, fire.

889
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:30,672
- Fire!

890
01:13:31,883 --> 01:13:36,633
(shouting)
(guns firing)

891
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,065
Stop them!

892
01:13:46,065 --> 01:13:48,565
(guns firing)

893
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:52,007
- They'll pay for this.

894
01:13:53,112 --> 01:13:56,400
(guns firing)

895
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,917
- [Man] The Earthmen and
the Torkarga soldiers

896
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:01,147
revolted and Zoll is leading the men.

897
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,008
(guns firing)

898
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:13,713
- Stay back, stay back.

899
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:17,330
(gun firing)
(gasping)

900
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:18,163
- Maya.

901
01:14:20,742 --> 01:14:25,325
(gun firing)
(gasping)

902
01:14:34,578 --> 01:14:36,995
(gun firing)

903
01:14:39,148 --> 01:14:41,565
(whimpering)

904
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,913
- Farewell my friends.

905
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,840
Forgive me for not protecting
them as I promised.

906
01:14:59,477 --> 01:15:02,227
(dramatic music)

907
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:19,983
- [Phantom] Tochiro raise the flag.

908
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,033
- [Tochiro] Raise the flag?

909
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,453
- [Phantom] Yes.

910
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,223
Raise our flag.

911
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:33,333
- [Tochiro] Alright.

912
01:15:37,882 --> 01:15:40,799
(orchestral music)

913
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,920
- [Phantom] Set Arcadia's
course for planet Torkarga.

914
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:16,533
Zoll I'll keep our promise.

915
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:20,904
(orchestral music)

916
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:02,683
- Maya.

917
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:09,610
- Emeraldas please forgive me
for thinking only of Harlock.

918
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:11,740
That's the only reason I used the radio,

919
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,790
to urge him to escape
from this terrible place

920
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:16,840
and my doing it caused the death of Zoll

921
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,910
and caused your beautiful
face to be scarred for life

922
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:24,080
and so many people have
been hurt and captured.

923
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,670
All this happened because
of my broadcasting.

924
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:30,890
I am the one who should be executed.

925
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:32,470
- That's not true.

926
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:35,190
Even without your radio sooner or later

927
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:36,450
all the people of Earth,

928
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,670
even Zoll and me would've done this.

929
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:40,880
I'm sure Harlock, Tochiro and La Mime

930
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,410
would also have done the same.

931
01:17:54,555 --> 01:17:57,110
- This is Illumidus Fleet Command.

932
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:59,250
All ships will proceed
to Earth immediately

933
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,940
as reinforcement for
Earth occupation troops.

934
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:04,390
- [Zeda] Reinforcements
for one man like Harlock?

935
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,490
Murigson.

936
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,970
- [Murigson] Yes?

937
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,830
- I am positive Harlock will return

938
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,440
and you'd better start thinking up a plan

939
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,550
of how we're going to handle it.

940
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:20,383
- [Murigson] Yes sir.

941
01:18:30,824 --> 01:18:33,241
- That's the planet Torkarga.

942
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,020
- [La Mime] That's the
planet Zoll told me about.

943
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:43,393
It used to be a beautiful
planet with rich green forests.

944
01:18:45,682 --> 01:18:48,942
(eerie music)

945
01:18:48,942 --> 01:18:51,890
- Hmm, my home and now it's been

946
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:53,583
almost completely destroyed.

947
01:18:54,859 --> 01:18:57,859
(suspenseful music)

948
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:14,200
That just shows you what
Illumidus can do to a planet.

949
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,800
The monsters.

950
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,730
- [Phantom] It looks like the planet

951
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:18,800
has already been annihilated.

952
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,530
But lets go down and have a look.

953
01:19:22,193 --> 01:19:24,943
(dramatic music)

954
01:19:50,713 --> 01:19:53,546
(thunder booming)

955
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:41,647
(blast booming)

956
01:21:10,553 --> 01:21:12,373
- [La Mime] Everything is destroyed.

957
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:15,133
There's not a single life reaction.

958
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:17,453
Torkarga is finished.

959
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,093
- Huh?

960
01:21:21,093 --> 01:21:22,029
Drones.

961
01:21:22,029 --> 01:21:24,529
(guns firing)

962
01:21:35,627 --> 01:21:38,710
(explosions booming)

963
01:21:46,095 --> 01:21:47,871
(guns firing)

964
01:21:47,871 --> 01:21:50,954
(explosions booming)

965
01:22:07,634 --> 01:22:10,634
There's an automated defense system.

966
01:22:14,444 --> 01:22:15,958
(gun firing)

967
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,059
(groaning)

968
01:22:17,059 --> 01:22:19,559
(guns firing)

969
01:22:21,899 --> 01:22:24,149
(groaning)

970
01:22:28,457 --> 01:22:31,207
(dramatic music)

971
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,883
They must've fought till the last man.

972
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:43,830
And I don't know where to start looking

973
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,163
for Zoll's sister and brother.

974
01:22:46,163 --> 01:22:50,637
- Brother Zoll come back to
Torkarga, please save us.

975
01:22:52,983 --> 01:22:57,827
Brother Zoll come back to
Torkarga, please save us.

976
01:23:05,559 --> 01:23:07,809
(rumbling)

977
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:13,141
(gun firing)

978
01:23:26,415 --> 01:23:29,415
(explosion booming)

979
01:23:36,282 --> 01:23:37,282
- Hey.
- Hey!

980
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:43,079
(laughing)
(cheering)

981
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,760
- Why you're still alive.

982
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,733
You really are alive.

983
01:23:50,184 --> 01:23:51,820
(laughing)

984
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:53,640
I'm so glad. (laughing)

985
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,303
Yes I'm so glad to find
someone still alive.

986
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:03,300
- Brother Zoll come back to
Torkarga, please save us.

987
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,480
- [La Mime] What a dreadful thing.

988
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,563
They even burnt women and children.

989
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,180
- And the Earth will be next.
- Please save us.

990
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:12,013
(gun firing)

991
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:12,872
(explosion booming)

992
01:24:12,872 --> 01:24:17,726
Brother Zoll come back to
Torkarga, please save us.

993
01:24:17,726 --> 01:24:19,720
- Brother Zoll.

994
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:24,423
Brother Zoll please help me. (groaning)

995
01:24:26,756 --> 01:24:28,173
- [La Mime] Mira.

996
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,250
- You've come back.

997
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,423
Please help me.

998
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,940
- Harlock, hurry and come back.

999
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,360
There's a planet demolition bomb

1000
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,460
right under the tower.

1001
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:39,417
(bomb whistling)

1002
01:24:39,417 --> 01:24:42,030
(explosion booming)
- Huh?

1003
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:43,712
Take care of Mira.

1004
01:24:43,712 --> 01:24:45,430
- Harlock do you hear me?

1005
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,983
We must evacuate at once.

1006
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,273
What's the matter with them?

1007
01:24:51,273 --> 01:24:53,163
Why don't they come back?

1008
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:56,670
- What is the situation on the surface?

1009
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:58,510
- We've got a big problem.

1010
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,540
A planet demolition bomb is set
right at Harlock's position.

1011
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,373
- A bomb?

1012
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,803
The Illumidus fleet.

1013
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:14,520
- All ships 45 degrees to port

1014
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,420
and cover all possible escape routes

1015
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,570
of the enemy spaceship.

1016
01:25:26,077 --> 01:25:29,827
- [Tochiro] Harlock, La
Mime, return at once.

1017
01:25:38,403 --> 01:25:39,853
- [Phantom] Arcadia lift off.

1018
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,510
Full speed gravity break away.

1019
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:06,917
(dramatic music)

1020
01:26:12,314 --> 01:26:14,731
(whimpering)

1021
01:26:23,293 --> 01:26:26,293
(explosion booming)

1022
01:26:28,612 --> 01:26:30,779
(gasping)

1023
01:26:40,372 --> 01:26:44,696
- Brother Zoll please
save Torkarga, please.

1024
01:26:44,696 --> 01:26:47,446
(dramatic music)

1025
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,990
- If we keep on this course

1026
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,960
we'll collide with the Illumidus fleet.

1027
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,410
- [Phantom] Can we lose them?

1028
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:11,180
- It's possible if we change course

1029
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,710
but then we'll be forced to go across

1030
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:15,020
the deadly Flame Stream Prominence.

1031
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,640
- The Owen Stanley Witch of Space.

1032
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,780
- That's right.

1033
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,340
The five fire streams that go
over the double sun, Besberas.

1034
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,830
The hardest part of space

1035
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:25,150
where Emeraldas ship was scorched.

1036
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:28,430
- Alright we'll do exactly
what my ancestor did.

1037
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:29,850
Change course and we'll challenge

1038
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:32,743
the Owen Stanley Witch of space.

1039
01:27:32,743 --> 01:27:35,660
(flames crackling)

1040
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:54,911
(dramatic music)

1041
01:28:03,221 --> 01:28:05,388
(gasping)

1042
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,000
- Our ship's heat resistance is higher

1043
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,563
than that of Emeraldas's ship,

1044
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:15,300
but she told me that the stream feeds

1045
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,883
off of life reaction.

1046
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,813
Thrust decrease 70%.

1047
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,833
Our defense speed is plus four.

1048
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,720
We're being pulled into
the river of flame.

1049
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,970
- She's laughing.

1050
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:39,652
The witch is laughing at us.

1051
01:28:39,652 --> 01:28:42,569
(echoing laughing)

1052
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,403
- Save me please.

1053
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:57,913
- [La Mime] It's alright Mira,
you'll see Zoll pretty soon.

1054
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:04,250
- Big brother Zoll I held
out as long as I could.

1055
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:10,801
(gasping)

1056
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:13,551
(dramatic music)

1057
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,230
- Now listen to me.

1058
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:32,600
The last Torkarga female has just died.

1059
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:36,213
Now there is no one left
to bear Torkarga children.

1060
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
The Torkarga race is now
doomed to extinction.

1061
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:47,290
Never forget that Harlock and the others

1062
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:51,303
risked their lives to try
and give Torkarga a future.

1063
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:59,213
- Thrust minus 80%, descent speed plus 10.

1064
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,093
We're descending too fast.

1065
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,326
- Tochiro maximum thrust, all engines.

1066
01:30:06,326 --> 01:30:09,243
(flames crackling)

1067
01:30:18,589 --> 01:30:20,021
- Come on.

1068
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:22,938
(echoing laughing)

1069
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,753
Hey we've started gaining thrust.

1070
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:15,290
(laughing)

1071
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:16,410
Harlock we did it.

1072
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:18,893
We beat the Owen Stanley Witch of Space.

1073
01:31:20,837 --> 01:31:23,754
(flames crackling)

1074
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:33,883
Oh, Mira.

1075
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,283
- [La Mime] It's not only Mira who died.

1076
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:40,729
- What?

1077
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:45,729
(footsteps rapidly thudding)
(dramatic music)

1078
01:32:13,335 --> 01:32:15,502
(gasping)

1079
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,800
- [La Mime] To cancel
out the life reaction

1080
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,020
which was pulling the ship down.

1081
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:25,443
- Everyone of them jumped
out into the river of flames?

1082
01:32:26,382 --> 01:32:31,382
(flames crackling)
(dramatic music)

1083
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:59,254
(orchestral music)

1084
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,070
- What, Harlock is coming back?

1085
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:16,270
Never.

1086
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:17,320
I'll alert the fleet.

1087
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,313
Intercept that ship.

1088
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:23,230
- [Zeda] Hold it.

1089
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:25,730
Let him return safely to Earth.

1090
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:27,170
- But why?

1091
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:29,520
It's only one ship, let's shoot it down.

1092
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,090
- Yes it's only one ship,

1093
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:32,330
but are we going to mobilize

1094
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:34,363
our entire fleet to shoot it down?

1095
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,540
It will only make the
Earthmen revolt again.

1096
01:33:38,465 --> 01:33:40,715
(groaning)

1097
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,650
- [Murigson] Commander
we must intercept it.

1098
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:53,930
- They have formally
requested permission to land.

1099
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:56,100
To send out our force to
shoot down a spaceship

1100
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,680
with people who voluntarily
wish to return to this planet

1101
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:03,010
where only misery awaits them
is something I cannot do.

1102
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:03,937
They are very brave people

1103
01:34:03,937 --> 01:34:06,237
and it's time we showed
them a little respect.

1104
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:12,594
- Maya Harlock is coming
back to the Earth.

1105
01:34:12,594 --> 01:34:14,140
(gasping)

1106
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,020
He even made a formal
request to Commander Zeda

1107
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,710
for permission to land here.

1108
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:23,430
- He's coming back to Earth
and he'll only suffer again.

1109
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:24,990
- I knew he would come back.

1110
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:26,683
That's the kind of man he is.

1111
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,460
The next time when his spaceship

1112
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,763
leaves Earth let's go with him.

1113
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,133
You've already done more
than enough here on Earth.

1114
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:57,630
- [Maya On Radio] This is
the voice of Free Arcadia

1115
01:34:57,630 --> 01:35:02,490
broadcasting on a new frequency,
variable microwave 8390.

1116
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,640
8390.

1117
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:10,170
This is the voice of Free Arcadia

1118
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:12,770
holding flowers in our hands.

1119
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:16,620
Let's proceed to the desert
and welcome home our hope

1120
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,510
for the future with flowers.

1121
01:35:22,011 --> 01:35:24,761
(dramatic music)

1122
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:28,375
- [La Mime] Zoll.

1123
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:51,940
- Zoll, I came back as I promised I would,

1124
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:54,903
but I came back too late, forgive me.

1125
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,693
I brought your sister Mira back with us.

1126
01:35:57,693 --> 01:36:01,505
- Come back to Torkarga, please save us.

1127
01:36:01,505 --> 01:36:05,755
Brother Zoll come back to
Torkarga, please save us.

1128
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:10,600
- [Triter] You came all the way back here

1129
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,500
just to say that to a dead man

1130
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,640
even though you knew
we'd be waiting for you?

1131
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,260
You're nothing but a stupid fool.

1132
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:22,880
- If you don't understand
I feel sorry for you.

1133
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,310
- Maybe what you've
done made you feel good,

1134
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:28,260
but it puts Earth in a
very difficult position.

1135
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,140
At present Earth has an agreement

1136
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,980
to maintain cooperative
relations with Illumidus

1137
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:35,370
even though some idiots
are planning a revolt

1138
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:36,963
they will soon be suppressed.

1139
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:40,787
We want to maintain peace on Earth

1140
01:36:40,787 --> 01:36:42,730
and a dangerous element like you

1141
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:44,860
does not fit in with our present policy

1142
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,590
and therefore our government orders you

1143
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:49,763
to be permanently exiled from Earth.

1144
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,290
- What's that?

1145
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:54,650
- If you insist on remaining here on Earth

1146
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,900
we will have no other course,

1147
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:58,250
but to order our forces to fight you.

1148
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:01,290
- You want to fight against us?

1149
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:03,170
- You happen to be enemies of Earth.

1150
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:04,383
- Enemies of Earth?

1151
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:15,480
Alright, if you say we're not

1152
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,050
welcome here than we shall leave.

1153
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:19,020
- But Harlock.

1154
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:21,200
- Harlock is right.

1155
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,010
There's no need for anyone to stay here

1156
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:25,520
and lower himself to the
level of being a pig.

1157
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,520
- Emeraldas.

1158
01:37:28,085 --> 01:37:29,599
Emeraldas.

1159
01:37:29,599 --> 01:37:32,349
(dramatic music)

1160
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:37,210
- The two of you there
listen very carefully,

1161
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:39,600
the savageness of Murigson
who shot Maya and me

1162
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,963
will long be remembered.

1163
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:45,130
And the coward traitor who shot Zoll

1164
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:47,000
will never be forgiven.

1165
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,220
The ruthlessness of you two

1166
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:51,820
who think nothing of the
life of man shall be avenged.

1167
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:52,653
- But I was--

1168
01:37:52,653 --> 01:37:54,373
- Don't bother making excuses.

1169
01:37:55,339 --> 01:37:57,963
You can never justify what you have done.

1170
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:03,000
- This is the voice of Free Arcadia.

1171
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,120
This is Maya.

1172
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:09,140
My dear Earthmen I wish to continue

1173
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,673
to stay on the air and be with you.

1174
01:38:12,677 --> 01:38:16,857
Oh, I wanted to continue being with you.

1175
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:21,230
But now I cannot keep going on.

1176
01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:22,433
Please forgive me.

1177
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:27,823
This is the last voice of Free Arcadia.

1178
01:38:27,823 --> 01:38:28,656
- Maya.

1179
01:38:29,747 --> 01:38:31,903
- This is--
- Maya, that's enough.

1180
01:38:33,168 --> 01:38:34,660
It's alright.

1181
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:37,403
- Harlock I had faith in you.

1182
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:42,130
I knew in my heart that
you would come back again.

1183
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:44,570
I knew that you would keep your promise

1184
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:47,453
even though your friend
Zoll is no longer with us.

1185
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:53,270
- We'll go together to the Sea of Stars.

1186
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:58,270
- I've been dreaming all these
years of a beautiful place.

1187
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:04,260
We used to play together
and now I will saail

1188
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:09,260
in the Arcadia with you
over the Sea of Stars.

1189
01:39:14,451 --> 01:39:15,284
- Maya.

1190
01:39:17,736 --> 01:39:19,080
- Maya.

1191
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,650
Maya.

1192
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:22,320
Why did you leave me?

1193
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,400
I had so many things to say.

1194
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,010
Maya.

1195
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:28,760
(dramatic music)

1196
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:37,150
- Everyone, Maya who kept
appealing to all of you

1197
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:40,770
to believe in a better
future for Earth is now gone

1198
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,290
and the government of Earth has just

1199
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:45,290
condemned all of us to permanent exile.

1200
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:47,980
All of you beware, for
the Earth will become

1201
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:51,593
a second Torkarga and how
will you survive that?

1202
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:54,110
I urge all of you all of you

1203
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:56,743
to remember the voice of Free Arcadia.

1204
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:59,980
- That's enough Tochiro.

1205
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:02,180
Since we've been exiled
we better leave now.

1206
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,610
Under that flag is there anyone

1207
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:16,533
among you who wants to join us?

1208
01:40:17,517 --> 01:40:20,267
(dramatic music)

1209
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:38,070
Under that flag, do you pledge to fight

1210
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:39,500
for those who believe in freedom?

1211
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,333
- I do.

1212
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,770
- You can never return.

1213
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:44,453
- The Sea of Stars will be
our home, our only home.

1214
01:40:57,977 --> 01:41:00,477
(tense music)

1215
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:07,803
- Let's go.

1216
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,360
- Keep your filthy hands off.

1217
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,400
He was my best friend.

1218
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,300
- Hold it Harlock.

1219
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:26,370
I am also a proud man and if you wish

1220
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:29,420
to depart safely you
must first go through me.

1221
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,690
- A duel?
- Yes.

1222
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:34,390
And the choice of weapons
and the place shall be mine.

1223
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:39,080
By custom a duel is fought one to one

1224
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,420
and I forbid interference.

1225
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:41,343
- Very well.

1226
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,313
- Commander you can't let
that man get away now.

1227
01:41:49,098 --> 01:41:50,574
(grunting)

1228
01:41:50,574 --> 01:41:53,574
(suspenseful music)

1229
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:58,280
- You object to my decision

1230
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,477
and you raise a weapon in defiance of me

1231
01:42:00,477 --> 01:42:02,363
and let that be the end of you.

1232
01:42:03,953 --> 01:42:06,370
(gun firing)

1233
01:42:30,472 --> 01:42:32,910
- [Maya] Now my loved one sets out

1234
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:36,320
with the flag of our freedom.

1235
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,653
Farewell until the day
you come back to me.

1236
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:41,843
I believe in you.

1237
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,230
No matter how far apart we may be

1238
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:48,587
I know that you will
never forget the Earth.

1239
01:42:49,867 --> 01:42:52,617
(dramatic music)

1240
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:14,360
No one can keep you from leaving

1241
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,116
with your flag floating high.

1242
01:43:17,116 --> 01:43:19,410
Farewell my Harlock.

1243
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:22,520
You always had faith and hope in tomorrow

1244
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,453
no matter what the circumstances.

1245
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:29,900
And I am proud to have shared
my days in the past with you.

1246
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:33,313
I pray that your future will
be the one you believe in.

1247
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,840
Farewell my dear Harlock.

1248
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,500
Live on with hope.

1249
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,433
Live forever.

1250
01:43:41,068 --> 01:43:44,180
I see it so clearly deep inside

1251
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:48,893
your heart the flame is burning,
believing in your future.

1252
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:53,804
The fire of the man who will
never betray his friends.

1253
01:43:53,804 --> 01:43:57,793
I love you and I will be apart
of the flame in your heart.

1254
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:03,487
Deep in you heart I will
be with you forever.

1255
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:06,237
(dramatic music)

1256
01:44:25,403 --> 01:44:27,236
- [Emeraldas] Harlock.

1257
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:31,720
Look at the red pirate flag on my ship.

1258
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:34,210
It's the color of Maya's blood.

1259
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:37,200
Maya's white dress dyed like her blood,

1260
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:39,060
the flag of a pirate.

1261
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,800
The red badge of freedom
that man is seeking.

1262
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:43,493
The flag of my freedom.

1263
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:49,780
- Maya was Harlock's--

1264
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:51,530
- That's right the kind of woman

1265
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:53,860
who never tired down the one she loved.

1266
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:57,190
The kind of woman even you
would've fallen in love with.

1267
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:01,429
(dramatic music)

1268
01:45:34,634 --> 01:45:35,467
- Ah?

1269
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,623
It's signaling follow me.

1270
01:45:39,610 --> 01:45:41,253
That's the Illumidus flag ship.

1271
01:45:46,918 --> 01:45:50,820
- Harlock, I've found
a true Earthman in you

1272
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:52,560
that no computer could fathom

1273
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:58,580
and Tochiro came out
the same and also Maya.

1274
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:02,700
Therefore not as commander
of the Earth Occupation Force

1275
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:06,073
but as man to man I am determined
to have a duel with you.

1276
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:11,617
And I hope you will
fight without restraint.

1277
01:46:18,062 --> 01:46:19,912
- [Woman] Contact report.

1278
01:46:19,912 --> 01:46:23,745
The Illumidus fleet
attack force of 624 ships.

1279
01:46:25,176 --> 01:46:27,343
(gasping)

1280
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,590
- I think Commander Zeda

1281
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:33,030
is trying to pull us away
in the opposite direction

1282
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:35,480
from the area the Illumidus
fleet is approaching.

1283
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:52,103
- Increase our thrust.
- Roger.

1284
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,570
We're closing fast on the enemy ship.

1285
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:36,420
- Take combat positions.

1286
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:37,963
Combat speed five.

1287
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,693
All turrets combat ready.

1288
01:48:31,503 --> 01:48:34,420
(orchestral music)

1289
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:42,550
Open all reverse jets and accelerate.

1290
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:45,113
- [Tochiro] Roger, reduce
to combat speed three.

1291
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:54,223
- Port side gunner
aligned, stand by to fire.

1292
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:58,180
Fire at 0.1 garm intervals.

1293
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:00,123
30 micro-garms before volley.

1294
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:06,710
- Relative velocity, 128,000.

1295
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:09,743
Altitude variance zero.

1296
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,620
Main gun tracking speed in sync.

1297
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:16,563
10 seconds before discharge.

1298
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:24,680
Eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.

1299
01:49:28,490 --> 01:49:29,795
- Fire.

1300
01:49:29,795 --> 01:49:30,959
- Fire.

1301
01:49:30,959 --> 01:49:33,459
(guns firing)

1302
01:49:37,819 --> 01:49:38,990
(yelling)

1303
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:41,490
(guns firing)

1304
01:49:54,847 --> 01:49:57,930
(explosions booming)

1305
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:01,027

1306
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:05,359
- Port side aft dispatch
damage control team.

1307
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:07,859
(guns firing)

1308
01:50:13,742 --> 01:50:15,180
- Give me a damage assessment report.

1309
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:17,370
- [Woman] Port launching tube disabled.

1310
01:50:17,370 --> 01:50:19,430
- [Man] Port exhaust valve damaged.

1311
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:22,323
- Number 16 hold and the rear
of the airship have been hit.

1312
01:50:27,088 --> 01:50:30,255
- [Phantom] Hard to port, 180 degrees.

1313
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:35,430
- Reduce speed and hard to starboard, 180.

1314
01:50:36,704 --> 01:50:39,454
(dramatic music)

1315
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,420
Vertical angle, vector octave.

1316
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:58,790
Range six million vols.

1317
01:50:58,790 --> 01:51:00,880
Synchronize all starboard turrets.

1318
01:51:01,884 --> 01:51:04,801
(orchestral music)

1319
01:51:10,692 --> 01:51:11,877
Fire.

1320
01:51:11,877 --> 01:51:13,163
- Fire.

1321
01:51:13,163 --> 01:51:15,663
(guns firing)

1322
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,487
(yelling)

1323
01:51:28,616 --> 01:51:31,488
(guns firing)

1324
01:51:31,488 --> 01:51:33,655
(yelling)

1325
01:51:35,165 --> 01:51:37,832
- [Man] Port side guns disabled.

1326
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,990
(dramatic music)

1327
01:51:46,083 --> 01:51:48,000
- Tochiro are you alright?

1328
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,373
- I'm alright, but see that?

1329
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:55,253
The automatic firing
sight, it's been destroyed.

1330
01:52:01,469 --> 01:52:03,620
(suspenseful music)

1331
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:06,030
- Transfer all personnel
from the side pod hull

1332
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:08,860
to the center master control ship at once.

1333
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:12,600
I repeat, transfer all
personnel from the side pod hull

1334
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,963
to the center master control ship at once.

1335
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:24,093
- You've got the answer?
- Yes.

1336
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,490
A manual sight, it's right in here.

1337
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:29,423
- A manual sight.

1338
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:32,210
- Look.
- Why that's--

1339
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:36,303
- Yes, the original sight your
ancestor gave to my ancestor.

1340
01:52:38,061 --> 01:52:40,811
(dramatic music)

1341
01:52:46,438 --> 01:52:50,740
- And this, it's what tied our
ancestors together, the eye.

1342
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:51,573
- Our eye.

1343
01:52:52,439 --> 01:52:55,189
(dramatic music)

1344
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,140
- [Phantom] Here he comes.

1345
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:21,170
- Roger.

1346
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,553
Maintain course and speed.

1347
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:29,920
- Eject both of the side pod
hulls and full combat speed.

1348
01:53:33,625 --> 01:53:35,309
(gasping)

1349
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:36,142
- [La Mime] And Zeda's center

1350
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:38,250
control ship hasn't been damaged.

1351
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:40,800
- [Phantom] Concentrate
fire on the central bridge.

1352
01:53:41,830 --> 01:53:43,783
- I hope this sight is going to work.

1353
01:53:52,433 --> 01:53:54,903
- Tochiro open fire.
- Roger.

1354
01:53:56,226 --> 01:53:58,726
(guns firing)

1355
01:54:11,729 --> 01:54:13,649
(laughing)

1356
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:16,429
- That's it Tochiro, give him a broadside.

1357
01:54:16,429 --> 01:54:17,981
(laughing)

1358
01:54:17,981 --> 01:54:20,481
(guns firing)

1359
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:31,173
(screaming)

1360
01:54:37,898 --> 01:54:39,965
(explosions booming)

1361
01:54:39,965 --> 01:54:41,430
- Keep firing.

1362
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:43,930
(guns firing)

1363
01:54:54,111 --> 01:54:56,370
- You alright Tochiro?

1364
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:58,760
- I'm still alive I guess,

1365
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:02,053
but if they come back and attack
us one more time forget it.

1366
01:55:12,468 --> 01:55:14,070
(explosion booming)
(screaming)

1367
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:16,213
- All personnel abandon ship.

1368
01:55:36,862 --> 01:55:39,612
(dramatic music)

1369
01:55:46,933 --> 01:55:49,840
- [Phantom] Zeda's turning back
for another frontal attack.

1370
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,113
- And I can't guarantee
what'll happen this time.

1371
01:56:02,030 --> 01:56:03,633
He's coming directly at us.

1372
01:56:03,633 --> 01:56:05,710
- Zeda is a brave man.

1373
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:07,390
Years ago there used to be a lot

1374
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:09,023
of brave men like him on Earth.

1375
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:11,740
- He's going to hit us head on.

1376
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:13,700
This is it, here goes.

1377
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:15,253
- Tochiro, hold your fire.

1378
01:56:17,945 --> 01:56:19,940
- Harlock you fought very well.

1379
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:22,783
When we meet in hell let's
have a drink together.

1380
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:28,140
Till then guard your life
and keep living and fighting

1381
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:30,963
to accomplish that long
cherished dream of yours.

1382
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,533
Now farewell.

1383
01:56:35,702 --> 01:56:38,543
(gasping)

1384
01:56:38,543 --> 01:56:41,293
(dramatic music)

1385
01:56:44,031 --> 01:56:47,031
(explosion booming)

1386
01:56:56,756 --> 01:56:59,506
(dramatic music)

1387
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:13,077
(yelling)

1388
01:57:18,929 --> 01:57:23,012
- [Phantom] Farewell Zeda,
I'll meet you in hell.

1389
01:57:42,414 --> 01:57:43,247
- Harlock.

1390
01:57:44,230 --> 01:57:46,050
Commander Zeda led us to a position

1391
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:48,890
where we can escape from
the Illumidus fleet,

1392
01:57:48,890 --> 01:57:51,993
but only if we reverse
course now and accelerate.

1393
01:57:57,730 --> 01:57:59,960
- This is our new start on life.

1394
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:01,650
I'd hate to be called a coward

1395
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:03,910
who turned and ran after his first battle.

1396
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:06,140
Tochiro what do you think about it?

1397
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:08,590
- Well I don't want to
show my back to the enemy.

1398
01:58:14,270 --> 01:58:15,650
- I can see that anyone who goes

1399
01:58:15,650 --> 01:58:17,670
against you is in for trouble.

1400
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:19,700
- A pirate must live a pirate's life

1401
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:21,730
and this is the way of
life we have chosen.

1402
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:23,772
Action stations.

1403
01:58:23,772 --> 01:58:26,883
Full speed ahead, prepare for combat.

1404
01:58:27,927 --> 01:58:30,844
(orchestral music)

1405
01:58:41,390 --> 01:58:42,760
- He's trying to escape.

1406
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:45,430
All ships fly in point,
open fire with energy bolts

1407
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:47,143
and destroy that pirate ship.

1408
01:58:49,759 --> 01:58:52,259
(guns firing)

1409
01:58:55,465 --> 01:58:58,300
- [Man] Captain, all advanced ships report

1410
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,600
that their energy bolts
failed to go straight.

1411
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:04,320
Computer side estimation
readouts are all wrong.

1412
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,173
- What?

1413
01:59:07,889 --> 01:59:09,840
- [Tochiro] Harlock, the magnetic field

1414
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,040
and dimension wave around us

1415
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:14,010
are showing an extraordinary phenomenon.

1416
01:59:14,010 --> 01:59:15,460
- [Phantom] What's that mean?

1417
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:17,840
- It looks normal to the naked eye,

1418
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,160
but the instruments can't read

1419
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:21,400
the exact position of the enemy ships.

1420
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:24,140
- The explosion of Zeda's
ship must've done it.

1421
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:25,940
When his high powered engines blew up

1422
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:28,640
they must've warped space
over a very large area

1423
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:32,460
and I'll bet he did it
intentionally just to protect us.

1424
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:34,200
Alright, frontal attack.

1425
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,158
We'll board their flagship.

1426
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:38,658
(guns firing)

1427
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:01,048
- Don't stop, keep on firing.

1428
02:00:01,048 --> 02:00:06,048
(guns firing)
(orchestral music)

1429
02:00:17,812 --> 02:00:20,225
(gasping)

1430
02:00:20,225 --> 02:00:23,142
(orchestral music)

1431
02:00:49,705 --> 02:00:51,872
(gasping)

1432
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:56,000
This is no way to fight.

1433
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,440
- It isn't in the rule book, too bad

1434
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,788
because this is a pirate's way to fight.

1435
02:01:00,788 --> 02:01:01,621
(gun firing)

1436
02:01:01,621 --> 02:01:03,011
(groaning)

1437
02:01:03,011 --> 02:01:05,894
(yelling)

1438
02:01:05,894 --> 02:01:08,311
(gun firing)

1439
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:14,300
This is a lesson to teach you

1440
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:16,593
to sheer off when you see my flag.

1441
02:01:24,733 --> 02:01:29,733
(air whooshing)
(screaming)

1442
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,850
Both engines, full break away speed.

1443
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:36,943
And set a course for the Sea of Stars.

1444
02:01:38,251 --> 02:01:41,334
(explosions booming)

1445
02:02:34,907 --> 02:02:37,657
(dramatic music)

1446
02:02:40,816 --> 02:02:44,520
Whatever the spirit is that
governs the universe and space

1447
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:48,070
let my friend Zoll and Mira the last

1448
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:51,513
Torkarga female return to your bosom.

1449
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:01,933
Now let Zoll and Mira
rest in peace forever.

1450
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,213
- Farewell my friends.

1451
02:03:05,299 --> 02:03:08,049
(dramatic music)

1452
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:31,930
- [Phantom] Somewhere at the
point where the rings of time

1453
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:34,543
come in contact we shall meet again.

1454
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:39,113
Goodbye Maya.

1455
02:03:40,072 --> 02:03:43,620
Till the last moment of my
life in the Sea of Stars

1456
02:03:43,620 --> 02:03:45,543
the memory of you will stay with me.

1457
02:03:53,049 --> 02:03:55,794
- [Tochiro] Ready Harlock?

1458
02:03:55,794 --> 02:03:58,544
(dramatic music)

1459
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:26,550
- The Sea of Stars, we submit

1460
02:04:26,550 --> 02:04:28,100
our loved ones into your hands.

1461
02:04:29,425 --> 02:04:32,175
(dramatic music)

1462
02:05:03,197 --> 02:05:05,690
We will never surrender to anyone.

1463
02:05:05,690 --> 02:05:08,220
We will never seek help from others.

1464
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:10,830
We will never fight under any other flag

1465
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:15,783
