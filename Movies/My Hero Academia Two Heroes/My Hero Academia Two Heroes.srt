Sorry, kid, it’s
not gonna happen.

126
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,406
[IZUKU]
My name is Izuku Midoriya,

127
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,910
and I was born without
any special power.

128
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,452
I was Quirkless.

129
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,695
Because of that, I almost
gave up on my dream

of becoming a hero.

131

But my life changed completely
when I met the number‐one pro.

The person I’d admired
my entire life.

134
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,721
[IZUKU]
Is it possible to become a hero,

135
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
even if I don’t have a Quirk?

136
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,137
I’m a normal kid
without any powers.

137
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,272
Could I ever hope to
be someone like you?

138
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,809
[ALL MIGHT] There are
stories about every hero.

139
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:01,735
How they became great.
Most have one thing in common.

140
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,905
Their bodies moved before
they had a chance to think.

141
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:06,986

142
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,492
What the hell? Why are you here?

143
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,815
Kacchan!

144
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,238
I couldn’t just stand there
and watch you die!

145
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,332
You, too, can become a hero.

146
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,747
There’s nothing natural
about my ability.

147
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,339
I wasn’t born with this power.

148
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,633
It’s a sacred torch that was

149
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,586
passed on to me
from someone else.

150
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,216
I can transfer my
Quirk to another.

151
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,345
And that’s just one facet
of my secret abilities.

152
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,854
The true name of my
power is One For All.

153
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,517
One For All.

154
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,027
[ALL MIGHT]
One person improves the power.

155
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,452
Then hands it off
to another person.

156
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,619
It continues to grow
as it’s passed along.

157
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,029
It is this cultivated
power that allows me

158
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,448
to save those who are
in need of a hero.

159
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,907
The truth behind my strength.

Young Midoriya, you’re next.

161
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,289
I can give you my abilities.

162
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,958
[IZUKU] After I received
All Might’s Quirk,

163
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,388
I enrolled in a prestigious
hero course at UA High School.

164
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,140
I began running
toward my dreams.

165
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,351
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

166
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,432
with a smile on my face

167
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,309
in order to become the
world’s greatest hero.

168
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,646
[VOICE 1A] We will now begin
the immigration process.

169
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,406
Let’s test your
trivia, young man.

170
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,162
Why was this artificial
island created?

171
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,754
I know this.

172
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,459
It was built so the world’s
brightest minds could

173
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,121
gather together
to research Quirks

174
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,379
and develop new
hero support items!

175
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,380
They made the island moveable
in order to protect

176
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,302
the scientists and
their top‐secret research

177
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,762
from villains.

178
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,342
It’s got a security system
on par with the one

179
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,755
at the Tartarus prison,
so basically,

180
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,723
no one has ever
committed a crime here.

181
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,024
Way too many details,
but I should’ve expected that.

182
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,063
[VOICE 1A] The immigration
inspection is complete.

183
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,863
The island is currently holding
the pre‐opening of I‐Expo,

184
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,479
an event that showcases research

185
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,147
and development
projects our teams

186
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,775
have been working on.

187
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,490
Only those with invitations
may attend the preview.

188
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,284
[laughs]

189
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,960
[ALL MIGHT] I can’t believe
so many people are here

190
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,130
before the expo is officially
opened to the public.

191
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,630
[IZUKU]
No way!

192
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,461
The pictures of this place
don’t do it justice!

193
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,467
[ALL MIGHT] Unlike back
in Japan, people are allowed

194
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,180
to use their Quirks however
they wish on this island.

195
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,301
The pavilions are
jam‐packed with attractions

196
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,007
and demonstrations.
Make some time for them later.

197
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,470
[IZUKU]
I will!

198
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,558
Now let’s see, the
hotel should be nearby.

199
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,603
[WOMAN]
Welcome to I‐Expo.

200
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,858
[gasps] S’that you, All Might?

201
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:49,862
Is he really here?

202
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,403
Wow, the number‐one hero!

203
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,364
We need an interview.

204
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,815
Let’s get closer!

205
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,413
‐‐[ALL MIGHT laughing]
‐‐[CROWD clammoring]

206
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,489
[ALL MIGHT] Thank you so much
for the warm welcome!

207
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,995
Form a line for
autographs, please!

208
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,457
Oh, wow, I didn’t think I’d
get stopped for so long.

209
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,842
I’m afraid at this point
we’re in terrible danger

210
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,711
of being late.

211
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,417
Late to what?

212
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,585
[ALL MIGHT] Ah. I wanted to drop
in on a dear old pal of mine

213
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,554
who I haven’t seen
in quite a while.

214
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,426
Sorry to spring it on you,
but would you mind coming along?

215
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,642
You mean I’d get to meet
one of your friends?

216
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,523
Obviously, of course I’ll go!

217
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,061
[whispering] By the way,
I haven’t told him

218
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,775
about One For All
or how I’ve passed

219
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,103
the Quirk on to you,

220
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,688
so keep everything
under wraps, okay?

221
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,442
[IZUKU] Whoa, not even
your close friend knows?

222
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,775
Only because danger
tends to follow anyone

223
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,901
who knows the truth
about my power.

224
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,700
Oh, yeah, I see. For
their safety, of course.

225
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,123
[IZUKU] I can’t forget
how important it is to keep

226
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,123
One For All a secret.

227
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,375
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya.

228
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,037
Because you have
inherited my power,

229
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,956
you now bear a heavy burden.

230
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,713
Since I failed in the past,

231
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:56,376
you’ll one day have to face
the great evil of All For One.

232
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,006
[IZUKU]
That’s right.

233
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,642
I have to keep training so
I’m ready when the time comes.

234
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,430
I must learn to master
One For All, as soon as I can!

235
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,231
There you are, Uncle! Finally!

236
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,944
[MELISSA]
Welcome, Uncle Might!

237
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,028
[ALL MIGHT] It’s so good
to see you, Melissa!

238
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,701
Oh, my gosh, it’s been forever.

239
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,700
I can’t believe
you’re actually here!

240
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,412
I’m truly grateful
for the invitation.

241
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,243
I almost didn’t recognize you.

242
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,248
When did you go
and get so grown up?

243
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,290
Well, I am 17 now you know!

244
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,325
Much heavier than the
last time you saw me.

245
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,247
Are you? No.

246
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,296
[ALL MIGHT laughing]

247
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,761
Glad to see you’re looking well,
though I suppose you always are.

248
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,971
[IZUKU] Wait, this is
All Might’s old friend?

249
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,644
They must’ve met when she
was just a kid or something.

250
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,023
Or maybe her Quirk
makes her look young?

251
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,179
And Dave? Where’s he hiding?

252
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,438
[MELISSA giggles]
Oh, he’s in his lab.

253
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,151
He had a breakthrough
on some research

254
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,732
he’s been focusing on for years.

255
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,985
Actually, he has no idea
you’re even here;

256
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,609
this is just a little surprise
to celebrate his work.

257
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,535
So that’s what this is about.

258
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,573
Give me the scoop then.

259
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,486
What is he cooking up this time?

260
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,946
[MELISSA]
He said it’s confidential.

261
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,446
He won’t even tell me
what he’s been doing.

262
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,537
[ALL MIGHT]
Scientists and their secrets.

263
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,212
Oh, right, Young Midoriya.

264
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,461
Allow me to introduce you
to my friend Dave’s daughter.

265
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,174
It’s really nice to meet you.

266
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,416
I’m Melissa Shield.

267
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,966
This makes more sense now.

268
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,471
Huh, what’s that?

269
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,431
Uh‐‐ Nothing! Uh, hi, it’s
really nice to meet you.

270
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,103
I’m a first‐year student
at UA High School.

271
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,312
Izuku Midoriya.

272
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,603
In the hero course?

273
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,476
So that’s how you
know Uncle Might.

274
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,193
Uh‐huh, I’m his student.

275
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,905
He’ll be a great pro one day.

276
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,153
[gasps] I can’t believe
I’m meeting someone

277
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,817
that Uncle Might teaches!

278
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,663
You must have
a promising future.

279
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,409
Well, I hope so, but I
have a lot to learn.

280
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,871
Tons of training!

281
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,243
[MELISSA] So, what kind
of Quirk do you have?

282
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,158
[IZUKU]
It’s a power type!

283
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,538
The costume’s cool.

284
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,874
Though it’s a pretty
simplistic design.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,630
Huh, I don’t see any
support items either.

286
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,341
[IZUKU]
She’s so close to me!

287
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,463
[gasps]

288
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,008
[MELISSA] It looks like
you should think about

289
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,931
upgrading your gear a bit.

290
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,510
[ALL MIGHT clears throat]
Melissa, shall we?

291
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,806
Oh! Sorry, I got
distracted. Heh.

292
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,482
If we hurry, we can
surprise Papa in his lab!

293
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,692
This way, Uncle Might.

294
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,022
It’s right over here.

295
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:25,242
[phone ringing]

296
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,285
[WOLFRAM] We infiltrated
the expo without a problem.

297
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,448
So? When do the goods arrive?

298
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,996
[VOICE] Three PM. You’ll
find them at Gate 66.

299
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,002
Then we’ll be waiting.

300
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,353
[SAM]
Excuse me. Um, Professor?

301
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,891
[SAM] I’ve finished putting
the equipment away,

302
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,477
just so you know.

303
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,980
[DAVID]
Already? Thanks so much, Sam.

304
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,614
[SAM] Why don’t you get
out of the lab today

305
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,362
and go have some
lunch with Melissa?

306
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,442
She’s busy today
at the Academy.

307
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,909
Oh? I thought they were
on break for I‐Expo.

308
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,740
Yes, but she’s doing
independent research.

309
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,085
You know me, I am
my father’s daughter.

310
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,240
For better and for worse.

311
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,538
Melissa, hey!

312
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,411
Hello, Miss, it’s
so good to see you.

313
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,418
Aw, right back at ya, Sam.

314
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,040
Thanks for always
taking care of Papa,

315
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,547
since he does nothing
but work here constantly.

316
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,919
Come on, I’m not that bad.

317
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,966
To what do we owe the pleasure?

318
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,592
Oh, you’ll see.

319
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,088
Since you completed the first
stage of your research,

320
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,598
I invited someone here
to celebrate with us.

321
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,272
Who would that be?

322
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,391
[MELISSA]
A person you dearly love.

323
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,266
[gasps]

324
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,942
Yes, I am here!

325
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,230
Shaking with emotion for
our heartfelt reunion!

326
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,646
[DAVID]
Toshi‐‐ A‐All Might?

327
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,448
Is it really you?

328
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,332
[laughs] I came all this
way just to see you,

329
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,701
Dave, old buddy.

330
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,365
Well, Papa, are you
totally surprised?

331
00:15:55,455 --> 00:16:00,505
Uh. Yeah. Completely astounded.

332
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,246
We both have Melissa
to thank for that.

333
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,797
Man, how long has it been?

334
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,011
Oh, now, come on.
Don’t make me say it.

335
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,093
I already feel
old enough, ya jerk.

336
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,467
[BOTH laugh]

337
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,975
You do have a point.

338
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,637
Glad to see you
again, my friend.

339
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,306
Agreed. I’ve missed you, too.

340
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,646
[ALL MIGHT laughs]

341
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,021
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya.

342
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,229
Let me introduce you
to someone incredible.

343
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,528
David Shield.

344
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,612
I know him!
Professor David Shield!

345
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,356
A top scientist in
the research world

346
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,160
who received a
Nobel Quirk Prize!

347
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,831
He was All Might’s partner
when he lived in America.

348
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,501
And he’s a genius when
it comes to costumes.

349
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,120
All Might’s Young Age.

350
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,577
Bronze Age.

351
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,416
The Silver Age.

352
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,752
And, of course, the Golden Age.

353
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,758
He’s the inventor who created
each of those iconic looks!

354
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,681
I never thought I’d get
to meet him in real life.

355
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,600
I’m just so moved!

356
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,009
[giggles]

357
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,019
It seems I don’t have
to introduce myself.

358
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,349
[IZUKU]
Uh‐‐ Oh, wow. I’m sorry!

359
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,437
No, don’t apologize.

360
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,361
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

361
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,857
[DAVID]
Listen, it’s been a long time.

362
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,525
Can the two of you
give All Might and me

363
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,862
a little time to catch up?

364
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,277
[IZUKU]
Yeah. Of course!

365
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,705
Melissa. Why don’t you
take our new friend

366
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,195
on a tour around the expo?

367
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,195
[MELISSA] Sure thing,
Papa. Sounds like fun.

368
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,619
You’re not busy?

369
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,415
No, I’m honored to
show off our hard work

370
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,711
to a future hero.
Right this way.

371
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,714
Thanks! This is so nice of you!

372
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,797
Sam. You should
take a break, too.

373
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,335
[MELISSA] So, what do you
want me to call you?

374
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,508
By your real name, or do
you have a hero one already?

375
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,428
[IZUKU]
Well, actually...

376
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,690
Why don’t you call me Deku?

377
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,980
Deku? That’s kind of
a strange nickname.

378
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,645
You can stick with
Melissa for me.

379
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,904
See you two soon.

380
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,654
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

381
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,908
Hey. Are you all right, Toshi?

382
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,282
[ALL MIGHT]
Thanks for catching it.

383
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,330
The amount of time I
can keep my muscle form

384
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,582
has gotten even shorter.

385
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,165
You said it was bad
in your email.

386
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,578
But I had no idea
it was this serious.

387
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,749
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

388
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,679
[IZUKU] Holy whoa!
This place is amazing.

389
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,050
I can’t believe the
entire island is man‐made.

390
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:17,928
It’s nuts.

391
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,515
And there’s normal city stuff.

392
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,599
About everything you could need.

393
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,734
The big downside
is we can’t travel.

394
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,191
[IZUKU]
Really? Why not?

395
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,651
[MELISSA] The scientists
and their families

396
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,522
have to keep their
work top secret.

397
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,108
That ensures there
aren’t any leaks.

398
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:35,202
[gasps] It’s the
Monster Hero, Godzillo!

399
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,741
Wow, I’ve only ever
seen him on TV!

400
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,695
His Quirk is so insane!

401
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,075
[MELISSA]
Nice. I bet a sponsor

402
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,122
flew him out here for the expo.

403
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,207
[MELISSA] They invite heroes
to show off new gear

404
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,581
and sign autographs.

405
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,627
Looks like the events
are in full swing.

406
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,341
[IZUKU]
This place is incredible!

407
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,263
A lot of the pro heroes will
be at the big party tonight.

408
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,841
Ah, but I’m sure you already
knew about that, huh?

409
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,809
I mean, since you came all
this way with Uncle Might.

410
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,640
[IZUKU] Oh, so I guess
that’s why he told me

411
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,394
to bring formal clothes.
Glad I found some.

412
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,147
[MELISSA]
Look! Over here!

413
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,478
You definitely have
to check this place out.

414
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,315
[IZUKU] I’ve never seen so many
new hero items in one place!

415
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,992
Deku, look at this one!

416
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,571
This multipurpose Beagle can
fly like a jet, of course,

417
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,027
but it can also move underwater.

418
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,289
So cool!

419
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,869
[MELISSA] You can wear
this diving suit and drop

420
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,495
up to 7,000 meters in the ocean.

421
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,043
So deep!

422
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,126
This helmet is equipped
with 36 different sensors,

423
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,340
so you can see all the
way around your body.

424
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,172
That’s so much!

425
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,875
[MELISSA] You know, almost
everything here was created

426
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,008
using different inventions
that Papa patented.

427
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,176
Wow. I bet you’re proud of him.

428
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,893
These support items
will help heroes

429
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,135
around the world.
Who knows how many people

430
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,186
will be affected because
of his hard work.

431
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,982
I think it’s great that
your dad is someone

432
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,024
you can look up to like this.

433
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,609
That’s because it’s my dream

434
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,993
to become a scientist
just like him.

435
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,530
[IZUKU]
Oh, yeah?

436
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,783
So does that mean
you’re training

437
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,574
at the school here
on the island?

438
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,240
[MELISSA]
Mm‐hm. I’m a third year.

439
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,748
The I‐Island Academy is
where everyone who dreams

440
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,500
of becoming a scientist
wants to go.

441
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,960
You must be a real genius!

442
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,170
Oh, no, I’ve still
got a lot to learn.

443
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:15,462
Honestly, I should be
studying much more.

444
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,758
I feel the same.

445
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,882
If I’m gonna be a
hero like All Might,

446
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,428
I’ve gotta train even harder.

447
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,514
Uncle Might really
holds a special place

448
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,267
in your heart, doesn’t he, Deku?

449
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,891
I still can’t get over how much
you were geeking out earlier.

450
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,348
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

451
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,518
I’m kind of a fanboy.

452
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,685
[giggles]

453
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,033
Looks like you’re
having fun, Deku.

454
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,779
Uh‐‐! Huh, Uraraka?
What are you doing here?

455
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,664
It looks like you’re having fun.

456
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,660
[IZUKU]
You said that.

457
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,451
[YAOYOROZU clears throat]

458
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,736
[IZUKU]
Yaoyorozu?

459
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,079
You appear to be
having a good time.

460
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,253
[JIRO]
Midoriya. I heard everything.

461
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,381
[IZUKU] Jiro’s Earphone Jack!
The ultimate spy tech.

462
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,630
Are these your friends?

463
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,843
Uh, yeah, these
are my classmates.

464
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,011
And I didn’t tell
them I’d be here.

465
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,930
Oh, guys, this is
my friend Melissa.

466
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,640
She was just showing me around
the Expo a little bit.

467
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,052
Nice to meet you.

468
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,258
My dad and Uncle Might
are really good fr‐‐

469
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,639
[IZUKU screams]

470
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,386
[IZUKU whispering] I’m sorry.
Please don’t tell them

471
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,516
I came here as All Might’s
guest. It’s kind of

472
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,062
a big secret, okay?

473
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,525
[whispering] But why is that?

474
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,655
[IZUKU whispering] Because
reasons? I beg you.

475
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,114
[whispering] Your secret’s safe.

476
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,283
How about we all grab
some tea at the café?

477
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,624
[MELISSA] Wow! You really
got to work with pro heroes?

478
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,123
Like, out in the field?

479
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,873
Just normal training
and a few patrols.

480
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,785
I helped out with
a hostage crisis,

481
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,666
but only the evacuation part.

482
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,173
That’s still amazing, though.

483
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,504
Somehow, I ended up
in a TV commercial

484
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,800
for hair products.

485
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:42,091
Sounds like an
experience. Lucky.

486
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,176
We were thinking about going
to check out the pavilion

487
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,143
where the Academy’s
exhibit is tomorrow.

488
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,932
[OCHACO]
I’m really excited!

489
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,135
[IZUKU] I’m saved. They’re
not questioning anything.

490
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,978
[KAMINARI]
Thanks for waiting.

491
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,732
I know that voice.

492
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,944
Kaminari!

493
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,113
[OCHACO]
Is that... Mineta?

494
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,612
[JIRO]
What’re you two doing here?

495
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,493
They needed extra wait
staff, and since it meant

496
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,532
a free trip to the island,
we applied to work. Right?

497
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,157
We get to explore the
expo on our breaks.

498
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,583
And we make some money.

499
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,251
Plus, there’s the chance
we’ll have passionate

500
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,119
encounters with
some of the cute‐‐

501
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,996
Oh, my god, I think I’m in love.

502
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,924
[whispering] Hey, Midoriya,
who’s that high‐voltage

503
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,001
hottie over there?

504
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,547
Don’t be greedy, introduce us.

505
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,921
Well... That’s, um...

506
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,835
[MELISSA]
Are they also your classmates?

507
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:22,974
That’s right.

508
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,760
We’re basically pros.

509
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,354
[TENYA]
Why are you two slacking off?

510
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,178
You wanted to make
more money didn’t you?

511
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,974
But you’re not willing
to work hard?

512
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,017
[BOTH scream]

513
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,391
[IZUKU]
Wait, Iida?

514
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,598
You’re here, too?

515
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,686
[TENYA] I come from
a long line of heroes.

516
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,113
It’s to be expected
that we received

517
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,979
an invitation to the Expo.

518
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,986
But my family was busy,
so it’s just me.

519
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,569
I wondered if you’d be here.

520
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,316
I received an invitation because
my father’s a shareholder

521
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,327
in some of the expo’s
sponsor companies.

522
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,329
It’s so fun to get
to go to the preview.

523
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,751
Yeah. And she had
a few extra plus ones,

524
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,372
so we basically gambled for ’em.

525
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,706
[GIRLS]
No hard feelings, whoever wins.

526
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,544
Rock, papers, scissors.

527
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,419
My life is over!

528
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,666
[JIRO] So, after an
impartial game of chance,

529
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,546
the two of us ended up joining
the fun as her guests.

530
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,755
The other girls are here,

531
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,007
they just can’t
visit the preview.

532
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,556
Oh, are they really?

533
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,221
Uh‐huh. We’re all planning
to look around together

534
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,849
once the expo opens up
to the public tomorrow.

535
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,095
Here’s a thought.

536
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,598
Why don’t I show you
girls the sights?

537
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,900
You’re sure you have time?

538
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,273
[MELISSA]
Mm‐hm!

539
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,859
[OCHACO, JIRO, YAOYOROZU]
That’s awesome!

540
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,242
[MINETA, KAMINARI]
Please take us with you!

541
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,320
‐‐[rumbling]
‐‐Whoa, what was that noise?

542
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,158
[MC 1AA]
A clearance time of 33 seconds.

543
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,043
He’s in eighth place!

544
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,580
[IZUKU]
Kirishima?

545
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,793
So I’m guessing he’s
from UA, as well?

546
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,916
Yeah, he’s in the
same class as us.

547
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,843
[MC 1AA] Please welcome
our next challenger!

548
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,422
Kacchan?

549
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,046
[MC 1AA] The Villain Attack
course has been reset.

550
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,764
Ready. Go!

00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,441
Die!

552
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,101
[IZUKU]
"Die"?

553
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,609
[MC 1AA] Look at that time!
Only 15 seconds!

554
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,113
First place!

[KIRISHIMA] Hey. Isn’t that
Midoriya in the stands?

00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,083
[laughs nervously]

[yelps]

Damn it! What are you
doing here, Deku?

560
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,538
Uh, hey there, Kacchan.

00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,289
Bakugo, behave yourself!

564
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,248
[MELISSA]
Why is that boy so angry?

565
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,917
[JIRO]
That’s just who he is.

566
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,795
[OCHACO]
He and Deku are fated rivals.

567
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,342
So, Kirishima, you two got
asked to I‐Expo as well?

568
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,469
Nah, Bakugo was invited

569
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,806
since he won the
UA Sports Festival.

570
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,640
I just tagged along with him.

571
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,475
You guys gonna do this
villain course, or what?

572
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,103
Don’t even try it.

573
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,148
There’s no way you’ll get
a better score than I did.

574
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,822
Yeah. You’re prob’ly right. Yep.

575
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Huh. I’m not so sure. Only one
way to find out, I guess.

576
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,777
Yeah. You’re prob’ly right.

577
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,203
Huh?!

578
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,993
Just hurry and get your
pathetic attempt over,

579
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,745
you damn nerd. Then
you get outta here!

580
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,408
[IZUKU]
Right. I’ll do that.

581
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,956
[MC 1AA]
We’ve got a new challenger

582
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,669
coming in at the last minute!

583
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:05,339
Will he end up on top, or fail
in front of the entire Expo?

584
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,722
[IZUKU] If I’m doing this,
I’m gonna go for it.

[IZUKU]
One for All... Full Cowling!

Ready. Go!

588
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,440
[IZUKU]
To keep from injuring my arm,

589
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,440
I’ll use five percent
of my power!

590
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,571
[MC 1AA]
An incredible run!

591
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,789
He’s in second place
at 16 seconds!

[CROWD cheers]

593
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,959
[MELISSA]
He has such explosive speed.

594
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,210
And that destructive power.

595
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,382
It’s just like Uncle Might’s!

But...

Wow!

That was a good
showing, Midoriya.

599

I didn’t think I’d be
able to get so close

00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,967
to Kacchan’s time.

601
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,394

and blast your score to ash!

to the top of the pack!

You can’t just appear outta
nowhere and show me up!

I’ll say that much, at least.

629
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,744
[OCHACO, JIRO]
True.

630
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:01,286
[phone ringing]

631
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,121
[WOLFRAM] I picked up
the goods as planned.

632
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,879
What? All Might’s here now?

633
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,961
It doesn’t matter. We can
handle him, no problem.

634
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,640
[WOLFRAM]
Of course he had to show up.

635
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,356
[gasps]

636
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,399
[DAVID]
I don’t get it, Toshi.

637
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,488
Why are your Quirk levels
going down so dramatically?

638
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,407
I know you were seriously
injured by All For One,

639
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,365
but to suddenly get
these numbers is absurd.

640
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,668
What in the world
happened to you?

641
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,671
[coughs] I suppose if you’re
a hero for a long time,

642
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,675
your body starts to fall apart.

643
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,298
[ALL MIGHT] I wish I could
tell him the truth

644
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,175
about One For All.

645
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,602
But if I did,

646
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,310
I’d risk getting him
and Melissa caught up

647
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,890
in the fight
against All For One.

648
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:11,107
[DAVID] At this rate, the
Symbol of Peace will disappear.

649
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,730
The only reason
Japan is able to keep

650
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,318
its crime rate at six percent
is because of your presence.

651
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,533
Other countries hover
around 20 percent.

652
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:22,374
And some are even
worse than that.

653
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,121
Honestly, part of me
wishes you’d never left.

654
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,584
America could use you.

655
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,463
There’s no need for you
to be so pessimistic, Dave.

656
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,134
The world is full of
capable pro heroes.

657
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,884
Not to mention the
good people like you

658
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,587
who support them.

659
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,257
Besides, I can
still be All Might

660
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,295
for a few hours each day,
I’m not dead yet‐‐

661
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,137
[DAVID]
Come on.

662
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,393
What if a monstrous
villain appears,

663
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,945
and you’re not capable
of saving us again?

664
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,601
[ALL MIGHT]
Listen.

[gasps]

666
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,862
Just in case that day comes,

667
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:58,191
understand that I have no
intention of stepping down.

668
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,908
[ALL MIGHT]
Besides, there’s still hope.

669
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,408
[ALL MIGHT]
For the future of One For All.

670
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,954
And the Symbol of Peace.

671
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,380
A new generation will
rise to take my place.

672

[ANNOUNCER 1AA]
The I‐Expo preview

673
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,469
will be closing at 6 PM.

[KAMINARI groans]

The Expo isn’t even
open to the public yet.

677

If we’re this slammed now,
will we ever get to rest?

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,599
Shut up. I don’t
wanna think about it.

Hey, Mineta! Kaminari!

680
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,817
How did your shift go?

681
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,572
You should be proud of the
work you’ve done today.

What are these things?

Invitations to the big Expo
reception later tonight.

There’s a party?

These are for us?

686
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,249
Melissa took pity on
you for some reason.

687
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,119
She figured you
could use a break!

688
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,538
I had a few extras.

689
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,294
Please, I’d love
for you to have them.

be quite a few pro heroes

attending tonight’s
party as well.

696
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,927
It’s imperative we don’t
tarnish UA’s reputation.

697
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,645
We’ll change into our formal
clothes and go as a group.

Everybody meet in lobby seven

Don’t you dare be late.

I’ll contact Todoroki and Bakugo
and share this information.

Why would I wanna go to a party?

old geezers I don’t know

much gourmet food as we want.

Well, actually...

Not long ago, I was
getting terrible grades.

That’s why I’ve been
studying so hard lately.

if I wanna be a hero.

on that dream a while ago.

I mean, I’m Quirkless after all.

You don’t have a Quirk?

[MELISSA]
Nope.

772

After I turned five and
I still didn’t have one,

I got taken to the doctor.

And they said I was in the
minority of the population

develop a power.

Papa didn’t have a Quirk
that would let him be a hero.

But he supports Uncle

Then, at the villain attraction,

I noticed you were limiting
yourself on purpose.

811

So I was thinking, maybe
your Quirk is too strong,

and therefore, your body
can’t handle its full power.

I made the gauntlet strong.

It could withstand Uncle Might’s
punches three times.

perfect fit for you, too.

942
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,171
Iida. Let’s go to that party.

943
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,464
For what reason.

944
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,667
Because that’s the
place we can find

945
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,757
All Might right now.

946
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,089
Wait, All Might’s in there?

947
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,384
Oh, thank goodness,
we don’t have

948
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,387
anything to worry about, then.

949
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,639
So, Melissa.

950
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,970
Do you know of any way
we can get down there

951
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,475
without the elevator?

952
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,308
[MELISSA] Yeah, sure. We can
use the emergency stairs.

953
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,853
That will at least get us close.

954
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,148
We’ll follow your lead, then.

955
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,897
[TSUYU]
Our phones don’t have a signal.

956
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,983
And the internet’s
not working, either.

957
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,190
[ASHIDO]
Ugh.

958
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,569
What happened to
all the channels?

959
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,164
[HAGAKURE]
We’re roughin’ it, ladies!

960
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,660
But I brought some
games along. Who’s in?

961
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,122
[WOLFRAM]
Don’t worry.

962
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,832
If ya stay quiet, there’s
no reason to hurt anyone.

963
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,425
We plan to release you safely
when the time is right.

964
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,250
What are you criminals after?

965
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,625
‐‐[WOMEN gasp]
‐‐[groans]

966
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,712
[WOLFRAM]
Do you not know how to listen?

967
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,839
Stay down.

968
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,263
[phone ringing]

969
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,682
What’s up? Yeah, I got it.

970
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,885
[WOLFRAM] Hey, Tubby.
You a researcher here?

971
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,638
Yes. I am.

972
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:02,688
Take this one up.

973
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:03,942
No, please. Don’t.

974
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,072
Stop it. That man
is my assistant.

975
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,941
What do you plan
on doing to him?

976
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,697
[WOLFRAM]
Hm? Ah. The famous David Shield.

977
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,242
Bring him, too.

978
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,195
[DAVID]
What if I refuse?

979
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,785
Then somewhere on this island,

980
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:21,369
you’ll hear a pretty little
blonde girl scream.

981
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,251
All right. Lead the way.

982
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,673
[ALL MIGHT]
Dave.

983
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:32,225
I have to subdue these villains
and get the system back online.

984
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,890
How much power do
I even have left?

985
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,564
[ALL MIGHT]
I have to find a way.

986
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,728
Because I am here.
The Symbol of Peace.

987
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,856
[ALL MIGHT]
What? Young Midoriya?

988
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,730
Okay, he knows that we’re here.

989
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,189
Jiro, is your jack in place?

990
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,857
[JIRO]
Yeah, ready.

991
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,065
[IZUKU whispering] You can talk
to us. We’re listening!

992
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,407
[whispering] Hope you
can you hear me.

993
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,292
Some villains have
taken the tower.

994
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,080
They have control of
the security system,

995
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,834
and everyone on
this island is now

996
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,624
being held as a hostage.

997
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,459
That includes the heroes
who are at this party.

998
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,125
It’s dangerous. Get away from
here as soon as you can.

999
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,465
[JIRO]
This is bad, Midoriya.

1000
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,354
[TENYA] We’ve received All
Might’s orders loud and clear.

1001
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,600
He’s our teacher.

1002
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,143
I suggest we follow
his instructions

1003
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,676
and escape this place.

1004
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,888
Otherwise, we’d be
going against his will.

1005
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,898
I’m afraid I have to agree
with what Iida is saying.

1006
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,521
We’re still only students.

1007
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,938
We can’t fight these villains

1008
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,566
if we don’t have
our hero licenses.

1009
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,453
[gasps] Why don’t
we get outta here

1010
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,110
and tell the heroes outside?

1011
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,738
It’s not going to be
very easy to escape.

1012
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,826
The security system here
is on the same level

1013
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,123
as that of the Tartarus prison,
which is where they keep

1014
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,077
the most dangerous
criminals in the world!

1015
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,625
Then, all we can do
is sit and wait

1016
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,628
until everything’s
over, I guess.

1017
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,460
[JIRO] Are you really okay
with that, Kaminari?

1018
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,047
Well, what choice do we have?

1019
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,921
Don’t you think we should
at least try and stop them?

1020
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,887
Hey, come on, those villains
have even got All Might trapped.

1021
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,549
There’s no way we can
stop them ourselves

1022
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,597
if the actual pros are stuck!

1023
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,813
Aren’t we trying to
be pros ourselves?

1024
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,315
[YAOYOROZU]
Well, yes, but we’re not allowed

1025
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,186
to work as heroes‐‐
you know that.

1026
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,733
Does that mean that
it’s right for us

1027
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,026
to do nothing at all?

1028
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,691
Well. It’s complicated.

1029
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,280
[IZUKU]
I wanna help.

1030
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,327
[OCHACO]
Really, Deku?

1031
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,041
I want to save them.

1032
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,793
You wanna go fight
those villains?

1033
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,543
Didn’t you learn anything
from the USJ, Midoriya?!

1034
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,247
This is totally different.

1035
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,455
We don’t have to fight them.

1036
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,586
We just need to think of
a way to rescue All Might

1037
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,013
and everyone else at the party
without facing the bad guys.

1038
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,395
That’s easy to say,

1039
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,761
but you know it won’t
be that simple.

1040
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,596
[IZUKU]
I know, but I still wanna try.

1041
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,021
[gasps]

1042
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,641
[IZUKU] We can figure out
what the best plan of action is

1043
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,186
and keep these
criminals from winning.

1044
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,731
We can save everyone!

1045
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,266
Are you sure?

1046
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,357
[MELISSA] I know where
the security system is.

1047
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,324
It’s on the top floor
of this tower.

1048
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,784
If these criminals managed
to take control of it,

1049
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,665
then the authentication
locks and password

1050
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,742
have probably been disabled.

1051
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,709
We should be able to restart
the system ourselves.

1052
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,540
We just have to stay off
the villains’ radar

1053
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,415
until we can get to the
top floor. That’s all.

1054
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,003
If we do that, the whole
island will be safe again.

1055
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,758
Then it’s possible.

1056
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,632
Sure, but how do we keep
on the low for that long?

1057
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,388
The security system
hasn’t discovered us yet.

1058
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,641
That means the villains probably

1059
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,602
don’t know how it
works very well.

1060
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,234
So we avoid fighting anyone

1061
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,389
and try to get the
place back to normal.

1062
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,598
It could work.

1063
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,109
Not bad. What do ya think?

1064
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,821
Let’s do it!

1065
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,899
Many of our enemies are likely
gathered there on the top floor.

1066
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,567
[IZUKU] If we’re fast,
we won’t have to fight them.

1067
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,566
When the security system
goes back to normal,

1068
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,328
All Might and the others
will be released.

1069
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,829
They’ll immediately
jump into action

1070
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,541
and stop the
villains‐‐I know it.

1071
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,421
Let’s do this, guys!

1072
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,790
[IZUKU]
Uraraka!

1073
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,418
I don’t wanna sit around
here being helpless.

1074
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,594
Not if there’s something
we can actually try.

1075
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,553
What’s important is that
we’re helping people,

1076
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,382
even if we’re not real heroes.

1077
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,678
That’s exactly the way
I feel about things.

1078
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,142
We’ll follow our hearts
and save the island!

1079
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,605
Yeah!

1080
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,774
[TODOROKI]
Midoriya. I’ll go with you, too.

1081
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,062
I’m in.

1082
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:13,895
Todoroki!

1083
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,560
Thanks, Kyoka!

1084
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,318
[TENYA] The moment I think
we’ve gone too far, it’s over.

1085
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,282
If that’s something
you can agree to,

1086
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,451
I’ll join you as well.

1087
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:22,859
[IZUKU]
Okay!

1088
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,567
All right. If that’s
the case, I’ll go, too.

1089
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,117
[KAMINARI]
Obviously I’m in.

1090
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,122
[OCHACO]
Yaoyorozu!

1091
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,703
[IZUKU]
Kaminari!

1092
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,656
Have you all lost your minds?!
All right, I’ll go!

1093
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,499
[IZUKU]
Thanks, Mineta!

1094
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,294
[KAMINARI] The girls’ll think
we’re so cool for this.

1095
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,586

Be a hero, Mineta!

Melissa, you can wait
down here for us, okay?

1097
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,384
No, I’m going, too.

1098
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,465
Uh‐‐ But, without a Quirk,
you’ll be in danger.

1099
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,353
I don’t suppose any of
you know how to change

00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,640
the settings on the

[KAMINARI]
Uh...

1102
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,637
[MELISSA]
I’m a student at the Academy.

1103
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,226
I’ll be useful to you.

1104
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,731
Hold on.

1105
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,692
I know I might just
get in your way.

1106
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,324
At least until we get
up to the top floor.

00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,820

Yeah, all right, then.

I know what you’re thinking.

He’s not going to leave.

1124
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,035
I know I should be furious

that he’s ignoring

But who am I kidding?

If he didn’t act right now,

1128

then he wouldn’t
be my successor.

1129

I’ll just have to
keep this form up.

[HENCHMAN 1C] Good. Hurry up
and unlock the vault.

You’re not the boss here.

Well, you heard him.

1139
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,360
I’d move quickly if you
wanna keep your head on.

Sure. I’ll begin.

[SWORDKIL]
Take ’em.

1142
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,161
[HENCHMAN 1D]
This way.

Wait, Melissa.
How high does it go?

[KAMINARI]
The what?!

1148
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,632
[MINETA]
That’s way too many stairs!

1149
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,217
But it’s still better than
running into the villains.

1150
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,430
[panting]

1151
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,766
Hey, Melissa.

1152
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,481
Do you want me to use
my Quirk on you?

1153
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,692
I’ll be fine.
But thanks anyway!

[MELISSA] Save your power
for when we need it.

I’m right behind you.

00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,451
[TENYA]
This route’s blocked!

1157
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,656
What should we do?
Break through it?

1158
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,208
[MELISSA]
If we did that.

1159
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,170
I’m sure the security system
would alert the villains

1160
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,832
that someone’s in here.

1161
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,500
[MINETA] Then why don’t we go
through this door instead?

[SWORDKIL]
Somethin’ wrong?

1165
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,302
[HENCHMAN 1C] A door on
a high floor just opened.

1166

What the hell?

1167
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,055
I thought you scanned each
level and they were all clear.

1168
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,635
[WOLFRAM] Use the barriers to
trap them on the 80th floor.

Be careful, everyone.

[TODOROKI]
Is there another way to go up?

1175
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,819
There should be another
emergency staircase

down at the other
end of the hallway.

cross through here!

[IZUKU]
What is this place?

1185
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,180
[MELISSA]
It’s a plant factory.

1186
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,635
They research the effects that
Quirks have on fauna here.

1187
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:24,856
Hold on! Look. The
elevator’s coming up.

1188
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,729
Don’t tell me the
villains found us.

1189
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,067
We should hide and
let them pass.

1190
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,244
[KAMINARI] I wonder if
we can use that elevator

1191
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,874
to get to the top floor
once they’re gone.

[MELISSA]
No. Only authorized people

1193
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,452
can use the controls,
unfortunately.

1194
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,708
And it’s built like
a bomb shelter,

1195
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,920
so we can’t even
break in and try.

1196
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,711
Of course we can’t
go the easy way.

He said the kids came in here.

1201
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,935

They just had to pick a place

1202
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,215
with so many hiding spots.

1203
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,216

in the right direction?

1249
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,577
Kirishima!

1250
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:50,537
[TODOROKI]
Dodge!

1251
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,800
[HENCHMAN 1A] You boys know
how to fight, don’t you?

1252
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,346
Hm. Where’d you come from?

1253
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:05,021
Right, like we’d tell a
couple ’a weak‐ass villains.

1254
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,890
Why would we tell you anything?

1255
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,316
This way’s blocked as well.

1256
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,320
[MINETA] Great, so what
are we supposed to do.

1257
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:19,532
We’re like helpless mice
stuck in a fancy cage.

1258
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,365
We need a plan.

1259
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,780
Hey, Melissa.

1260
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,076
Where does that little
vent up at the edge

1261
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,001
of the ceiling
lead to? Over there!

1262
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,869
I think it runs under
the maintenance room

1263
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,206
for the sunlight system.

1264
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,672
Ha! There’s probably
an emergency ladder

1265
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,921
in the maintenance room, right?

1266
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,304
[MELISSA]
Well, yeah, there is.

1267
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,919
But it’s a manual release,
so someone would

1268
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,757
have to be inside to
let it down for us.

1269
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,473
Is this really as far as we go?

1270
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,893
No, there’s still a possibility.

1271
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,941
[YAOYOROZU] If somebody
climbs through the vent

1272
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,562
and to the exterior
wall, they can get

1273
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,439
into the maintenance room.

1274
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,896
Right!

1275
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,074
There must be another
vent leading inside!

1276
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,032
They can get in that way!

1277
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,162
But who can go through
such a cramped space

1278
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,659
and then climb the outer
wall without falling?

1279
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,754
You can’t be serious!
No, I can’t!

1280
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,211
[OCHACO]
Please, you have to, Mineta.

1281
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,829
[JIRO] You’re the only
one of us who can do it!

1282
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,245
You idiots.

1283
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,343
Do you have any idea
how high up we are?

1284
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,919
If you save everyone
and become a celebrity,

1285
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,466
they’ll interview you on TV,
and then you’ll be popular

1286
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,261
with girls everywhere.

1287
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,052
[BOTH]
Come on!

1288
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:25,515
Just imagine the harem.

1289
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:30,266
Oh, man. Okay, fine,
I’ll do it! Whatever!

1290
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,647
Harem, harem, harem,
harem, harem!

1291
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,232
Harem, harem, harem,

1292
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,356
Harem, harem, harem, harem!

1293
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:48,577
I did it! The chicks
are gonna swoon!

1294
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,790
Come on, you guys.

1295
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,790
Time to show me some love.

1296
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,254
Let’s have some kisses
from the ladies, please.

1297
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,214
You were incredible, Mineta!

1298
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,014
As I’d expect from
a student hero.

1299
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,592
[MINETA] That’s it, let’s
get fired up, everyone!

Can’t you find ’em?

You’re lettin’ those
dumb kids get away.

00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,059
What’s the problem?

1306
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,476
We’re workin’ on it.

[TODOROKI] This guy’s not
making matter disappear;

1312
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,137
he’s displacing it.

1313
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,009
Is that how his Quirk works?

1314
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,968
Don’t learn, do you?

1315
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,727
I can’t keep messin’
around forever‐‐

1316
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,521
it’s time to put an end to this.

[KATSUKI]
That’s the sweat from my palms.

1324
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,883
It works like nitroglycerine.

00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,226
Um. I can’t move.

1331
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,523
Can you get me outta here?

1332

Are you that stupid?

Just turn your damn
Quirk off, you idiot.

1334

[KIRISHIMA] Oh. Right. Guess
I shoulda thought of that.

[TODOROKI] I’m just glad
to see you’re not injured.

Thank you.

Whoa, where’d that come from?

1340
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,580
Don’t worry about it.

1341
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,129
I’m not worried.

1342
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,882
[TODOROKI] Right. Let’s
catch up with the others.

1343
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,262
[KATSUKI]
Don’t order me around.

1344
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,589
Todoroki. Time to give
us some details.

1345
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,967
[TODOROKI] Looks like
they’ve gotten serious.

1346
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,728
[HENCHMAN 1C] Boss, those are
no ordinary kids in the tower.

1347
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,519
They’re students from
UA High’s hero course.

1348
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,114
They’re well trained.

1349
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,859
[WOLFRAM] The brats are
probably trying to restore

1350
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,281
the security system.
Be on alert.

1351
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,320
You sent out the security drones
on the 80th floor, right?

1352
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,026
[HENCHMAN 1C]
Yes, sir!

1353
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,244
Then raise any barriers
from floors 100 to 130

1354
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,125
and let ’em pass freely.

1355
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,372
Just do what I say.

1356
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,496
[KAMINARI] Seems like we’ve
gotten pretty lucky.

1357
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,295
The path’s been clear since
we passed the 100th floor.

1358
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,838
Yeah, do you think
we lost them maybe?

1359
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,424
I doubt that’s it.

1360
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,627
It’s quite possible that
they’re leading us somewhere.

1361
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,007
Likely.

1362
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,635
Even if that’s the case,
we’ve almost made it

1363
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,470
to the top floor! We’re so
close to this being over.

1364
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,188
[OCHACO]
So many robot sentries.

1365
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,232
[TENYA]
The villains aren’t just trying

1366
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,813
to block us in anymore.

1367
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,978
It looks like they’re actually
trying capture us now.

1368
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,939
If so, then I bet
they realized that

1369
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,777
we’re hero course students.

1370
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,203
[YAOYOROZU]
If that’s true,

1371
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,493
no reason not to show
them what we can do.

1372
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,695
You’re right.

1373
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,497
We’ll go ahead and
commence with Plan A.

1374
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,578
Ready, Kaminari?

1375
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,003
You got it. I won’t
let you guys down.

1376
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,172
Let’s do this, Iida.

1377
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,581
[TENYA]
Right!

1378
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,878
[KAMINARI]
Indiscriminate shock.

1379
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,717
One point three million volts!

1380
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,260
It’s not working!

1381
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:41,887
Fine! How ’bout we
try 2,000,000 volts?!

1382
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,809
Don’t! If you do that, then...

1383
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,766
[KAMINARI]
Yay.

1384
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,897

...you’ll turn stupid.

[IZUKU]
Well, at least he stopped

1386
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,240
the robots for us, right?

1387
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,568
[KAMINARI]
Uh‐heh!

1388

‐‐[JIRO] Kaminari!
‐‐They’re just too strong!

1389
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,702
Right, then. Quick. Plan B.

1390
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:00,908
On it!

1391
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,175
[YAOYOROZU] We can jam their
communications with these.

1392
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,092
[OCHACO]
Take that!

1393
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,001
And that!

[grunts]

1395
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,094
Now, Mineta!

1396
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,796
Don’t hurt Kaminari!

1397
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,515
He’s got a harem to get home to!

1398
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,716
It worked!

1399
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,188
Aw, man!

1400
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,849
Our turn. C’mon, Midoriya.

1401
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,517
Let’s go!

1402
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,359

One for All... Full Cowling!

And Full Gauntlet!

1404
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,535
I think it’d be perfect for you.

1405
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,618
You should be able
to use your full power

1406
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,005
if you have it on.

1407
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:43,960
[IZUKU]
First, I’ll try it out with just

1408
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,751
30 percent of my power.

1409
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,754
Smash!

1410
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:54,133
[IZUKU] It didn’t hurt.
My arm is fine. I’ve got this.

1411
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,967
[KAMINARI]
Whee!

1412
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,104
Jiro! Do they have backup?

1413
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,811
Yeah, coming from the left!

1414
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,891
[TENYA] Then we’re heading
the opposite way.

1415
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,314
[STUDENTS]
Right!

1416
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,274
Deku, what’s with that
glove? It’s amazing!

1417
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,145
It worked perfectly,
Melissa, thanks.

1418
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,022
I’m so glad you brought it.

1419
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,528
I didn’t know how to
get it off my arm.

1420
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,528
[HENCHMAN 1C] Boss, there’s
something interfering

1421
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,453
with the drones’ sensors.
We’ve lost those kids.

1422
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,203
[WOLFRAM]
Lose the chatter.

1423
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,124
We don’t know if one of
those brats has a Quirk

1424
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,213
that’ll let ’em spy on us.

1425
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,959
I hear a lot of those
security machines

1426
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,253
on the floor below us.

1427
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,294
Any sounds from above?

1428
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,128
No. It should be clear.

1429
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:33,462
[TENYA]
Let’s go!

1430
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,796
[ALL gasp]

1431
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,518
[TENYA]
A trap?

1432
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,732
Let’s break through, Iida!

1433
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:47,940
Wait a sec.

1434
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,599
We can’t damage these servers.

1435
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:52,648
It could affect the
island’s security system!

1436
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,453
[MINETA] How many of
these things are there?

1437
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,989
We can handle these machines
while protecting the servers.

1438
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,665
Midoriya, go.

1439
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,493
Take Melissa and see if you
can find a different route.

1440
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,658
We’ll leave it to them, come on.

1441
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,706
Ochaco, you should
come with us, too.

1442
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,173
But, the robots...

1443
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,631
Do it. They may need you.

1444
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:23,008
[TENYA]
Torque over, recipro burst!

1445
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,519
If you’ll take over
the gun, then

1446
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,273
I’ll make us some soft ammo.

1447
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,774
Roger that!

1448
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,994
I won’t let you hurt my ladies!

1449
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,861
[KAMINARI]
Yay.

1450
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:44,704

[OCHACO]
Deku, you can’t stop! Run!

1454
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,498
If we all get caught here,

1455
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,376
Iida and the others
did that for nothing!

1456
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,505
Everyone... Please be safe!

1457
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,062
[TENYA]
Stalled.

Yao‐momo?

1461
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,112
That’s my limit with Creation.

1462
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:19,192
My scalp’s telling me that
it’s time to surrender.

1463
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,067
[JIRO grunts]

1464

[YAOYOROZU gasps]

1465
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,414
[SWORDKIL]
Ha! That’s what you get

1466
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,530
for thinking you can take us.

1467
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,075
What about the three who ran?

1468
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
We’re looking for them now.

1469
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,615
These kids are so annoying.

1470
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,252
[IZUKU]
What is this?

1471
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,044
[MELISSA]
The wind power generator.

1472
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,585
So what are we doing here?

1473
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,170
There are more
robots in the tower.

1474
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,384
Probably just waiting there
for a chance to ambush us.

1475
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,175
But if we climb to
the top from here,

1476
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,509
we’ll avoid them.

1477
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,433
There’s an emergency
exit we can enter.

1478
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,263
[IZUKU]
All the way up there?

1479
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,849
[MELISSA]
But we have Ochaco.

1480
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,602
Your Quirk makes anything
you touch weightless, right?

1481
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,775
So, this should be easy.

1482
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,022
Leave it to me.

1483
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,988
[OCHACO]
Melissa. Hang on to Deku.

I can’t!

1491
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,836
If I do that, you might not
make it to the top in time.

Yeah, fine.

1499
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,776
I used my Quirk on
Deku and Melissa.

1500
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,031
They should be able
to reach the top.

going to hit the wall!

[MELISSA]
This gauntlet is strong.

1518
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,074
It could withstand Uncle

1519
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,530
I would think.

Why is he up on the
top floor, though?

01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,411
Maybe the villains
brought him here.

1559
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,623
They might need
something from him.

1560
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,162
We have to help him!

1561
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,325
Right.

1562
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:50,295
[gasps] I’ve unlocked
it. Block 1147.

1563
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,801
[SAM]
Wonderful.

1564
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,182
[DAVID]
It’s opening.

1565
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,639
[SAM]
You did it, Professor!

1566
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,444
Look, everything is
here. It’s perfect.

1567
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,769
[DAVID]
Finally. I’ve gotten it back.

1568
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:08,937
[DAVID]
All my research.

1569
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,735
And they just took my
device away from me.

1570
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,281
But now it’s mine.

1571
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,824
[SAM]
Just like we planned.

1572
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,777
And it looks like the villains
are holding things down.

1573
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,448
[DAVID]
Thank you.

1574
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,907
I couldn’t have done any of
this without your help, Sam.

1575
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:23,959
Papa.

1576
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,710
[BOTH gasp]

1577
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,706
[DAVID]
Melissa? No.

1578
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,756
[SAM]
Miss, what are you doing here?

1579
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:36,141
What does he mean that
it’s like you planned it?

1580
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:41,059
Don’t tell me that you’re
the one behind this.

1581
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,271
This was all you?

1582
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,233
Just to steal something?

1583
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,766
No. It can’t be true!

1584
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,242
Yes, it is.

1585
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,245
Papa. How could you?

1586
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,245
[SAM] The professor is
only trying to get back

1587
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,657
what was stolen.

1588
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,003
The invention inside
this briefcase

1589
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,659
can amplify someone’s Quirk.

1590
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,328
Wait, is that even possible?

1591
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,247
[SAM] Yes. It’s still
being tested, of course.

1592
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,086
But, unlike with drugs,
this device can magnify

1593
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,594
a person’s Quirk without
doing any damage

1594
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,765
to their body or brain.

1595
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:21,055
Yet, despite that,
our sponsors confiscated

1596
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,809
this prototype and
our research data.

1597
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,773
Then they demanded that
the project be abandoned.

1598
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,355
They worried that
something like this would

1599
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,359
drastically affect the structure
of superhuman society.

1600
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:36,653
Fearing chaos, governments
from different nations

1601
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,619
put pressure on your
father to end it.

1602
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,951
That’s why we did this.

1603
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:46,456
I can get my research
back? But how?

1604
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:50,879
[SAM] All we have to do is hire
someone to steal it back for us.

1605
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,250
[DAVID]
Ugh. Don’t be ridiculous.

1606
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:54,798
[SAM] Wait, listen.
I’m not talking about

1607
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,131
using actual
criminals, Professor.

1608
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,508
[DAVID]
Huh?

1609
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,145
We can hire people who will
pretend to be villains

1610
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,639
and have them "force" us
to break in and take it.

1611
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:03,892
Of course,

1612
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,683
we’ll order them
not to harm anyone.

1613
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,478
And after it’s done,
we can continue

1614
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,600
our research somewhere else.

1615
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:11,978
This is crazy.

1616
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:14,155
I know, but I wanna
get that data back

1617
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,315
and keep working.

1618
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,201
Don’t you feel the
same way, Professor?

1619
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,162
[SAM]
I’ve completed the preparations.

1620
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,292
We’ll carry this out on the
day of the I‐Expo preopening

1621
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,699
when the tower’s closed.

1622
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,538
The plan will begin
alongside the reception

1623
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,044
since that’s the only time
when all the people involved

1624
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,246
will be together
in the same place.

1625
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,925
We’ll pull the strings
in the background

1626
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,093
while the actors make
it seem like I‐Island

1627
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,012
has been taken over by villains.

1628
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,510
[SAM]
Professor?

1629
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,015
I don’t understand.

1630
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,732
There’s something
I’m missing, right?

1631
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,903
You’d never do this!

1632
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,521
I’m so sorry.

1633
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,148
[gasps]

1634
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:58,533
[MELISSA]
This doesn’t make any sense.

1635
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,031
The Papa I know
and love wouldn’t

1636
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,363
act like a villain,
no matter what.

1637
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:07,488
So why, then? Why?

1638
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,368
I had to for All Might.

1639
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,827
[BOTH gasp]

1640
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,035
[DAVID] You two probably
aren’t aware of this.

1641
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,537
But his Quirk is disappearing.

1642
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,130
[gasps]

1643
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,093
However, if he uses this device,
he’ll be his old self.

1644
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,257
No. His abilities will
be even stronger

1645
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:25,887
than they were!

1646
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,353
The number‐one hero...
The Symbol of Peace...

1647
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:33,234
...can get his strength
and light back again.

1648
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:37,362
He can keep saving people.
Just like he always has.

1649
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:38,782
[IZUKU]
The professor’s upset because

1650
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,951
his friend’s power is fading.

1651
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,240
This is happening,
because All Might passed

1652
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,494
One For All onto me.
He doesn’t know.

1653
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,076
[DAVID]
Please.

1654
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,501
Please just let me hand this
device over to All Might.

1655
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,410
There’s no time to remake it.

1656
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,378
When he’s better,
I don’t care what kind of

1657
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,629
punishment I receive.

1658
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,922
[MELISSA]
They risked their lives.

1659
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,264
Deku and his classmates
went through so much.

1660
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,379
Do you know how
dangerous this was?

1661
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:06,217
How hard we were trying to
save everyone on the island?

1662
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,772
No, what do you mean?

1663
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,771
The villains are fake.

1664
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,693
It’s all supposed to be an act!

1665
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,520
Of course it was a performance.

1666
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,115
[IZUKU, MELISSA gasp]

1667
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:19,651
But the real act was pretending
we weren’t criminals.

1668
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,276
You’re the boss!

1669
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,606
[IZUKU grunts]

1670
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:29,034
Oh, no, Deku!

1671
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,828
[IZUKU] His Quirk lets
him manipulate metal.

1672
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,004
[WOLFRAM]
You’d be smart not to resist.

1673
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,793
Sam. Hand it over.

1674
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,087
[SAM]
Right. Uh. Here you go!

1675
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:41,919
Sam? This was your plan?

1676
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:43,506
You were going to
hand it over all along?

1677
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,393
[SAM] You’re the one who
tricked me, professor.

1678
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,849
I’ve been your assistant
for all these years,

1679
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,221
and you let them take our work.

1680
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,477
We could have had
fame and fortune.

1681
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,769
But, no.

1682
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:58,062
I deserve more.
I need to be rewarded.

1683
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,857
Otherwise my entire career
was a complete waste of time!

1684
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,525
[WOLFRAM] Here’s the
payment I promised you.

1685
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,495
[gasps]

1686
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,782
Sam!

1687
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:11,035
[SAM] No. Why? This isn’t
part of the plan.

1688
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,040
[WOLFRAM]
Is it not? That’s strange.

1689
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,503
Because it was always
a part of mine.

1690
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:17,424

[SAM]
Professor. Why?

1694
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,177
Get outta here.

1695
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,379

1696
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,510
Stay back.

[DAVID grunts]

1700
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,065
[WOLFRAM] Trying to play
the hero after all this?

1701
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,687
Too late for that.

1702
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,864
No matter what
your reasons were,

1703
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,983
you’ve dirtied your hands now.

1704
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,948
Whether we’re real villains
or actors is irrelevant.

1705
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,279
You planned and committed
an actual crime here.

1706
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,076
You’re exactly the
same as we are.

1707
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,122
You can no longer remain
a respected scientist.

1708
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,785
Or continue your
research without shame.

1709
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,135
Your life is forever tainted
by the darkness of villainy.

And if you want a future at all,

1712
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,629
you’ll be a good scientist
and mass produce

1713
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,508
this device so I can sell it.

01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,310
[MELISSA]
No.

1717
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,562
Please, no. Give him back!

1718
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,015
[WOLFRAM]
That reminds me.

1719
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,395
This’ll be much easier

1720
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,363
if I get rid of the
professor’s attachments.

1721
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,072
[IZUKU]
Don’t you hurt her!

1722
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,070
[IZUKU]
Smash!

1723
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,076
[IZUKU]
Melissa!

1724
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,750
[IZUKU]
I’ve got the professor and Sam.

1725
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,961
[IZUKU]
You save everyone else.

1726

[gasps]

1727
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,344
[WOLFRAM]
Stop her! Don’t let ’er escape.

1728
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,594
Right.

1729
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,598
[IZUKU]
I won’t let you past me.

1730
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,646
Don’t make threats you
can’t live up to, kid!

1731
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,071
[IZUKU]

[MELISSA]
Papa...

1735
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,828
[IZUKU]
I will save you.

1736
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:17,041
[MELISSA]
I will save you.

1737
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,789
I promise.

1738
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:28,262
She got control of
the security system?

1739
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,224
[KATSUKI]
What happened?

1740
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,090
They just stopped.

1741
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,467
Midoriya and Melissa must’ve
made it to the top!

1742
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,306
[ANNOUNCER 1AA]
I‐Island’s security system

1743
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,680
is now operating in normal mode.

1744

Oh, hey, that’s good.

1745
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,941
Yeah, my phone’s working, too!

Damn it!

1748
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,614
[HENCHMAN 1E]
What’s happening?

1749
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,486
[CROWD cheers]

1750
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,698
[ALL MIGHT] Did you pull
it off, young heroes?

1751
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:54,988
[WOLFRAM]
Is it here?

1752
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,196
[HENCHMAN 1C]
Just landed.

1753
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,275
[WOLFRAM]
Then we’re leavin’.

1754
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,698

Yes, sir.

[IZUKU]
I have to rescue him.

1759
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,339
Otherwise, why am I even here?

1760
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,890
[IZUKU] I may not be a pro,
but I’ll do what I can for now.

01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,975
[phone rings]

[ALL MIGHT]
Melissa, what’s happening?

1763
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,689
Oh, thank goodness!

1764
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,941
Papa’s been taken by
the villains, Uncle Might!

1765
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,562
And Deku’s gone after them.

1766
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,690
[ALL MIGHT] Don’t worry.
I’m going to stop them.

1767
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,816
[PILOT HENCHMAN]
Boss, what about everyone else?

1768
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,868
[WOLFRAM] We’re goin’ before
the security system’s

01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,044
back online.

[HENCHMEN]
Uh. Yes, sir!

1771
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,420
[DAVID]
Kill me. Just do it.

1772
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,001
[WOLFRAM] I’ll add a few more
sins to your heart first.

1773
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,546
But then I’ll make
your wish come true.

1774
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,341
[IZUKU]
Stop!

1775
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:02,137
You give the professor
back right now!

1776
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,524
I wonder.

1777
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,231
Did you come to
bring this man back

1778
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,151
so he can pay for his crimes?

1779
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,769
Of course not.

1780
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:12,818
I’m here to rescue David Shield
from the likes of you!

1781
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,402
Even though he’s a criminal?

1782
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,454
You watch. I’m going
to save everyone.

1783
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,075
That includes the professor.

1784
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:24,042
It doesn’t look like that to me.

1785
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,541
Shut up! This is what heroes do.

1786
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,925
They help people
who are in trouble.

1787
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,172
How, exactly?

1788
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,383
[gasps]

1789
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:35,883
Save yourself. Run away!

1790
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:40,973
[WOLFRAM] Jeez. Bein’ a hero
seems really inconvenient.

1791
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,927
I didn’t even use
much of my power,

1792
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,927
yet you’re helpless.

1794
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,823

Doesn’t sound like a very smart

way to live to me.

1796
01:16:59,073 --> 01:16:59,993

Take off.

able to activate much metal

1799
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:16,256
if all he can touch
is the helicopter!

Stop it. Let me go, Midoriya.

waiting for you!

[WOLFRAM] I’ll give you this.
You act like a real hero.

1807

But you’re an idiot, too.

Don’t give up. Think!

01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:53,669
What do I do? What can I do?

take the professor!

Everything will be okay.

I’m so sorry.

I heard Sam.

1840
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,498
All Might’s Quirk
is failing him.

1841
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:22,297
He doesn’t have the same
unstoppable power he once did.

1842
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,014
[IZUKU] He’s using
the professor’s device!

[ALL MIGHT grunts]

01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:06,336
[WOLFRAM] David Shield’s genius
lives up to its reputation.

1852
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,508
I can tell my Quirk’s
growing more powerful.

1853
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:12,308
[WOLFRAM cackles]
It feels amazing!

01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,483
I’m never taking this off.

Dave, what in the
world have you made?

1856
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,976
I had no idea he created
something so powerful.

1857
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,405
[WOLFRAM]
Now...

1858
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,816
I think I know the best
way to raise the price

1859
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,025
of this device.

1860
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,327
I can charge whatever
I want if it was used

1861
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,621
to kill the world’s
number‐one hero.

All Might. This isn’t good.

01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,967
He’s at his limit.

Is Uncle Might okay?

Why won’t you just die already?!

1868
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,025
All Might!

1869
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,042
[KATSUKI]
Go to hell!

1870
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:21,751
How can you let
yourself get beat

01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,667
by such a lame final boss.

1872

While we were planning

I received an intriguing phone
call from the man himself.

He said he wanted to
work with me. To help.
