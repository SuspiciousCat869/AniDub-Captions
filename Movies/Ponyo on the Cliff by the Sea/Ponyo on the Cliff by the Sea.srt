1
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,897
Shh!

2
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:51,858
Sosuke, come right back up, OK?

3
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,009
OK!

4
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:11,807
Huh?

5
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,532
A goldfish!

6
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:48,651
Can't get it out.

7
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,251
That was weird.

8
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,923
Ow!

9
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:23,833
It looks kind of dead.

10
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:30,408
It licked me! It's alive!

11
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,224
Sosuke, we'll be late!

12
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:38,021
Mom, a goldfish!

13
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:39,028
Sosuke!

14
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,752
This wind is crazy.

15
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,669
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!

16
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,395
Well? Have you found my daughter?

17
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:12,555
What? She was captured by a human?

18
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,139
A boy! This is very bad.

19
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:46,392
Is it already dead?

20
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,120
You are alive!

21
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,162
Sosuke, I have a job, you know!

22
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:12,514
Look, mom, I found a goldfish!

23
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,123
A goldfish?

24
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,458
It was right down by the rocks.

25
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,490
Yeah?

26
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,857
Hm?

27
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:43,938
I don't know who you are,

28
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,318
but we don't use weedkiller around here.

29
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:51,301
Hm? What? This is not weedkiller.

30
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,364
This is the purest ocean water,

31
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,892
and it keeps me from drying out on land.

32
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,934
Whatever. As long as it's not weedkiller.

33
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:58,677
Excuse us.

34
00:11:58,702 --> 00:11:59,385
Please wait.

35
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:05,768
Uh-oh.

36
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,283
This is bad. This is very bad.

37
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,640
Wow. That guy was a freak show.

38
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:17,207
But don't you call people "freak show."
We never judge others by their looks.

39
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:18,793
I know, mom. I don't.

40
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:21,122
Oh. Another experiment for school?

41
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:21,852
Mm-hm.

42
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:24,033
Your teacher doesn't really like show and tell.

43
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:25,579
I think it'll be fine.

44
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:27,688
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.

45
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,201
Huh! She sure is pretty.

46
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,670
There's a ship headed for dry dock.

47
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,383
Hurry up. Eat your breakfast.

48
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:45,517
I wonder if she would eat this.

49
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:47,028
Want some?

50
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,254
Hey! My cut is all gone!

51
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,303
Mom, I think I'll call her Ponyo.

52
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:57,866
Mmm?

53
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:59,206
She came to me.

54
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,846
She might be magic.

55
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:04,536
I saved her. She's my responsibility now.

56
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:15,890
Want ham instead?

57
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,816
Mom, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.

58
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,332
So she thinks she's human?

59
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:39,782
Ouch!

60
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:00,785
Whoa! Turn!

61
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:04,457
Humans are disgusting!

62
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,760
Come on, Lisa, hurry!

63
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:18,463
All this waste, filth.

64
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,227
Morning, Shima-San!

65
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:31,288
Ponyo, look. You can see our house.

66
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,190
Ask about the fish.

67
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:54,849
I will.

68
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,048
Love you, Sosuke.

69
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:57,584
Goodbye.

70
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,635
Morning! Seems like I'm always late.

71
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,942
Can you get me another wheelchair?

72
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:02,444
Sure.

73
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,686
Good morning, Sosuke.

74
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:20,987
Excuse me.

75
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:22,767
I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.

76
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,989
Is that so?

77
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,311
And me, Sosuke?

78
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,613
 Not now, Toki. I'm concentrating.

79
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:28,226
Ah...

80
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,652
Maybe the teacher will get mad.

81
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:40,545
I got it.

82
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:47,515
You'll be safe here, Ponyo. I'll be back soon.

83
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:53,055
Hm. I wonder if there are any cats around here.

84
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:06,477
That should do it, Ponyo. Stay put. I'll be right back.

85
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:15,213
See you later.

86
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:16,229
Hello there, Toshi.

87
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:20,712
I'll call if her cough gets worse, but she looks fine.

88
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,948
You good, little sweetie?

89
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:23,380
Oh, thank you. Good.

90
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,151
Bye-bye.

91
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,535
Good morning, sensei.

92
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:27,533
Good morning, Sosuke.

93
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,153
Hi, Sosuke.

94
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,050
Sosuke!

95
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:36,705
Kumiko!

96
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:39,210
Look at me! My mother made me a new dress.

97
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:40,322
Isn't it pretty?

98
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:40,894
Hm...

99
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,503
Hey, Sosuke, let's go play.

100
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,914
Can't now. I'm busy.

101
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,281
You're not busy. You're five.

102
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,965
I am too! I have a job.

103
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,480
You're so weird.

104
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:52,897
Yeah. Hm!

105
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:06,579
Oh!

106
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:10,614
Ponyo?

107
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:14,629
Ponyo!

108
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:23,349
Sosuke!

109
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,002
Oh, Kumiko.

110
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:25,954
What is that?

111
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:29,307
There are rules about bringing
things to school for a reason.

112
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,023
I know. This isn't school.

113
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:33,675
These bushes are on the senior center property.

114
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:34,559
Let me see!

115
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:37,375
Oh, a goldfish?

116
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,723
She's not just a goldfish. She's Ponyo.

117
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,831
Ponyo? Let's see!

118
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,241
OK, but don't tell she's here.

119
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:44,757
I won't.

120
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,568
The rules are look but don't touch.

121
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,878
Look at her. Isn't she pretty?

122
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,993
That's the most boring goldfish
I've ever seen in my entire life.

123
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:24,150
That one was Kumiko's fault.

124
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:27,018
You should never judge others by their looks.

125
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,555
Let's get you some more water.

126
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:55,744
Ponyo!

127
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:04,328
Ah! That was my fault.

128
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,345
There it comes again.

129
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,806
I hear old Sosuke's voice.

130
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:19,263
But I know our boy is in school right now.

131
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,593
So it must be only in my head.

132
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,801
Look, Yoshie. I'm right over here.

133
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,385
Oh, that's a relief.

134
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:31,197
I haven't lost my mind quite yet.

135
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,657
Are you ready to see my big surprise?

136
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:34,591
What is it?

137
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:36,146
I'll show you.

138
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:39,235
But first, guess what color she is.

139
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,745
Hm... she... she's red!

140
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:43,388
Red!

141
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,142
That's right!

142
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:47,734
How did you both guess that?

143
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,533
Come on, show us!

144
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:50,330
OK.

145
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,486
Well, look!

146
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,740
Very pretty.

147
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,449
Her name is Ponyo. She likes to eat ham.

148
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,938
And she can do magic!

149
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,719
I got a cut on my thumb,

150
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,173
and it went away because she licked it.

151
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,793
Oh!

152
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:12,571
Maybe she could use some of
her magic to fix my hips and back.

153
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:16,591
I'd let a fish lick me if it'd
get me out of this wheelchair.

154
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,732
Well, I don't know about all that licking.

155
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:20,744
I'd have to ask Ponyo...

156
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,871
Let me have a look in that green pail.

157
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:24,516
Yes, Toki-San.

158
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,624
It has a real face on it!

159
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:34,487
Hurry up! Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?

160
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:37,998
Oh, you. It's always tsunami, day and night.

161
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:41,687
Fish with faces who come out of the sea cause tsunamis.

162
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,436
That's what they always say.

163
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,454
Tsunami! tsunami! It's here!

164
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,413
Ah! Oh! Sosuke, put her back
in the ocean where she belongs!

165
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:58,785
Toki, what's the matter?

166
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:02,199
I'm soaking wet. Look at my clothes!

167
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,314
Sosuke!

168
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:17,699
Sosuke!

169
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:22,512
Sosuke!

170
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,514
Sosuke!

171
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,655
Come back here and apologize!

172
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:41,975
Don't worry, Ponyo. No matter what, I will protect you.

173
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:43,311
I promise.

174
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,371
Sosuke!

175
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,498
Sosuke!

176
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:55,899
Ponyo!

177
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:00,685
Ponyo. Sosuke.

178
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:05,072
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

179
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:12,255
I will love you, too.

180
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:15,173
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

181
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,330
Ponyo?

182
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:57,738
Ponyo!

183
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:00,224
Ponyo! Ponyo!

184
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:01,719
Ponyo!

185
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,071
Ah! Ponyo! Ponyo!

186
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,201
Ponyo!

187
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:11,034
Sosuke!

188
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,271
Ponyo! Ponyo!

189
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:18,051
Ponyo!

190
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:19,255
Ponyo!

191
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:22,381
Ponyo!

192
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:19,683
Listen, Sosuke, you know, this could be for the best.

193
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:22,286
I know you tried, but Ponyo is a fish.

194
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,737
She wasn't meant to live in a
bucket. The ocean is home to her.

195
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:27,316
Anyway, let's get home.

196
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,632
Hopefully, that spritzing weirdo is gone. Whoo!

197
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,585
Can I have a lick?

198
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:36,244
Hurry, it's starting to melt.

199
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:40,962
Dad's favorite. Me, too!

200
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:49,654
I'm really sorry, Sosuke. But
dad is finally coming home tonight.

201
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:51,675
You can tell him all about Ponyo.

202
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:21,644
No more ocean today, OK?

203
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:22,897
Mm-hm.

204
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:50,296
Sosuke?

205
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,618
Sosuke? Time to come in now.

206
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:55,581
Maybe if I leave the pail,

207
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,107
Ponyo will know where we live when she comes back.

208
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,004
Do that. I think that's a lovely thing to do for Ponyo.

209
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:02,873
Mm-hm.

210
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,606
Sosuke, can you get that?

211
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:18,921
It must be your dad.

212
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:24,943
Hello? Yep. She's fine.

213
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:26,245
Are you at the dock?

214
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,613
I caught a second run,

215
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,631
so I have to take lit.! Won't be home tonight.

216
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:32,309
I'll signal you when we pass.
Can you help me out with mom?

217
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,132
No, you should tell her.

218
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:38,210
Hi, honey. Uh-huh.

219
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:41,607
What?! Too many in a row, Koichi!

220
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,948
Let someone else take it!

221
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,973
Go ahead, abandon your wife and
child up here on a cliff all alone.

222
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:47,270
Oh, jerk!

223
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:55,065
Uh! Come on, Sosuke. Let's get out of here.

224
00:26:56,621 --> 00:26:58,259
What if Ponyo comes back?

225
00:26:59,664 --> 00:27:00,245
Mm!

226
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:07,299
Ah!

227
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:29,749
There's dad. Turn off the lights, mom.

228
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,091
Don't you wanna signal him?

229
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:32,067
Mm-mm.

230
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:57,437
Hey, my son is working the signal all by himself!

231
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,733
Can you believe that?

232
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,900
Your wife must be pretty mad.

233
00:28:01,694 --> 00:28:04,960
S... o... r...

234
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,869
...r... y.

235
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,419
Dad says he's very sorry.

236
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:11,333
B-u-g...

237
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,351
O-f-f.

238
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:17,609
B-u-g o-f-f. B-u-g o-f-f.

239
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,413
Mom, dad says he loves you.

240
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:29,424
He says, "lots and lots."

241
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:45,188
Wow! Nice, dad!

242
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,269
Don't cry, mom.

243
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,003
I know dad breaks his promises sometimes.

244
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,354
But he does his best for us.

245
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:29,373
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.

246
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:30,942
Then I lost her.

247
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:36,127
I wonder if she's crying now.

248
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:40,172
Ah!

249
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,492
You are so good! Mmm!

250
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:46,745
Happy as can be.

251
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,572
Mm! Ah!

252
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,932
Don't you worry, Sosuke.

253
00:29:51,095 --> 00:29:53,743
You did your best and Ponyo will be just fine.

254
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:55,721
OK.

255
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:59,491
I say we start with dessert and go backwards!

256
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,070
It's been a backwards kind of day.

257
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:13,205
It's not your fault.

258
00:30:13,894 --> 00:30:17,017
I exposed you to the magic and
you're too young to understand.

259
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:20,870
I have to keep the sea in
balance. It's a great responsibility.

260
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,091
You must promise me something:

261
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:26,218
You will never go back to the surface. Yes?

262
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,957
Come on, now. Eat, Brunhilde.

263
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:31,425
I want ham!

264
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:37,812
Ham! You ate their food. What else did you do?

265
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,322
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?

266
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:43,198
My name is not Brunhilde. It's Ponyo.

267
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,091
Ponyo?

268
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:47,934
Ponyo! Ponyo loves Sosuke!

269
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,378
I will be a human, too!

270
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:54,463
Human? What do you know about humans, Brunhilde?

271
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,768
They spoil the sea.

272
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:59,113
They treat your home like their empty, black souls.

273
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:02,711
I was once, long ago, a human myself.

274
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,684
I had to leave that all behind to serve the Earth.

275
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,258
Hands! I want hands!

276
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:10,958
I don't want these flippers anymore!

277
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:13,810
I want feet, like Sosuke!

278
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:16,111
That's enough!

279
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:25,224
Ah!

280
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,386
Oh!

281
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:39,449
I made hands! I made feet, too! Ha!

282
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:40,468
Yes!

283
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,169
What? No, no!

284
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,382
Don't tell me. You have tasted human blood!

285
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,486
I'm going to Sosuke!

286
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:48,306
Enough! You're making a terrible mistake!

287
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:51,221
Don't do it! Stop it. Stop it! Stop changing now.

288
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,168
Revert. Revert. Revert! Revert!

289
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:57,330
Revert!

290
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,182
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!

291
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,106
Don't change!

292
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:07,671
I need more power!

293
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:12,458
Let me out! Let me out!

294
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:16,371
Let me out!

295
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,924
I want to see Sosuke! Let me go!

296
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:22,407
Let me out!

297
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:25,648
You can't be human and magic at the same time, sweetheart.

298
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,534
Be still, be still, be still, be still, be still.

299
00:32:38,617 --> 00:32:40,084
She's already so powerful.

300
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,420
Just like her mother.

301
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:49,848
If you could only remain innocent and pure forever.

302
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,972
I don't have the power to hold her for very long.

303
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:16,720
I need to ask for her mother's help now.

304
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,254
What?

305
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,723
Huh! They're headed for my elixirs.

306
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,502
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here! Shoo!

307
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,614
That was too close.

308
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,520
I must be careful not to upset the balance of nature.

309
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,435
Calm. I must remain calm.

310
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:42,376
When [ Think of leaving her
again, my heart won't stop pounding.

311
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,151
Right, then. Focus on work.

312
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:46,366
This batch should be ready.

313
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,656
At least there aren't leaks down here.

314
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:04,198
This door still doesn't fit right.

315
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:09,923
I'll fix that next.

316
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,294
If even one living creature got in here...

317
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:49,174
Ah, yes. I can feel the power of the
ocean in the furthest reaches of my DNA.

318
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:54,101
When this well is full, then the
age of the ocean will begin again.

319
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:57,677
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Age.

320
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:00,636
An end to the era of those abominable humans.

321
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:07,869
This cursed door!

322
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:32,559
Teeth!

323
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,865
Let's find Sosuke!

324
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:54,943
I'm free!

325
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:15,785
Waterspout!

326
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,014
Captain, look over there!

327
00:39:20,302 --> 00:39:22,281
It must be a tsunami!

328
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:24,032
Turn the ship into the wave!

329
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:27,165
Look! What is that?

330
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:35,251
Captain, all our instruments just went dead!

331
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,936
It's a little girl. Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.

332
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:57,527
Thanks again.

333
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:59,432
Sure. See you tomorrow.

334
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,942
It's raining so hard, Sosuke.

335
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,616
I'll call your mother and have her pick you up.

336
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:07,039
That's all right. I'll take the shortcut. Goodbye, sensei.

337
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:10,533
Bye, Sosuke. Be careful out there.

338
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:55,045
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

339
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:57,828
The door didn't open, right? The power just went out.

340
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,678
Everything OK at school?

341
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:00,318
Mm-hm.

342
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,713
Lisa, if your shift's over, you can go home.

343
00:41:03,913 --> 00:41:05,206
Sure you don't need my help?

344
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:07,030
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

345
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:10,669
A little rain storm keeps the seniors entertained.

346
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:13,359
If I were you, I'd get out of here while you still can.

347
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:16,483
Wait here, sweetie. I'll be right back.

348
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:17,507
OK.

349
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,659
Hi, Yoshie.

350
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,161
Oh, Sosuke. Is that you?

351
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,542
It's so dark I can barely see.

352
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:37,821
Here, Yoshie. I made this for you.

353
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:43,591
Oh! What do we have here?

354
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,292
There's one for you, too, Noriko.

355
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,831
Thank you, Sosuke.

356
00:41:47,112 --> 00:41:51,119
I can't see a thing. I don't know why we're still here.

357
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:55,246
It's just a little rain. I wanna go back to my own house.

358
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:01,300
There we go. That's more like it.

359
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:04,298
Let's see. Your goldfish!

360
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:08,180
I bet the lights came back on because Sosuke's here.

361
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:11,708
They're now calling the bizarre event a micro-typhoon.

362
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,804
Ship...

363
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,246
Ah, this stupid TV.

364
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,836
Nobody understands weather anymore.

365
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:22,608
Might as well look at shadows and listen to crickets.

366
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,585
You should take your mother home now.

367
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,725
With our lucky goldfish to keep us company,

368
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:29,663
we'll be just fine.

369
00:42:29,996 --> 00:42:30,703
OK.

370
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:33,421
...landslides, flooding and tidal surges.

371
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,120
This is for you, Toki.

372
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,881
I can't tell. What is it? It's wrinkled.

373
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:48,814
It goes like this.

374
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:53,270
I got it. It's a grasshopper.

375
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:55,524
No, it's the Koganei Maru.

376
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:58,608
That's the name of your father's ship, isn't it, Sosuke?

377
00:42:58,646 --> 00:42:59,212
Mm-hm.

378
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,555
Now, it looks like a party hat.

379
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,287
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.

380
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:06,029
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.

381
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:09,785
OK. Ladies, good evening.

382
00:43:10,436 --> 00:43:12,674
Good evening, Mr. Sosuke.

383
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:15,794
Be careful the wind doesn't blow you away.

384
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:18,063
Let's go. Slide in.

385
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:24,402
They said the phones are out, too.

386
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:50,319
The ocean looks all puffed up.

387
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,889
You think the storm could sink the ships?

388
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,002
No. Ships can handle a storm. They go out to sea.

389
00:44:00,097 --> 00:44:01,852
That's what your father's doing right now.

390
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:15,822
I saw a fish! Did you see that, mom?

391
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:17,197
Put your seat-belt on!

392
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:30,041
Hold on, Lisa! You can't cross here!

393
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,972
We've just gotten word. They're gonna evacuate this side.

394
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:34,554
It's not mandatory.

395
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,492
There are some people up at the senior center.

396
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:37,676
You should get them out.

397
00:44:37,692 --> 00:44:39,424
They're fine. They're on the leeward side.

398
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:41,571
You need to go back and seek shelter there.

399
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:44,617
OK. But right now, I need to get home.

400
00:44:45,258 --> 00:44:46,647
Well, you can't cross here.

401
00:44:46,663 --> 00:44:47,703
Take the mountain road.

402
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:52,168
Hold on, kiddo.

403
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:52,736
Mm!

404
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,761
No! Stop! Don't do it!

405
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,125
Watch out! Here it comes!

406
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:05,455
Lisa, you gotta get out of here!

407
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:16,916
Hold on.

408
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,072
The fish are following us now!

409
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:49,413
Turn around. Sit down.

410
00:45:58,828 --> 00:45:59,360
Ah!

411
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:01,394
Ah!

412
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:04,868
Try to hang on to something!

413
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,844
That wave is just after us.

414
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,066
Mom, the little girl just fell in!

415
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:11,502
What?

416
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:13,375
She was running on a fish and she fell!

417
00:47:18,563 --> 00:47:19,180
Where?

418
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:30,143
I've never seen the ocean like this.

419
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:32,860
Sosuke, where did you see a little girl?

420
00:47:32,876 --> 00:47:35,775
She was out there, running on top of a huge fish!

421
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:36,934
That's impossible.

422
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:42,957
Sosuke, we have to go!

423
00:47:58,785 --> 00:48:00,988
It's OK. There was no little girl out there.

424
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:01,901
We're almost home.

425
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:59,353
There is a little girl. Come over here!

426
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:01,436
We'll help you! Come here!

427
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,879
Stay there, Sosuke.

428
00:49:11,057 --> 00:49:11,616
What?

429
00:49:29,071 --> 00:49:31,193
Sosuke, do you know her?

430
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:53,562
Ponyo?

431
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:56,578
Mm-hm! It's me, Ponyo!

432
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:58,307
It is you!

433
00:50:00,624 --> 00:50:04,076
Mom! Ponyo came back and she's a little girl now!

434
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:05,931
Who?

435
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:17,298
I found Sosuke!

436
00:50:36,254 --> 00:50:41,576
All right. Sosuke, Ponyo, life is mysterious and amazing.

437
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,563
But we have work to do now.

438
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,253
And I need both of you to stay calm.

439
00:50:46,336 --> 00:50:46,713
Me, too.

440
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:53,086
You can take off your rain coat now, Sosuke.

441
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,872
I've got a job for you, Ponyo. Will you hold the light?

442
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:00,693
Huh?

443
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,297
Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.

444
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:21,700
Here, this way!

445
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,829
It smells like you're in here!

446
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:29,872
Ow!

447
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:30,610
Ponyo!

448
00:51:35,356 --> 00:51:35,830
Oof!

449
00:51:35,933 --> 00:51:36,981
There, got ya.

450
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,100
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.

451
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:45,669
Look at that pretty red hair. It's almost dry.

452
00:51:46,459 --> 00:51:47,073
Huh!

453
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:48,041
Huh?

454
00:51:48,592 --> 00:51:49,621
And your clothes are dry.

455
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:52,753
That's because Ponyo was a fish, mom.

456
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:54,825
Water can't make her wet.

457
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:56,746
Mm-hm.

458
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,370
I really like this thing.

459
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:03,611
So let's calm ourselves down with a hot drink.

460
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:06,154
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?

461
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:07,489
Coming!

462
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:08,584
Ok.

463
00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:10,530
Who wants to bet the water is working?

464
00:52:10,646 --> 00:52:11,522
I do!

465
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:12,824
I do!

466
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:16,751
Water!

467
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,505
Water!

468
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,413
We have our own water tank outside in the yard.

469
00:52:23,385 --> 00:52:25,142
And who thinks the stove will light?

470
00:52:25,302 --> 00:52:28,059
And light! All right.

471
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,146
All right!

472
00:52:29,257 --> 00:52:30,927
We have our own propane tank.

473
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:36,218
OK. Let's all sit at the table.

474
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:37,534
OK!

475
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,494
Ponyo, the table's over here.

476
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:46,855
Now, sit down like this.

477
00:52:50,315 --> 00:52:51,534
Now, put your stuff down.

478
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:55,605
You need to use your hands.

479
00:52:56,254 --> 00:52:57,589
No, I'll use feet!

480
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:01,666
Look at that!

481
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,891
Uh... what are you guys doing?

482
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:09,830
Look at her feet. They're just like hands.

483
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:30,440
Here you go.

484
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,139
It's hot.

485
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:40,018
This is the best.

486
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:58,057
Mm!

487
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:24,525
Hm...

488
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:29,893
That hit the spot.

489
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,049
So, what would the two of you like to do now?

490
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:36,341
Ponyo wants ham!

491
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,212
All she thinks about is ham, mom.

492
00:54:39,998 --> 00:54:41,810
I better make some dinner then.

493
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:45,287
First, we should start the
generator so we can call Koichi.

494
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:49,871
That's my dad. We need power to talk to him on the radio.

495
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,358
He's out at sea right now, but he'll be fine.

496
00:54:53,636 --> 00:54:55,327
Is he an evil wizard?

497
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:56,621
No, of course not.

498
00:54:57,032 --> 00:54:58,500
He's the captain of a ship.

499
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,688
So, Ponyo, what's your dad like?

500
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:04,897
He hates humans! He keeps me in a bubble!

501
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:05,661
Huh?

502
00:55:05,788 --> 00:55:07,676
So I swam away from home.

503
00:55:07,977 --> 00:55:08,763
Huh?

504
00:55:09,564 --> 00:55:11,129
So, what's your mother like then?

505
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:14,583
She's big and beautiful!

506
00:55:15,071 --> 00:55:17,474
But she can be very scary.

507
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,011
Just like my mom.

508
00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:25,490
Ponyo, over here, please.

509
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:40,176
Mm!

510
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:44,839
Looks like something must have
gone wrong with the fuel line.

511
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,286
Maybe it's clogged.

512
00:55:46,674 --> 00:55:47,881
It's clogged.

513
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:49,693
It's clogged over there.

514
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,483
It's on!

515
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,945
It's light now! Yeah!

516
00:56:10,507 --> 00:56:12,355
Ponyo, you're amazing.

517
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,239
Antenna, antenna!

518
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,129
Hey, mom.

519
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:35,202
Did all the ships out there sink?

520
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,173
I don't see any lights out there.

521
00:56:43,374 --> 00:56:44,082
All right.

522
00:56:56,785 --> 00:56:58,170
Too loud!

523
00:56:58,638 --> 00:56:59,550
What's wrong?

524
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:03,081
I can't get any reception. That's really weird.

525
00:57:04,408 --> 00:57:08,745
Transmitting from Ja4ll. Ja4ll.

526
00:57:08,943 --> 00:57:10,342
Come in, Koichi.

527
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:13,056
This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.

528
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:15,577
We wanted you to know that we're all doing fine.

529
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:18,812
I'm taking care of everyone, dad!

530
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:20,756
Ham!

531
00:57:29,332 --> 00:57:30,736
Got your noodles all ready?

532
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:33,682
Be careful. It's really hot.

533
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:49,960
You have to wait a little bit.

534
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,106
It takes three minutes.

535
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:08,639
OK, close your eyes.

536
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:10,888
Keep 'em shut.

537
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:16,098
Ponyo, uh! No peeking!

538
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:20,987
Get ready to look now.

539
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,720
Abracadabra!

540
00:58:29,474 --> 00:58:30,540
Mm!

541
00:58:30,936 --> 00:58:31,985
It's ham!

542
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:32,985
Careful, it's hot.

543
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:37,762
Oh! Hot, hot, hot!

544
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:42,373
Mm...

545
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:56,852
Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.

546
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,942
Do you think Ponyo came from far, far away?

547
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:08,421
Yeah, I do.

548
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:26,853
Look outside. It looks like the waves have calmed down.

549
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,382
Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.

550
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:31,200
Do you see that light?

551
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:42,209
It's moving. There must be somebody still over there.

552
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:43,956
That's the senior center.

553
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,129
I don't see it now.

554
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:53,280
Did they evacuate?

555
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:55,067
I'm worried about the seniors.

556
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:59,449
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?

557
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:12,130
I've gotta go help them.

558
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:14,680
I can get there if I take the mountain road.

559
01:00:17,938 --> 01:00:20,422
Sosuke, I should go to the senior center.

560
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:21,747
I'm coming, too.

561
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:24,806
I'd feel better if you stay up here.

562
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:28,784
But why can't I come? We'll
wake up Ponyo and take her with us.

563
01:00:29,282 --> 01:00:30,709
I wanna go with you!

564
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:36,489
Sosuke, right now, our house is a beacon in the storm.

565
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:39,328
Our light can be seen by the town and by the ships,

566
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,138
and every place else is dark.

567
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,829
You know I need to help the old people.

568
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:46,127
So I'm going to leave you here in charge.

569
01:00:46,387 --> 01:00:47,992
You'll do the right thing. I know it.

570
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:50,974
You have to be the man of the house tonight.

571
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:53,294
Let Ponyo sleep, wait for me.

572
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:56,297
You're only five, but you're very smart.

573
01:00:56,572 --> 01:00:59,053
Sometimes, we take a leap. Be brave.

574
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:01,309
You can do it, and I'll be back.

575
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:03,922
Promise?

576
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:06,514
I promise.

577
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:07,815
You promised.

578
01:01:09,077 --> 01:01:10,159
I love you, Sosuke.

579
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,999
Captain, I can see the lights of a city up ahead.

580
01:02:09,241 --> 01:02:11,882
Finally, we can get our bearings again.

581
01:02:12,363 --> 01:02:14,625
We're some place I've never seen before.

582
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:17,439
Did the storm blow us to China?

583
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:23,372
What mountains are those? I have no idea where we are.

584
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:32,692
That is a huge wall of water.

585
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:35,225
Why is the moon so close?

586
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:40,428
Hm...

587
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,620
That's no mountain we're looking at.

588
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,143
And that's no town, either.

589
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:46,398
Those lights are ships.

590
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,229
The moon is so close,

591
01:02:58,271 --> 01:03:01,246
its gravity is forcing the ocean to rise.

592
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:02,781
What's going on here?

593
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:10,788
The engine stopped!

594
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:12,248
Try to hold her steady.

595
01:03:12,628 --> 01:03:13,806
Aral, drop the sea anchor.

596
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,492
Yes, sir.

597
01:03:28,537 --> 01:03:29,909
Something's coming this way.

598
01:03:56,944 --> 01:03:59,005
I just saw the goddess of mercy!

599
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:00,156
Ah!

600
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:11,554
The engine's working.

601
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:12,609
It was her.

602
01:04:12,827 --> 01:04:15,992
So you saw her, too? I thought maybe I was hallucinating.

603
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,647
Thank you for protecting us...

604
01:04:47,234 --> 01:04:48,325
Higher, higher.

605
01:04:55,053 --> 01:04:55,633
Huh?!

606
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:04,190
That has a powerful spell on it.

607
01:05:04,979 --> 01:05:07,058
How has she learned to do something like that?

608
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,680
What? I can't believe it! I no!

609
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,313
She's turned into a human! Whoa! Hold still!

610
01:05:30,812 --> 01:05:32,285
You... what are you doing?

611
01:05:34,085 --> 01:05:34,847
Hold still!

612
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:42,512
Girls! Girls... whoa!

613
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:44,989
Stop, stop! Please!

614
01:05:45,464 --> 01:05:47,869
Stop now! No! Stop! Ah!

615
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:49,756
Respect your father!

616
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,299
This was serious. I'm trying to save your sister.

617
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,829
At last, she has finally come.

618
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,001
Fujimoto.

619
01:06:44,596 --> 01:06:46,249
It's been a long time, my love.

620
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:48,860
Look at my ocean.

621
01:06:53,233 --> 01:06:54,747
Something has changed.

622
01:06:54,763 --> 01:06:58,278
It's like my ancient Devonian
sea, full of magic and power.

623
01:06:58,843 --> 01:07:00,558
You're going to be very upset, my dear.

624
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:04,327
Ponyo got into my elixirs, and she has tasted human blood.

625
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:08,359
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

626
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:12,473
Hm.

627
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:16,415
Of course, it's all my fault, really.

628
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:20,936
She's become so powerful that she's
opened a hole in the fabric of reality.

629
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:24,088
She's too young to understand,
and she wouldn't listen to me.

630
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,591
She's now a little girl. And she loves a little boy.

631
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,599
And the whole world is out of balance.

632
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:33,896
Please, please, remove the human
in her, or the planet is doomed.

633
01:07:35,827 --> 01:07:36,233
Huh?

634
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:46,030
Already the Earth is pulling satellites from the sky.

635
01:07:46,427 --> 01:07:48,198
And the moon pulls the sea closer...

636
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:51,401
Be calm, dear.

637
01:07:59,022 --> 01:08:02,268
Sosuke. The boy's name is Sosuke.

638
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:09,998
We love your sister, and we all want her to be happy.

639
01:08:13,617 --> 01:08:17,275
Listen, my darling, why don't we
let Ponyo become human for good?

640
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,635
We must test the boy. If Sosuke's love is true,

641
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:25,378
Ponyo will be permanently transformed
and the balance of nature will be restored.

642
01:08:25,394 --> 01:08:29,319
But if his love isn't real,
then Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

643
01:08:29,962 --> 01:08:33,164
True. That is where we all originated, my darling.

644
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:35,889
The boy is so young, so innocent.

645
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:36,367
What does...?

646
01:08:36,383 --> 01:08:37,149
Shh.

647
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:43,356
Let them sleep.

648
01:08:44,556 --> 01:08:46,119
They'll need their rest.

649
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:00,040
Sosuke!

650
01:09:01,677 --> 01:09:03,008
Sosuke!

651
01:09:08,055 --> 01:09:09,736
Ponyo, you OK?

652
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:12,228
Good morning, Sosuke.

653
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,904
Huh?

654
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,611
Look at that. The ocean is at our door.

655
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:46,497
How come your mom's not here?

656
01:09:46,536 --> 01:09:48,818
The water's so high. She must be stuck.

657
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:51,461
Too bad we don't have a boat.

658
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:56,368
There's a boat, right there!

659
01:09:58,474 --> 01:09:59,622
It's a little small.

660
01:09:59,804 --> 01:10:01,043
No, it's not.

661
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:09,699
Ah!

662
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,775
Uh! Huh?

663
01:10:17,491 --> 01:10:18,512
Thank you!

664
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:23,243
Wow! You even made the candle bigger.

665
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:24,843
We can fit!

666
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:26,202
This is fantastic.

667
01:10:26,282 --> 01:10:27,662
Fantastic!

668
01:10:27,773 --> 01:10:29,118
You take that end, please.

669
01:10:29,134 --> 01:10:29,672
OK!

670
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:33,514
Ready?

671
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,133
Let's go!

672
01:10:35,285 --> 01:10:35,768
Whoa!

673
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:38,160
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

674
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:41,506
Ah!

675
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:49,705
It actually floats!

676
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:54,932
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.

677
01:10:55,383 --> 01:10:56,912
Now, we have to fill the boiler.

678
01:10:57,983 --> 01:10:59,951
The water gets sucked in through this pipe.

679
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:03,187
Then it gets heated up here in this round thing.

680
01:11:31,003 --> 01:11:32,427
Well, that worked.

681
01:11:40,016 --> 01:11:41,630
Looks like everything's shipshape.

682
01:11:41,712 --> 01:11:42,891
Shipshape!

683
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:43,407
Yep.

684
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:44,727
Shipshape!

685
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:46,066
Shipshape.

686
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:49,681
Shipshape! Shipshape! Shipshape! Shipshape!

687
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:50,596
Shipshape!

688
01:12:12,064 --> 01:12:12,930
What's that?

689
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:19,143
Ow!

690
01:12:19,188 --> 01:12:19,826
Ow!

691
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:25,068
Look at that!

692
01:12:25,114 --> 01:12:26,012
It's burning.

693
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:29,539
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

694
01:12:37,914 --> 01:12:38,842
Is it working?

695
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:40,096
Hm...

696
01:12:50,573 --> 01:12:51,681
It's working!

697
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:56,168
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

698
01:12:56,401 --> 01:12:56,788
Yep.

699
01:12:56,847 --> 01:12:57,963
This is a good boat.

700
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:58,907
Mm-hm.

701
01:13:02,838 --> 01:13:04,112
Ah!

702
01:13:06,099 --> 01:13:08,082
Hey, Sosuke! Look at me!

703
01:13:08,215 --> 01:13:08,836
Mm-hm.

704
01:13:09,307 --> 01:13:11,298
Hey, this is even more fun!

705
01:13:11,357 --> 01:13:12,147
Mm-hm.

706
01:13:12,435 --> 01:13:14,334
That thing makes my nose hot.

707
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:17,067
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.

708
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,101
And I'll do the steering, OK?

709
01:13:19,363 --> 01:13:21,455
Mm-hm. I'm the lookout!

710
01:13:48,531 --> 01:13:49,701
There's the road.

711
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,102
That's the road my mom took last night.

712
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:56,462
I don't see her anywhere.

713
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,279
We'll see her.

714
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,369
She promised me she'd come back.

715
01:14:04,675 --> 01:14:08,284
Those are ancient fish. They
lived during the Devonian age.

716
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,238
I know that one. It's bothriocephalus.

717
01:14:14,592 --> 01:14:16,286
And that one is...

718
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:17,555
Dipnorhynchus.

719
01:14:17,571 --> 01:14:18,922
Dipnorhynchus!

720
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:22,173
Wow! That one's really huge!

721
01:14:22,189 --> 01:14:23,664
That's devonynchus!

722
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,856
Devonynchus!

723
01:14:32,164 --> 01:14:33,452
Ahoy!

724
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:36,305
Ahoy!

725
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:39,008
Whoa, there's a boat!

726
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,857
Ahoy!

727
01:14:43,182 --> 01:14:44,689
I'm gonna say that.

728
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:47,801
Ahoy!

729
01:14:49,556 --> 01:14:50,337
Ow!

730
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,733
Whoa, that's fast!

731
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:57,946
Hey!

732
01:14:57,962 --> 01:14:59,571
I'm getting the hang of this.

733
01:15:03,193 --> 01:15:05,001
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

734
01:15:10,971 --> 01:15:12,127
Hello, you two.

735
01:15:12,143 --> 01:15:12,715
Hello.

736
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:15,725
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.

737
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:19,376
I've seen you before. You're
Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

738
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,004
He's not a little boy. He's Sosuke!

739
01:15:22,206 --> 01:15:23,248
She's Ponyo.

740
01:15:24,673 --> 01:15:26,814
And I used to be a fish.

741
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:28,469
Is that right?

742
01:15:29,603 --> 01:15:31,576
I like your name, Ponyo. It's cute.

743
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:32,442
Mm-hm.

744
01:15:33,682 --> 01:15:35,580
By the way, have you seen my mom?

745
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:39,459
Your mother? Why isn't your mother with you?

746
01:15:39,518 --> 01:15:41,134
She went to the senior center.

747
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,479
Wow, way up there?

748
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,215
My baby likes you.

749
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:15,441
Oh, sweetheart.

750
01:16:22,632 --> 01:16:24,550
Oh, is that for us?

751
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:39,686
Can I have the cup?

752
01:16:44,907 --> 01:16:48,203
Well, thank you. It smells good.

753
01:16:51,725 --> 01:16:54,518
Wow, that's good soup. Thanks.

754
01:16:54,574 --> 01:16:56,341
My mom made it from scratch.

755
01:16:56,767 --> 01:16:58,244
The soup's for him!

756
01:16:58,431 --> 01:17:02,008
Oh, I'm sorry. He's a little too young.

757
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,148
He can only drink milk at this age.

758
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:05,929
But I could eat the soup instead,

759
01:17:06,104 --> 01:17:08,165
and it would help me to make milk for him.

760
01:17:08,726 --> 01:17:09,607
Huh?

761
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:12,710
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.

762
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,498
Ponyo, what do you say? Is it all right if I eat the soup?

763
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:18,324
That's fine.

764
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:20,048
Thank you, sweetheart.

765
01:17:20,064 --> 01:17:20,519
Huh?

766
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:41,192
People from the town! It's just like a parade!

767
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:46,397
Ahoy! Are any of you in need of assistance at this time?

768
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:51,278
We're all good here! But thanks
for checking on us, captain!

769
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,689
We are taking everyone to the mountain peak hotel!

770
01:17:54,839 --> 01:17:57,825
For your safety, we request that you follow us!

771
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:59,940
Aye, aye! Will do!

772
01:18:02,492 --> 01:18:03,994
Looks like the whole town is here.

773
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:05,094
I don't see your mom.

774
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,362
I hope she's OK.

775
01:18:06,535 --> 01:18:08,297
Ponyo, time for us to cast off.

776
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:09,008
Hold on a second.

777
01:18:16,055 --> 01:18:17,335
Here, have some milk.

778
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,437
Oh. Uh...

779
01:18:20,389 --> 01:18:21,310
It's for milk.

780
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:24,178
She already ate all the ham off those sandwiches.

781
01:18:24,286 --> 01:18:27,205
Thank you. That's very generous of you, Ponyo.

782
01:18:27,221 --> 01:18:28,088
Sosuke, here.

783
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:31,179
I brought you the biggest candle I have.

784
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,794
Thanks. Ponyo will make it bigger.

785
01:18:34,363 --> 01:18:35,320
See you later.

786
01:18:36,106 --> 01:18:36,861
Take care.

787
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:38,512
Be careful.

788
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,834
Oh! What's the matter?

789
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:53,722
Shh, shh, shh. You have a cold.

790
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:12,643
Ponyo!

791
01:19:26,347 --> 01:19:27,915
Hey, are you guys OK?

792
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:29,019
Hey, Sosuke.

793
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,521
What are you doing out here?

794
01:19:30,592 --> 01:19:32,149
Sosuke, where's your mother?

795
01:19:32,165 --> 01:19:34,377
She went to the senior center last night!

796
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,066
We're on our way to find her!

797
01:19:36,091 --> 01:19:38,938
You know, I still can't believe Lisa beat that wave.

798
01:19:39,049 --> 01:19:39,787
That's Lisa.

799
01:19:39,802 --> 01:19:42,430
Sosuke, can I ride with you?

800
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,764
I can't. I'm busy. I have a job to do now.

801
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:48,893
Check the park. The seniors should be there by now.

802
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:50,376
Good luck, kid!

803
01:19:50,401 --> 01:19:51,566
You'll find her!

804
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:55,675
We'll send a boat for the seniors
as soon as we drop this group off!

805
01:19:56,265 --> 01:19:57,694
Good luck, captain!

806
01:20:47,177 --> 01:20:49,875
Ponyo, our candle is just about out.

807
01:20:53,834 --> 01:20:56,559
We'll be OK. The fisherman gave me another one.

808
01:20:57,944 --> 01:21:00,362
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

809
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,753
Bye-bye.

810
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:11,423
Here, Ponyo. Can you make this bigger?

811
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:14,054
All right.

812
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,470
Hey, are you OK?

813
01:21:22,972 --> 01:21:23,459
Hm?

814
01:21:29,832 --> 01:21:30,559
Ponyo.

815
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:31,603
Hm?

816
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:48,920
Ponyo. Ponyo!

817
01:22:46,706 --> 01:22:48,762
Oh, good. I can walk from here.

818
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:16,745
There's the road.

819
01:23:29,973 --> 01:23:30,903
It's shrinking!

820
01:23:32,705 --> 01:23:33,371
Ponyo!

821
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:54,565
Ponyo!

822
01:23:56,005 --> 01:23:57,873
Ponyo, wake up!

823
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,745
Sosuke.

824
01:24:08,532 --> 01:24:09,433
You scared me.

825
01:24:10,216 --> 01:24:12,882
Don't turn into a fish again. I'd miss you.

826
01:24:25,513 --> 01:24:28,731
My mom's car! Ponyo, come on! She might be there!

827
01:24:33,014 --> 01:24:35,613
Hey, mom! Mom!

828
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,347
Mommy!

829
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:44,802
Mommy!

830
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,833
Mom!

831
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:53,886
Mommy!

832
01:24:57,451 --> 01:24:59,168
Mom!

833
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,725
Mom!

834
01:25:32,128 --> 01:25:33,898
Here, I've got your boat.

835
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:36,915
There's water coming from your eyes.

836
01:25:44,257 --> 01:25:45,733
Let's go find your mom.

837
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:46,844
Mm-hm.

838
01:26:33,665 --> 01:26:34,895
It's so beautiful!

839
01:26:34,942 --> 01:26:36,295
You forgot your cane!

840
01:26:36,664 --> 01:26:38,715
Look, here comes a whale again!

841
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,686
I think he sees us.

842
01:26:40,822 --> 01:26:42,871
The other side is nice, isn't it?

843
01:26:42,927 --> 01:26:44,048
And my knees don't hurt.

844
01:26:44,063 --> 01:26:45,603
This is the other side?

845
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:48,225
Where do you think we are, Las Vegas?

846
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,562
It's like a dream.

847
01:26:51,387 --> 01:26:54,452
Ladies, can we gather around, please?

848
01:26:54,733 --> 01:26:55,866
Coming!

849
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:57,806
Why don't we run?

850
01:26:58,308 --> 01:26:59,070
Come on!

851
01:27:00,269 --> 01:27:01,931
It's so nice to run.

852
01:27:02,081 --> 01:27:03,218
Beat you there!

853
01:27:08,415 --> 01:27:09,328
Winner!

854
01:27:14,223 --> 01:27:16,314
Everyone, quiet, please.

855
01:27:17,027 --> 01:27:19,282
The time has come for you to bear witness

856
01:27:20,223 --> 01:27:21,588
to a sacred test of love.

857
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:24,100
Oh, how exciting!

858
01:27:24,116 --> 01:27:25,970
Are they too young for this?

859
01:27:25,986 --> 01:27:27,182
Are we too old?

860
01:27:27,197 --> 01:27:28,262
When are they coming?

861
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:32,105
Please, ladies, the children are coming now.

862
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:34,690
And remember, this is a very important moment.

863
01:27:35,278 --> 01:27:36,176
A crucial moment.

864
01:27:37,379 --> 01:27:42,179
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm
come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?

865
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:44,211
It's not in his nature.

866
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:46,114
Of course I wouldn't.

867
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:50,196
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep. Excuse me.

868
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:01,829
Do you think we can trust him?

869
01:28:02,071 --> 01:28:04,228
I wonder what Lisa is thinking.

870
01:28:04,574 --> 01:28:05,950
She's with that woman,

871
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:09,452
and they've been talking all night and day.

872
01:28:17,436 --> 01:28:19,779
Poor Lisa. Must be hard on her.

873
01:28:20,065 --> 01:28:22,720
I wish we could hear what they're talking about.

874
01:28:22,978 --> 01:28:25,505
Oh, why don't we just ask. Lisa!

875
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:28,399
Lisa!

876
01:28:34,461 --> 01:28:35,463
Lisa!

877
01:28:35,674 --> 01:28:38,338
We wanna know what you're talking about!

878
01:28:38,492 --> 01:28:39,992
Come tell us!

879
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:55,337
My dear!

880
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:56,099
Lisa!

881
01:28:56,115 --> 01:28:57,131
What's going on?

882
01:28:57,383 --> 01:28:59,761
Lisa, are you sure you can trust that man?

883
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:01,100
It's so exciting.

884
01:29:01,116 --> 01:29:03,118
Tell us what's going to happen next.

885
01:29:03,134 --> 01:29:05,992
Whatever happens, I'm just glad you're all here for this.

886
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:07,564
It's going to be fine.

887
01:29:33,127 --> 01:29:34,770
I think I've been here before.

888
01:29:36,367 --> 01:29:37,145
Ponyo?

889
01:29:38,116 --> 01:29:39,663
Don't like this place.

890
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:45,828
Don't let go of my hand.

891
01:29:46,354 --> 01:29:46,887
Mm...

892
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:24,895
Ponyo!

893
01:30:44,734 --> 01:30:45,483
Ponyo!

894
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:54,777
Ponyo!

895
01:31:16,764 --> 01:31:19,097
Ponyo! Please don't die!

896
01:31:19,715 --> 01:31:20,970
Ponyo!

897
01:31:22,004 --> 01:31:24,233
Ponyo, wake up Ponyo!

898
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,448
Shh.

899
01:31:25,749 --> 01:31:27,156
Be careful not to wake her.

900
01:31:28,555 --> 01:31:31,827
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.

901
01:31:32,074 --> 01:31:33,806
The old ladies, your mother...

902
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:35,651
My mother?

903
01:31:36,095 --> 01:31:38,987
Won't you come with me and join them, Sosuke? Ponyo, too.

904
01:31:39,645 --> 01:31:40,449
Come with me.

905
01:31:41,983 --> 01:31:44,564
I promise I'm not going to take Ponyo away from you.

906
01:31:44,698 --> 01:31:45,326
We have to go now.

907
01:31:45,342 --> 01:31:46,843
Sosuke!

908
01:31:47,754 --> 01:31:50,431
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!

909
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:54,565
He tricked all the others into going
with him, but he couldn't fool me!

910
01:31:54,604 --> 01:31:55,378
Toki!

911
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:57,948
Did you hear me? Nobody fools me!

912
01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:00,936
There is so little time! My choice has to be made!

913
01:32:01,761 --> 01:32:04,599
If the moon comes any closer... can't you see it?

914
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:07,506
The world is out of balance! We will all be underwater!

915
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:11,097
That's the best excuse you can
come up with? A falling moon?

916
01:32:11,327 --> 01:32:12,895
Sosuke, come to me!

917
01:32:12,911 --> 01:32:13,713
Humans!

918
01:32:13,757 --> 01:32:15,801
Sosuke, please listen. You have to trust me.

919
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:18,900
You're the only one who can
save the planet. Do it now. Do it!

920
01:32:20,841 --> 01:32:21,562
Ponyo!

921
01:32:24,061 --> 01:32:26,129
Brunhilde, respect your father!

922
01:32:32,996 --> 01:32:34,117
Ponyo!

923
01:32:34,534 --> 01:32:36,833
Sosuke, come on!

924
01:32:37,358 --> 01:32:38,288
Bring them to me!

925
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:45,690
Faster!

926
01:32:48,353 --> 01:32:49,604
Jump for it!

927
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:30,220
Now what?

928
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:26,165
Mama!

929
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:26,760
Sosuke.

930
01:34:27,661 --> 01:34:28,395
Ponyo!

931
01:34:33,961 --> 01:34:35,300
You don't have to swim.

932
01:34:36,748 --> 01:34:37,856
I don't know why we're here.

933
01:34:47,752 --> 01:34:49,633
So this is Sosuke.

934
01:34:49,998 --> 01:34:50,816
How do you do?

935
01:34:51,615 --> 01:34:53,064
Are you Ponyo's mother?

936
01:34:53,953 --> 01:34:54,799
Yes.

937
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:57,242
You brought my daughter safely here.

938
01:34:57,484 --> 01:34:58,275
Shh!

939
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:59,242
Thank you.

940
01:35:00,419 --> 01:35:03,390
Sosuke, Ponyo opened a magic well

941
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:08,393
because she wants very much to
be human, to become a real girl.

942
01:35:08,666 --> 01:35:12,914
She needs you to accept and love her as she truly is.

943
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,714
You know that Ponyo was a fish, don't you?

944
01:35:18,959 --> 01:35:19,437
Mm-hm.

945
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,445
And you know her as a human.

946
01:35:21,868 --> 01:35:23,527
Your drop of blood did that.

947
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:24,996
Oh, that's it!

948
01:35:25,012 --> 01:35:28,265
I cut my thumb. Then Ponyo licked it and made it better.

949
01:35:28,362 --> 01:35:30,574
So that's how she changed into a human.

950
01:35:32,098 --> 01:35:35,387
Could you love her if she moved between two worlds?

951
01:35:36,121 --> 01:35:38,442
Mm-hm. I love all the Ponyos.

952
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:42,292
It's a big responsibility, but I really love her.

953
01:35:56,837 --> 01:35:58,677
Ponyo, come here, please.

954
01:36:13,489 --> 01:36:17,934
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.

955
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:24,559
To become human, you must choose to abandon magic.

956
01:36:25,177 --> 01:36:26,315
Can you do that?

957
01:36:26,759 --> 01:36:27,403
Mm-hm.

958
01:36:37,163 --> 01:36:40,048
Kiss the bubble, child, when you return to land,

959
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:44,098
and Ponyo will become a girl, growing up just like you.

960
01:36:48,262 --> 01:36:49,858
I accept, Ponyo.

961
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:53,224
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.

962
01:36:59,518 --> 01:37:02,651
Everyone, the balance of nature is restored.

963
01:37:02,667 --> 01:37:04,088
Life begins again.

964
01:37:06,572 --> 01:37:07,759
I'm so proud!

965
01:37:14,249 --> 01:37:14,973
My Sosuke.

966
01:37:40,647 --> 01:37:41,945
Good luck, Lisa.

967
01:37:42,547 --> 01:37:43,286
Thank you.

968
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:44,827
I'll take care of her.

969
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:59,122
There you are! Are you all right?

970
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:06,757
Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!

971
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,352
Don't bother, Shima-San. We like to walk.

972
01:38:09,368 --> 01:38:10,894
Life begins again.

973
01:38:14,782 --> 01:38:16,784
This is yours, I believe.

974
01:38:19,229 --> 01:38:20,010
Thank you.

975
01:38:20,668 --> 01:38:22,145
Try to remember me kindly.

976
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:24,534
If you will. May I?

977
01:38:30,531 --> 01:38:31,840
Take care of Ponyo.

978
01:38:34,738 --> 01:38:35,636
It's your father!

979
01:38:40,842 --> 01:38:43,890
Koichi! Hi!

980
01:38:44,628 --> 01:38:45,970
Over here!

981
01:38:46,447 --> 01:38:49,228
Ah! Lisa and Sosuke!

982
01:38:50,069 --> 01:38:51,275
Ahoy!

983
01:38:51,887 --> 01:38:54,281
Look, Ponyo, there's my dad's ship!
