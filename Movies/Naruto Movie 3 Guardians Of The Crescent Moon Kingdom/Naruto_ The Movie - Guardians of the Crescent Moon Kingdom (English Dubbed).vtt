TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Long ago,
when the lands were at war,

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.324 position:19% line:83% align:start
it was the hidden hand
of the shinobi that

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
often turned the tide of battle.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even today, as peace
reigns, shinobi

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
we must continue to
work behind the scenes,

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
defending their lands
and their people.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.005 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why here in the
Hidden Leaf Village,

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.043 position:7% line:83% align:start
you will find a new generation
of young shinobi apprentices,

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:46.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
all dreaming of being
the heroes of tomorrow.

it's not about being a hero,

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:54.121 position:10% line:83% align:start

on this tour of the lands--

- --you playing over there, huh?

00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:57.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
MICHIRU: --in order to, you
know, broaden my horizons.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.828 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Looks like it must be fun.

00:06:58.862 --> 00:07:00.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
MICHIRU: Tell me,
what kind of king

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.031 position:10% line:83% align:start
does the Leaf Village have?

KAKASHI: We don't have a king.

00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:04.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
Our leader is--

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:04.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
-So much for trying--

00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:05.502 position:10% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI: --called a Hokage--

00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:06.136 position:21% line:83% align:start
- --to be friendly.

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fine, be that way.

00:07:07.504 --> 00:07:09.339 position:10% line:83% align:start

passed down from generation

00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:12.709 position:30% line:83% align:start
to generation?

00:07:12.742 --> 00:07:14.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
-No, the title goes
to whoever's best

no matter who it might
be-- even this guy.

00:07:21.284 --> 00:07:24.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, it's Naruto's
dream to be Hokage some day.

00:07:25.022 --> 00:07:27.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
And in order to make
that dream real,

life and push himself

00:07:31.962 --> 00:07:32.830 position:33% line:83% align:start

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:34.665 position:10% line:83% align:start

in the mountains.

00:37:00.409 --> 00:37:02.445 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll go there for now.

00:37:06.382 --> 00:37:07.383 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Sheesh.

00:37:07.416 --> 00:37:08.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
Some reception.

00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:11.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
This isn't what I expected
from the Land of the Moon.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've seen graveyards
livelier than this.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.491 position:41% line:83% align:start
Hmph.

00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:14.925 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hmm?

00:37:17.995 --> 00:37:21.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, the prince's coach.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
Where are they going?

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.182 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasp]

00:37:39.216 --> 00:37:40.183 position:30% line:83% align:start
MICHIRU: Papa!

00:37:40.217 --> 00:37:41.085 position:27% line:83% align:start
HIKARU: Grandpa?

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.053 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Papa!

00:37:42.086 --> 00:37:42.552 position:41% line:83% align:start
Papa!

00:37:42.586 --> 00:37:43.253 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Grandpa!

00:37:43.286 --> 00:37:44.722 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Oh no, what's happened?

00:37:44.756 --> 00:37:45.556 position:41% line:83% align:start
Papa.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
-So that old man, he's the king?

00:37:49.661 --> 00:37:51.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
KOREGA: There have been clashes
of late between the King

00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:54.932 position:13% line:83% align:start
and some of his ministers,
led by Shabadaba.

00:37:54.966 --> 00:37:56.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Each side has different
ideas of where

00:37:56.601 --> 00:37:59.169 position:10% line:83% align:start
they want to lead this land.

00:37:59.203 --> 00:38:00.905 position:24% line:83% align:start
The King hoped to
reason with them

00:38:00.938 --> 00:38:03.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
and one day bring them
around to his point of view.

00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:07.645 position:7% line:83% align:start
But meanwhile, Shabadaba took
matters into his own hands.

00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:10.648 position:30% line:83% align:start
He plotted to
overthrow the King.

00:38:10.682 --> 00:38:13.685 position:16% line:83% align:start
By chance, we discovered
his plot in time

00:38:13.718 --> 00:38:15.988 position:13% line:83% align:start
and informed His Majesty.

00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:19.992 position:7% line:83% align:start
He realized the time had come
to confront his ministers.

00:38:20.025 --> 00:38:23.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
He knew this could be dangerous,
so he sent Prince Michiru

00:38:23.562 --> 00:38:26.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
and his son on a royal
tour of many lands

00:38:26.397 --> 00:38:27.700 position:13% line:83% align:start
in order to protect them.

00:38:27.733 --> 00:38:28.801 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasp]

00:38:28.834 --> 00:38:33.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
-That's why-- you sent us away.

00:38:33.505 --> 00:38:35.874 position:30% line:83% align:start
To protect us.

00:38:35.908 --> 00:38:37.609 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Once you were safely
out of the way,

00:38:37.643 --> 00:38:39.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
the King moved to
settle the matter.

00:38:39.645 --> 00:38:42.481 position:19% line:83% align:start
But it was too late--
Shabadaba had already

00:38:42.514 --> 00:38:45.985 position:13% line:83% align:start
hired shinobi mercenaries
to secure his position.

00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:48.620 position:19% line:83% align:start
We were outmaneuvered
and outmanned.

00:38:48.654 --> 00:38:52.324 position:21% line:83% align:start
We barely managed to
escape in the nick of time.

00:38:52.357 --> 00:38:54.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the King, to
my shame, did not.

00:38:58.297 --> 00:38:58.765 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Grandpa.

00:39:02.135 --> 00:39:03.670 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let me take a look
at his injuries.

00:39:06.473 --> 00:39:08.875 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasp]

00:39:08.908 --> 00:39:11.276 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasp]

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.880 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's-- it's turned to stone.

00:39:13.913 --> 00:39:17.117 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Yes One of these
three shinobi has

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.786 position:7% line:83% align:start
possession of a special jutsu.

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:23.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
And due to my negligence, he
was able to use it on the King.

00:39:26.459 --> 00:39:27.594 position:21% line:83% align:start
-What do you think?

00:39:27.627 --> 00:39:29.096 position:10% line:83% align:start
-It's worth a try, at least.

00:39:40.473 --> 00:39:42.442 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Unacceptable!

00:39:42.475 --> 00:39:45.079 position:7% line:83% align:start
We let both of them get away.

00:39:45.112 --> 00:39:48.314 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, blast, blast, blast!

00:39:48.348 --> 00:39:51.185 position:13% line:83% align:start
-They had good bodyguards.

00:39:51.218 --> 00:39:51.986 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:54.155 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is that all you have to say?

00:39:54.188 --> 00:39:55.923 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Calm down.

00:39:55.956 --> 00:39:59.360 position:16% line:83% align:start
They may be strong, but
we're stronger still.

00:39:59.393 --> 00:40:01.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have no doubt we
can handle them.

00:40:01.129 --> 00:40:02.730 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I hope so.

00:40:02.763 --> 00:40:05.499 position:10% line:83% align:start
It would be annoying to find
out I paid you all that money

00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:07.768 position:19% line:83% align:start
for nothing, Ishidate.

00:40:07.802 --> 00:40:08.270 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmph.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.075 position:19% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI: Well, Sakura?

00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:15.811 position:30% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: I can
treat petrification

00:40:15.844 --> 00:40:19.446 position:19% line:83% align:start
without a problem, but
in order to be reversed,

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.917 position:30% line:83% align:start
it needs to be
treated immediately.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.085 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I understand.

00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:28.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's just that so
much time has passed.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.925 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's nothing I can do.

00:40:37.399 --> 00:40:39.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
KAKERU: You're home, Michiru.

00:40:39.835 --> 00:40:41.736 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Papa!

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.838 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Grandpa!

00:40:42.871 --> 00:40:44.372 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Majesty.

00:40:44.406 --> 00:40:46.741 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hikaru too.

00:40:46.775 --> 00:40:47.243 position:35% line:83% align:start
Wonderful.

00:40:50.412 --> 00:40:51.948 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see.

00:40:51.981 --> 00:40:56.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
So it was you who
protected them.

00:40:56.351 --> 00:41:00.690 position:10% line:83% align:start
My friends, I thank you all.

00:41:00.723 --> 00:41:04.727 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tell me, how fares
the Land of the Moon.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
KOREGA: Not well, Your Majesty.

00:41:06.896 --> 00:41:08.764 position:27% line:83% align:start
It appears that,
soon, the whole island

00:41:08.798 --> 00:41:11.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
will be under the
rebels' control.

00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:13.870 position:30% line:83% align:start
KAKERU: I see.

00:41:13.903 --> 00:41:17.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
Michiru, what comes
to your mind when

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
you think about
this land of ours?

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:23.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
MICHIRU: Oh, it's
a wonderful place.

00:41:23.146 --> 00:41:26.449 position:30% line:83% align:start
Beautiful and
prosperous and wealthy.

00:41:26.482 --> 00:41:27.818 position:30% line:83% align:start
-That's right.

00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:31.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I see now that happiness
and wealth are not necessarily

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.056 position:27% line:83% align:start
the same thing.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:33.589 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh?

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:45.102 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Joy, happiness-- our
hopes and our dreams.

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:50.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
Our place of peace and harmony--
that's the sort of land I

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.376 position:33% line:83% align:start
envisioned.

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:54.578 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought Shabadaba
shared my dream,

00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:58.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I could never
get him to see it.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:00.251 position:33% line:83% align:start
Such a pity.

00:42:00.285 --> 00:42:03.087 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'm not sure I
understand either, Papa.

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:06.157 position:13% line:83% align:start
You talk just like Amayo.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.992 position:30% line:83% align:start
KAKERU: Amayo?

00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:14.132 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are the two of
you-- what a shame.

00:42:14.165 --> 00:42:17.902 position:7% line:83% align:start
-She told me I don't have any
clue about what really matters.

00:42:17.936 --> 00:42:22.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Amayo always was a
very sensible girl.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.743 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had hoped she'd
be a good influence.

00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:28.179 position:21% line:83% align:start
That, with a little
time, her common

00:42:28.213 --> 00:42:33.618 position:16% line:83% align:start
sense-- I never dreamed
she'd be the one to give up.

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:34.752 position:33% line:83% align:start
Such a pity.

00:42:38.023 --> 00:42:41.793 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, that's right--
what really matters.

00:42:51.637 --> 00:42:53.072 position:38% line:83% align:start
Michiru?

00:42:53.105 --> 00:42:54.273 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes?

00:42:54.306 --> 00:42:56.175 position:21% line:83% align:start
KAKERU: One request.

00:42:56.208 --> 00:42:58.010 position:30% line:83% align:start
My last wish.

00:42:58.043 --> 00:42:58.811 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!

00:42:58.844 --> 00:43:01.013 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!

00:43:01.046 --> 00:43:02.214 position:38% line:83% align:start
Grandpa!

00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:02.915 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Papa!

00:43:02.948 --> 00:43:03.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's very important--

00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:04.516 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Grandpa, no.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
- --what I have to say--

00:43:05.184 --> 00:43:05.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Please don't go.

00:43:05.718 --> 00:43:06.785 position:33% line:83% align:start
- --my son.

00:43:06.819 --> 00:43:08.620 position:21% line:83% align:start
This isn't the way I
imagined it happening.

00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:09.422 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You mustn't.

00:43:09.456 --> 00:43:10.190 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't talk like that, Papa.

00:43:10.223 --> 00:43:11.090 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I know it will be hard--

00:43:11.124 --> 00:43:11.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Please, save your strength.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.093 position:13% line:83% align:start
- --but you must face it.

00:43:13.126 --> 00:43:13.959 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Please, Papa!

00:43:13.993 --> 00:43:14.793 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Grandpa!

00:43:14.827 --> 00:43:18.398 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Starting now, you are the King.

00:43:18.431 --> 00:43:21.868 position:35% line:83% align:start

00:43:21.901 --> 00:43:24.603 position:35% line:83% align:start
[sobbing]

00:43:24.636 --> 00:43:27.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
You, Leaf Village shinobi.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.212 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sir.

00:43:32.245 --> 00:43:36.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I know I have no right
to ask this of you,

00:43:36.783 --> 00:43:42.889 position:10% line:83% align:start
but as you are an honorable
man, I make this last request.

00:43:42.922 --> 00:43:43.690 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Of course.

00:43:43.723 --> 00:43:45.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
KAKERU: Look after them.

00:43:45.825 --> 00:43:49.596 position:19% line:83% align:start
Protect them, please.

00:43:49.629 --> 00:43:51.098 position:7% line:83% align:start
-With our lives, Your Majesty.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:56.669 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I thank you.

HIKARU: My grandfather
was always kind to me.

00:44:39.948 --> 00:44:42.683 position:16% line:83% align:start
He made that bow for me.

00:44:42.716 --> 00:44:46.054 position:24% line:83% align:start
He always used to
watch me practice.

00:44:46.088 --> 00:44:51.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
And whenever I made a bullseye,
he was even happier than I was.

00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:52.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
I loved him so much.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:56.832 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Do you think you
understand what

00:44:56.865 --> 00:44:58.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
your grandpa was trying to say?

00:44:58.733 --> 00:44:59.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[sniff]

00:45:04.474 --> 00:45:08.511 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think I understand, sorta.

00:45:08.544 --> 00:45:11.114 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's about what happens
here in your heart.

00:45:15.485 --> 00:45:20.790 position:10% line:83% align:start
In the Leaf Village, Old Man
Hokage was like my grandfather.

00:45:20.823 --> 00:45:24.160 position:16% line:83% align:start
He kind of looked after
me when he was alive.

00:45:24.193 --> 00:45:26.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
And when he died, it was
like he left everything

00:45:26.996 --> 00:45:28.464 position:19% line:83% align:start
for me to look after.

00:45:28.498 --> 00:45:32.168 position:24% line:83% align:start
And so that's why
I promised myself

00:45:32.201 --> 00:45:35.171 position:7% line:83% align:start
that some day I'll be Hokage.

00:45:35.204 --> 00:45:38.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
What your grandpa left is
something very precious,

00:45:38.774 --> 00:45:42.044 position:13% line:83% align:start
and you and your father--
it's up to both of you

00:45:42.078 --> 00:45:44.448 position:27% line:83% align:start
to keep it safe.

00:45:44.481 --> 00:45:54.525 position:16% line:83% align:start
-But if it's really that
precious-- I'm not sure

00:45:54.525 --> 00:46:00.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
-But if it's really that
precious-- I'm not sure

00:46:00.663 --> 00:46:02.166 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm ready for that.

00:46:02.199 --> 00:46:03.333 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Of course you are.

00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:05.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
Or at least you will be.

00:46:05.435 --> 00:46:05.936 position:30% line:83% align:start
HIKARU: But--

00:46:10.475 --> 00:46:12.376 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Mm.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:13.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're friends, right?

00:46:13.777 --> 00:46:16.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
So someday, when I'm
Hokage and you're king,

00:46:16.648 --> 00:46:18.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
our two lands will
be friends too.

00:46:18.949 --> 00:46:20.017 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Really?

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
-If the Land of the
Moon is ever in trouble,

00:46:21.685 --> 00:46:23.655 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Leaf Village will
be there for you.

00:46:23.687 --> 00:46:25.523 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you'll do the
same for me, right?

00:46:33.298 --> 00:46:35.732 position:44% line:83% align:start
OK?

00:46:35.766 --> 00:46:37.168 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:46:37.202 --> 00:46:38.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
-All right then, it's a promise.

00:46:45.009 --> 00:46:50.815 position:13% line:83% align:start
From this day on, friends
forever, no matter what.

00:46:50.848 --> 00:46:53.652 position:16% line:83% align:start
HIKARU: Friends forever.

00:46:55.588 --> 00:46:57.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
KOREGA: There are
simply too few of us.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
We haven't a chance against
the traitor Shabadaba

00:46:59.991 --> 00:47:01.594 position:27% line:83% align:start
and his forces.

00:47:01.627 --> 00:47:05.097 position:7% line:83% align:start
For now, the only thing to do
is get the prince and his son

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
out the Land of the Moon.

00:47:07.066 --> 00:47:10.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll go to the other
lands, our allies,

00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:12.037 position:19% line:83% align:start
and hope that they'll
help us with more troops.

-Where are they?

00:47:29.288 --> 00:47:29.755 position:44% line:83% align:start

00:48:24.512 --> 00:48:25.879 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just a minute.

-Are you really that stupid?

-We knew that you'd
arrange for a ship.

00:48:50.137 --> 00:48:51.807 position:21% line:83% align:start
We've been watching
the coast just

-So, now I get it.

00:51:27.433 --> 00:51:29.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was that paper bomb.

00:51:30.703 --> 00:51:32.003 position:21% line:83% align:start
Effective, isn't it?

00:51:32.036 --> 00:51:35.174 position:16% line:83% align:start
An odorless poison that

you're all sitting ducks!

-Hmm.

00:52:50.718 --> 00:52:54.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
What a remarkable
look on his face.

00:52:54.255 --> 00:52:58.826 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd almost say I
created a work of art.

Almost.
