00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:21.154 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:23.825 position:19% line:83% align:start
In pursuit of wealth,
fame, and power,

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.828 position:21% line:83% align:start
countless souls are
driven to the seas.

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:28.495 position:30% line:83% align:start
For those who
long for adventure,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.598 position:16% line:89% align:start
it is a dream come true,

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:33.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
but there are some among them
who seek only to plunder,

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.837 position:24% line:83% align:start
leaving an endless
trail of chaos

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.639 position:7% line:89% align:start
and destruction in their wake.

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:40.440 position:21% line:83% align:start
For the powerless,
it is an age of oppression,

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.443 position:13% line:83% align:start
where the strong may prey
on the weak at any moment.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.279 position:35% line:83% align:start
The Navy,
under the World Government,

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.649 position:30% line:83% align:start
seeks to stem
the tide of piracy,

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
but even they cannot
help everyone.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.721 position:10% line:83% align:start
So in their moment of need,
who can the oppressed turn to?

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:58.492 position:7% line:83% align:start
Who has the strength to answer
their prayers for salvation?

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know if we can make it.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.229 position:19% line:83% align:start
No one is looking out
for folks like us.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.632 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's just gonna
keep getting worse.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:08.670 position:21% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Seems like
I'm crying every day.

00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:10.270 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Navy's useless.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.740 position:16% line:83% align:start
They can't protect us,
and now we're gonna starve!

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:14.742 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's like they don't
even care if we die!

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:15.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
No point in blaming them for it.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.478 position:10% line:83% align:start
The pirates are the ones who
took our stuff away, you know!

00:01:18.513 --> 00:01:19.881 position:13% line:89% align:start
Those jerks! I hate them!

00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:21.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why do they have
to be so greedy?

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.184 position:21% line:83% align:start
All they ever do is
make people suffer!

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:27.187 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CITIZENS crying]

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
Does anyone even care
what happens to us?

00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:32.860 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FISHERMAN A] Please,
I can't live like this anymore.

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:34.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're the only one
who understands.

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:35.763 position:21% line:89% align:start
You have to help us!

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:36.531 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER B]
I'm begging.

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:37.665 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER A]
We believe in you.

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [VILLAGER C] Help us.
- [VILLAGER D] You can fix this!

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.169 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CITIZENS]
You have to!

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.739 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
I know. I hear you.

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:48.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why I'm bringing
this world into a new age.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
One where you all can be happy.

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:56.618 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CROWD chattering]

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:17.505 position:33% line:83% align:start
Gotta say,
that's one helluva crowd!

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:19.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uta's never done
a show in person before,

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:21.441 position:7% line:89% align:start
so this is kind of a big deal.

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her songs on the
Transponder make me

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.345 position:7% line:89% align:start
wanna rock and roll all night!

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.381 position:10% line:89% align:start
And did you see that stage?

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:29.851 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know I'm gonna freak out
when she shows up!

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:33.253 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can't wait!

00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:39.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
It would seem her popularity
has spread to merfolk as well!

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.763 position:30% line:83% align:start
But remind me,
why are we dressed up?

00:02:41.796 --> 00:02:43.798 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're wearing costumes
to hype up her show,

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:46.366 position:7% line:83% align:start
and in return, we got a set of
these babies for free!

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.969 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wow, looks like garbage.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.537 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
I think it's fun.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.371 position:33% line:83% align:start
And besides,
who wouldn't want to support

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:52.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
the world's number
one sweetheart?

00:02:52.807 --> 00:02:54.809 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY] Is this chick
that big of a deal?

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.410 position:27% line:83% align:start
I would describe
her performances

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.879 position:7% line:89% align:start
as an out-of-body experience.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:02:59.714 position:10% line:89% align:start
And trust me, I'm an expert.

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:01.683 position:38% line:89% align:start
U! T! A!

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:03.751 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now let's go Uta!

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.620 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're pathetic.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:08.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna take all of your
swords, shove 'em up your ass,

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.323 position:24% line:83% align:start
roast you alive,
and make some shish kebabs!

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
Like to see you try, curly brow.

Aw yeah.

she's wide open.

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:47.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
All we gotta do is
swoop in and swoop out

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:49.070 position:16% line:89% align:start
and we're set for life.

Hm?

- Uta. Been a while, huh?
- [UTA] Huh?

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:15.296 position:19% line:89% align:start
C'mon, look, it's me!

I don't... [gasps]

No way!

Uta wouldn't be pals
with a pirate! Come on!

[ROBIN] That's a surprise.
Seems Luffy is friends with Uta.

At least introduce us!

Shanks the pirate?

Not just any pirate,

I'll never forget that name.

all those years ago.

[sighs]

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:25.366 position:16% line:83% align:start
So that's why they chose
Elegia as the venue.

Shanks had a daughter

00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:41.315 position:7% line:89% align:start
all this time and no one knew!

that means he's got a weakness!

enough to take him on,

Who's the other guy?

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:12.746 position:13% line:89% align:start
My name is Charlotte Oven

and I'm the fourth son
of Big Mom.

I'm glad we came.

Yes. In more ways than one,

Okay! That's enough.

It's nice to meet your friends,

All of you are my fans, right?

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:39.867 position:16% line:83% align:start
So you should get along
and enjoy the show!

Wait a sec.

who won't take "no"
for an answer!

00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:49.777 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because we're pirates, and
pirates take whatever they want,

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
even if we have to
beat it out of you!

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then quit being pirates,
you doofs!

I'll forgive all the

none of the cruelty

not stop the whole show.

00:16:40.234 --> 00:16:44.104 position:24% line:83% align:start
We must prepare,
in case Tot Musica returns.

00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:48.075 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now there's a grim thought.
We can't allow it to awaken.

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:52.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that's on the table, then we
must take decisive action.

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:55.617 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAINU]
All right.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.752 position:19% line:83% align:start
We just got the order
to bring in Uta.

00:16:57.785 --> 00:16:59.654 position:13% line:89% align:start
That girl's a damn menace.

00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:01.756 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KIZARU] That little missy
has quite the fan club.

00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:03.156 position:16% line:89% align:start
Must be a real charmer.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.158 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now she's got
our attention, too.

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:07.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
Enough! This isn't
a joking matter.

00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:10.698 position:13% line:83% align:start
The target's on the island
of music, Elegia.

00:17:10.732 --> 00:17:14.669 position:7% line:83% align:start
The same spot Tot Musica was
sealed away in ancient times.

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:17.404 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FUJITORA] All right,
so how many are we sending?

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.840 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well let me put it this way!

00:17:18.873 --> 00:17:21.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
How many ships
do you have ready to sail?

00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:22.644 position:33% line:83% align:start
[FUJITORA]
That would be 30.

00:17:22.677 --> 00:17:24.512 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAINU]
Good! Send them all,

00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:27.549 position:21% line:83% align:start
packed with troops
and loaded for war!

00:17:27.582 --> 00:17:28.583 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SAILOR A]
In the event of...

00:17:28.616 --> 00:17:30.083 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SAILOR B]
Keep that capstan going.

00:17:30.117 --> 00:17:32.119 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait for the signal,
and then push together.

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:34.087 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't rush,
but put your backs into it!

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:35.723 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SAILOR C] Anemometer reading
is at four knots,

00:17:35.757 --> 00:17:36.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
with surface conditions...

00:17:36.758 --> 00:17:38.358 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SAILOR D] I want all
gunner crews assembled

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:39.594 position:13% line:89% align:start
and checking your cannons.

00:17:39.627 --> 00:17:42.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
Check your barrels for cracks,
make sure your vents are clear,

00:17:42.864 --> 00:17:43.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
confirm your wheels are mobile,

00:17:44.032 --> 00:17:47.602 position:13% line:83% align:start
and make sure you've got
plenty of ammunition secured.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:52.640 position:27% line:83% align:start
[UTA] Hey guys!
Is anyone here getting hungry?

00:17:52.674 --> 00:17:54.609 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry!
I'll make tons of food

00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:56.143 position:13% line:89% align:start
and some other stuff, too!

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:58.813 position:30% line:89% align:start
[CROWD cheers]

00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:02.249 position:19% line:83% align:start
[gasps] It's so cute!
Can I keep it?

00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:05.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course! Everyone
deserves to be happy!

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:08.221 position:7% line:83% align:start
I want you all to eat whatever
you want, whenever you want!

00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:11.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're gonna sing, dance,
and have fun every single day!

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:12.894 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's like a dream.

00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:14.762 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's nothing to fear anymore!

00:18:14.796 --> 00:18:15.964 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing you can't do!

00:18:15.997 --> 00:18:19.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Stick with me and we'll make
everyone's wishes come true!

00:18:19.567 --> 00:18:21.903 position:24% line:89% align:start
A new age is here!

00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:27.542 position:30% line:89% align:start
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.913 position:5% line:83% align:start
[PEROSPERO grunts] Her power's
greater than expected.

00:18:31.946 --> 00:18:33.881 position:30% line:83% align:start
Looks like we
underestimated her!

00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:38.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
[BIG MOM laughs]
Red-Haired Shanks' daughter.

00:18:38.352 --> 00:18:41.254 position:10% line:89% align:start
Truly a remarkable specimen.

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:43.591 position:7% line:89% align:start
I want her and I want her now.

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:47.394 position:7% line:83% align:start
Plus those insufferable Straw
Hats will be with her, too.

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:49.931 position:19% line:89% align:start
Time to get eh-licked.

00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:52.165 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KATAKURI]
I'll go to Elegia.

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:59.206 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KATAKURI] Anyone who lays
a finger on my sister will pay.

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:04.579 position:7% line:83% align:start
All of these rare ingredients,
here in a flash!

00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:06.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] Uta hooked me up
with some booze, too.

00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:08.516 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
She said "anything," right?

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:10.752 position:10% line:83% align:start
So does that means she could
give us some treasure?

00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:12.352 position:21% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER] How do you
think her powers work?

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:13.955 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:19:13.988 --> 00:19:16.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY] What kinda Devil Fruit
would that even be?

00:19:16.223 --> 00:19:17.825 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Can't cook with this.

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:20.394 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've witnessed plenty of
powers, but none like this.

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:21.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
Luffy, you're friends with Uta.

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:24.231 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have any idea how
she can make all this work?

00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:26.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
Beats me! Heh, she was
always good at singing,

00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:29.469 position:19% line:83% align:start
- so maybe that's it!
- What?

00:19:29.504 --> 00:19:32.840 position:30% line:83% align:start
[BROOK laughs]
Luffy might be onto something!

00:19:32.874 --> 00:19:36.611 position:10% line:83% align:start
Perhaps she was smiled upon
by the gods of music themselves,

00:19:36.644 --> 00:19:38.311 position:13% line:89% align:start
and granted mighty powers!

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's up? Is everyone
having a good time?

00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:42.315 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, Princess! Thanks to you!

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:43.685 position:5% line:89% align:start
With all these rare ingredients,

00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:45.485 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's like a playground
for a chef!

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.789 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everything looks awesome to me!

00:19:47.822 --> 00:19:48.923 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's good to hear.

00:19:48.956 --> 00:19:51.793 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd hate to make a bad
impression on Luffy's friends!

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:53.928 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Hold up. Is anyone missing?
- Nuh-uh.

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:56.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you messing with me?
That hat, it belongs-

00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:58.900 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is everybody!

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:02.335 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, Luffy, you wanna
play a game with me?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.572 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] There's no way
you can beat me anymore.

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:05.840 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on!

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:08.710 position:24% line:83% align:start
I beat your butt
183 times in a row!

00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:11.846 position:13% line:89% align:start
No! <i>I</i> beat <i>you</i> 183 times!

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:13.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those are rather
divergent perspectives.

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:15.783 position:24% line:89% align:start
What kind of game?

00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:17.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'd compete in
just about anything.

00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:20.955 position:13% line:83% align:start
Stuff like knife throwing,
or arm wrestling, you name it!

00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:24.257 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right! I know exactly
what to do! Watch!

00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:25.593 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:34.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UTA] We'll have a chicken
speed-eating contest.

00:20:34.301 --> 00:20:35.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
- How's that?
- [LUFFY] Great!

00:20:35.636 --> 00:20:38.472 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY laughs] But we're
still missing something.

00:20:38.506 --> 00:20:40.508 position:24% line:83% align:start
[UTA] Don't worry.
I've got it covered!

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:43.276 position:38% line:89% align:start
[roars]

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.945 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm ready!

00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:44.879 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:46.413 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Three, two, one!

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.426 position:33% line:89% align:start
You thirsty?

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:01.929 position:16% line:89% align:start
Awesome! Thanks a bunch!

00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:03.664 position:30% line:89% align:start
[UTA giggles]

00:21:03.698 --> 00:21:06.500 position:30% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY gasps]

00:21:06.534 --> 00:21:07.769 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uta's the winner!

00:21:07.802 --> 00:21:09.504 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah!

00:21:09.537 --> 00:21:12.372 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uta! You cheater!

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.942 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh. He might die.

00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:18.579 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:22.449 position:30% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY gasps]

00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:23.618 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oops, sorry!

00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:25.620 position:27% line:83% align:start
I forgot you ate
a Devil Fruit like me!

00:21:25.653 --> 00:21:26.521 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be angry!

00:21:26.554 --> 00:21:28.089 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
I want a do-over on that game!

00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:29.056 position:33% line:89% align:start
You cheated!

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.025 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're such a sore loser!

00:21:31.058 --> 00:21:33.828 position:10% line:83% align:start
And since I won, you better
tell me where Shanks is hiding!

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:34.695 position:21% line:89% align:start
You know, don't you?

00:21:34.729 --> 00:21:35.563 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Nope.

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:36.363 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
You're kidding.

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:37.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then why've you
got his straw hat?

00:21:38.032 --> 00:21:38.866 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
I'm borrowing it.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.901 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Quick question!

00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:42.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you mind if I ask
where the two of you met?

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.605 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? She came to
Windmill Village

00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:46.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
with Shanks and his crew
when I was a little kid.

00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:48.042 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, So you played together

00:21:48.075 --> 00:21:49.911 position:13% line:83% align:start
back in your old hometown,
how cute!

00:21:49.944 --> 00:21:51.444 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:21:57.718 --> 00:22:00.822 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] What're you doing?
Daydreaming again?

00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:01.956 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come sit with me.

00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:03.524 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh, that's boring!

00:22:03.558 --> 00:22:05.626 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wanna play a game!

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.762 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
Ugh. Why're you such a baby?

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:10.965 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right, I think I know
exactly what game to play.

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:12.465 position:33% line:83% align:start
[UTA, LUFFY]
Chicken Chomper!

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:14.101 position:38% line:89% align:start
[barks]

00:22:14.135 --> 00:22:16.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whoever can eat the most
before they run wins!

00:22:16.637 --> 00:22:17.470 position:38% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:22:17.505 --> 00:22:18.272 position:30% line:89% align:start
Cut that out!

00:22:18.306 --> 00:22:20.107 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're going to
get hurt, you two!

00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:20.975 position:33% line:83% align:start
[UTA, LUFFY]
We won't!

00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:22.677 position:35% line:83% align:start

Uta! Luffy!

[SHANKS]
Eh, let 'em have their fun.

00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:30.518 position:16% line:83% align:start
This isn't just a game,
it's a matter of honor for them.

00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:31.418 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:32.119 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ready?

Three, two, one, go!

[MAKINO] What are they
competing over, anyway?

00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:38.659 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's a test of
their pirate skills,

00:22:38.693 --> 00:22:40.895 position:24% line:83% align:start
though I don't get
the chicken part.

00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:46.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
Luffy! Chow down!

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:47.001 position:33% line:89% align:start
You thirsty?

00:22:47.034 --> 00:22:50.004 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Thanks, Uta!

Luffy!

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.842 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
he fell for it again!

00:22:54.876 --> 00:22:55.877 position:10% line:89% align:start
You still alive down there?

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.044 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not over!

00:22:57.078 --> 00:22:58.846 position:24% line:83% align:start
That didn't settle
nothing, darn it!

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.848 position:16% line:89% align:start
Grow up! You sore loser!

00:23:00.882 --> 00:23:02.583 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're the loser, you cheated!

00:23:02.617 --> 00:23:04.051 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm a pirate, dummy!

00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:05.519 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't follow the rules!

00:23:05.553 --> 00:23:06.988 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you got distracted
during a duel

00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:08.589 position:10% line:89% align:start
'cause you're a stupid baby!

00:23:08.623 --> 00:23:10.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
Would you stop acting
like you're so cool?

00:23:10.191 --> 00:23:12.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're not a real pirate
till Shanks says so.

00:23:12.627 --> 00:23:14.762 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shut up! I'm Shanks' daughter,

00:23:14.795 --> 00:23:15.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
which means I've
been sailing and

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.832 position:7% line:89% align:start
going on adventures for years!

00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:20.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm way, way, way different
than a little snot like you!

- [UTA] Yuh-huh!

00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:23.938 position:24% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] 'Kay then!
If you're a real pirate,

00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:25.072 position:16% line:89% align:start
why don't you fight me?

00:23:25.106 --> 00:23:28.175 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm ready for you any time!

00:23:28.209 --> 00:23:32.747 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH yell]

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.149 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS] I think that's
enough nonsense for today.

00:23:35.182 --> 00:23:36.918 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
You should be ashamed, Shanks!

00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:39.486 position:16% line:83% align:start
A real pirate wouldn't
bonk kids with his sword!

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.123 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah? What's wrong?
You never heard of "tough love"?

00:23:42.156 --> 00:23:44.525 position:16% line:83% align:start
But swords aren't tough,
they're sharp!

00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:47.094 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aw! Did you say "love"?

00:23:47.128 --> 00:23:50.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you like me so much, Shanks,
you don't have to be shy!

00:23:50.531 --> 00:23:52.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
What about me?

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.070 position:10% line:83% align:start
Y'always gotta climb on me,
you clingy little monkeys?

00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:58.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, Uta? Why d'you
call him "Shanks"?

00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.141 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shouldn't you call him "Dad"?

00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:02.009 position:21% line:83% align:start
He might be my dad,
but as a pirate,

00:24:02.043 --> 00:24:03.476 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shanks is my captain!

00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:05.680 position:19% line:89% align:start
And he's my hero, too!

00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:10.551 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UTA giggles] I'm feeling
so good about beating Luffy,

00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:11.552 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think I'm gonna sing!

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:14.255 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] No fair, Shanks!
I wanna go sailing, too!

00:24:14.288 --> 00:24:15.589 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing personal, kid,

00:24:15.623 --> 00:24:17.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you're too rowdy
for my crew.

00:24:17.124 --> 00:24:18.092 position:35% line:89% align:start
But Uta-

00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:19.827 position:19% line:83% align:start
Waits back on the ship
when we have a fight,

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.630 position:24% line:83% align:start
but there's no way
you would sit still.

00:24:23.297 --> 00:24:24.131 position:44% line:89% align:start
See?

00:24:24.165 --> 00:24:24.832 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
That's right!

00:24:24.865 --> 00:24:26.600 position:7% line:89% align:start
I may be little, but I'm Uta,

00:24:26.634 --> 00:24:28.235 position:33% line:83% align:start
musician of
the Red-Hair Pirates!

00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:29.103 position:21% line:89% align:start
And when I grow up,

00:24:29.136 --> 00:24:31.038 position:19% line:83% align:start
my songs are going to
make a new age,

00:24:31.072 --> 00:24:32.940 position:10% line:89% align:start
where everyone will be free!

00:24:32.974 --> 00:24:34.275 position:16% line:89% align:start
Star's taking the stage.

00:24:34.308 --> 00:24:36.210 position:10% line:89% align:start

[NAMI, UTA laugh]

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.350 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now that I think back,
you disappeared suddenly.

00:25:49.383 --> 00:25:50.851 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh-

00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:53.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is there a story? What happened?

00:25:53.187 --> 00:25:56.957 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, what was it?

00:25:56.991 --> 00:26:00.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was always excited when Shanks
came to visit the village.

00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:03.097 position:7% line:89% align:start
But that day it was different.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.865 position:30% line:89% align:start
Welcome back!

00:26:04.899 --> 00:26:07.835 position:19% line:83% align:start
What kinda adventures
did you have this time?

00:26:07.868 --> 00:26:10.604 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? What gives?

00:26:10.638 --> 00:26:12.339 position:16% line:89% align:start
Fine! I'll just ask Uta!

00:26:12.373 --> 00:26:15.209 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uta! Uta!

00:26:15.242 --> 00:26:18.079 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you wanna brag about your
trip, I'll listen this time!

Why are you hiding? It's me!

00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:25.953 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Shanks? Where'd Uta go?

00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:33.094 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's that look?
Did something bad happen to her?

00:26:33.127 --> 00:26:35.663 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS]
Nothing to worry about, Luffy.

00:26:35.696 --> 00:26:38.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uta left the crew to
become a singer, that's all.

00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:40.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was the right choice.

00:26:44.004 --> 00:26:46.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] So why'd you stop
wanting to be a pirate, Uta?

00:26:47.007 --> 00:26:49.810 position:24% line:83% align:start
You used to love
the Red-Hair Pirates.

00:26:51.745 --> 00:26:53.214 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even if I wanted to be a pirate,

00:26:53.247 --> 00:26:55.049 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wanted to be
a singer way more!

00:26:55.082 --> 00:26:57.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean, look, in just two years,

00:26:57.318 --> 00:26:59.920 position:19% line:83% align:start
I got this many fans
rooting for my success!

00:26:59.954 --> 00:27:01.055 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
All right.

00:27:01.088 --> 00:27:03.791 position:10% line:83% align:start
[UTA] What about you, Luffy?
What are you doing now?

00:27:03.824 --> 00:27:06.160 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm a pirate, obviously!

00:27:06.193 --> 00:27:07.895 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:27:07.928 --> 00:27:10.064 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course. That was your dream.

00:27:10.097 --> 00:27:10.898 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh!

00:27:10.931 --> 00:27:13.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates.

00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:16.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Luffy. Why don't you
give up on that?

Huh?

00:27:17.037 --> 00:27:19.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'd be much better off
sticking with me.

00:27:19.273 --> 00:27:20.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your friends are
all fans of mine,

00:27:20.474 --> 00:27:22.209 position:7% line:89% align:start
so they'd be up for it, right?

have a great time!

seeing you again, Uta!

Thanks for all the meat!

[LUFFY]
Who're you?

Straight to the point, then.

00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:57.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
My name is Gordon and
I am the former ruler

[LAW]
That may be true now,

00:35:05.138 --> 00:35:08.543 position:7% line:83% align:start
but Elegia was once known as
the music capital of the world.

00:35:08.576 --> 00:35:11.746 position:19% line:83% align:start
Until all its citizens
disappeared overnight.

00:35:11.779 --> 00:35:14.515 position:16% line:83% align:start
Really? So what the hell
happened to 'em?

00:35:14.549 --> 00:35:17.585 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LAW] It was the work of
a famous pirate, or so they say.

00:35:17.619 --> 00:35:18.553 position:33% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO]
Hm?

00:35:24.692 --> 00:35:27.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
[GORDON] Let me tell you
something about Uta.

00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:29.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
After Elegia's citizens
were gone,

00:35:29.897 --> 00:35:32.499 position:30% line:83% align:start
I raised her
in this city, myself.

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:33.868 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Wait, what?

00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:34.802 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
But as I said,

00:35:34.836 --> 00:35:38.405 position:19% line:83% align:start
the others were gone,
so it was only us.

00:35:38.438 --> 00:35:40.575 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure she was
terribly lonely.

00:35:40.608 --> 00:35:43.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, she put on
a brave face around me,

00:35:43.845 --> 00:35:46.514 position:27% line:83% align:start
but many times,
when she was alone,

00:35:46.547 --> 00:35:50.484 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would catch her singing
about her lost friends.

00:35:50.518 --> 00:35:57.525 position:35% line:89% align:start
[singing]

00:36:26.688 --> 00:36:30.257 position:10% line:83% align:start
[GORDON] I hoped to fill her
voice with boundless joy.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
I raised her to be
the greatest singer

00:36:32.894 --> 00:36:35.763 position:7% line:89% align:start
that the world had ever known.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.466 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is important!
Are you even listening?

00:36:39.499 --> 00:36:41.401 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO] I'm listening,
pops, keep talkin'.

00:36:41.435 --> 00:36:44.371 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BEPO gasps]

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.674 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BEPO]
Sorry.

00:36:46.708 --> 00:36:49.242 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO] Anywho, I guess
that explains why Miss Uta

00:36:49.276 --> 00:36:51.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
doesn't know about what
Mister Luffy's been up to-

00:36:51.612 --> 00:36:55.315 position:33% line:83% align:start
[BEPO gasps]
Jeez! Sorry!

00:36:56.984 --> 00:37:00.588 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GORDON] The greatest question
I faced was where and when

00:37:00.621 --> 00:37:03.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
to present her sublime
singing to the world.

00:37:03.658 --> 00:37:06.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
She remained secluded
here for years,

00:37:06.426 --> 00:37:09.429 position:21% line:83% align:start
so she was ignorant
of outside affairs.

00:37:09.463 --> 00:37:11.632 position:16% line:89% align:start
But then, the time came

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:15.268 position:16% line:83% align:start
in a way that I couldn't
have anticipated.

00:37:15.302 --> 00:37:17.038 position:19% line:89% align:start
It was two years ago.

00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:19.807 position:24% line:83% align:start
She stumbled upon
something by chance.

00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:22.275 position:30% line:83% align:start
A new kind of
video transponder snail

00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:23.911 position:10% line:89% align:start
had washed up on the beach.

00:37:23.945 --> 00:37:26.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uta started sending her
songs beyond the island.

00:37:26.914 --> 00:37:30.785 position:16% line:83% align:start
Suddenly, she was free,
soaring from its confines.

00:37:30.818 --> 00:37:34.655 position:10% line:83% align:start
Before long, she had amassed
a countless number of fans.

00:37:34.689 --> 00:37:37.725 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her voice reached
every corner of the globe,

00:37:37.759 --> 00:37:41.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
even as she stayed
in this silent, empty city.

00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:43.631 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FAN A]
Thanks, Uta! You're the best!

00:37:43.664 --> 00:37:44.866 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm all better now!

00:37:44.899 --> 00:37:47.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't know what
tomorrow will bring,

00:37:47.434 --> 00:37:49.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I can face it,
thanks to you.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.805 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's nothing.

00:37:50.838 --> 00:37:54.008 position:24% line:83% align:start
I am just so happy
you all like my singing!

00:37:56.677 --> 00:37:58.345 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
But the more people she reached,

00:37:58.378 --> 00:38:01.682 position:10% line:83% align:start
the more she learned about
the state of the outside world.

00:38:01.716 --> 00:38:03.985 position:16% line:83% align:start
Soon, she realized that
the Great Pirate Era

00:38:04.018 --> 00:38:06.453 position:19% line:83% align:start
was a time of unending
war and bloodshed

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:08.455 position:13% line:89% align:start
for many innocent people.

00:38:08.488 --> 00:38:11.692 position:10% line:83% align:start
At first, she only hoped to
uplift them with her music.

00:38:11.726 --> 00:38:15.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
But as time went on,
fans started to hail Uta

00:38:15.062 --> 00:38:19.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
as some sort of "savior
for the downtrodden."

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:21.569 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uta didn't deny them.

00:38:21.602 --> 00:38:24.471 position:27% line:83% align:start
I get it. I feel
the same way, too.

00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:28.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll create a new age,
and then, we will be free!

00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:31.712 position:19% line:83% align:start
Luffy. Stop Uta's plan
before it's too late!

00:38:31.746 --> 00:38:33.346 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were her friend,
weren't you?

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.682 position:19% line:89% align:start
Surely you can do it!

00:38:34.715 --> 00:38:37.518 position:10% line:83% align:start
I take it this plan of hers
involves the concert?

[screams]

00:38:47.061 --> 00:38:47.929 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:38:47.962 --> 00:38:48.963 position:35% line:89% align:start
Bear guy!

00:38:48.996 --> 00:38:49.964 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:38:53.835 --> 00:38:54.936 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uta.

00:38:54.969 --> 00:38:58.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UTA] Gordon. What are you
doing with these pirates?

00:38:58.906 --> 00:39:02.810 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uta. Tell me why you left
Shanks' crew back then.

00:39:03.544 --> 00:39:05.613 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
You said you were his musician.

00:39:05.646 --> 00:39:07.715 position:19% line:83% align:start
So why don't you want
to go back with them?

00:39:07.748 --> 00:39:09.016 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did something happen?

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.751 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's enough.

00:39:10.785 --> 00:39:12.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't want to talk about
Shanks ever again.

00:39:12.954 --> 00:39:14.989 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut up!

00:39:15.022 --> 00:39:16.456 position:30% line:89% align:start
[GORDON gasps]

[GORDON groans]

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.869 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UTA] You don't need this
stupid hat, or the One Piece,

00:39:27.902 --> 00:39:30.705 position:13% line:83% align:start
and you don't need to be
King of the Pirates either.

00:39:30.738 --> 00:39:32.940 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can give you
everything that matters.

00:39:32.974 --> 00:39:35.142 position:24% line:83% align:start
Stop fighting and
enjoy life with me.

00:39:35.176 --> 00:39:37.144 position:21% line:89% align:start
You stop! Lemme go!

00:39:37.178 --> 00:39:39.680 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UTA] We could arm wrestle
and eat all kinds of food.

00:39:39.714 --> 00:39:41.448 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like we did before, right?

00:39:41.481 --> 00:39:43.618 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just laughing and
living life in peace.

00:39:43.651 --> 00:39:47.088 position:21% line:83% align:start
Give that hat back!
Then we can talk!

00:39:48.522 --> 00:39:50.758 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fine, Luffy. I don't need you.

00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:52.960 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not in my new age.

00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:54.662 position:38% line:89% align:start
Too bad.

00:39:54.695 --> 00:39:56.697 position:41% line:83% align:start

Room! And Shambles!

Huh? Where'd they go?

00:40:00.768 --> 00:40:02.603 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thought we had them
cornered for sure.

00:40:02.637 --> 00:40:05.806 position:19% line:83% align:start
I see. Guess there's
all kinds of powers, huh?

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.108 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's no biggie!

00:40:07.141 --> 00:40:08.542 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's make it a game!

00:40:08.576 --> 00:40:11.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a hunt for runaway pirates!

00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:21.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Lemme go!
I gotta get that hat back!

00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:23.124 position:41% line:83% align:start

Shut up! You're in time out,

00:40:23.157 --> 00:40:25.092 position:16% line:83% align:start
'cause I don't want you
doing anything stupid!

00:40:25.126 --> 00:40:27.194 position:16% line:83% align:start
Fine, but we can't just
keep running away.

00:40:27.228 --> 00:40:29.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our objective now
is to get to the port.

00:40:29.263 --> 00:40:30.097 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Why?

00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:31.699 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LAW]
I noticed quite a few Marines

00:40:31.732 --> 00:40:33.935 position:16% line:83% align:start

in the audience.

[BARTOLOMEO]
What d'you think that means?

00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:37.470 position:7% line:83% align:start
[LAW] It means that the World
Government and the Navy

00:40:37.505 --> 00:40:39.774 position:21% line:83% align:start
have already noticed
Uta's power.

00:40:39.807 --> 00:40:41.943 position:7% line:83% align:start
More than that, they consider
her to be a threat.

00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:44.712 position:13% line:83% align:start
So they were watching her
and planning to make a move?

00:40:44.745 --> 00:40:47.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. The idea's to find
someone from the Navy

00:40:47.581 --> 00:40:49.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
and get them to talk,
so we can find out how-

[UTA]
Hey, Gordon. Are you mad?

00:41:36.764 --> 00:41:39.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because I did this concert
without asking you?

00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:42.103 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
It's not just a concert, is it?

00:41:42.136 --> 00:41:45.806 position:16% line:83% align:start

then you'll support me, right?

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.012 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
Not-  Not in the way you want.

00:41:51.045 --> 00:41:54.015 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UTA] Must be nice to have
that choice, to turn away.

[GORDON]
I only want the best for you,

00:41:55.816 --> 00:41:59.787 position:16% line:83% align:start

not this! Listen-

Just wait there for now.

Let them come. I have this.

00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:09.797 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Tot Musica.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.732 position:7% line:89% align:start
What are you doing with that?

00:42:11.766 --> 00:42:13.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UTA] I knew you hid it
beneath the castle.

00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:16.137 position:30% line:83% align:start
It was waiting
for me to find it.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.872 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why didn't you throw it away?

00:42:17.905 --> 00:42:19.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe all this time
you've hoped for

it's an imaginary world

Everyone affected is unaware

This is the power

there's nothing we can

Even if our intel is good,

01:07:03.423 --> 01:07:05.593 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's useless without
someone on the other side.

01:07:05.627 --> 01:07:06.828 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
There is someone.

01:07:06.861 --> 01:07:08.161 position:33% line:89% align:start
[COBY gasps]

01:07:09.229 --> 01:07:11.465 position:33% line:83% align:start
- [LAW] Huh?
- Captain!

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.536 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Bepo? What happened?

01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:16.571 position:10% line:89% align:start
Tiny Bepo and some old guy.

01:07:16.604 --> 01:07:19.406 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO] That's Gordon.
He's Miss Uta's adoptive father.

01:07:19.439 --> 01:07:21.208 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [USOPP gasps]
- And he's on our side?

01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:24.144 position:7% line:83% align:start
We're kind of in danger here.
Just tell us who it is.

01:07:24.177 --> 01:07:25.112 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
Shanks.

01:07:25.145 --> 01:07:25.813 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:27.247 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:29.216 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your idea seems sound enough.

01:07:29.249 --> 01:07:32.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
When Shanks arrives,
he'll stop Uta in reality.

01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:34.221 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tell me,
did something bad happen

01:07:34.254 --> 01:07:35.489 position:16% line:89% align:start
between Shanks and Uta?

01:07:35.523 --> 01:07:37.625 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid I...

01:07:39.259 --> 01:07:40.828 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just say it!

01:07:42.564 --> 01:07:43.263 position:30% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY groans]

01:07:43.297 --> 01:07:45.299 position:24% line:83% align:start
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]
Don't go!

01:07:45.332 --> 01:07:46.668 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're not ready to
beat Miss Uta yet.

01:07:46.701 --> 01:07:48.836 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mister Luffy's gonna
mess up the whole plan!

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:51.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's not a plan in the world
Luffy doesn't ruin.

01:07:51.706 --> 01:07:53.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll run out of time
standing around.

01:07:53.473 --> 01:07:55.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
Might as well join him
and finish this.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:56.878 position:13% line:89% align:start
But Shanks isn't here yet.

01:07:56.911 --> 01:07:59.346 position:19% line:83% align:start
We just need to attack
at the same time, right?

01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:01.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I'll start cutting
and won't let up.

01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:03.618 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then when the other side
attacks, it should time out.

01:08:03.651 --> 01:08:06.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we keep attacking,
we'll be just fine, won't we?

01:08:06.219 --> 01:08:08.856 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh man, you're right,
I shouldn't doubt Mister Luffy!

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:10.758 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Straw Hats can
make miracles happen,

01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:12.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
so there ain't
no reason to worry!

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:14.729 position:19% line:89% align:start
All we can do is try!

01:08:14.762 --> 01:08:17.532 position:27% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Mm-hmm!
Real quick, before we go.

01:08:17.565 --> 01:08:19.333 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did something happen to you?

01:08:19.366 --> 01:08:20.702 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.820 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
What are you doing here?

01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:41.789 position:10% line:83% align:start
How many times do I have to
beat you before you get a clue?

01:08:41.823 --> 01:08:43.725 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
I haven't admitted defeat.

01:08:43.758 --> 01:08:46.728 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aw, Luffy! You sore loser!

01:08:49.262 --> 01:08:51.599 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Fine, have it your way.

01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:53.735 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll give you one more,
for old time's sake.

01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:54.802 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ready?

[yells]

01:09:16.858 --> 01:09:19.259 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you gonna hit me or what?

01:09:23.865 --> 01:09:25.633 position:7% line:89% align:start
What you're doing isn't right!

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:28.368 position:10% line:89% align:start
I could say the same to you.

01:09:28.402 --> 01:09:29.904 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm stopping all the pirates.

01:09:29.937 --> 01:09:31.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
They've made people
suffer for long enough.

01:09:31.806 --> 01:09:33.641 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's over.

01:09:33.675 --> 01:09:34.709 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't even get it.

01:09:34.742 --> 01:09:36.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why do you wanna be
King of the Pirates so bad?

01:09:36.944 --> 01:09:40.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
To make a new era,
same as you.

01:09:40.447 --> 01:09:41.582 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
Luffy!

01:09:41.616 --> 01:09:42.817 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

01:09:47.655 --> 01:09:49.657 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UTA] Roger's execution
marked the beginning

01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:51.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the Great Pirate Era.

01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:53.326 position:35% line:89% align:start
And today,

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.930 position:24% line:83% align:start
your execution is
about to mark its end.

01:09:55.963 --> 01:09:58.231 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's Shanks' hat!

01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:01.401 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:10:02.036 --> 01:10:03.738 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
What happened?

01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:06.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
Last time I saw you,
you loved the Red-Hair Pirates!

01:10:06.974 --> 01:10:08.910 position:30% line:83% align:start
You were proud
to be one of them!

01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:12.312 position:16% line:83% align:start
You used to tell me that
Shanks was your hero!

01:10:12.345 --> 01:10:15.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
What changed to make you
hate pirates so much?

01:10:17.552 --> 01:10:19.252 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
It's Shanks' fault.

01:10:19.286 --> 01:10:20.320 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:10:20.353 --> 01:10:24.257 position:10% line:83% align:start
[UTA] I did look up to him.
Just like you said.

01:10:25.093 --> 01:10:27.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought of Shanks
as my real father!

01:10:27.494 --> 01:10:28.629 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:36.871 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
And it wasn't just him.

01:10:36.904 --> 01:10:39.574 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everyone on that ship
was like family to me.

01:10:39.607 --> 01:10:41.576 position:7% line:89% align:start
But that was all a nasty lie,

01:10:41.609 --> 01:10:44.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
that's just what they
wanted me to believe.

01:10:44.078 --> 01:10:47.749 position:7% line:83% align:start
As soon as he had the chance,
Shanks abandoned me.

01:10:47.782 --> 01:10:51.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
He left me on Elegia and didn't
even bother to say goodbye!

01:10:51.451 --> 01:10:54.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're wrong, he told me
he left so you could sing!

01:10:54.522 --> 01:10:55.823 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
Another lie!

01:10:55.857 --> 01:11:02.395 position:35% line:89% align:start
[applause]

01:11:03.731 --> 01:11:05.633 position:33% line:89% align:start
Magnificent!

01:11:05.666 --> 01:11:08.536 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your voice truly is
a gift to the world!

01:11:08.569 --> 01:11:10.838 position:19% line:83% align:start
And if you would like
to hone than talent,

01:11:10.872 --> 01:11:13.741 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's no shortage of
teachers and musicians here!

01:11:13.775 --> 01:11:16.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you would grace us
with your presence,

01:11:16.343 --> 01:11:20.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
then Elegia shall
welcome you with open arms!

01:11:20.948 --> 01:11:21.949 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS]
Well, what do you think?

01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:24.484 position:13% line:83% align:start
You seemed to really enjoy
singing back there.

01:11:24.519 --> 01:11:26.053 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
Mm. I guess.

01:11:26.087 --> 01:11:28.790 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS] You sure you wouldn't
rather sing for a big crowd,

01:11:28.823 --> 01:11:31.893 position:21% line:83% align:start
instead a bunch of
smelly old men on a boat?

01:11:31.926 --> 01:11:34.061 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
It's not like that.

01:11:34.095 --> 01:11:35.462 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll tell you something.

01:11:35.495 --> 01:11:36.564 position:16% line:89% align:start
Despite what people say,

01:11:36.597 --> 01:11:37.932 position:21% line:83% align:start
things like "peace"
and "justice"

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:39.466 position:13% line:89% align:start
don't exist in this world.

01:11:39.499 --> 01:11:40.300 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
Hm?

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:42.937 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS]
But your voice? That's real.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.572 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's something that
can bring happiness

01:11:44.605 --> 01:11:45.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
to everyone, everywhere.

01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:47.575 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

01:11:47.608 --> 01:11:50.377 position:33% line:83% align:start
If you want,
you can stay here.

01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:51.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll come pick you
up once you're

01:11:51.612 --> 01:11:52.780 position:27% line:83% align:start
the best singer
in the world, okay?

01:11:52.814 --> 01:11:56.483 position:10% line:83% align:start
Never! I'm the musician of
the Red-Hair Pirates, y'know!

01:11:56.517 --> 01:11:57.484 position:27% line:89% align:start
I like it here,

01:11:57.518 --> 01:11:59.687 position:13% line:83% align:start
but if I had to leave you,
there's no point!

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.721 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're my family!

01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:02.757 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry. It's fine.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.759 position:7% line:89% align:start
We'll ship out tomorrow, okay?

01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:06.627 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

01:12:07.929 --> 01:12:10.565 position:21% line:83% align:start

happened that night.

Gordon?

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:26.881 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why is everything on fire?

01:12:26.914 --> 01:12:28.716 position:13% line:89% align:start

01:12:28.749 --> 01:12:31.384 position:35% line:83% align:start

They've taken everything!

And the people of this country,
they're dead- killed!

Where is Shanks?

01:12:36.791 --> 01:12:38.860 position:13% line:89% align:start
They used you to trick us.

01:12:38.893 --> 01:12:40.928 position:27% line:83% align:start
Enchanted by the
sound of your voice,

we welcomed you only to
have our treasures stolen!

01:12:43.965 --> 01:12:45.132 position:41% line:83% align:start
[UTA]
They did this?

01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:48.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
They are pirates after all.

01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:54.108 position:24% line:83% align:start
They've been lying
your entire life, Uta.

01:12:54.141 --> 01:12:56.409 position:13% line:89% align:start
They don't care about you!

01:12:56.443 --> 01:12:58.713 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is what they do!

01:12:58.746 --> 01:13:00.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
They're criminals!

01:13:04.552 --> 01:13:08.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UTA] Come back, Shanks!
Don't leave me!

01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:45.626 position:10% line:89% align:start
Shanks wouldn't do that. No.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.128 position:27% line:83% align:start
Does that sound
like him to you?!

01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:49.897 position:10% line:83% align:start

I know you can hear me

Mister Luffy!

Uta! Listen to me!

01:23:25.507 --> 01:23:27.575 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
I just want to talk!

01:23:27.609 --> 01:23:31.311 position:10% line:83% align:start
[UTA] I have nothing to say
to a pirate! Die!

01:23:37.284 --> 01:23:38.586 position:30% line:83% align:start
- [LUFFY] No!
- [BEPO gasps]

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.187 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can't you see?

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.689 position:19% line:89% align:start
Luffy cares about you.

01:23:41.723 --> 01:23:44.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't sit here and
watch you hurt your friends.

01:23:44.726 --> 01:23:45.894 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's enough!

01:23:45.927 --> 01:23:48.395 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you really siding with
someone who looks up to Shanks?

01:23:48.428 --> 01:23:50.230 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
You've got the wrong idea.

01:23:50.264 --> 01:23:51.699 position:30% line:89% align:start
I lied to you.

01:23:51.733 --> 01:23:55.369 position:10% line:89% align:start
On that night, 12 years ago,

01:23:55.402 --> 01:24:00.207 position:7% line:83% align:start
it wasn't the Red-Hair Pirates
who destroyed Elegia.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.677 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was Tot Musica!

01:24:03.711 --> 01:24:05.580 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry.

01:24:05.613 --> 01:24:09.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's my fault for
hiding this from you.

01:24:09.316 --> 01:24:11.586 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you remember
the party that night,

01:24:11.619 --> 01:24:13.453 position:10% line:89% align:start
but not what happened next.

01:24:13.487 --> 01:24:14.722 position:7% line:89% align:start
When the musicians of the city

01:24:14.756 --> 01:24:17.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
learned that you were
leaving with Shanks,

01:24:17.124 --> 01:24:19.259 position:13% line:83% align:start
they realized it was their
last chance to hear you,

01:24:19.293 --> 01:24:21.428 position:10% line:89% align:start
and had you sing for hours.

01:24:21.461 --> 01:24:22.530 position:16% line:89% align:start
Before you could leave,

01:24:22.564 --> 01:24:25.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
they wanted the entire kingdom
to hear your voice.

01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
They arranged it so that
your performance

01:24:27.501 --> 01:24:29.369 position:5% line:89% align:start
would play throughout the land.

01:24:29.403 --> 01:24:32.406 position:10% line:89% align:start
That was a terrible mistake.

01:24:33.073 --> 01:24:36.376 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GORDON] Your singing beckoned
to a forbidden score.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:40.447 position:7% line:83% align:start
A cursed weapon that had been
sealed deep beneath the castle!

01:24:44.451 --> 01:24:48.690 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
That score was Tot Musica.

01:24:48.723 --> 01:24:51.224 position:27% line:83% align:start
Like dark magic,
it found its way

01:24:51.258 --> 01:24:53.828 position:7% line:89% align:start
to your side, and tempted you.

01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:55.830 position:16% line:89% align:start
It longed to be set free

01:24:55.863 --> 01:24:58.733 position:27% line:83% align:start
by the power of
the Sing-Sing Fruit.

[ALL gasp]

01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:06.841 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GORDON] With the seal broken,
the Demon King was unleashed.

01:25:06.874 --> 01:25:09.276 position:13% line:89% align:start
Absorbing you into itself,

01:25:09.309 --> 01:25:12.880 position:7% line:83% align:start
it took revenge on the country
that had locked it away.

01:25:16.818 --> 01:25:18.653 position:21% line:89% align:start
Snap out of it, Uta!

01:25:18.686 --> 01:25:21.421 position:30% line:83% align:start
You can't let
the demon take you!

01:25:35.737 --> 01:25:39.239 position:7% line:83% align:start

were still a child at the time.

01:25:39.272 --> 01:25:41.809 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your stamina gave out
and you fell asleep.

01:25:41.843 --> 01:25:45.479 position:7% line:89% align:start
But the country was destroyed.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.348 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
Huh?

01:25:52.887 --> 01:25:55.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
[GORDON] I'm sure the Navy will
want to make an arrest.

01:25:55.657 --> 01:25:58.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS] Would you mind
keeping this a secret from Uta?

01:25:58.626 --> 01:26:00.795 position:24% line:83% align:start
It'd be too cruel
to tell her the truth.

01:26:00.828 --> 01:26:01.963 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
Of course.

01:26:01.996 --> 01:26:04.899 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll tell the Navy that I was
responsible for this.

01:26:04.932 --> 01:26:06.801 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS]
Nah. It should be us.

01:26:06.834 --> 01:26:07.802 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GORDON]
Huh?

01:26:07.835 --> 01:26:10.237 position:19% line:83% align:start
"The Red-Hair Pirates
laid waste to the city.

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:12.840 position:16% line:83% align:start
They tricked its people
and stole its treasure."

01:26:12.874 --> 01:26:15.810 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tell that to Uta, as well.

01:26:15.843 --> 01:26:18.378 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't understand.
Are you leaving her?

01:26:18.412 --> 01:26:20.480 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS] The girl's got
a hell of a voice.

01:26:20.515 --> 01:26:23.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
We can't keep a superstar
like her cooped up on a boat

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:26.219 position:19% line:83% align:start
while we're on the run
from the Navy.

01:26:26.253 --> 01:26:28.355 position:33% line:83% align:start
I leave her
in your capable hands.

01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:30.692 position:13% line:83% align:start
Make her into the greatest
singer in the world.

01:26:30.725 --> 01:26:33.795 position:13% line:83% align:start
Her singing's not a crime
that needs to be punished.

01:26:33.828 --> 01:26:35.763 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes. Of course.

01:26:36.764 --> 01:26:38.766 position:30% line:89% align:start
I understand!

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.836 position:5% line:83% align:start

the devotion to music

that everyone in
this kingdom felt!

I will pour my heart
