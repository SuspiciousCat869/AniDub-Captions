00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:52.620 position:21% line:89% align:start
It causes problems.

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:55.388 position:16% line:83% align:start
Dance Powder is used to
artificially form clouds

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:57.625 position:16% line:83% align:start
that quickly absorb all
the moisture in the air,

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.794 position:13% line:89% align:start
and rain whenever needed.

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:02.930 position:13% line:83% align:start
The problem exists because
this process, in effect,

00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:05.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
"steals" the rain
from nearby areas,

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:08.435 position:13% line:83% align:start
which has resulted in many
quarrels between nations.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.670 position:27% line:83% align:start
Makes sense that
the World Governement

00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:10.805 position:16% line:89% align:start
would have it outlawed.

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:13.708 position:7% line:83% align:start
[VIVI] Two years ago, enormous
amounts of Dance Powder

00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:16.878 position:10% line:83% align:start
were carried into Alabasta's
port town of Nanohana.

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:18.179 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was during this same time

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.781 position:16% line:83% align:start
that an unusual weather
pattern moved in.

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.450 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rain fell nowhere in
the kingdom but Alubarna,

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:24.484 position:19% line:89% align:start
where the king lives.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:26.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
Naturally the supicion
would fall on the king.

00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:28.789 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone would think he
used the Dance Powder

00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:30.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
to hog all the rain for himself.

00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:33.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait! Vivi, this would mean
that your dad's a bad guy!

00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
What?! You moron!
He was framed!

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.865 position:13% line:83% align:start
Vivi's father would never
do anything like that.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.800 position:13% line:89% align:start
Never... ever... never...

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:41.002 position:41% line:83% align:start
[VIVI]
Sanji's right.

00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:45.640 position:10% line:83% align:start
My father is a good man and
he's innocent of this crime.

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:47.108 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the citizens
swore up and down

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:49.442 position:13% line:83% align:start
that they saw him greeting
ships at the port.

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.878 position:27% line:83% align:start
They all saw who
knows how many tons

00:06:50.912 --> 00:06:53.446 position:19% line:83% align:start
of Dance Powder hauled
into the palace.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's as clear as
the sky overhead.

00:06:55.182 --> 00:06:56.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] I got it!
The guy with the lipstick

00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:58.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
must've transformed
into the king.

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:01.122 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't believe we let such
a bad guy get away from us.

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:03.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
[VIVI] This has all been a
trap laid out by Crocodile,

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:05.726 position:10% line:89% align:start
the organization's big boss.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the rebellion hit
just like he planned.

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:09.997 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:11.232 position:10% line:89% align:start
This joker's plan is to make

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
the royal army clash
with the rebels

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:16.037 position:10% line:83% align:start
and then take control after
both sides have weakened.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.673 position:16% line:83% align:start
And he's using the guise
of the kingdom's hero.

00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:20.508 position:5% line:89% align:start
Crocodile's stolen everything--

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
the royal family's
reputation, the rain,

and even people's very lives.

Maybe it's a ploy by the rebels.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
[COBRA] Gather all of
our forces at once!

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.145 position:7% line:89% align:start
Chaka, assemble the officers.

00:17:58.178 --> 00:17:59.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be holding a war
meeting shortly.

00:17:59.914 --> 00:18:01.481 position:10% line:89% align:start
Pell, I want you to fly off

00:18:01.516 --> 00:18:03.283 position:27% line:83% align:start
and monitor the
enemy's movement.

00:18:03.317 --> 00:18:06.219 position:10% line:83% align:start
The time has come for all of
us to engage the rebel army.

00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:08.556 position:7% line:89% align:start
It'll be a fight to the death.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.324 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, move it!

00:18:12.492 --> 00:18:14.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
[BON CLAY] And now that everyone
is nice and confused,

00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:17.832 position:13% line:83% align:start
this part of the operation

[LUFFY]
This sucker's fast!

00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:25.573 position:21% line:83% align:start
Eyelash says he was
born in these parts,

00:18:25.607 --> 00:18:27.875 position:13% line:83% align:start
so he has tons of friends
that can help us out.

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:30.177 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, thanks, Eyelash.

Luffy?

00:18:33.347 --> 00:18:34.515 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks for this.

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:35.449 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't think it's a decision

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:38.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I ever could've
made all by myself.

[LUFFY]
You wanna thank me?

How 'bout you line
up a nice buffet

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:45.258 position:24% line:83% align:start
for me to gorge on

Take that, Crocodile!

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:23.698 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now, that's not nice.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.404 position:7% line:89% align:start
Vivi, what are you doing here?

00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:31.572 position:27% line:89% align:start

Seis Fleurs.

00:19:48.756 --> 00:19:50.357 position:33% line:89% align:start
And clutch.

Pell!

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
Turns out not even
the greatest warrior

00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:56.798 position:30% line:83% align:start
in the kingdom
is anything special.

00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:59.332 position:19% line:89% align:start
So who's that? Anyone?

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE]
This is all so pointless.

00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:03.738 position:13% line:83% align:start
Considering that the party
has already begun.

00:20:03.771 --> 00:20:06.373 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't you agree with me,
Miss All Sunday?

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:07.842 position:38% line:89% align:start
I would.

Oh, no.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.479 position:33% line:89% align:start

that I sent into Nanohana,

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
the rebel army has launched
an all-out attack.

00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:26.293 position:7% line:83% align:start
And the royal army intends to
fight back with furious resolve.

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:28.796 position:13% line:89% align:start
We will protect Alabasta!

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.032 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE] It's hearbreaking,
but almost poetic.

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:34.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
The love for the kingdom will be
what destroys the kingdom.

in Alubarna before the rebels,

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:44.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
I might be able to stop
this war before it begins.

He's evil.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.016 position:13% line:83% align:start
He embodies the word fiend
like no one else I've ever met.

00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:35.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
without some serious

Trust us, Vivi.

this whole kingdom is done for.

00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:59.452 position:5% line:83% align:start

is of helping these people,

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.488 position:10% line:89% align:start

doesn't require a headstone.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.089 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'll be dragged down into
an underground water vein.

[SOLDIER S] What's with
this sand cyclone?!

Do not break formation!

[VIVI]
I will not give up.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.379 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll stop the bomb.

00:50:45.412 --> 00:50:48.683 position:10% line:83% align:start
And at the very least, I can
reduce the number of casualties.

00:50:48.716 --> 00:50:50.484 position:27% line:83% align:start
This'll stop it.
That'll stop it.

This'll save lives.
That'll save lives.

Your ideals are pathetic.
Just like the rest of you.

I don't care what
you think about me.

I won't abandon my ideals.

00:51:00.127 --> 00:51:02.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE] You're such
an undesireable woman.

00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:04.699 position:27% line:83% align:start
And in the end,
you couldn't stop anything.

00:51:04.732 --> 00:51:06.668 position:24% line:83% align:start
You only made more
victims out of those

00:51:06.701 --> 00:51:08.502 position:13% line:89% align:start
who followed your ideals.

What a fool.

00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:12.807 position:5% line:89% align:start
You'll never save this kingdom.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.242 position:27% line:89% align:start

Just in time!

00:51:42.637 --> 00:51:45.673 position:41% line:83% align:start
[VIVI]
Luffy. Pell.

00:51:45.707 --> 00:51:48.610 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's like my voice doesn't
reach anyone anymore.

00:51:48.643 --> 00:51:50.712 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Don't worry.

00:51:50.745 --> 00:51:55.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
We hear your voice,

[ZORO]
Huh?

00:51:58.318 --> 00:52:00.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
Luffy and Vivi are
alive! All right!

00:52:00.287 --> 00:52:03.290 position:13% line:83% align:start
See! I knew it all along!
They had to be alive somewhere!

00:52:03.323 --> 00:52:05.627 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, you certainly weren't
acting like you knew!

Hang on, Vivi, my sweet!

Let's move it, Zoro!

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:12.600 position:5% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] I'm clearly more wounded
than you are, you know!

00:52:12.634 --> 00:52:15.168 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can't walk!

00:52:15.202 --> 00:52:16.738 position:41% line:83% align:start

Liar...

00:52:16.771 --> 00:52:18.840 position:38% line:83% align:start

You can read Poneglyphs?

00:52:18.873 --> 00:52:20.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Yes.

00:52:20.074 --> 00:52:22.910 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why Crocodile and I
teamed up in the first place.

00:52:22.944 --> 00:52:26.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's also why he can't
kill me. I'm necessary.

00:52:26.748 --> 00:52:27.815 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:30.484 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
So Pluton is real.

00:52:33.453 --> 00:52:34.922 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Are there any more of these?

00:52:34.956 --> 00:52:37.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
Or is this the only one
hidden in the kingdom?

00:52:37.892 --> 00:52:41.194 position:33% line:83% align:start
Displeased?
Because I've kept my side--

00:52:42.697 --> 00:52:45.933 position:24% line:83% align:start

What I seek isn't here either!

00:52:45.967 --> 00:52:48.836 position:33% line:83% align:start

Is that it, Robin?

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:50.337 position:24% line:83% align:start

That was quick.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:51.906 position:33% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE]
Have you deciphered it?

00:52:51.939 --> 00:52:52.707 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Yes.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.842 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then tell me where
the Pluton is.

00:52:54.876 --> 00:52:56.644 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
That's not written here.

00:52:56.678 --> 00:52:57.612 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's not?

00:52:57.645 --> 00:53:00.715 position:16% line:83% align:start
On this, the only thing
written is history.

00:53:00.748 --> 00:53:04.251 position:10% line:83% align:start
The word Pluton doesn't even
appear on here one time.

00:53:04.284 --> 00:53:06.621 position:33% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE]
I see. That's too bad.

00:53:06.654 --> 00:53:08.856 position:30% line:83% align:start
You've been an
excellent partner...

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:12.560 position:19% line:83% align:start
...but I believe it's
time to kill you now.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] I'm gonna put
an end to all this.

00:53:15.797 --> 00:53:17.732 position:41% line:83% align:start

Right.

Vivi!

00:53:24.605 --> 00:53:26.674 position:13% line:89% align:start
Looks like we all made it!

Hey, kid. You all right?

00:53:37.618 --> 00:53:40.454 position:21% line:83% align:start
[PELL] Down there is
the mortuary temple.

00:53:40.487 --> 00:53:43.356 position:7% line:89% align:start
All right! I'm coming for you!

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.292 position:35% line:89% align:start
Crocodile!

00:53:54.001 --> 00:53:56.504 position:10% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] We got five minutes
to find the cannoneer?

00:53:56.537 --> 00:53:59.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
All this sand. Crocodile may
have created this as a shield.

00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:02.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then that means the bomb
should be somewhere nearby

00:54:02.043 --> 00:54:05.378 position:16% line:83% align:start
if this square is indeed
the intended target.

00:54:05.412 --> 00:54:08.281 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh. I bet he's
somewhere up high.

00:54:08.315 --> 00:54:09.282 position:27% line:89% align:start
How do you know?

00:54:09.316 --> 00:54:10.818 position:19% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Because no one
leaves bombs like that

00:54:10.852 --> 00:54:11.919 position:24% line:89% align:start
just lying around.

00:54:11.953 --> 00:54:13.420 position:5% line:89% align:start
Plus, to nail this kinda target,

00:54:13.453 --> 00:54:16.389 position:13% line:83% align:start
you wouldn't launch it or
plant it, you'd drop it.

00:54:16.423 --> 00:54:18.059 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're amazing, Usopp!

00:54:18.092 --> 00:54:20.061 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just call it a highly
educated guess.

00:54:20.094 --> 00:54:21.195 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Well, now that we know that.

00:54:21.229 --> 00:54:22.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
--[ZORO] Let's hurry!
--[CHOPPER, NAMI] Yeah! Right!

00:54:22.096 --> 00:54:24.397 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Actually, it's less of a guess

00:54:24.431 --> 00:54:28.435 position:10% line:83% align:start
and more like the talent of
a natural born genius. Heh.

00:54:29.469 --> 00:54:31.404 position:33% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE]
Water, huh?

00:54:31.438 --> 00:54:35.810 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which is useless if
it doesn't touch me.

00:54:35.843 --> 00:54:40.480 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, I do forgive you for
everything, Nico Robin.

00:54:40.515 --> 00:54:42.917 position:19% line:89% align:start
And you should know...

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.920 position:21% line:83% align:start
...I haven't trusted
anyone from the start.

00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:50.323 position:7% line:83% align:start
Cobra's reaction proved to me
that Pluton actually exists.

00:54:50.357 --> 00:54:51.726 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll find it on my own.

00:54:51.759 --> 00:54:53.628 position:24% line:83% align:start
Once this kingdom
is under my rule,

00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:55.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
it will only be a
matter of time.

00:54:55.897 --> 00:54:57.832 position:35% line:89% align:start
[rumbling]

00:55:03.805 --> 00:55:07.041 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's too early for the bomb
to be going off. Did you...?

00:55:07.074 --> 00:55:10.377 position:10% line:83% align:start
When this temple was built,
it was designed to collapse

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.647 position:13% line:83% align:start
with the pull of a single
block of stone.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.883 position:10% line:83% align:start
As the 12th generation king
of the Nefeltari family,

00:55:15.917 --> 00:55:19.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would never let someone
like you have this.

00:55:19.153 --> 00:55:22.023 position:16% line:83% align:start
So now you're trying to
bury me alive with you?

00:55:22.056 --> 00:55:27.128 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're a model king, Cobra.
But you cannot kill me.

00:55:27.161 --> 00:55:30.397 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can change this whole place
into sand and escape.

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:31.498 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CROCODILE laughs]

00:55:31.532 --> 00:55:32.900 position:33% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE]
I hope dying for nothing

00:55:32.934 --> 00:55:35.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
will be worth it for you!

00:55:43.544 --> 00:55:44.946 position:21% line:89% align:start
I've got you, Croc.

00:55:44.979 --> 00:55:47.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
How did...? How did you
escape from that quicksand?

00:55:48.015 --> 00:55:49.917 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why are you alive?

00:55:49.951 --> 00:55:53.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
And what makes you think
you can stand up to me now?

00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:55.990 position:19% line:89% align:start
Answer me, Straw Hat!

00:55:59.193 --> 00:56:02.697 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because you still
haven't given back...

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.665 position:30% line:83% align:start
...what you've
stolen from them!

00:56:04.699 --> 00:56:08.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
What I've stolen?
Money? Reputation?

00:56:09.003 --> 00:56:12.940 position:24% line:89% align:start
Trust? Life? Rain?

00:56:12.974 --> 00:56:14.609 position:33% line:89% align:start
The kingdom!

00:56:25.019 --> 00:56:25.987 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:31.959 position:30% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY yells]

00:56:36.163 --> 00:56:37.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
But how? How did you...?

00:56:37.965 --> 00:56:39.867 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] When you stabbed
me in the desert,

00:56:39.901 --> 00:56:44.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
the Yuba water that touched your
arm showed me something neat.

00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:47.041 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't transform into
sand if you touch water,

00:56:47.074 --> 00:56:48.676 position:10% line:89% align:start
so blood should do the same.

00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:49.610 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CROCODILE laughs]

00:56:49.644 --> 00:56:52.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
Very well. You've resolved
to challenge me.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.750 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I'll reward you,
since you've seen hell before.

00:56:55.783 --> 00:56:58.152 position:33% line:89% align:start
As a pirate.

00:56:58.185 --> 00:56:59.452 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:56:59.486 --> 00:57:01.622 position:33% line:83% align:start
[CROCODILE]
A poison stinger.

00:57:01.656 --> 00:57:02.790 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:57:02.823 --> 00:57:05.626 position:13% line:83% align:start
A duel between pirates can
truly never be anything more

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.595 position:10% line:89% align:start
than a battle for survival.

00:57:07.628 --> 00:57:10.564 position:24% line:83% align:start

[TERRACOTTA] You were
supposed to entertain

01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:11.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
this "Life Purpose Ceremony"
at the young age of 14.

01:21:11.405 --> 01:21:14.274 position:13% line:89% align:start
The kingdom is so excited.

I'm coming in, Vivi.

[VIVI]
Sit down, Papa.

01:21:24.184 --> 01:21:27.254 position:27% line:89% align:start
I mean, Father.

01:21:27.287 --> 01:21:29.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have something
important to tell you.

Look! It's Princess Vivi!

[MAn F]
Vivi!

01:21:48.475 --> 01:21:50.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
We've waited for you!

01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:51.713 position:30% line:89% align:start
Princess Vivi!

01:21:51.746 --> 01:21:54.348 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAN G]
Finally you're all grown up!

01:22:03.323 --> 01:22:06.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
[VIVI] I have had a
taste of adventure!

01:22:06.493 --> 01:22:09.363 position:10% line:83% align:start
[COBRA] I hope this doesn't
turn the citizens unruly.

01:22:09.396 --> 01:22:11.265 position:16% line:89% align:start
Koza! It's begun! Hurry!

01:22:11.298 --> 01:22:13.535 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's loud enough that the
whole kingdom can hear it.

01:22:13.568 --> 01:22:15.102 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm fine.

01:22:15.135 --> 01:22:18.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
[VIVI] It was a journey of
despair across dark seas.

01:22:19.006 --> 01:22:21.275 position:13% line:89% align:start
One very sinister journey.

01:22:21.308 --> 01:22:26.079 position:7% line:83% align:start
During a storm, I encountered
a single, small ship.

01:22:26.113 --> 01:22:30.284 position:24% line:83% align:start
The ship pushed me
forward and said this:

01:22:30.317 --> 01:22:35.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
Up ahead. Can you see
the light before you?

01:22:35.523 --> 01:22:39.193 position:10% line:83% align:start
That ship, which never lost
its way in the darkness,

01:22:39.226 --> 01:22:43.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
passed over enormous
waves as if dancing.

01:22:43.698 --> 01:22:48.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
It never defied the sea, yet the
bow sailed straight and true,

01:22:48.035 --> 01:22:50.003 position:16% line:89% align:start
always pointing forward.

01:22:50.037 --> 01:22:52.740 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Look! Ahead there is a light!"

01:22:53.741 --> 01:22:59.246 position:10% line:83% align:start
History will see this and it
will be called an illusion.

01:22:59.279 --> 01:23:02.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
But for me, it can
only be truth.

01:23:08.756 --> 01:23:10.491 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
You hear that speech?

01:23:10.525 --> 01:23:12.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's definitely Vivi's voice.

01:23:12.392 --> 01:23:13.160 position:41% line:89% align:start
Vivi.

01:23:13.193 --> 01:23:15.128 position:27% line:83% align:start
It only sounded
like Vivi's voice.

01:23:15.162 --> 01:23:16.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's speaking at her ceremony,

01:23:16.831 --> 01:23:18.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
which means she's
not coming with us.

01:23:18.766 --> 01:23:20.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on. It's past noon already.

01:23:20.535 --> 01:23:23.337 position:13% line:83% align:start
She wants to come with us!
Let's go find her.

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:24.606 position:16% line:89% align:start
She woudn't stay behind!

[USOPP]
Not good!

01:23:26.073 --> 01:23:28.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Marine fleet is
pulling into the bay!

01:23:28.275 --> 01:23:30.444 position:16% line:89% align:start
You kidding?! Let's go!

01:23:30.477 --> 01:23:34.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
Time to let it go,
Luffy. She's a princess.

01:23:34.849 --> 01:23:36.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
What in the world
is going on here?!

01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:39.654 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MAN G] Show your face,
you fake princess!

01:23:39.687 --> 01:23:42.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MAN H] We wanna know
where the real Vivi is!

Right now, Vivi is, uh...

Hey, guys!

01:23:58.506 --> 01:23:59.674 position:33% line:89% align:start

--Vivi!
--I'll turn the ship around!

01:24:02.476 --> 01:24:06.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Vivi. I knew
you'd come. I knew it.

01:24:07.347 --> 01:24:09.283 position:41% line:83% align:start
[VIVI]
I came...

01:24:09.316 --> 01:24:12.119 position:7% line:89% align:start
...to wish you a good journey!

01:24:12.152 --> 01:24:15.289 position:13% line:89% align:start
No. Hold on, d'she say--?

01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:20.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
[VIVI] I'm sorry,
but I cannot go with you.

01:24:20.595 --> 01:24:23.230 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAN I]
Who's she talking to?

01:24:23.263 --> 01:24:24.498 position:41% line:83% align:start

Thank you all so much

01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:28.268 position:30% line:83% align:start
for everything
you've done for me!

01:24:28.302 --> 01:24:30.605 position:13% line:89% align:start
I would love nothing more

01:24:30.638 --> 01:24:33.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
than to go on more
adventures with all of you.

01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:36.243 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I love this
kingdom too much!

[PEOPLE cheering]

01:24:44.852 --> 01:24:48.121 position:21% line:83% align:start
[VIVI] So that's why
I can't go with you.

01:24:52.492 --> 01:24:54.394 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

01:24:54.428 --> 01:24:56.096 position:38% line:89% align:start
And I...

01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:03.437 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've decided to spend
the rest of my life here.

01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:08.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
But if we ever...
meet up again...

01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:12.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
...I hope you will still
call me your friend.

01:25:21.321 --> 01:25:22.422 position:13% line:89% align:start
You'll always be our fr--!

[NAMI]
You!

01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:26.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shut up! The Marines
are too close to us!

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:28.863 position:10% line:83% align:start
If they find any proof that
Vivi's in cahoots with us,

01:25:28.896 --> 01:25:31.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
she'll be considered a criminal.

01:25:31.331 --> 01:25:34.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
And so, let's part
ways through silence.

[VIVI]
Yes.

01:29:22.897 --> 01:29:26.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Something to remind me
of some very dear friends.

more. So much more.

01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:47.989 position:13% line:89% align:start
After all, we're friends.

01:29:48.022 --> 01:29:49.957 position:27% line:89% align:start
