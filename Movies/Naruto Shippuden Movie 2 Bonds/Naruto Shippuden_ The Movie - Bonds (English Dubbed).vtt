00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.428 position:19% line:83% align:start
SAILOR: Steer to port!

00:03:33.448 --> 00:03:35.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
-All pilots, prepare for launch.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.418 position:27% line:83% align:start

-Sound the alarm.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.940 position:24% line:83% align:start
Level three alert!

00:07:18.973 --> 00:07:19.439 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

00:07:25.914 --> 00:07:29.449 position:35% line:83% align:start
[grunting]

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:39.426 position:27% line:83% align:start
-What the heck?

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.395 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are they using Wind
Style or something?

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:48.969 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's chakra.

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:51.204 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're circulating
chakra into the wings,

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:53.507 position:13% line:83% align:start
creating air pressure and
enough lift to make them fly.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.615 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Sky ninja?

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:02.616 position:21% line:83% align:start
Never heard of 'em.

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:12.859 position:5% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: To be able to launch an
air attack with such strength.

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:15.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Who in the world
could they be, milady?

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:19.466 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Well, during the Second Great
Ninja War, a group of ninja

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:23.236 position:5% line:83% align:start
excelled at jutsu that let them
fly by manipulating chakra.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
They called themselves
the Land of Sky.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.041 position:27% line:83% align:start
They opposed the
Five Great Nations,

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:30.077 position:10% line:83% align:start
so the Leaf destroyed them.

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:37.017 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You're saying this attack is
somehow related to those ninja?

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.252 position:35% line:83% align:start
[groaning]

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: Then their target
would be the Leaf Village.

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:44.156 position:19% line:83% align:start
And by extension, they
may seek their revenge

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.126 position:10% line:83% align:start
on the entire Land of Fire.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.096 position:35% line:83% align:start
[yelling]

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.951 position:41% line:83% align:start
[yell]

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:24.330 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:31.672 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:33.640 position:7% line:83% align:start
What in the world's going on?

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:35.842 position:33% line:83% align:start
-You there!

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.811 position:27% line:83% align:start
Give me a hand!

00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:39.278 position:35% line:83% align:start
[grunting]

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Don't worry, old man.

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:46.252 position:35% line:83% align:start
I got ya.

00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:52.559 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunt]

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.461 position:35% line:83% align:start
[groaning]

00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:58.364 position:13% line:83% align:start
He needs a doctor, quick.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
-One of his lungs is punctured.

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:01.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
-He won't make it to the
hospital in this state.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.274 position:13% line:83% align:start
-No way-- you're a doctor?

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:09.710 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Not good.

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:12.612 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's traumatic pneumothorax.

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:15.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
Air's building up inside
his chest, suffocating him.

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:18.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What's that for?

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.620 position:44% line:83% align:start
Eh!

00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:22.923 position:30% line:83% align:start
[air hissing]

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.490 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sigh]

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:25.792 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Good.

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:28.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now you can take this
man to the hospital.

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.562 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Me take him?

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:32.799 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I gotta go after the
guys who trashed the village.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:34.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Don't waste your time.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.970 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'd be like a stray cat
trying to jump high enough

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
to swat down a crow.

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:41.640 position:30% line:83% align:start
-A stray cat?

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:42.709 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yup.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:45.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
And when that cat
falls, he falls hard.

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:49.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right now, just focus on saving
lives, even if it's only one.

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:53.820 position:16% line:83% align:start
There will be plenty of
time for fighting, trust me.

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:56.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
And try not to bend his chest
when you carry him, Naruto.

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:57.858 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:01.494 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, old man!

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:02.561 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's weird.

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.396 position:16% line:83% align:start
How did he know my name?

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:23.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
-The assault force has
started to pull back.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:25.085 position:19% line:83% align:start
Neji, can you see why?

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:27.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Yes, they've run out of chakra.

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.521 position:21% line:83% align:start
They need to recoup.

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:29.890 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Interesting.

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:32.458 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which means if we calculate
the amount of chakra they used

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.061 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the attack versus what
they have left in the tank,

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:36.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
we should be able to
determine the distance

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:39.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
that they're flying to get home.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
-So it would seem.

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:47.840 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
Good, you're safe.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:58.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Yes, but I wish I'd been
the only one they'd hurt.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
They've overrun
the entire village,

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.855 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they didn't
finish us off, which

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:06.193 position:13% line:83% align:start
means they must have some
greater objective in mind.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.161 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Shinobi from the Land of Sky.

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.365 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Doctor, we found another.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: Put her here.

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.006 position:33% line:83% align:start
Incredible.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.041 position:30% line:83% align:start
-She's stable.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.642 position:21% line:83% align:start
She'll pull through.

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:26.579 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Another?

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.514 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just like the patient
Naruto brought in.

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:30.217 position:5% line:83% align:start
This girl was treated perfectly.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.984 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who could do this?

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:34.653 position:24% line:83% align:start
And in the middle
of a battlefield.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.922 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Hmm, this old man was-- aah!

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:39.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It was Master Shinno.

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.493 position:21% line:83% align:start
This girl-- and him!

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:44.331 position:19% line:83% align:start
They were all treated
by Dr. Shinno!

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:46.632 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Dr. Shinno?

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:49.535 position:10% line:83% align:start
-That name sounds familiar.

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:52.205 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Hey, are you friends with
that old guy or something?

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.006 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You said you saw him, right?

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:54.707 position:41% line:83% align:start
Where?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.742 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where's the doctor now?

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:58.211 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Whoa, chill out.

00:12:58.245 --> 00:12:59.144 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's my village.

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:01.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're in trouble
and need help.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.847 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please hurry, I--

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:04.516 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey, easy.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
Who is this kid?

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.323 position:21% line:83% align:start
SHINNO: You've been
a great help, Naruto.

00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:12.791 position:7% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: When I found out he's
your apprentice, old man, I,

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.327 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just couldn't leave him.

00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:15.394 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Apprentice?

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.929 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, right?

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:18.597 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's your-- I mean, this kid--

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.665 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Amaru.

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:20.766 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:22.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're the great doctor
Amaru talked about.

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:24.337 position:27% line:83% align:start
-That's kind of
you to say, Naruto,

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:27.506 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I don't think I deserve
such a noble title as doctor.

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:29.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Ah, don't be modest.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:31.710 position:10% line:83% align:start
Without you, there would've
been a lot more wounded people

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:32.945 position:10% line:83% align:start
that wouldn't have survived.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:35.781 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's what Sakura and
the others are saying.

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:38.117 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.154 position:7% line:83% align:start
Amaru's village is way on the
outskirts of the Land of Fire.

00:13:42.187 --> 00:13:44.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even so, last night
it was attacked

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:46.692 position:10% line:83% align:start
by a group of unknown ninja.

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:49.762 position:13% line:83% align:start
Many people were injured.

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:53.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
Amaru came here to seek my help.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:55.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
-No one knows who was
behind the attack?

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:55.901 position:38% line:83% align:start
[groan]

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.236 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.804 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, little boy, you awake?

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:00.139 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Aah!

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:03.409 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scream]

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:11.150 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Hey kid, are you sure you're
in good enough shape to leave?

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.551 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmph.

00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:15.321 position:7% line:83% align:start
Dr. Shinno has agreed to come
lend us a hand in my village.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.556 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't waste time sleeping.

00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:19.058 position:35% line:83% align:start
-I got it.

00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:20.426 position:24% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: Then it's
a good thing we

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:23.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
formed an emergency
three-man medical squad.

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:24.997 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.531 position:35% line:83% align:start
S-Sakura?

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:27.700 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hinata!

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:28.400 position:41% line:83% align:start
What?

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:29.902 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wait, a three-man squad?

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.603 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Yes, that's right.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:34.106 position:19% line:83% align:start
Including you, Naruto,
it's three people.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.506 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Eh?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
-If you accompanied us,
it would be a great help.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.245 position:16% line:83% align:start
-W-wait, I never said--

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:40.813 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Here.

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:42.014 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:43.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: A protective
charm from Master Jiraiya.

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.789 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Good.

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then it's decided.

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:53.993 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto?

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:56.428 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Eh?

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:57.696 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let's do our best.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.931 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Aah!

00:14:58.964 --> 00:14:59.898 position:44% line:83% align:start
I--

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:00.866 position:21% line:83% align:start
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Why can't I be

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.201 position:5% line:83% align:start
part of the counterattack force?

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.008 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Let him through,
let him through.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:09.975 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Nice one, nice one.

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:11.176 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Keep it going, keep it going.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.011 position:13% line:83% align:start
SOLDIER 1: Get out of the
way, get out of the way.

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:13.212 position:7% line:83% align:start
We got more incoming, come on.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.579 position:19% line:83% align:start
SOLDIER 2: Step back.

00:15:14.612 --> 00:15:15.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
SOLDIER 1: Coming in!

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:15.948 position:21% line:83% align:start
SOLDIER 3: Next one.

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:16.448 position:41% line:83% align:start
Good.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Ninja Art-- Super Beast Scroll.

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:43.876 position:35% line:83% align:start
[screech]

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.411 position:35% line:83% align:start
[screech]

00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:54.719 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Enemy spotted.

00:15:54.752 --> 00:15:55.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
SOLDIER (ON COMM): How many?

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.822 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Uh, just one.

00:15:57.855 --> 00:16:00.192 position:35% line:83% align:start
[laughter]

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hah, foolish Leaf.

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:04.629 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're counterattacking
faster than we expected,

00:16:04.662 --> 00:16:05.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they clearly
didn't have time

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:08.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
to prepare for a real fight.

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:10.202 position:24% line:83% align:start
OK men, let's have
some fun with him.

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.004 position:19% line:83% align:start
Send out Squadron One.

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.005 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sir!

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.006 position:24% line:83% align:start
Second formation,
prepare to launch!

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:14.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
Raise the catapults!

00:16:20.978 --> 00:16:23.449 position:16% line:83% align:start
-One, two, three, four.

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:26.418 position:13% line:83% align:start
So far, it appears I'm the
only one that they've noticed.

00:16:29.354 --> 00:16:31.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Sai, since you
can go head-to-head

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.858 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the Sky ninja,
you're a big asset.

00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:37.129 position:10% line:83% align:start
But look, there's no reason
for you to go all out on 'em.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.996 position:16% line:83% align:start
We just need you to draw
their attention away

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.798 position:10% line:83% align:start
from the rest of us, got it?

00:16:40.832 --> 00:16:42.301 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sigh]

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Shikamaru, you make
it sound so easy,

00:16:45.837 --> 00:16:48.773 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I'm no good at this
kind of delicate job.

00:16:48.806 --> 00:16:50.275 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh well.

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:53.744 position:10% line:83% align:start
Guess I can hold back a bit.

00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:55.746 position:35% line:83% align:start
[screech]

00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:09.660 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Aah!

00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:12.130 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:15.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scream]

00:17:21.072 --> 00:17:22.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Was that too fast?

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:26.144 position:7% line:83% align:start
Like I said, I'm bad at this.

00:17:26.177 --> 00:17:28.514 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Just as Lady Tsunade
said, it looks

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:32.417 position:7% line:83% align:start
like they're getting ready to
move to their second objective.

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:33.951 position:33% line:83% align:start
Astonishing.

00:17:33.985 --> 00:17:37.822 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aircraft carriers anchored
here, just off our coast.

00:17:37.855 --> 00:17:39.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your calculations were perfect.

00:17:39.924 --> 00:17:41.926 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Well, it's the
same way worker bees

00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:43.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
find their way back
to the beehive.

00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:46.565 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just narrowed down the
possible flight distance

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:49.800 position:13% line:83% align:start
from the amount of chakra
that Neji's Byakugan detected.

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:54.205 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Even so, sending a single
four-man squad is bold.

00:17:54.238 --> 00:17:56.340 position:24% line:83% align:start
Typical Shikamaru.

00:17:56.374 --> 00:17:58.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Well, with those
ships, they could always

00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:00.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
retreat into the open ocean.

00:18:00.244 --> 00:18:02.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I figured we should
let the sky ninja think

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:04.815 position:21% line:83% align:start
we have no military
means to counter.

00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:06.552 position:16% line:83% align:start
That way, they'll stick
around long enough

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.052 position:7% line:83% align:start
for us to do some real damage.

00:18:21.732 --> 00:18:23.167 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Sasuke.

00:18:23.201 --> 00:18:24.235 position:33% line:83% align:start
You've come.

00:18:24.268 --> 00:18:25.903 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What do you want?

00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:28.706 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Sasuke, we received word
that the Leaf Village

00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:30.775 position:7% line:83% align:start
was bombed early this morning.

00:18:30.808 --> 00:18:33.878 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Land of Sky was
behind it, a group

00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:35.746 position:10% line:83% align:start
thought destroyed long ago.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.815 position:24% line:83% align:start
-The Leaf Village?

00:18:37.848 --> 00:18:40.952 position:10% line:83% align:start
After all this time, you're
still interested in them?

00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:43.254 position:27% line:83% align:start
-My dear boy, I
don't really care

00:18:43.287 --> 00:18:46.123 position:16% line:83% align:start
what happens to the Leaf
or its pathetic people.

00:18:46.157 --> 00:18:48.292 position:21% line:83% align:start
When I summoned you
here, that place

00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:50.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
was the furthest thing
from my mind, but--

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:51.596 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunt]

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.998 position:35% line:83% align:start
[coughing]

00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:56.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Lord Orochimaru.

00:18:56.334 --> 00:19:01.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Sasuke, there is a man I would
like you to find and bring

00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:02.173 position:41% line:83% align:start
to me.

00:19:02.206 --> 00:19:03.507 position:38% line:83% align:start
-A man?

00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:05.209 position:35% line:83% align:start
-A doctor.

00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:07.278 position:27% line:83% align:start
-This doctor is
the one from whom

00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:10.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
I received the forbidden
regeneration jutsu.

00:19:10.948 --> 00:19:13.351 position:21% line:83% align:start
And after all these
years, I bet he's

00:19:13.384 --> 00:19:16.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
perfected a different,
more desirable form of it.

00:19:16.754 --> 00:19:19.824 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Oh, it's him, is it?

00:19:19.857 --> 00:19:21.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Bring him here.

00:19:21.325 --> 00:19:25.496 position:7% line:83% align:start
Alas, the time has come for me
to require that jutsu again.

00:19:34.472 --> 00:19:38.376 position:13% line:83% align:start
SHINNO: Amaru's village is
upstream, deep in this jungle.

00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:40.745 position:30% line:83% align:start
There are some
ancient ruins nearby.

00:19:40.777 --> 00:19:42.146 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah?

00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:44.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
And why do we have to paddle up
the river in these dumb boats?

00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:48.352 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'd get there faster if we
jumped out and went on foot.

00:19:48.386 --> 00:19:50.955 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Through a jungle like this,
with giant bugs, deadly snakes,

00:19:50.988 --> 00:19:53.524 position:27% line:83% align:start
and all kinds of
bloodthirsty beasts?

00:19:53.557 --> 00:19:54.925 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!

00:19:54.959 --> 00:19:57.628 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Don't forget, the river is
host to man-eating catfish,

00:19:57.662 --> 00:20:00.598 position:10% line:83% align:start
hungry alligators, and lots
of poisonous fish as well.

00:20:00.631 --> 00:20:01.532 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Eh?

00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:02.967 position:38% line:83% align:start
[splash]

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Don't be scared.

00:20:11.008 --> 00:20:12.743 position:27% line:83% align:start
Both these boats
carry skilled doctors

00:20:12.777 --> 00:20:15.980 position:16% line:83% align:start
who are way more useful
than any of you shinobi.

00:20:16.013 --> 00:20:18.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
All I need to save
you is this scalpel.

00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:19.617 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Oh yeah?

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.720 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it's us ninja who
are protecting you doctors.

00:20:22.753 --> 00:20:26.557 position:7% line:83% align:start
And besides, I bet if you were
the one holding the scalpel,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'd wind up killing
all your patients!

00:20:28.925 --> 00:20:30.294 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:20:30.328 --> 00:20:33.364 position:7% line:83% align:start
I may not look it, but I'm Dr.
Shinno's number one apprentice!

00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:36.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
You and your cold ninja world
couldn't possibly understand!

00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:39.337 position:7% line:83% align:start
There's nothing more important
than the master and student

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:39.836 position:41% line:83% align:start
bond!

00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:41.272 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Say what?

00:20:41.305 --> 00:20:42.707 position:27% line:83% align:start
You got no clue!

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.275 position:10% line:83% align:start
You wanna talk about bonds?

00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:47.678 position:21% line:83% align:start
Me and Iruka-sensei,
Kakashi-sensei, even Pervy

00:20:47.712 --> 00:20:56.220 position:19% line:83% align:start

AMARU (VOICEOVER): I
owe Dr. Shinno my life.

00:31:56.744 --> 00:32:00.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was abandoned as a
child, so when I fell ill

00:32:00.547 --> 00:32:04.486 position:13% line:83% align:start
from a mysterious disease,
no one in the whole village

00:32:04.518 --> 00:32:06.254 position:24% line:83% align:start
would care for me.

00:32:06.287 --> 00:32:09.523 position:10% line:83% align:start
But the doctor wasn't afraid
of catching the disease,

00:32:09.556 --> 00:32:11.259 position:24% line:83% align:start
and he treated me.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:28.476 position:7% line:83% align:start
When I woke up, he showed me a
tender smile and said softly,

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.079 position:30% line:83% align:start
"You did well.

00:32:31.112 --> 00:32:35.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
You did well, Amaru."

we didn't discover

00:32:43.124 --> 00:32:44.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
any of the bodies
of the villagers,

00:32:44.625 --> 00:32:48.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
they must have taken
refuge somewhere else.

00:32:48.063 --> 00:32:48.997 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You're right.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:49.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then we should
head out and search

00:32:49.863 --> 00:32:51.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
for them, just the three of us.

00:32:51.266 --> 00:32:51.732 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

00:32:51.765 --> 00:32:54.536 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:32:54.568 --> 00:32:59.773 position:10% line:83% align:start
-I'm not good enough unless
Dr. Shinno is by my side.

00:32:59.807 --> 00:33:01.209 position:21% line:83% align:start

This chakra--

Naruto.

00:33:51.493 --> 00:33:53.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh, I thought you were
out searching with Hinata?

are the ruins Old Man

Amaru.

Hey, what are you

00:34:44.945 --> 00:34:46.246 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's wrong with you?

Now then.

Attacking with the

00:36:06.526 --> 00:36:07.527 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's clever.

You've been trained
well, but that'll

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:13.900 position:10% line:83% align:start

Why won't you simply
release that power?

00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:41.688 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why keep it hidden within you?

too dangerous.

Sage and everyone else.

You may have tried,

darkness in his heart.

Ah well.

00:41:14.934 --> 00:41:17.037 position:21% line:83% align:start
It should be enough

And if I continue to shroud

I'll soon have all the

Why did you hit me like that?

00:42:48.159 --> 00:42:50.129 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Because you were looking
at me all funny and it

00:42:50.161 --> 00:42:52.498 position:27% line:83% align:start
freaked me out!

00:42:52.531 --> 00:42:55.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
So wait-- what happened?

00:42:55.634 --> 00:42:58.302 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I don't really understand
what happened back there,

00:42:58.336 --> 00:43:01.573 position:10% line:83% align:start
but it looks like we wrapped
it up nice and quick-- aah!

00:43:01.607 --> 00:43:03.809 position:35% line:83% align:start
[rumbling]

00:43:03.842 --> 00:43:04.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
What in the heck?

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.845 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Or maybe it's not over at all.

00:43:06.879 --> 00:43:07.680 position:35% line:83% align:start
[rumbling]

00:43:07.713 --> 00:43:08.747 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hold on a sec.

00:43:08.781 --> 00:43:09.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
What if Hinata and
the missing villagers

00:43:09.948 --> 00:43:11.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
are inside those ruins?

00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:14.318 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Listen, Sakura-- head
back to the Leaf Village

00:43:14.352 --> 00:43:16.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
and take Amaru with you.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.690 position:27% line:83% align:start
Leave Hinata and
the others to me.

00:43:17.723 --> 00:43:19.992 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll find 'em for sure.

00:43:20.025 --> 00:43:21.126 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Right, got it.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I'll hurry back with
lots of reinforcements.

00:43:23.729 --> 00:43:26.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
Amaru, let's go.

00:43:26.464 --> 00:43:27.700 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's the matter?

00:43:27.733 --> 00:43:29.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll carry you on my back.

00:43:29.635 --> 00:43:30.803 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hurry now!

00:43:30.836 --> 00:43:31.770 position:41% line:83% align:start
Amaru!

00:43:31.804 --> 00:43:33.172 position:35% line:83% align:start
-I won't!

00:43:33.204 --> 00:43:35.440 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:43:35.473 --> 00:43:38.276 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I have to honor Dr.
Shinno's teachings.

00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:40.179 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to save my people.

00:43:42.948 --> 00:43:45.617 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I'm sorry, but I can't leave
you here in your condition.

00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:46.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I totally understand.

00:43:46.819 --> 00:43:47.853 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:49.822 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Follow me, kid.

00:43:49.855 --> 00:43:51.056 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, wait a second.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:52.858 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can't just--

00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:54.026 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right!

00:43:54.059 --> 00:43:55.259 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Don't worry!

00:43:55.293 --> 00:43:58.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll watch out for
Amaru, no matter what!

00:43:58.563 --> 00:43:59.031 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto!

00:44:02.533 --> 00:44:03.969 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sigh]

00:44:04.002 --> 00:44:07.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
Heh, he never does
listen to me, does he?

00:44:10.943 --> 00:44:13.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Anyway, I've
gotta notify the Leaf Village.

00:44:13.912 --> 00:44:18.917 position:35% line:83% align:start
[rumbling]

00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:21.385 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:45:17.708 --> 00:45:18.177 position:38% line:83% align:start
Naruto!

00:45:31.689 --> 00:45:32.990 position:21% line:83% align:start
-What do you think?

00:45:33.025 --> 00:45:34.425 position:16% line:83% align:start
Should we send more men?

00:45:34.458 --> 00:45:36.195 position:13% line:83% align:start
-There's no need for that.

00:45:36.228 --> 00:45:38.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just hurry up with
the refueling.

00:45:38.496 --> 00:45:39.198 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sir!

00:45:39.231 --> 00:45:40.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
Keep refueling!

00:45:40.464 --> 00:45:41.599 position:30% line:83% align:start
Quickly, men!

00:45:41.632 --> 00:45:44.269 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'll finish you
off some other day.

00:45:44.303 --> 00:45:46.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
Perhaps when we destroy
the Leaf Village.

00:45:50.508 --> 00:45:51.642 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's about time.

00:45:51.676 --> 00:45:54.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It appears the enemy
has finished refueling.

00:45:54.545 --> 00:45:57.081 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'll have to go up against
another full scale attack.

00:46:00.518 --> 00:46:03.921 position:27% line:83% align:start
-There's need to
worry about that.

00:46:03.955 --> 00:46:05.756 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why, you ask?

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.425 position:38% line:83% align:start
Simple.

00:46:07.458 --> 00:46:10.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because there's no way I failed.

00:46:10.162 --> 00:46:11.629 position:33% line:83% align:start

-What the--

00:46:33.184 --> 00:46:41.993 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What the--

00:46:48.032 --> 00:46:48.499 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!

00:46:48.532 --> 00:46:49.000 position:41% line:83% align:start
Nooo!

00:46:55.006 --> 00:46:55.539 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No!

00:46:55.573 --> 00:46:57.942 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's impossible!

00:46:57.975 --> 00:47:02.446 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chirping]

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.948 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wha-- bugs?

-Hm.

00:47:20.398 --> 00:47:22.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Now that was something else.

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:00.404 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sigh]

00:48:00.438 --> 00:48:01.272 position:38% line:83% align:start

00:48:01.305 --> 00:48:01.839 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?

00:48:01.872 --> 00:48:03.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Is this real?

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.842 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, these ruins are flying.

00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:05.743 position:30% line:83% align:start
This is nuts.

00:48:05.776 --> 00:48:08.578 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Ugh, you're right about that.

00:48:08.611 --> 00:48:11.749 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't get what's
going on around here.

00:48:11.782 --> 00:48:14.719 position:7% line:83% align:start
This whole day's been nothing
but one surprise after another.

00:48:14.752 --> 00:48:16.120 position:21% line:83% align:start
SHINNO (VOICEOVER):
You're the one

00:48:16.153 --> 00:48:18.588 position:7% line:83% align:start
I recognize as my apprentice.

00:48:18.621 --> 00:48:20.024 position:13% line:83% align:start
AMARU (VOICEOVER): Doctor.

00:48:20.057 --> 00:48:20.590 position:30% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Amaru.

00:48:20.623 --> 00:48:21.892 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:48:21.926 --> 00:48:22.592 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Let's move.

00:48:25.096 --> 00:48:25.562 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:48:28.766 --> 00:48:30.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
If this thing was
built by humans,

00:48:30.468 --> 00:48:33.170 position:10% line:83% align:start
then there has to be someone
controlling it from somewhere.

00:48:33.204 --> 00:48:34.472 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

00:48:34.504 --> 00:48:36.474 position:10% line:83% align:start
And if we can find that guy,
we could send these ruins

00:48:36.506 --> 00:48:37.808 position:21% line:83% align:start
back down to earth.

00:48:37.842 --> 00:48:40.510 position:13% line:83% align:start
And when we do that, those
villagers are as good as saved.

00:48:43.147 --> 00:48:44.982 position:33% line:83% align:start
AMARU: Look!

-Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:48:49.387 --> 00:48:51.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sorry guys, but you're
kinda in our way!

SHINNO: I'm so very
proud of you two.

00:49:10.508 --> 00:49:12.910 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!

00:49:12.943 --> 00:49:18.748 position:27% line:83% align:start
You-- I knew it!

00:49:18.782 --> 00:49:21.651 position:35% line:83% align:start
I knew it!

00:49:21.684 --> 00:49:23.354 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.

00:49:23.387 --> 00:49:25.256 position:33% line:83% align:start
[chuckling]

00:49:25.289 --> 00:49:26.689 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I believed!

00:49:26.723 --> 00:49:28.125 position:24% line:83% align:start
I believed in you!

00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:30.560 position:10% line:83% align:start
I knew you were still alive!

00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:32.363 position:7% line:83% align:start
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

00:49:33.596 --> 00:49:36.733 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Old man, what is going on?

00:49:36.766 --> 00:49:39.170 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's the meaning of
all this craziness?

00:49:39.203 --> 00:49:40.071 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Let's see.

00:49:40.104 --> 00:49:41.971 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ah, that's a tricky one.

00:49:42.005 --> 00:49:45.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if I explained it, I doubt
your small minds could fully

00:49:45.209 --> 00:49:45.708 position:35% line:83% align:start
grasp it.

00:49:45.742 --> 00:49:46.976 position:38% line:83% align:start
[giggle]

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:50.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're inside a flying
fortress called Ancor Vantian.

00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:53.883 position:10% line:83% align:start
It looks like ancient ruins,
but it's been painstakingly

00:49:53.917 --> 00:49:56.420 position:13% line:83% align:start
developed and constructed
over several decades

00:49:56.454 --> 00:49:58.955 position:7% line:83% align:start
by ninja from the Land of Sky.

00:49:58.988 --> 00:50:01.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's the ultimate
weapon of destruction.

00:50:01.624 --> 00:50:05.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Ancor Vantian?

00:50:05.463 --> 00:50:06.430 position:30% line:83% align:start
-That's right.

00:50:06.464 --> 00:50:09.065 position:30% line:83% align:start
It means "the
fortress of the king."

00:50:09.099 --> 00:50:12.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
-So, old man, what are
you doing here, then,

00:50:12.536 --> 00:50:14.171 position:19% line:83% align:start
sitting on the throne?

00:50:14.205 --> 00:50:16.207 position:24% line:83% align:start
Didn't those kunai
hurt you at all?

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.208 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Ah, yes.

00:50:17.241 --> 00:50:19.008 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, it was child's
play to convince

00:50:19.042 --> 00:50:22.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
the likes of Sakura and
Hinata that I was dead.

00:50:22.179 --> 00:50:23.547 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasp]

00:50:23.581 --> 00:50:27.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then I revived my damaged organs
using my Body Activation Jutsu.

00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:29.220 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Jutsu?

00:50:29.253 --> 00:50:33.324 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, you're talking pretty
strange and I don't like it!

00:50:33.357 --> 00:50:36.059 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'd better tell us what
you're doing here, old man.

00:50:36.092 --> 00:50:39.863 position:10% line:83% align:start
You did come to these ruins
to whup these guys, didn't ya?

00:50:39.896 --> 00:50:42.699 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Oh, you still
haven't caught on yet.

00:50:42.732 --> 00:50:45.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Doctor, what-- ah!

00:50:45.969 --> 00:50:48.171 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Obviously, I'm not
about to bring harm

00:50:48.204 --> 00:50:50.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
to my closest allies.

00:50:50.341 --> 00:50:51.107 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Amaru!

00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:52.041 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!

00:50:52.075 --> 00:50:52.976 position:44% line:83% align:start
Aah!

00:50:53.009 --> 00:50:55.278 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunt]

00:50:55.312 --> 00:50:58.549 position:27% line:83% align:start
-14 years ago, I
posed as a doctor

00:50:58.582 --> 00:51:01.918 position:10% line:83% align:start
and traveled the world, all
the while gathering knowledge

00:51:01.951 --> 00:51:04.320 position:24% line:83% align:start
on how to control
the Zero-Tails.

-You mean you-- you've been
tricking us this whole time!

00:51:07.891 --> 00:51:10.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It took 13 long years
to find the scroll that

00:51:11.027 --> 00:51:13.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
enabled me to revive
the beast, but find it

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
I did-- hidden in
the Leaf Village.

00:51:16.966 --> 00:51:20.103 position:21% line:83% align:start
And at last, I have
mastered the Zero-Tails

00:51:20.136 --> 00:51:23.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
and its vast power
of dark chakra.

00:51:23.507 --> 00:51:25.175 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Did you say dark chakra?

00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:26.109 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Wait!

00:51:26.142 --> 00:51:27.677 position:38% line:83% align:start
Naruto!

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's not behaving like himself!

00:51:29.779 --> 00:51:32.516 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's gotta be sick, right?

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:34.652 position:7% line:83% align:start
Maybe we can cure him somehow.

00:51:34.684 --> 00:51:35.752 position:38% line:83% align:start
Please!

00:51:35.785 --> 00:51:36.686 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Eh?

00:51:36.719 --> 00:51:38.121 position:27% line:83% align:start
[fabric ripping]

00:51:38.154 --> 00:51:39.055 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:51:39.088 --> 00:51:41.925 position:33% line:83% align:start
[chuckling]

00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:44.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Wrong diagnosis, Amaru.

00:51:44.994 --> 00:51:48.498 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you think I've lost my
mind, you're sorely mistaken.

00:51:48.532 --> 00:51:51.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
In fact, if anything
is unnatural,

00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:53.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's how I've been
acting until now.

00:51:53.336 --> 00:51:56.906 position:35% line:83% align:start
[laughter]

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Nice look, Amaru.

00:51:58.474 --> 00:52:00.644 position:10% line:83% align:start
You pretending to be Shinno?

00:52:00.678 --> 00:52:03.647 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can wear his clothes,
but you ain't got his skills.

00:52:03.681 --> 00:52:05.481 position:35% line:83% align:start
[laughter]

00:52:05.515 --> 00:52:09.285 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Amaru, I think they
look quite good on you.

00:52:09.319 --> 00:52:12.121 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Thanks very much, doctor.

00:52:12.155 --> 00:52:14.891 position:16% line:83% align:start
SHINNO: When darkness is
present in people's hearts,

00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:17.860 position:24% line:83% align:start
the Zero-Tails can
take a hold over them

00:52:17.894 --> 00:52:22.432 position:13% line:83% align:start
and turn their darkness of
the heart into actual chakra.

00:52:22.465 --> 00:52:25.703 position:16% line:83% align:start
Once I understood that,
it was quite simple.

00:52:25.735 --> 00:52:28.171 position:27% line:83% align:start
It only took me
14 years to learn.

00:52:28.204 --> 00:52:31.541 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Darkness of the heart?

00:52:31.574 --> 00:52:34.911 position:10% line:83% align:start
-People overcome by despair.

00:52:34.944 --> 00:52:39.182 position:16% line:83% align:start
When sadness washes over
them, people focus great anger

00:52:39.215 --> 00:52:43.720 position:10% line:83% align:start
and hatred at the source of
their misery, and in doing so,

00:52:43.753 --> 00:52:46.723 position:7% line:83% align:start
create the darkest of chakras.

00:52:46.756 --> 00:52:49.959 position:21% line:83% align:start
I ordered the attack
on your village

00:52:49.993 --> 00:52:53.496 position:24% line:83% align:start
so the Zero-Tails
would possess you.

00:52:53.529 --> 00:52:54.464 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

00:52:54.497 --> 00:52:57.800 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're lying--
aren't you, doctor?

00:52:57.834 --> 00:52:59.269 position:38% line:83% align:start
Master!

00:52:59.302 --> 00:53:02.071 position:35% line:83% align:start
[laughter]

00:53:02.105 --> 00:53:05.174 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(MOCKINGLY) "Master,"
"apprentice"--

00:53:05.208 --> 00:53:08.177 position:27% line:83% align:start
who cares about
such stupid titles?

00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:11.014 position:16% line:83% align:start
To me, you were nothing
more than a convenient pawn

00:53:11.047 --> 00:53:12.582 position:33% line:83% align:start
in my plan.

00:53:12.615 --> 00:53:18.054 position:35% line:83% align:start
[laughter]

00:53:18.087 --> 00:53:20.523 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You've grown so much, Amaru.

00:53:20.556 --> 00:53:22.025 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm proud of you.

00:53:22.058 --> 00:53:23.526 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes.

00:53:23.559 --> 00:53:26.529 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scream]

00:53:26.562 --> 00:53:28.698 position:33% line:83% align:start
[chuckling]

00:53:28.731 --> 00:53:31.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Trust me, after you've
saved a person's life,

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.437 position:13% line:83% align:start
they will never doubt you
about anything at all.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:37.806 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Amaru-- snap out
of it, will ya?

00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:41.411 position:33% line:83% align:start
[whimpering]

00:53:41.444 --> 00:53:43.845 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Ooh, there it is.

00:53:43.879 --> 00:53:48.785 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can feel it-- dark chakra
coursing through my veins.

00:53:48.817 --> 00:53:52.288 position:35% line:83% align:start
[laughter]

00:53:59.329 --> 00:54:01.764 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You're gonna pay.

00:54:01.798 --> 00:54:05.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
I won't let up and I'll
never forgive you for this!

00:54:11.274 --> 00:54:13.676 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Dark chakra isn't
only used to reawaken

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Zero-Tails, my boy.

00:54:16.446 --> 00:54:18.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
It has other uses, too.

00:54:18.715 --> 00:54:20.817 position:10% line:83% align:start
For example, it can do this.

00:54:26.189 --> 00:54:29.592 position:35% line:83% align:start
[growling]

00:54:43.473 --> 00:54:45.375 position:33% line:83% align:start
[chuckling]

00:54:45.408 --> 00:54:48.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
That was the Body
Activation Jutsu.

00:54:48.611 --> 00:54:52.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
In this form, with this colossal
body, I can open up all eight

00:54:52.815 --> 00:54:56.251 position:13% line:83% align:start
of the inner chakra gates,
including the gate of death.

00:55:04.761 --> 00:55:05.428 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(IN UNISON) Aah!

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.736 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunt]

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:18.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Are you starting to understand
what this ultimate form, born

00:55:18.039 --> 00:55:22.478 position:19% line:83% align:start
of the Body Activation
Jutsu, can do?

00:55:22.512 --> 00:55:24.346 position:33% line:83% align:start
Ooh, sorry.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.148 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm still having
trouble getting used

00:55:26.181 --> 00:55:27.517 position:10% line:83% align:start
to this incredible strength.

00:55:40.395 --> 00:55:42.297 position:35% line:83% align:start
Now I see.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
This seat must been
created for the one who

00:55:44.834 --> 00:55:47.436 position:10% line:83% align:start
possesses the ultimate body.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.405 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a fine throne, fit
for a man strong enough

00:55:50.439 --> 00:55:51.574 position:24% line:83% align:start
to be called king.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:01.617 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Ain't gonna happen.

00:56:04.953 --> 00:56:05.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(IN UNISON) Aah!

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.430 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmph.

00:56:15.464 --> 00:56:15.932 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Aah!

00:56:19.301 --> 00:56:21.503 position:16% line:83% align:start
You think you're a king?

00:56:21.536 --> 00:56:24.439 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think you're nothing!

00:56:24.473 --> 00:56:26.909 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm not gonna
let you do this!

00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:38.620 position:38% line:83% align:start
Amaru--

00:56:38.653 --> 00:56:41.891 position:19% line:83% align:start
-In the human body, a
muscle is strengthened

00:56:41.924 --> 00:56:44.359 position:19% line:83% align:start
through the process of
damage and recovery.

00:56:44.392 --> 00:56:49.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
Therefore, I need only to apply
the basics of medical ninjutsu.

00:56:49.498 --> 00:56:52.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Through this process
alone, my body

00:56:52.567 --> 00:56:57.372 position:7% line:83% align:start
can become massively powerful,
capable of nearly anything.

00:56:57.405 --> 00:57:00.175 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Monster.

00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:04.546 position:19% line:83% align:start
-And when my ultimate
body releases chakra,

00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:11.419 position:7% line:83% align:start
it unleashes its most supreme
attack-- Super Activation Fist.

00:57:23.632 --> 00:57:24.099 position:33% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Aah!

00:57:28.603 --> 00:57:31.540 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunt]

00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:33.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
-What a nice surprise.

00:57:33.842 --> 00:57:37.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can still move after
that kind of punishment.

00:57:37.646 --> 00:57:40.315 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, I still
haven't paid you back

00:57:40.348 --> 00:57:42.651 position:16% line:83% align:start
for damaging my throne.

00:57:42.684 --> 00:57:43.852 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's gonna hurt.

00:57:50.859 --> 00:57:53.328 position:27% line:83% align:start
Were you trying
to sneak up on me?

00:57:53.361 --> 00:57:54.829 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's not very nice.

00:58:02.103 --> 00:58:03.338 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hmm.

00:58:03.371 --> 00:58:05.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come on then, hit me.

00:58:05.974 --> 00:58:10.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hit me with the dark
power inside you.

00:58:10.111 --> 00:58:11.513 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Not gonna happen!

00:58:19.988 --> 00:58:21.957 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Why do you resist?

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:26.661 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Zero-Tails told me you
have something inside of you,

00:58:26.695 --> 00:58:30.699 position:13% line:83% align:start
something that would bring
me great entertainment.

00:58:30.732 --> 00:58:33.168 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No way.

00:58:33.201 --> 00:58:34.536 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not gonna use that!

00:58:39.507 --> 00:58:41.977 position:13% line:83% align:start
-My power, I must test it.

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:46.247 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to know how strong
dark chakra really is.

00:58:46.281 --> 00:58:48.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You listen to me.

00:58:48.783 --> 00:58:51.019 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna put a stop to you.

00:58:51.052 --> 00:58:54.789 position:24% line:83% align:start
And all I need is
this first, got that?

00:58:54.823 --> 00:58:57.592 position:21% line:83% align:start
So get ready to pay!

00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:07.902 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Now you listen to me.

00:59:07.936 --> 00:59:09.638 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're done.

00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:10.939 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's it.

00:59:10.972 --> 00:59:13.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's as strong
as you'll ever be.

00:59:13.341 --> 00:59:16.878 position:13% line:83% align:start
No matter how long you try
or how hard you believe,

00:59:16.911 --> 00:59:19.914 position:27% line:83% align:start
this is all the
power you can obtain.

00:59:19.948 --> 00:59:24.119 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the end, that's all you got.

00:59:24.151 --> 00:59:26.021 position:27% line:83% align:start
Humans are weak.

00:59:26.054 --> 00:59:29.624 position:10% line:83% align:start
They have no fangs or claws.

00:59:29.658 --> 00:59:33.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why, their only unique
skill is crying.

00:59:33.495 --> 00:59:37.766 position:7% line:83% align:start
And yet, somehow, they managed
to conquer the entire world.

00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:41.036 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you know why?

00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:46.975 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because among all living
things on the planet, humans--

00:59:47.008 --> 00:59:47.942 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunt]

00:59:47.976 --> 00:59:51.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
--are the most cruel!

00:59:51.345 --> 00:59:52.781 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunt]

00:59:55.684 --> 00:59:57.752 position:33% line:83% align:start
Am I wrong?

00:59:57.786 --> 00:59:59.754 position:24% line:83% align:start
Unlike every other
creature, humans

00:59:59.788 --> 01:00:02.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
try to improve their condition.

01:00:02.157 --> 01:00:04.125 position:21% line:83% align:start
They join together,
and now they've

01:00:04.159 --> 01:00:06.628 position:13% line:83% align:start
achieved a higher status.

And what power did
they use to achieve it?

01:00:10.031 --> 01:00:13.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
It most certainly was
not the power of love!

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.939 position:13% line:83% align:start
-You gotta be kidding me.

01:00:17.972 --> 01:00:20.975 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just 'cause you've got some
freaky jutsu that puffs up

01:00:21.009 --> 01:00:24.145 position:27% line:83% align:start
your muscles, it
doesn't give you

01:00:24.179 --> 01:00:27.548 position:21% line:83% align:start
the right to be all
high and mighty.

01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:30.618 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look, I know I'm gonna
sound a little cheesy here,

01:00:30.652 --> 01:00:36.557 position:16% line:83% align:start
but the fact is, all my
sensei and all my friends who

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:42.897 position:10% line:83% align:start
fight beside me-- heck, even
Pervy Sage-- I love them.

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:46.134 position:33% line:83% align:start
Ya hear me?

01:00:46.167 --> 01:00:48.268 position:7% line:83% align:start
I love them with all my heart!

01:00:54.441 --> 01:00:56.376 position:24% line:83% align:start
I get it already.

01:00:56.410 --> 01:00:59.313 position:13% line:83% align:start
What was I even thinking?

01:00:59.346 --> 01:01:02.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
I tried to explain
myself, but a fool

01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:06.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
like you couldn't
possibly understand.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.157 position:24% line:83% align:start

Amaru's so-called love get you?

01:01:17.932 --> 01:01:20.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
In the end, that's what
created this whole mess.

01:01:20.634 --> 01:01:21.102 position:35% line:83% align:start

01:01:27.942 --> 01:01:30.344 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's my fault.

01:01:30.377 --> 01:01:34.249 position:24% line:83% align:start
My power did this.

01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:36.583 position:10% line:83% align:start
-It'll take more than that.

01:01:36.617 --> 01:01:37.584 position:38% line:83% align:start

01:02:00.908 --> 01:02:03.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't lose that hatred of yours.

01:02:03.278 --> 01:02:06.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
Never forgive me for
the evil I've done.

I can still fight.

01:02:34.775 --> 01:02:42.783 position:13% line:83% align:start
All the sadness you feel,
all your pain-- it's OK.

01:02:42.816 --> 01:02:45.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not your fault.

You can't help it.

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:54.761 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I'll
take it-- that pain,

01:02:54.795 --> 01:02:56.797 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll take it all on myself.

I'm about to knock you out!

-Naruto, sorry.

01:03:08.842 --> 01:03:09.810 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry.

That's not the way.

01:03:27.027 --> 01:03:28.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you get it?

01:03:28.762 --> 01:03:30.331 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have to live.

01:03:30.365 --> 01:03:37.804 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that's why-- that's why
you have to say goodbye.

01:03:37.838 --> 01:03:40.340 position:21% line:83% align:start
You never told him.

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:43.644 position:19% line:83% align:start
Never had the chance,
isn't that right?

01:03:46.613 --> 01:03:50.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have to tell him
how you feel, right?

01:03:55.722 --> 01:03:56.189 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Mm.

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:09.468 position:7% line:83% align:start
The first time I was praised,
he was the one who praised me.

01:04:09.503 --> 01:04:13.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
The first time I was
taught, he was the one

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:18.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
to teach me, the first
person to guide me.

-Keep going.

01:04:19.913 --> 01:04:29.056 position:5% line:83% align:start

was pretty, and the first time

01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:34.328 position:13% line:83% align:start
I ever cared what someone
thought of me, he was my world.

01:04:34.361 --> 01:04:35.796 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:39.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
-All I could think
about was the doctor.

01:04:43.602 --> 01:04:47.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was my first time
wanting someone's heart.

01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:49.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wanted to be loved.

01:04:49.643 --> 01:04:55.882 position:21% line:83% align:start
The truth is that I
always loved you, doctor!

-Hey!

01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:06.492 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shut it, dirtbag!

01:05:06.525 --> 01:05:10.663 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do me a favor-- how about
keeping your freaky ideas

01:05:10.696 --> 01:05:15.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
to yourself and quit
forcing 'em on us?

01:05:20.173 --> 01:05:23.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because you may believe
that a person's love leads

01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:27.080 position:7% line:83% align:start
to darkness, but you're wrong!

01:05:27.114 --> 01:05:30.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't destroy love!

01:05:30.117 --> 01:05:32.585 position:41% line:83% align:start
Never!

01:05:32.618 --> 01:05:35.554 position:44% line:83% align:start

never forgive you.

Sasuke!

01:06:31.044 --> 01:06:32.011 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why are you here?

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:38.452 position:16% line:83% align:start
-After all this time, it
seems that Lord Orochimaru

01:06:38.485 --> 01:06:41.354 position:27% line:83% align:start
would like some
assistance from you.

-Oh, is that the case?

01:06:43.622 --> 01:06:46.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what if I should resist you?

01:06:46.092 --> 01:06:49.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
I assume you'd have
to take me by force.

01:06:49.362 --> 01:06:52.798 position:16% line:83% align:start
-If that's how you wish
it to be, then yes.

01:06:59.705 --> 01:07:02.608 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you think I'm all
out of dark chakra?

01:07:02.641 --> 01:07:04.244 position:33% line:83% align:start
Ridiculous!

01:07:04.277 --> 01:07:07.780 position:13% line:83% align:start
The world is teaming with
darkness from people's hearts,

01:07:07.813 --> 01:07:09.682 position:27% line:83% align:start
and with my Body
Activation Jutsu--

01:07:09.715 --> 01:07:11.083 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Go ahead and try it.

01:07:11.117 --> 01:07:12.918 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!

01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:14.554 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I won't stop you.

01:07:14.588 --> 01:07:16.356 position:33% line:83% align:start

01:07:25.231 --> 01:07:26.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't get it!

chakra and saw its entire flow.

01:08:07.239 --> 01:08:10.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
Guess you didn't notice
my Chidori Senbon.

-No!

01:08:12.011 --> 01:08:14.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
You mean you somehow undermined
the control of my chakra

01:08:14.947 --> 01:08:16.315 position:38% line:83% align:start
points?

01:08:16.348 --> 01:08:18.485 position:19% line:83% align:start
But when did you-- oh!

01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:26.025 position:5% line:83% align:start

but I will be taking you back

He's probably trying to
get his hands on this.

Amaru, I'm gonna go
and try to find him.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:06.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's like you said, there
might be a way to cure him.

01:09:06.799 --> 01:09:08.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's worth a shot, right?

01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:11.270 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, you can
always give up later.

01:09:11.303 --> 01:09:15.007 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right now, you have gotta
go save those villagers.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.045 position:13% line:83% align:start
That way, you're honoring
the teachings of your master.

01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:33.259 position:38% line:83% align:start
Wait up!

How long have you been here?

01:09:39.198 --> 01:09:41.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
Talk to me, Sasuke!

01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:05.790 position:19% line:83% align:start
How stupid can you be?

01:10:05.823 --> 01:10:08.027 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Who are you calling stupid?

01:10:18.037 --> 01:10:19.438 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Look at that.

01:10:19.471 --> 01:10:24.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
Can't use your Chidori
down here, can you?

01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:27.413 position:7% line:83% align:start
This place absorbs the chakra
collected by the Zero-Tails

01:10:27.446 --> 01:10:29.947 position:13% line:83% align:start
and converts it to power.

01:10:29.981 --> 01:10:33.152 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now that you morons are
here, any chakra you release

01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:37.056 position:16% line:83% align:start
will be absorbed as more
fuel for Ancor Vantian, which

01:10:37.089 --> 01:10:39.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
means the two of you
can't do a thing.

shut up already?

01:10:42.827 --> 01:10:44.797 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't need chakra!

01:10:44.829 --> 01:10:45.331 position:41% line:83% align:start
Hyaa!

01:10:48.567 --> 01:10:51.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna take you
down, and I'm gonna

01:10:51.337 --> 01:10:54.573 position:7% line:83% align:start
do it with my two bare hands.

01:10:54.606 --> 01:10:57.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
-If that thing absorbs
all the chakra around it,

01:10:57.409 --> 01:10:58.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're all at the
same disadvantage.

01:11:03.248 --> 01:11:05.184 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You're both a bit
slow to catch on.

01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:08.187 position:7% line:83% align:start
I didn't lead you all the way
to the core of Ancor Vantian

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I could shut off
your puny chakra.

01:11:29.974 --> 01:11:32.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
-What did you think
Ancor Vantian was,

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:36.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
some kind of extravagant
floating fortress?

01:11:36.315 --> 01:11:38.883 position:13% line:83% align:start
You really believe I would
dare meddle with something

01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:42.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
as dangerous as a Tailed
Beast just for that?

01:11:42.454 --> 01:11:44.390 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's bigger than that.

01:11:44.423 --> 01:11:47.158 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why, it can obliterate
the Five Great Nations!

01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:50.429 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's equipped with the

-What?

01:11:50.995 --> 01:11:52.431 position:33% line:83% align:start

That is the power
of the Land of Sky!

01:12:43.514 --> 01:12:47.385 position:7% line:83% align:start
And after I've destroyed each
of the Five Great Nations,

01:12:47.418 --> 01:12:51.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will reign supreme
