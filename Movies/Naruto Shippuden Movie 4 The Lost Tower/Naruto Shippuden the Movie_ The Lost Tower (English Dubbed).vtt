When you're up against
puppets, you can't let

distracted by them.

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:50.593 position:27% line:77% align:start
Just focus on the chakra
threads being used to
control the puppets.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.964 position:38% line:77% align:start

00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:03.039 position:7% line:77% align:start
Let chakra flow into your sword

That's how you stop puppets.

00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:11.340 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Ley Line is an immense
source of chakra energy.

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:15.011 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was sealed away by the
Fourth Hokage's Jutsu Formula.

That's it.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.754 position:13% line:83% align:start

late to try to stop my plans.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.071 position:13% line:77% align:start
I'll possess the power of
the Ley Line and use it
to fuel my Puppet Jutsu.

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:45.976 position:7% line:77% align:start

doubt it.

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:51.748 position:33% line:71% align:start
You'll never be able

the Fourth Hokage
placed upon it.

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.685 position:19% line:83% align:start

01:10:09.817 --> 01:10:13.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
Won't work. Rasengan's the
Fourth Hokage's own jutsu.

01:10:13.654 --> 01:10:15.890 position:19% line:83% align:start
Only Pervy Sage and I
know how to use it.

01:10:16.123 --> 01:10:18.058 position:44% line:77% align:start
Of course!
That's why I
know it, too.

01:10:18.492 --> 01:10:19.026 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.029 position:50% line:77% align:start
Come on.
Just put out
your right hand.

01:10:22.529 --> 01:10:23.530 position:38% line:89% align:start
Okay...

01:10:27.835 --> 01:10:28.769 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

01:10:30.205 --> 01:10:33.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
So you still have some
chakra left, do you?

01:10:38.812 --> 01:10:40.047 position:16% line:89% align:start
A Rasengan?!

01:10:41.815 --> 01:10:43.784 position:10% line:89% align:start
No way. How's it possible?!

01:10:44.485 --> 01:10:47.688 position:24% line:77% align:start
'Cause when similar
Chakra Natures merge they
strengthen each other.

01:10:48.223 --> 01:10:50.724 position:33% line:83% align:start
And when that happens,
the end result is...

01:10:50.758 --> 01:10:52.893 position:47% line:83% align:start
an ultimate,
Supreme Rasengan!

01:10:57.631 --> 01:10:58.899 position:10% line:89% align:start

Ultimate, Supreme

Yeah.

01:16:24.394 --> 01:16:28.231 position:5% line:83% align:start

You did what you had to do!

01:16:28.398 --> 01:16:30.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're an

erase all memory of this.

01:16:41.378 --> 01:16:45.949 position:5% line:77% align:start

now, I may never be able to!
