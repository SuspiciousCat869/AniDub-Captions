[TATARA] You young ones
are persistent, aren't you?

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:53.872 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah, very well.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.542 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you must know the story,
I'm the one to tell it.

00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:00.745 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HYAKUSHUBO] Gather near and
pay close attention, everyone.

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:03.047 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TATARA]
A long time ago.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hm, actually, it wasn't
long ago at all.

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:08.018 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why do stories
always start that way?

00:01:08.052 --> 00:01:11.655 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HYAKUSHUBO] Anyhow, the story
begins right here in Jutengai,

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.591 position:27% line:83% align:start
a thriving land
that is home to about

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:15.359 position:10% line:89% align:start
one hundred thousand Beasts.

00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:18.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
The lord of Jutengai
had ruled for many years,

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:20.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
but then, one day, he announced
that he was going to

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:25.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
retire from his post
and reincarnate as a god.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
He needed some time to
decide what sort of god

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:29.339 position:7% line:89% align:start
he wished to become, however.

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:31.808 position:10% line:83% align:start
Once he reached a decision,
he would determine which Beast

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
was worthy to become
the lord in his place.

00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:36.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TATARA] His successor
had to be fair, honorable,

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.781 position:16% line:89% align:start
and, of course, strong.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:42.485 position:16% line:83% align:start
The first candidate was
a Beast named Iozen.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.389 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TATARA] Iozen was
fearless and valiant.

00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:49.792 position:10% line:83% align:start
Many apprentices had sought
him out for his fighting prowess

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:50.760 position:19% line:89% align:start
and teaching ability.

00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:53.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was also the proud
father of two sons,

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:56.431 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ichirohiko and Jiromaru.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.736 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TATARA] Everyone was certain
he would be chosen.

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:03.405 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HYAKUSHUBO] However,
there was another candidate.

00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:05.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Beast who would
challenge Iozen.

00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:09.310 position:16% line:89% align:start
His name was Kumatetsu.

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:12.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
He was tall and shaggy,
with the appearance of a bear.

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:14.282 position:16% line:83% align:start
But he had the tireless
energy of a monkey,

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:15.817 position:27% line:83% align:start
dashing back and
forth as he fought,

00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:17.718 position:7% line:89% align:start
swinging his scabbarded sword.

00:02:17.752 --> 00:02:20.821 position:24% line:83% align:start
He and Iozen were
said to be equals.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.191 position:33% line:83% align:start
[HYAKUSHUBO]
In terms of strength, anyway.

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:27.695 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TATARA] Kumatetsu's character
was a different story.

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:31.097 position:7% line:83% align:start
He was rough around the edges,
a bit crude, and often selfish.

00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.333 position:27% line:83% align:start
He did not have
a single apprentice.

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:35.235 position:16% line:83% align:start
[HYAKUSHUBO] Yes, strong
fighter though he was,

00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:38.739 position:19% line:83% align:start
he had no apprentice.
Nor did he have any sons.

00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:33.281 position:10% line:89% align:start

come and get me?

it's only right

No. Forget about him.

Your mother obviously wanted to.

We humbly seek your counsel.

00:40:21.409 --> 00:40:22.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is true strength?

00:40:22.977 --> 00:40:25.046 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KOKURAN DOJIN] I don't have
the powerful muscles

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:26.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
that many fighters do.

00:40:26.714 --> 00:40:30.618 position:7% line:83% align:start
However, I do have the ability
to create illusions.

00:40:30.651 --> 00:40:33.755 position:13% line:83% align:start
And sometimes there can be
more truth within an illusion

00:40:33.788 --> 00:40:34.922 position:27% line:89% align:start
than in reality.

00:40:34.956 --> 00:40:36.590 position:7% line:89% align:start
Therefore, true strength is...

00:40:36.623 --> 00:40:37.891 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:40:47.734 --> 00:40:49.836 position:21% line:83% align:start
I possess the power

which may seem like
strength to you.

But there is something even
my ability is powerless against.

00:40:54.608 --> 00:40:55.976 position:7% line:89% align:start
Therefore, true strength is...

True strength is...?

Well, I can tell you
that isn't true.

00:43:04.966 --> 00:43:06.667 position:24% line:83% align:start

you've done so far.

you learn quickly.

this case lies with Kumatetsu.

00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:20.581 position:16% line:83% align:start
His fighting techniques
are like him.

00:43:20.614 --> 00:43:23.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
A little bit rough.
Definitely on the messy side.

00:43:23.483 --> 00:43:25.585 position:33% line:89% align:start
But strong.

00:43:25.618 --> 00:43:28.521 position:24% line:83% align:start
He had no parents
or master to teach him.

00:43:28.554 --> 00:43:29.522 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KYUTA]
Huh?

00:43:29.555 --> 00:43:32.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
He had to become strong
without anybody's help.

00:43:32.092 --> 00:43:34.027 position:30% line:83% align:start
In some ways,
that's his greatest asset.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
In others, however,
it's his greatest failing.

00:43:37.063 --> 00:43:39.098 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because he learned
everything independently,

00:43:39.132 --> 00:43:41.668 position:16% line:83% align:start
he can now neither take
instruction nor give it.

00:43:41.701 --> 00:43:43.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can see how
that would happen.

00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:44.704 position:24% line:89% align:start
Despite all that,

00:43:44.737 --> 00:43:47.740 position:10% line:83% align:start
he's still capable of wisdom
every once in a while.

00:43:47.774 --> 00:43:49.976 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like what he said earlier.

00:43:50.009 --> 00:43:51.510 position:24% line:83% align:start
When he said there
are some things

00:43:51.543 --> 00:43:53.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have to figure out on my own?

00:43:53.146 --> 00:43:57.083 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HYAKUSHUBO] Yes. I believe

00:44:00.652 --> 00:44:02.087 position:33% line:83% align:start

00:44:03.221 --> 00:44:05.490 position:16% line:83% align:start

They want me to get good grades,

01:01:26.156 --> 01:01:28.857 position:19% line:83% align:start
so I spend all my time
inside a library.

know who the real me is.

And I won't 'til I'm on my own.
