1
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:38,328
From Mimuro's mountain slopes, maple leaves are torn...

2
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:46,382
Which turn Tatsuta river...

3
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,703
Into a rich brocade...

4
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,585
Though it cost my life...

5
00:00:56,812 --> 00:00:59,679
The same favored card as the Master, huh?

6
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,632
We now must meet...

7
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,382
All of this is because of you,

8
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:11,804
Momiji Ooka.

9
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:17,257
And as soon as today's program
is recorded, I should thank you.

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,650
Heh.

11
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,140
Huh? Faster than I'd thought you'd be.

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,843
Thanks for coming.

13
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,060
Huh?!

14
00:01:26,148 --> 00:01:28,140
You're not..! What the hell are you doing?!

15
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,507
Stay away from me!

16
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,382
Wah... Agh...

17
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:40,468
Ugh!

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,892
In Naniwa Bay, a flower blooms, in winter...

19
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:06,259
Then spring will rise, and a new flower shall bloom...

20
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:14,814
Then spring will rise, and a new flower shall bloom...

21
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:20,502
Since I could bring no offering...

22
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:23,712
Woah... And the Karuta card goes flying...

23
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,173
Oh, don't bother.

24
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,634
O... kay?

25
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,048
Please, excuse me.

26
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,591
Beautiful!

27
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,806
Please dad! Keep your voice down!

28
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:34,126
She's so cute!

29
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:35,275
Like an idol!

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,017
And that kimono suits her!

31
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:40,710
So, uh, remind me, why exactly
are we watching a Karuta game?

32
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:41,946
That's a good question.

33
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:42,298
Hm?

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,079
Mikiko asked us to stay in the
waiting room until the interview starts.

35
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:50,275
But all of a sudden, you got distracted by a
pretty girl and followed her to the studio, remember?

36
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,571
Who is Mikiko?

37
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,657
I introduced you to her!

38
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:56,821
Take your eyes off Kimono girl. Mikiko's over there.

39
00:02:57,173 --> 00:03:00,345
She's the chief of the Karuta
club I joined at Kaiho Academy.

40
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,095
Hold on a second.

41
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,470
You're in the Karuta club, Kazuha?

42
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:05,985
Yeah! You didn't know?

43
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,446
You guys went off to the bathroom hours ago!

44
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:14,048
Sorry. The studio door was shut and I
didn't know if we were gonna be allowed back in.

45
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:15,150
Uh, pardon me guys.

46
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:18,696
We're kinda in the middle of rehersal,
so could you maybe keep the noise down?

47
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,173
Right, sorry...

48
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:21,720
The wandering stag calls...

49
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,700
Once, my life was not dear to me...

50
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,540
Now I desire it shall endure...

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,907
Woah..!

52
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:29,701
Hohoh! Look at that throw!

53
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:30,350
Hey, Kudo.

54
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,196
What do you wanna bet, pops already
forgot he came down to Osaka for an interview?

55
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:36,032
If he has, it's forgivable.

56
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,681
Since Doc had something to do and couldn't make it,

57
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:42,243
Kogoro finally gave in to everyone's
nagging and brought them along.

58
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:45,048
And by the way, whatever happened to that rich girl?

59
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:47,353
Oh, you mean Sonoko?

60
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,400
She's sick in bed with a cold.

61
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,235
Aah...

62
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,908
I had no idea you liked that.

63
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,220
It's pretty cool you joined the Karuta club!

64
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:56,962
Yeah, Aikido and Karuta.

65
00:03:57,095 --> 00:04:01,407
The Karuta club almost had to shut down, due
to lack of members, so I was happy to help out.

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,804
I went now and then to help Mikiko practice.

67
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,642
But otherwise I was pretty much a ghost member.

68
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,962
A ghost member? That's so funny.

69
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,001
I'm so glad you're both having such a good time.

70
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:15,455
Perhaps you two think this is a coffee house?

71
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,978
Huh... Sorry about that...

72
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:41,469
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

73
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,360
I went to an amusement park with my childhood friend Ran,

74
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:50,438
and while we were there, we witnessed
some men in black making a dangerous deal.

75
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,477
Because I was so absorbed in watching them,

76
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:56,555
I didn't notice the man who came at me from behind.

77
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:03,063
He forced me to drink a poison that
knocked me out. And when I woke up...

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,305
I discovered that my body had shrunk!

79
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,009
If those guys ever found out that Shinichi
Kudo is still alive, they'd come back.

80
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:20,407
So on Doctor Agasa's advice, I
kept my real identity a secret.

81
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:25,657
When Ran asked me who I was, I
quickly made up the name "Conan Edogawa."

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,868
I knew if I wanted info on the men in black,

83
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:31,993
the smart thing to do would be to
stay at her house with her and her dad,

84
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:34,165
who ran a detective agency.

85
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:40,610
Heiji Hattori. High school detective of the west.

86
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,068
His father's Chief of HQ with the Osaka Police,

87
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:47,391
and he's solved several cases with his inherited skills.

88
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:50,665
He's one of the few who know about my true identity.

89
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,704
Kazuha Toyama, is Heiji's childhood friend and classmate.

90
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:59,985
He can drive her up the wall with a single offhand remark.

91
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,446
I can't help but wonder how
those two are going to end up...

92
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,524
And finally, the future Karuta queen, a
brilliant card player shrouded in mystery.

93
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,550
My body may have shrunk, but my I.Q hasn't.

94
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:16,390
Detective Conan leaves no case unsolved!

95
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,414
There is always only one truth!

96
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,626
Aw, we came all the way out to a
studio just to sit in the waiting room?

97
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:31,387
I wanted to see the show!

98
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:34,814
They're never letting us back
in, they even got mad at Kogoro!

99
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,407
Sorry guys, I didn't mean to get us kicked out...

100
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:41,718
Hey, When everyone else gets back, Hm? what
do you say we go out looking for some souvenirs?

101
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:42,109
Yeah!

102
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:42,578
Really?

103
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,300
Seriously?

104
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,298
Sure. If you guys can behave until they finish filming!

105
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,259
Yeah, you bet!

106
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,083
That's awesome!

107
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,938
Everybode else should come too!

108
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,493
Hey, if we got kicked out, what happened to Conan?

109
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,629
Oh, Conan's in the studio.

110
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:57,821
He's looking after dad to keep him out of trouble.

111
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,282
I'm confused.

112
00:06:59,307 --> 00:06:59,594
Huh?

113
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:02,384
I told you to go sit in the
waiting room, yet here you are.

114
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,407
You did, but Ran said she wanted me to
stay here so I could watch the filming!

115
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:07,446
Figures.

116
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:11,063
Make way, everyone! Karuta
cards coming through, clear a path!

117
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:13,241
It's the Satsuki Cup cards!

118
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,212
That's a lot of protection for some Karuta cards.

119
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,852
Well they're certainly deserving.

120
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,657
Those aren't just some cards...

121
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:23,391
They're the traditional deck of the
Satsuki Cup used in the final match!

122
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,774
Oh yeah! Right...

123
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,000
I guess competing in a contest
with those was your dream, huh?

124
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,340
Not just mine!

125
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,782
They've been adored for all of the
Satsuki Association's 20 year history!

126
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:38,852
Just touching those legendary cards in
the finals would be like a dream come true!

127
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:39,469
Hey!

128
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,844
Why are those particular cards only used in the finals?

129
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:46,509
They've been played in some
intense matches it's starting to show.

130
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,938
That's why when they're not being
used they're on display in a museum

131
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,180
stored safe and sound in a case like that one.

132
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:57,895
Maybe so, still seems like way
too much for a bunch of cards.

133
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:58,895
It does not!

134
00:07:58,919 --> 00:07:59,227
Huh?

135
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,501
Actually right after last year's
tournament the cards went missing.

136
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,040
Thank goodness they were found right away but...

137
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:10,743
The grand champion, Mr. Yajima, convinced
President Achiwa greater security was needed.

138
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,224
I see. Now tell me...

139
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,600
Who exactly are these people you mentioned?

140
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:16,868
Heheh...

141
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:20,712
Are you serious?! They're the ones
you're here to interview in the first place!

142
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:21,884
Oh, is that a fact?

143
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,548
You never give an inch, do you?

144
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:27,477
The man in this photo is President Kensuke Achiwa.

145
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:28,376
Huh...

146
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,766
He founded Achiwa Real Estate,

147
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,571
and now he's known as the Real Estate King of Naniwa.

148
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:37,100
He doesn't strike me as a guy who likes playing Karuta...

149
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,850
Apparently it's his only hobby. He's
supposed to be pretty good at it, too.

150
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:46,001
But I've seen articles about how he wanted
to be a reader of cards instead of a contestant.

151
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:49,134
Wohohohohoah! Who is that?!

152
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,420
President Achiwa's wife, Satsuki.

153
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,446
Ah, so she's married, huh?

154
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,594
She sort of established the Satsuki
Association and used to be the queen.

155
00:08:57,743 --> 00:09:00,813
Mister Achiwa took after her and became president.

156
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:03,610
Okay, and what else might come up in the interview?

157
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,048
Ah, this could be interesting right?

158
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:09,122
Whenever his wife enters an important competition,

159
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:11,735
Mr. Achiwa always washes his car.

160
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,493
It says here he thinks it brings him good luck.

161
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,290
According to him a clean car is the first step to victory!

162
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:22,876
You're telling me I have to do an interview
with this superstitious weirdo couple?

163
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:23,466
Well...

164
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:23,899
Huh?

165
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:28,884
Not exactly the both of them. About three
years ago, Satsuki got sick and passed away.

166
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,094
Your interview today will just be with President Achiwa.

167
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:33,673
I, uh... I see...

168
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:35,868
Who's this super strong looking guy?

169
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,157
He's in almost every one of
these pictures with Mr. Achiwa...

170
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:40,349
Togo Kaeda.

171
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,757
Huh?

172
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:42,727
He used to be Mr. Achiwa's secretary.

173
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:46,313
Rumor has it he ran the shady
side of the real estate empire.

174
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:50,274
He's really clever. But it seems he quit and disappeared.

175
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,038
Heiji!

176
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:51,516
Huh?

177
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,884
That is completely an unfounded rumor!

178
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:56,274
There is no way Mr. Achiwa's a criminal!

179
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,235
Take it back!

180
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:58,493
Okay, okay.

181
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,915
I said it was just a rumor?

182
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,149
The president's coming!

183
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:01,610
Huh?

184
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:04,188
President Achiwa! Let's go say hi!

185
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,335
It's an honor to have you with us today Mr. President.

186
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,884
The pleasure's all mine, thanks so much for having me.

187
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,524
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:14,946
I believe that Mr. Yajima and Momiji are
going to perform a little demonstration.

189
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,743
And then there's an interview to follow?

190
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,516
That's right, and we're going to air the film we
shot of Mr. Yajima's demonstration from last week.

191
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,920
After that, we'll show a Satsuki
Association special that will

192
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:27,648
hopefully get the whole nation excited about Karuta again.

193
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,516
Oh, I see the Satsuki Association's
cards are already on display.

194
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,239
Is everything going to plan?

195
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:33,900
Of course!

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,438
He draws in the whole room!

197
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,450
Well, what else would you expect from real estate royalty?

198
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:41,540
Excuse me, but can anyone get a hold of Mr. Yajima?

199
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,829
It's his call time and I just can't
find him anywhere! I've tried everything!

200
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:47,985
How strange,

201
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:51,329
he promised us he'd be here an
hour before we were set to air.

202
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,157
Yajima wouldn't be this late, it's simply not like him!

203
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,212
But just to have assurances, give Mister Sekine a call.

204
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:00,876
If worse does come to worst, I'm
sure he can serve as a substitute.

205
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:16,954
Huh..?

206
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:19,915
No... There's no way..!

207
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,376
There's some time before filming.

208
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:23,251
A little bit.

209
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:26,110
So Heiji! Where do you wanna take us for lunch?

210
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,610
To the #1 spot for Okonomiyaki, of course!

211
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,930
I think I know just where you're talking about!

212
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,040
Woah!

213
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:32,712
Uh...

214
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,212
I'm so sorry, are you all right?

215
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:39,001
Hey, you were the one playing Karuta!

216
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,868
It's destiny.

217
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,649
Huh?!

218
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:47,140
Something told me that I would get to see you!

219
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,063
Huh?!

220
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:50,688
My future husband... I've missed you so!

221
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,634
Future- what?!

222
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:52,602
Your husband?!

223
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,110
Huuh?!

224
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,368
I'll have some free time right
after we're done filming, my darling.

225
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:00,923
Why don't we go out for a cup of tea? Get reacquainted!

226
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,516
Just what do you think you're doing?!

227
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:03,602
I swear! I wasn't gonna...

228
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:04,352
Miss Momiji!

229
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:05,063
Huh?

230
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:07,532
Please Miss, I need you to get back to the waiting room!

231
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:10,071
Oh, well it's such a shame I have to leave so soon.

232
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:13,290
The thing is, Mr. Yajima is
running just a little late right now.

233
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,587
That's not like him...

234
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:18,098
After all he did to make sure this
program goes off without a hitch...

235
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,258
I'm certain he's just tying up loose ends.

236
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:22,829
I'll come and see you as soon as we're done, Heiji!

237
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,425
Okay, I'll be waiting!

238
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,266
Ugh!

239
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:27,384
Just who the hell is that girl?

240
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,212
She was the pretty girl playing Karuta!

241
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,329
She's adorable!

242
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:31,930
I think her name was Momiji.

243
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:34,266
I told you, I don't even know the girl!

244
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,454
Then how did she know your name huh?

245
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:37,759
Hey Ran?

246
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,696
Let's go wait outside!

247
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:41,876
We'll come back when they're done arguing.

248
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:43,150
Come on let's go!

249
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:44,977
I wonder what she's so mad about?

250
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:45,821
REAL friendly!

251
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:49,376
Well, I guess... Maybe we met somewhere before?

252
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,305
Oh, of course, I see! So you do know her.

253
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,759
Look, I told you I don't.

254
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:57,915
And trust me, because I'd never
forget someone as beautiful as that girl.

255
00:12:57,968 --> 00:12:59,899
Do you really think she's beautiful..?

256
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:02,993
You're memorable too but, y'know, for different reasons.

257
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:05,675
Excuse me?! Just what do you mean by that?

258
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,750
Hold on.

259
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,063
Are you really saying you don't know who she is, Heiji?

260
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,165
Momiji Ooka?

261
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,040
Apparently she's the Satsuki Cup
high school champion two years in a row.

262
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,714
She's a junior at Kyoto Senshin High School.

263
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,774
People say she'll be the Karuta Queen one of these days.

264
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:23,821
Momiji Ooka?

265
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:25,641
She must be incredible...

266
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,204
So this is the threat we received this morning?

267
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:32,915
It just says here that Nichiuri TV will be bombed.

268
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,264
What's this Image of a Karuta card about?

269
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,462
It was attached to the bottom of the email.

270
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,298
We still haven't figured out what it means.

271
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,805
Has Nichiuri TV been informed
of the threat against them yet?

272
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,102
They have. We sent them a notice.

273
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,719
What do you think, Heizo?

274
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,438
Is this message an honest to goodness
threat or just some stupid prank?

275
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:54,188
It's difficult to tell from just the one email.

276
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,423
But if this threat is real, it'll be a disaster.

277
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,805
An emergency evacuation alert has been
issued, by the Osaka Prefectural Police.

278
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,477
They want to evacuate the building?

279
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,844
and evacuate,

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,602
Hm? What in the...?

281
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,516
Is this some kind of fire drill?

282
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,407
Do you know what's happening Ran?

283
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,790
They mentioned the police.

284
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,602
Think they're filming another program?

285
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:21,774
Please stop all operations and filming,
and evacuate via the emergency stairs...

286
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,477
You! Find out what's going on!

287
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,665
Yeah... Right!

288
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,134
Sounds like we'd best make our way out.

289
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,524
Kazuha, I need you to get to
the emergency stairway. Stay safe.

290
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:35,196
Wait! What about you?

291
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm gonna go find out what's happening
here. You clear out of the building, okay?

292
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,719
But! Heiji!

293
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,055
What the-?

294
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:49,180
Hey! You're supposed to be heading outside!

295
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,219
I forgot something in the studio!

296
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:54,655
I don't care! Didn't you hear
that announcement they just made?!

297
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,258
Ugh...

298
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:56,571
Apologies, my lady.

299
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:58,329
I was surprised as well...

300
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,134
I really wish I'd had some time to change...

301
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,446
Heheh.

302
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:06,009
This is real bad! We need everyone out of here!

303
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:07,438
Calm down. What happened?

304
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,700
The cops say there's a bomb threat on the building!

305
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,321
What?! President Achiwa!

306
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:15,325
I'm certain this is just a prank, sir.
But just to be safe, we should evacuate.

307
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:16,805
Precautions must be taken.

308
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:20,829
All right people, you heard the announcement!
Let's get everyone outside! Hurry up!

309
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,032
All right! Got it!

310
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,688
Mikiko, what are you doing?!

311
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:27,169
Huh?!

312
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,413
It's too dangerous here. We have to go!

313
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:30,446
Sir, come on!

314
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:30,899
Huh?!

315
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:31,419
Woah!

316
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,954
What're you doing? Let's move!

317
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,016
Everyone, keep moving in an orderly fashion.

318
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,550
We just need to make sure it's safe before we

319
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,923
Everybody, stay where I can see you, we let you all
back into the building. until it's safe to go back in.

320
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,305
Great, even more waiting.

321
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,110
I can't get a signal...

322
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,384
Dad's still inside but I'm sure he can find a way out.

323
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,626
Ran!

324
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,970
Hey, it's Dad and Conan!

325
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,407
What the heck is going on in there?

326
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:59,868
Some kind of surprise fire drill or something?

327
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:03,370
It's not, I asked the staff
about it when we first came out.

328
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,641
They said there'd been a bomb threat.

329
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,743
Are you serious?!

330
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:10,188
Wait, where's Kazuha and Heiji?

331
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:13,165
Hold on! I thought they came outside with you!

332
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:16,192
No. I'm gonna head inside and look for them

333
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,266
No! I'll go.

334
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:19,696
Wait right here and don't move!

335
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,774
Hear me?!

336
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:27,649
Hmm...

337
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:31,235
Couldn't have picked a worse time for an evacuation drill.

338
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:33,493
If this is a joke, it's not funny!

339
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,634
Heiji! Mikiko!

340
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,094
Come on! We gotta go!

341
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:41,282
Sorry, I was worried about you two, that's all!

342
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:45,930
I'm so sorry!

343
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:48,785
I can't leave those cards behind! I'm going back for them!

344
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:49,478
Huh?!

345
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,485
If I can find the GPS location...

346
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:59,673
You're kidding, Hattori is still inside! For real?!

347
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:05,673
You! What're you doing?!

348
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:08,210
Forget the cards! You need to evacuate!

349
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:09,102
Listen!

350
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:09,962
Mikiko!

351
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:10,454
Huh?

352
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,173
What are you guys doing here?!

353
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,094
Do you have any idea what kind of danger you're in?!

354
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,196
I'm sorry!

355
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,016
Ah! Yeah, me too!

356
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,180
Come on...

357
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:21,954
Found a few in Studio Three.

358
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,040
Mikiko!

359
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,524
You had me so worried!

360
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:26,560
Get them out!

361
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:27,212
Roger that!

362
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:29,850
I'm really sorry, I just couldn't help myself!

363
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:32,157
I mean, if it was a real bomb threat...

364
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:34,600
It could blow any second,

365
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:37,923
we'll fall back and observe
until we deem it safe to approach!

366
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,055
That's good thinking.

367
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:42,469
There were 3 left in the studio
but they're being evacuated, sir.

368
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,766
They were the last, yes?

369
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,321
Right!

370
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:49,484
All right. Now that the civilians are safe,
it's up to us to find that bomb. Let's go!

371
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:50,259
Yes, sir!

372
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:55,485
The police went inside...

373
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,100
No way it's just a prank...

374
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:00,876
Come on, hurry! This way.

375
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:10,727
It was real!

376
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:14,039
Everyone, get out of here!

377
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:14,493
Yes, sir!

378
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:16,844
Expand the perimeter, get everyone back!

379
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,493
Keep the civilians away!

380
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,234
Keep moving, sir!

381
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,126
Woah!

382
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,555
Woah!

383
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:29,350
Look out!!

384
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,384
Kazuha!

385
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:36,000
Woah...

386
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,048
No! Stay here where it's safe.

387
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,063
Damn it! Where the hell are they?!

388
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:44,344
I hope Hattori's not injured... or worse!

389
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,391
Kazuha!

390
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,149
Ah!

391
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:49,134
Stop! It's dangerous!

392
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,516
Come with me!

393
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:51,204
Ah..!

394
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,524
Are you all right? Can you walk?

395
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:54,219
Y-Yes.

396
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,985
Good! Let's go. This way!

397
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,821
The building could collapse. We can't risk going in...

398
00:18:59,122 --> 00:18:59,657
Right...

399
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,719
Keep it moving, folks!

400
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,009
There were people still inside?

401
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,360
What?!

402
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:18,461
Go! Go!

403
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,149
Argh!

404
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,141
Gah!

405
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,673
Heiji!

406
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:27,259
Ah, close one...

407
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:31,930
Run! Get away!

408
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,423
We can't go down...

409
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,430
Kazuha, we're going up!

410
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,954
What do you mean? That's the way out!

411
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,891
We can't get out there, so let's
find somewhere we can breathe!

412
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:48,790
Don't tell me...

413
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:51,243
He's going up?

414
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:55,626
Damn. It's not going through...

415
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:01,727
Go, go!

416
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,352
Kazuha! Come back!

417
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,485
Oh... This is bad... The whole roof's gonna collapse!

418
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:16,266
More! Get as close as you can!

419
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,079
This is the closest we're going to get!

420
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,907
Excuse me! Coming through!

421
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,188
Damn! I can't see anything in this smoke.

422
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,171
No way I can handle this. Not by myself!

423
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,680
Kudo!

424
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:41,493
It's do or die.

425
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,641
Let's do this.

426
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,540
Haah!

427
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:59,579
Let's go!

428
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:02,251
That's him!

429
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:03,743
Took you long enough..!

430
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:05,024
Argh.

431
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,766
Ah! Ugh...

432
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:12,150
Hah!

433
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,251
Hattori!

434
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,500
Wait, where are we going?

435
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,532
To the only way out of this place, come on!

436
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,560
Down? That's crazy!

437
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,282
Wait here, I'll be right back!

438
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:34,313
Heiji! We'll never make it, it's too high!

439
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:35,985
Hey, I'm ready when you are!

440
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:38,984
Same here. There's no more time to waste!

441
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:39,759
Right!

442
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,192
Ah..

443
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:40,690
Here we go!

444
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:44,993
This is a bad idea! I can't see a thing now! Wait! Heiji!

445
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,319
Hang tight and keep your eyes closed, okay?

446
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:49,329
Huh?! Hey, wait a sec!

447
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:50,305
No!

448
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:53,337
No no no, put me down!

449
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,751
I owe you one, we'll be waiting down below!

450
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:56,891
I gotcha.

451
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:57,602
What are you doing?

452
00:21:57,727 --> 00:21:58,750
No... What are you?!

453
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:05,384
Ugh!

454
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:07,118
Kudo!

455
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,204
Ah! Damn!

456
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,915
Kudo!

457
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,540
It can't be!

458
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:28,360
Everybody see that?! Come on!

459
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,563
That's Heiji!

460
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:31,290
There is somebody there!

461
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,235
Go and get the stretcher!

462
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:34,078
Huh?

463
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,118
Kazuha!

464
00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:36,977
Ah.. Huh... Heiji...

465
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:44,743
Damn. That was the only way to get down...

466
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:48,774
Come on, think! There's got to be another way out of here.

467
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,329
A rescue chopper!

468
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:57,100
No, that's no good... With all the fire and
smoke they'd never be able to get close enough...

469
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,509
But wait! There's that river next to the station.

470
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,532
If I can get over there...

471
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:04,891
Here goes!

472
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,102
Ugh...

473
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:09,868
Not enough room to get my skateboard up to speed.

474
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:12,344
Woah!

475
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:16,126
Just breathing makes it feel like my lungs are on fire!

476
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,650
I've gotta do something and fast!

477
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,024
Gotta... try..!

478
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:22,219
Ugh...

479
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,173
No!

480
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:34,868
I won't give up... No matter what!

481
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:38,399
There's gotta be somewhere I can build up some speed.

482
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:39,735
There's gotta be!

483
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,087
That'll work!

484
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,734
You're low on time, Kudo! Hurry up!

485
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:46,430
Huh?!

486
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,782
Woah, that's him!

487
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,266
I mean it's gotta be! But what the heck's the plan?

488
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:01,329
Huh?

489
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,946
The river! Clever as always.

490
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:09,509
A little more...

491
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:11,876
A little faster...

492
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:17,884
I can barely breathe.

493
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:20,438
But I'm almost there!

494
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:22,566
Woah!

495
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,907
It's gonna fall!

496
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,610
I sure hope this works!

497
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,727
Damn, not enough speed!

498
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:33,876
Gah!

499
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,235
I'm not gonna make it!

500
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,665
Gah! Augh!

501
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:40,102
Hup!

502
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,048
I gotcha! Come here!

503
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,079
Hey, are you okay?!

504
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:01,704
I'm all right, yeah.

505
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,134
Here, you dropped these.

506
00:25:04,394 --> 00:25:05,141
Thanks.

507
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,750
Did you know that Nichiuri TV was gonna be bombed?

508
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:10,751
Is that why you brought that thing?

509
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:16,868
No, of course not! It was just a coincidence.
I like to keep it around for emergencies.

510
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:19,813
There's always an emergency when you're around.

511
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,384
Ahah... You have a point.

512
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,290
Kazuha!

513
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,550
Hey, Ran!

514
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,805
Are you all right?

515
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,360
Yeah, but, my memory's fuzzy...

516
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:36,423
I think I must have inhaled a lot of smoke or something.

517
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:38,360
As long as you're okay, that's what matters.

518
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,974
Glad it turned out alright.

519
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:40,570
Yeah.

520
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:44,829
Oh, and I think I dropped the car key
somewhere, so I'm gonna go take a look for it.

521
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,712
Okay, Dad!

522
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,852
By the way, where's Conan?

523
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:51,141
I assumed this is the evacuation center he would come to.

524
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:52,298
Hey look!

525
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,000
Yay, it's Conan!

526
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,454
We were worried sick!

527
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:58,200
Woah, Kazuha!

528
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,282
Well, look who it is! And where have you been hiding?

529
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:03,080
Oh, I uh...

530
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:05,970
And what about you, Conan? We
were all worried sick about you!

531
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:07,282
I'm really sorry.

532
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,830
What happened to Mikiko?

533
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,055
Her arm was injured while they were escaping
the building so she was taken to the hospital.

534
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:14,438
Is she okay?

535
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,462
I hope it's nothing serious.

536
00:26:17,337 --> 00:26:20,774
I found out what hospital she's
at. We can go see her if you like?

537
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,337
Yeah, let's go!

538
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:24,759
Heiji!

539
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:25,993
Inspector Otaki!

540
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,809
I'm so glad you're okay!

541
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:30,563
Go on, I'll be sure to catch up with you guys in a bit.

542
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:31,192
What?

543
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,530
Two seconds, I promise.

544
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:33,071
Ugh...

545
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:35,053
Let's go, Ran.

546
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:37,415
Okay... Come with us, Conan.

547
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:38,989
A-All right.

548
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,120
Let's leave them to talk, okay?

549
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:41,930
Yeah...

550
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,704
I'll see ya later, Conan!

551
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:47,774
So, is it true the police got word of a bomb threat?

552
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:51,040
This is the threat email sent
to our offices earlier today.

553
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:54,493
These are images of Karuta cards.

554
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:59,274
We believe those images must be somehow related
to the demonstration they were planning to film.

555
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,837
Why else would they attack Nichiuri TV?

556
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,755
It'll probably be a while before I can
get a chance to take a look inside, huh?

557
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:06,813
It will...

558
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:09,938
What the hell is this guy after?

559
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:19,052
Thank you very much, Doctor.

560
00:27:19,076 --> 00:27:20,376
Of course, take care.

561
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,550
How'd it go in there?

562
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:24,680
Oh, it was nothing really, just a light scratch is all.

563
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:26,034
Thank goodness...

564
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:29,727
I can't believe such a tragedy could
happen right before the competition...

565
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:32,317
I know... Truly I am as shocked as you are.

566
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,321
Unfortunately, this disaster may force
us to cancel the Satsuki Cup this year.

567
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,860
No, you can't!

568
00:27:38,962 --> 00:27:43,087
We have to play! We need to show
the public this hasn't broken us!

569
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:48,219
That's all well and good, but the cards we have always
used for the finals were destroyed the in the explosion.

570
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:50,649
If that's your only fear, then you needn't worry! - Huh?

571
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:51,805
The cards are safe!

572
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:53,220
Huh? But, how?!

573
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:54,578
What are you talking about?

574
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:58,149
Ms. Hiramoto took the Satsuki
deck with her when she evacuated.

575
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,805
M-Mikiko saved them?!

576
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,200
And we really are fortunate.

577
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,550
Because if they'd been destroyed
we'd have no choice but to...

578
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,024
Tell me! Are you absolutely
certain the cards are all right?

579
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,720
Yes! Someone from the museum took them
back. They wanted to check for smoke damage.

580
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:16,399
They're fine! You don't have to
worry about them! You can rest easy.

581
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:20,305
Yes... Yes, that is truly wonderful news, indeed.

582
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,470
But, where is Mikiko? I'd like
to thank her for her quick thinking.

583
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:27,157
She was injured escaping the building.

584
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:27,751
Huh?

585
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,079
I believe she's still in with the doctors...

586
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,563
I see.

587
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,993
It's taking a really long time...

588
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,946
The doctor said he was just gonna give her
first aid, so I hope it's not that bad...

589
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:38,852
Huh?

590
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,675
Mikiko! Don't tell me your arm is...

591
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,938
Yeah. It was broken when the roof caved in.

592
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,740
Maybe it's right I should be punished...

593
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:48,740
Mikiko...

594
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:53,025
No... I put you and Heiji in danger
when I went back for those cards and...

595
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,157
That's not true!

596
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:56,352
I am very proud of what you did in there.

597
00:28:56,805 --> 00:29:00,450
Those cards you saved are the
face of the Satsuki Association.

598
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:05,610
I do not know that I can ever thank you enough,
but know that you have the gratitude of all of us.

599
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:09,329
Of course, sir. I'm just sorry
I can't play with a broken arm...

600
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:13,083
Yes. It is truly a shame that
a player of your exceptional

601
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:16,274
talent and skill won't be able
to show the world what you can do.

602
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,680
However, recovery should be your first and only priority.

603
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:21,251
He's right!

604
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:23,071
You can always compete next year!

605
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:24,673
Next year's too late.

606
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:25,196
Huh?

607
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:30,680
If we don't place well enough in the Satski Cup
this year, then the Karuta Club will have to shut down.

608
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:34,453
I can't let that happen... I just can't...

609
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:35,599
President.

610
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:35,907
Huh?

611
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:37,954
The officers are ready to head out, sir.

612
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:38,813
If you are.

613
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:39,735
Of course...

614
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,454
It's all gonna be okay.

615
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,618
I don't know...

616
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,210
I mean, its true that there's no one else in the club that
would stand a chance aside from you or I but maybe we...

617
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:49,096
That's it!

618
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,402
You have to do it!

619
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:51,075
Huh?!

620
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:54,100
You can play and represent Kaiho Academy in my place!

621
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:56,030
That's a little sudden, Mikiko!

622
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:58,503
But you've never played competitively before, have you?

623
00:29:58,527 --> 00:29:59,562
No, never!

624
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:02,226
You always came to practice with me though, didn't you?

625
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:02,913
Y-Yeah.

626
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:05,280
You're strong and have great reflexes!

627
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:09,300
You're totally fearless and relentless
and you always keep calm under pressure!

628
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:10,311
Uuh...

629
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,700
Plus you're infuriating! It's perfect!

630
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:15,765
I'm not exactly sure that's a
compliment the way you think it is...

631
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,890
When is the competition supposed to be?

632
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,199
Er... They're supposed to play the day after tomorrow...

633
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:20,663
What?

634
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:24,937
You'll be okay! We'll use all the
time we have for nonstop training!

635
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:30,300
You really think an amateur has
any hope of winning the Satsuki Cup?

636
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:34,930
Karuta may be a bit complex for you,
perhaps a game of Go Fish would be better?

637
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:36,640
Don't patronize her!

638
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:40,765
We've practiced together all the time!
I know Kazuha has what it takes to win!

639
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,507
She might not be experienced,
but she's a top tier competitor!

640
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:47,733
Oh... I remember you now.

641
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:52,351
You were the girl who ws standing
at Heiji's side before, weren't you?

642
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:54,667
Though I am curious who you are to him.

643
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:55,233
Huh?!

644
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,890
I've known him since we were
little kids! Heiji's just my...

645
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,585
He's just my...

646
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:01,882
You like him!

647
00:31:02,718 --> 00:31:04,054
Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

648
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,450
You're so in love!

649
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,929
Adults are talking now!

650
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,999
No one would ever know of my love for you...

651
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:09,733
Huh?

652
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:12,760
So you fancy yourself as that poem?

653
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:14,319
Isn't that adorable.

654
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:14,890
Er...

655
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:18,054
Then I supposed this is how it must be.

656
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:22,803
Whosoever should win this competition
shall also win Heiji's love all for herself.

657
00:31:22,983 --> 00:31:25,569
She alone earns the right to confess her heart to him.

658
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:26,081
Uh oh...

659
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:27,210
What do you say?

660
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:29,570
Hold on, you cannot be serious!

661
00:31:29,632 --> 00:31:33,410
If your love is true then I believe that's
something worth fighting for, isn't it?

662
00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:36,952
Kazuha, listen. You don't have to do this, okay?

663
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:38,515
And just so you know.

664
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,726
I don't plan on losing to you.

665
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:44,741
Hold it!

666
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:45,288
Hm?

667
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:47,710
I accept your challenge!

668
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:50,280
You must be joking!

669
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:51,304
She's not!

670
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:55,577
You're passionate! I just hope you
can keep that up for the competition.

671
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:59,273
I'll be fine! How about you just focus on yourself, okay?

672
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:02,085
Actually, I think I'll go and do just that.

673
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:07,023
I was hoping to drop by the nail salon and maybe
think about how I'm going to tell Heiji my feelings!

674
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:10,023
Huh?

675
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:10,460
Um...

676
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,733
She looks a lot scarier now.

677
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:13,242
Yeah.

678
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:14,554
She's really confident!

679
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,148
Wow, that was incredible! Way to
give that girl a piece of your mind!

680
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,454
I guess so.

681
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,210
But I have no idea what I was thinking.

682
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:25,249
Huh?

683
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,824
Ah!

684
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:26,765
Woah, oh!

685
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,062
Oh, I'm so sorry.

686
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:30,148
It's my fault.

687
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,843
Dad, did you find the car key?

688
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,046
Not exactly...

689
00:32:34,296 --> 00:32:37,210
I looked for it everywhere but, no luck.

690
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,430
Really, Dad?

691
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,851
I guess I'll just have to get a spare made.

692
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:43,100
Huh? What's up, Conan?

693
00:32:43,265 --> 00:32:46,569
Momiji must've dropped this when they ran into each other.

694
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:48,530
Oh no! Here, let me see it.

695
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:50,780
Yeah, it's hers all right.

696
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:52,858
I'm gonna go give this back to her!

697
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,952
Hm, wait a sec!

698
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,580
This is terrible. What the heck am I supposed to do?!

699
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,015
Why are you asking me?

700
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,960
She was a little bit scary.

701
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,874
She was so beautiful though!

702
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:06,765
If she tells Heiji she likes him,
he's gonna fall head over heels for...

703
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:10,350
But she's no match for you, Kazuha! Not by a mile!

704
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:11,312
Really?

705
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:12,749
Yeah, totally!

706
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,358
Well, there's no use worrying about it now.
It's time gotta buckle down and start training!

707
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:22,327
Never been to a hospital before!

708
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:24,955
It's so big I feel like I might get lost in it!

709
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,062
Hey Ran! She's right over there!

710
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:30,538
Momiji! Hold on for a second! You dropped your train pass!

711
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:33,601
Momiji!

712
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:37,733
Aw, I was too late... What do we do now?

713
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:39,968
Well, we know her name and her school?

714
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,874
Hey, see if there's anything else inside!

715
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:43,686
Okay.

716
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,296
Do you mind if I take a look at it too?

717
00:33:46,413 --> 00:33:47,085
Sure!

718
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:50,249
Let's see, she's got this picture in here?

719
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,851
Huh?Who is that man?

720
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:54,793
Oh, looks like there's one more.

721
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,030
Wow!

722
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:58,900
It's a picture of her when she was little.

723
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,765
It's Momiji and...

724
00:34:00,977 --> 00:34:02,296
Is that Hattori?

725
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:04,421
They're pinky swearing!

726
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,101
Uh... Think they're promising to get married?

727
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,210
Like Heiji would be that lucky!

728
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,108
Come on, Conan! They're just kids!

729
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,866
You're right, that is silly.

730
00:34:15,257 --> 00:34:17,468
Except I could totally see him doing that.

731
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,460
He'd totally do that.

732
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,093
Huh? It's Heiji's motorcycle!

733
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,655
Let's agree not to mention the photo, okay?

734
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:29,733
And especially not to Kazuha.

735
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:30,616
Yep.

736
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:39,226
Hey! You guys the welcoming committee?

737
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,873
What's wrong? Are you okay?

738
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,608
Ran. So did you manage to catch up to her?

739
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,640
Uh, yeah!

740
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:48,835
Oh, hey!

741
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:49,925
Where have you been?

742
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:50,437
Hm?

743
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:52,749
Did you find out anything interesting?

744
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:56,323
No, the Osaka police are in total chaos.

745
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,398
Inspector Otaki says he'll get in touch as
soon as they find anything worth looking into.

746
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,437
Excuse me, I really think you should take this
call. It sounds like it's actually rather urgent.

747
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:06,745
Yes, of course I will.

748
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,968
That girl.

749
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:10,468
If it's not one thing then it's another with her.

750
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:11,671
Hello, from the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department.

751
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:12,335
Huh?

752
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:16,155
Right, okay. And what about, Mr. Yajima?

753
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:18,468
He was... He was murdered?!

754
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:20,273
Come on.

755
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:20,960
Right!

756
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,304
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

757
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,023
Thank you.

758
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,108
Hey you two, this area is off limits.

759
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:39,116
Right of course it is, but I'm here with Kogoro Mori.

760
00:35:39,499 --> 00:35:40,700
Yeah, I don't think so.

761
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,090
They're alright, let them on through.

762
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,780
Y-Yes, sir.

763
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,640
Long time no see, you two.

764
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:46,265
Ah!

765
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,327
Inspector Ayanokoji!

766
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:52,249
The victim is Mr. Toshiya Yajima.

767
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,179
He's the son of a distinguished
family and he lived here all by himself.

768
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:59,358
He most likely died at around 6AM.

769
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:02,304
But the corpse wasn't found until 2 in the afternoon.

770
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,390
Oh, and you'll want to be careful where you step.

771
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,710
The killer ransacked the place.

772
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:08,851
Y-Yeah.

773
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:09,546
A robbery?

774
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:10,124
Huh?

775
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:14,265
If it was, it's safe to say it
didn't go as planned by the looks of it.

776
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,351
That was our analysis as well.

777
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,749
The murderer likely came in planning to rob
the place, but they ran into Mr. Yajima instead.

778
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:26,077
The killer beat him to death with
the sword he was about to steal.

779
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,858
Then he took the money and made his escape.

780
00:36:30,132 --> 00:36:32,101
Poor man... But why?

781
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,500
The victim was practicing Karuta,
Huh? at the time of the attack.

782
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:36,577
Well observed.

783
00:36:36,624 --> 00:36:39,218
Woah! Hey! What the heck are you two doing here?!

784
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:43,608
Hey there Inspector! We're just gonna
take a little look around if that's okay.

785
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:47,060
Forensics has already finished, so have at it.

786
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:48,858
You're kidding me...

787
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:52,773
Unfortunately we're gonna have
to take the murder weapon with us.

788
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:54,726
No problem, go right ahead.

789
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:58,249
Please stay with the kids until
they're done with their investigation.

790
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:58,890
Sir!

791
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:03,374
I'll be waiting for you just outside, so
let me know if there's anything you might need.

792
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,155
Right.

793
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,812
So what do you think?

794
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,101
There's a whole lot to process
here. Look at his right hand...

795
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,585
Yeah, you noticed the blood stains too?

796
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:18,453
Uh-huh. He must have been holding
something that was already stained.

797
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,468
There's only one thing in the room that's pretty bloody...

798
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:23,233
The Karuta cards.

799
00:37:23,385 --> 00:37:28,515
The murderer must have noticed he was holding a
certain card and tried to hide it amongst the others.

800
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,499
It's gonna be tough to find which one in particular.

801
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:32,726
Well, maybe not.

802
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,437
Hm?

803
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,194
I think I might know someone who can help us.

804
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:38,827
Huh? Hold on.

805
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,569
Based on the blood stains, that remote
must've been really close to the victim.

806
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:47,491
Excuse me. Is it cool if I stand this TV up?

807
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,804
Sure, go ahead.

808
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:49,687
Thanks.

809
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:53,483
If he had the remote in his hands
until just before he was killed...

810
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:54,671
What was he watching?

811
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:58,452
Momiji Ooka?

812
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,390
So he was watching a Karuta match before he died...

813
00:38:01,476 --> 00:38:01,968
Huh?

814
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,827
Hm? What did you find?

815
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:05,898
It looks like a match from a while ago...

816
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,898
Yeah.

817
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:12,262
It says it's, "The 15th to the 20th
High School Satsuki Cup Competitions."

818
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:15,054
I wonder why Yajima would have been watching it...

819
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,702
The finals are known for a very high standard of gameplay.

820
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:24,780
Just watching a player's techniques or the way the cards
are lined up can be an incredibly educational experience.

821
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:27,820
Of course, I doubt it has anything
to do with the murder, though.

822
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:28,796
Wait, but...

823
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,983
But nothing!

824
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:32,210
Shut up, come on you two!

825
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,675
Ugh- Pops wait!

826
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,146
You're done playing detective!

827
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:37,186
We'll get out of your hair! Thank you!

828
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,390
Uh... Very well.

829
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:44,773
Hmm...

830
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:49,335
And now for the news. Today at around 1:00 PM...

831
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:50,983
This news story again?

832
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,882
It's all pretty scary isn't it?

833
00:38:52,983 --> 00:38:55,804
Hey! I was watching that, why would you turn it off?

834
00:38:55,983 --> 00:39:00,124
Every time the news gets scary, you get
anxious and I don't want you to have a breakdown.

835
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,077
I suppose...

836
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:03,460
You did get in touch with the children, didn't you?

837
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,007
I've been trying but Shinichi
still hasn't called me back yet!

838
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:07,968
Oh?

839
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:09,410
Huh?

840
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:12,054
Well, right on cue. See?

841
00:39:12,218 --> 00:39:14,410
Lovely. I can talk to him when you're finished.

842
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:14,835
Yeah.

843
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:19,702
It's about time. What were you thinking
not calling us as soon as you were safe?

844
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,687
Doc was really worried about you.

845
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,124
Yeah, sorry. It's been a little busy around here...

846
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:26,920
So, what did you call for?

847
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:29,796
I just emailed you a few photos a little while ago.

848
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,983
I want you to take a look at
the Karuta cards on the floor.

849
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,476
Huh?

850
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:35,882
First a bomb at the TV station,

851
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:38,327
and now blood-smeared Karuta cards?

852
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,593
I was hoping you could identify which
of those cards our victim was holding.

853
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,577
The boring stuff's your forte right?

854
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:46,007
Huh? Hmph.

855
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:47,108
You're boring.

856
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:50,765
Huh? There's a picture of a person in here.

857
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,858
Yeah, I'd like you to check out him too.

858
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,265
Is he a Karuta player?

859
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,866
I'm pretty sure he is.

860
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:02,069
I'll see what I can do. Give me a little time.

861
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:04,171
Thanks, I'm counting on you!

862
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:04,753
See ya!

863
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,812
Wait a second!

864
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,950
Doc wants..!

865
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:08,249
Ooh...

866
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:13,148
It's starting to look like they're intentionally
targeting members of the Satsuki Association.

867
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,499
Yeah, there's at least two potentials.

868
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:19,632
I can watch Mr. Achiwa. He's
staying at the same hotel as us.

869
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:22,765
And I'll keep an eye on Momiji Ooka.

870
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:23,773
Huh?

871
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:27,069
Stop right there! What are you doing here?

872
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:29,655
I'm a member of the Association, I have to get in!

873
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:32,530
Stay right there, sir! I'll need to see some verification.

874
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:33,382
There you are!

875
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:33,800
Huh?

876
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:35,765
Where the hell have you been, Sekine?!

877
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,214
I must have had you called hours ago!

878
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,530
I am so sorry, sir!

879
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,576
I kinda went out drinking last night,

880
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,397
must've overdone it and passed out
before I got my phone plugged in and charged.

881
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:46,537
Seriously?

882
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:52,710
And then when I woke up I saw the news about the
explosion down at the station. I called the association

883
00:40:52,788 --> 00:40:54,874
and they said you were at Yajima's looking for me.

884
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:58,382
I rushed over, but it is absolute chaos getting here, sir.

885
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,976
What's with all the cops? Is... Is everything all right?

886
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:05,593
I'm afraid that... Mr. Yajima has been murdered.

887
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:06,952
Wait, what?!

888
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:11,718
It seems that he was attacked by a thief. And
was killed with the sword he kept in the hallway.

889
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:14,054
The katana... Oh god.

890
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,304
Mr. Achiwa, who is this?

891
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:17,702
Sorry, Inspector.

892
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,632
I work as a cameraman for the Satsuki Association.

893
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:22,312
The names Koji Sekine.

894
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,835
And also, Mr. Yajima's foremost rival.

895
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:29,585
As a matter of fact, they faced off against each
other in the finals of the last two competitions.

896
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:34,476
And I couldn't pull off the win in either one. I
was really hoping that this was gonna be my year...

897
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:37,390
Guess I'll never get my rematch now, huh...

898
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:41,655
So after everything that's happened today,
do you still plan to hold the competition?

899
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:45,023
Well to be perfectly honest, I
have no idea what we should do.

900
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,819
Sir, you can't be serious!

901
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:50,179
Just think about how it would
look! Yajima was just beaten to death!

902
00:41:50,312 --> 00:41:54,194
There's no way you can call it off after
that. He would insist that we play on!

903
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:56,866
You might want to watch what you say, Mr. Sekine.

904
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,530
Sorry... Didn't mean to overstep...

905
00:41:59,796 --> 00:42:03,640
I'm Inspector Ayanokoji, detective with the Kyoto Police.

906
00:42:03,685 --> 00:42:06,476
If you have a moment, there are
few questions we'd like to ask.

907
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:08,601
Yeah, of course. What ever you need.

908
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,240
This way, please.

909
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,170
Uh, yes sir.

910
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:13,167
Well Inspector, if we're done here, I think,

911
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:13,968
Hey Kudo,

912
00:42:14,124 --> 00:42:15,763
I think I know who the perp is.

913
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:16,952
So do I.

914
00:42:18,218 --> 00:42:20,812
Koji definitely killed Mr. Yajima.

915
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:25,382
But what we don't have yet is a trace of evidence
that can tie him to the bombing of the station,

916
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:27,390
targeting the Satsuki Association.

917
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:28,163
Not yet.

918
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,351
But I think you're on the right track with
Achiwa and Momiji Ooka. We should keep tabs on them.

919
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,280
Yeah.

920
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:40,620
First place!

921
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:41,507
Second!

922
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,170
No fair! Wait for me!

923
00:42:44,326 --> 00:42:46,976
Wow, look at this place! It's incredible!

924
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:48,999
Sonoko made the reservation.

925
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:52,310
But, I think it's because she wanted to come too.

926
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:56,062
There's no way we would have been able to
book somewhere this close to the station.

927
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:58,593
Only the best for Suzuki Financial.

928
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,601
That's right, thank you.

929
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:05,968
She'll be practicing all night,
so grab her some midight snacks.

930
00:43:06,286 --> 00:43:07,726
Thanks for everything.

931
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:11,909
Aw man. Why do I do all this stuff for them?

932
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,968
I really enjoyed watching you go
all out rooting for your friends...

933
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,765
I guess it's okay.

934
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,898
Let the training begin!

935
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:23,744
Hey, we wanna help out!

936
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:26,550
So if there's anything we can do, just let us know!

937
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:28,290
Cause we've got your back Kazuha!

938
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,069
How sweet!

939
00:43:29,115 --> 00:43:30,335
You guys are great.

940
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:31,054
Huh?

941
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,039
That's me.

942
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:33,460
Who's calling you?

943
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,558
Oh it's from Doc!

944
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:34,882
Oh!

945
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:36,220
I want to talk to him, too!

946
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,680
Yeah, let's all get on the call!

947
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,405
Okay, we're gonna take this!

948
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,437
You guys start training, we'll be right back!

949
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:44,132
We'll go over there so we don't bother you!

950
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,366
This is, totally got my back, huh?

951
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,991
They mean well.

952
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,812
There, I can see you now! Is
everybody all right after what happened?

953
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,515
Yeah!

954
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,679
We're A-Okay!

955
00:43:55,704 --> 00:43:57,077
We're at the hotel now!

956
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,160
Well! That's good timing.

957
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,566
Huh?

958
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,319
Oh no.

959
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,687
Ta-daa! It's time!

960
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:04,898
To play Doc's quiz corner!

961
00:44:05,538 --> 00:44:07,858
Is that really why you called us?

962
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:09,097
Here goes!

963
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:12,937
Karuta is a game where you race
to pick up cards off the ground.

964
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,093
And that movement is strikingly
similar to what traditional,

965
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:17,921
Japanese activity?

966
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:21,530
One: Picking tea leaves. Two: Flying a kite.

967
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:25,444
Three: Pounding mochi. Or four: Harvesting rice.

968
00:44:25,974 --> 00:44:29,452
Grabbing cards is like picking tea so maybe the first one?

969
00:44:29,523 --> 00:44:32,265
Maybe... It's flying a kite?

970
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:34,866
You do slap the cards down like pounding mochi?

971
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:36,988
I need your final answer!

972
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,851
Four, harvesting rice.

973
00:44:38,954 --> 00:44:39,974
That's cheating, Ai!

974
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,952
Grabbing the cards looks very
similar to picking rice in a field.

975
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:43,843
She's right!

976
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:44,468
I get it!

977
00:44:44,493 --> 00:44:45,452
Wah? Huh?

978
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,788
You know what? You're no fun!

979
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:48,191
Woah!

980
00:44:48,215 --> 00:44:49,077
Hey you guys,

981
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,187
Don't stay up too late just
because you're on a trip, okay?

982
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,288
Okay!

983
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,101
I'm hanging up now.

984
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:57,238
Bye!

985
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,538
I didn't realize how late it was!

986
00:45:00,343 --> 00:45:02,374
Dad and the others are running late...

987
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:04,773
I wonder if Heiji is still with them too?

988
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,507
If you're worried about him, then why don't you just call?

989
00:45:07,616 --> 00:45:09,726
Uh, maybe I should...

990
00:45:13,905 --> 00:45:14,429
Hm?

991
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,110
Hey! What's up, Kazuha?

992
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:17,331
What does that mean?

993
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:17,710
Huh?

994
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,827
Where could you be this late at night?

995
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,640
What? You're where?!

996
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:23,077
In Kyoto..?

997
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:27,192
Sorry. I've got some stuff to take care of.
You should probably head on home without me.

998
00:45:27,273 --> 00:45:31,804
You can't be serious! I thought you
could help me with my Karuta training...

999
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:32,830
Your training?

1000
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,601
I'm entering the competition.
Someone has to take Mikiko's place.

1001
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,468
You've never played at that level before, have you?

1002
00:45:39,546 --> 00:45:41,590
Which would be why I'm training, dummy.

1003
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,429
You were really good at Karuta way
back when you were a kid, remember?

1004
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,148
Now that you mention it, I do remember playing in
elementary school, but that was just for fun, though.

1005
00:45:51,286 --> 00:45:54,866
You came out of nowhere and won
the whole thing! I was so surprised!

1006
00:45:55,597 --> 00:45:57,694
Well I don't know if I remember that happening...

1007
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,179
Maybe not, but I definitely do!

1008
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:06,398
When Mikiko asked me to join, the very first
thing I thought about was you winning that contest.

1009
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:07,917
Oh? Cool.

1010
00:46:07,941 --> 00:46:08,405
Huh?

1011
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,288
Well anyway, I've got some stuff
going on here, so I gotta split.

1012
00:46:11,398 --> 00:46:13,171
What the hell's wrong with you!?

1013
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,374
Huh?Are you really that desprate
to get off the phone with me?

1014
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,866
Pretty sure, that's not what I said?

1015
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:21,437
You know what, go. I'll be fine without you.

1016
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:22,898
Wait, what's wrong?

1017
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,960
You idiot! Just go already!

1018
00:46:25,251 --> 00:46:25,780
Huh?

1019
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:29,507
How is that boy so infuriating?!

1020
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:33,601
What the hell is up with that girl?

1021
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:36,648
Guess I can try to help...

1022
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:42,452
Hey, it's me. I've got a little favor to ask.

1023
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,148
Exactly, heh... Thanks.

1024
00:46:46,398 --> 00:46:48,874
Oh man, I'm exhausted.

1025
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,421
Look who made it back!

1026
00:46:51,264 --> 00:46:56,085
When you guys roped me into coming here,
I had no idea there'd be a case involved.

1027
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:57,305
Ugh...

1028
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,510
Uh, Dad... Where's Conan?

1029
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,866
I don't know.

1030
00:47:00,937 --> 00:47:03,400
I gave him a ride back to the hotel but,

1031
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,608
As soon as we got in, he decided he
needed to talk to Mr. Achiwa right away.

1032
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:11,304
Huh? Wow... Wonder what he's up to.

1033
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:16,601
If Koji's really the perp, Mr. Achiwa
probably won't be targeted tonight.

1034
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:17,608
Hm...

1035
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:20,077
Huh?

1036
00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:24,710
Is everything okay, Ran?

1037
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:26,054
Are you finished yet?

1038
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,202
Uh, sort of?

1039
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,194
Then, hurry back to the room, okay?

1040
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,605
I mean, with everything going on I...

1041
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:32,040
Right.

1042
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:33,655
Gotcha, on my way!

1043
00:47:40,279 --> 00:47:43,655
Perfect. Now I can keep track of him even if he heads out.

1044
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:44,398
Huh?

1045
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:45,930
Isn't that..?

1046
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:48,819
What's she doing here?

1047
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:53,655
Our sleeves were wet with tears...

1048
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,726
Hup!

1049
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:56,608
Woah! Ah..

1050
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,757
Wow! She's really good!

1051
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,280
I don't think I can be your partner...

1052
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,444
Watch where you're tossing those
things! You could've killed me!

1053
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,350
I'm back!

1054
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,241
Hey Conan!

1055
00:48:07,491 --> 00:48:09,929
And I brought along an excellent assistant.

1056
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:12,042
Huh?

1057
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:12,562
What?

1058
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,843
Who's she?

1059
00:48:14,173 --> 00:48:16,937
Huh? That's Heiji's mother...

1060
00:48:17,624 --> 00:48:21,210
Heiji told me about you, so I decided to lend a hand.

1061
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:22,694
But, why?

1062
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:23,968
Oh uh... Hmm.

1063
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:25,023
Huh?

1064
00:48:26,265 --> 00:48:30,187
It sounds like you need some help.
I hear you've been practicing Karuta.

1065
00:48:30,257 --> 00:48:31,858
Yes ma'am, but...

1066
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,515
I shall serve as your partner.

1067
00:48:34,108 --> 00:48:37,749
Though a former queen like
myself may not be much assistance.

1068
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,124
Former queen?

1069
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:41,179
This is a favor for my son.

1070
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:45,241
And for him I will be happy to
teach you all I know about the cards.

1071
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:49,265
But since there isn't much time to
waste, I will not be going easy on you.

1072
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:51,249
Will you accept my help?

1073
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,608
Yes. I'll learn anything you can teach!

1074
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,796
I thought you'd come, Inspector Ayanokoji.

1075
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:08,960
We think alike. Great minds often do.

1076
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,952
Guess so.

1077
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:13,030
The little detective has decided
not to join you this evening?

1078
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:15,233
He's busy keeping tabs on Mr. Achiwa.

1079
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,452
Oh, I see. The two of you make quite the team.

1080
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,077
Honestly, I'm starting to think
I got the raw end of this bargain.

1081
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,874
When I volunteered, I didn't think Miss
Ooka would be living in a freaking mansion.

1082
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:27,970
Hm?

1083
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:29,054
Huh?

1084
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:34,429
Uh...

1085
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:36,483
It's lovely weather this evening.

1086
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,870
It... certainly is...

1087
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:42,327
Pardon, my name is Iori, and I am the
personal servant of Miss Momiji Ooka.

1088
00:49:42,757 --> 00:49:43,200
Hm...

1089
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:45,429
I thought you might enjoy a cup of tea.

1090
00:49:51,877 --> 00:49:54,100
You must have been worried about me.

1091
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,366
My future husband.

1092
00:50:07,014 --> 00:50:12,154
Though wet through and wet again,
do not so change their colors...

1093
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:12,960
Oh, no!

1094
00:50:13,614 --> 00:50:15,499
Guess he hasn't left the hotel yet...

1095
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,968
The waves are gathered...

1096
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:20,491
You're pretty good.

1097
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:23,569
I thought you would have given in ages ago, Kazuha.

1098
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,355
Why don't we take a short
break, and you can get some rest?

1099
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,155
No... Let's keep going!

1100
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:30,428
Training requires rest.

1101
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,014
I believe I'll go downstairs and get something to eat.

1102
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,124
Ah... Kazuha!

1103
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,554
Are you okay?

1104
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:46,514
Let her sleep a while.

1105
00:50:47,202 --> 00:50:49,608
She's been training with all she has.

1106
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:51,350
And, how did she do?

1107
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:53,835
Far better than I anticipated.

1108
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,085
I don't doubt that she'll make it into the top
four. But reaching the finals is another matter entirely.

1109
00:50:59,178 --> 00:50:59,983
Oh, no.

1110
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,694
Don't worry yet. There is still much we can do.

1111
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:09,077
I said it would be difficult but I didn't say impossible.

1112
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:14,186
The most important things in competitive
Karuta are mental strength and concentration.

1113
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,788
She has both.

1114
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:20,850
If she focuses on the game, and the
game alone, I believe she could win.

1115
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,061
I can't show this to her then...
She'd never get it out of her head.

1116
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,905
This will be over soon, so please be patient.

1117
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:36,538
Yeah, I can try, but frankly I've got somewhere to be.

1118
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:39,327
So come on, what do you guys actually want from me?

1119
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,132
I have some questions about Mr. Yajima's murder.

1120
00:51:42,341 --> 00:51:44,483
It... was a robbery gone wrong, right?

1121
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,671
Or was it?

1122
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,405
Huh?

1123
00:51:46,912 --> 00:51:51,100
My powers of deduction reveal,
this was premeditated murder.

1124
00:51:51,196 --> 00:51:52,156
Hang on!

1125
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,054
Look, Yajima was a jerk, everybody knows that.

1126
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,108
Even still, I can't imagine
anyone wanting to kill the guy?

1127
00:51:58,171 --> 00:51:59,180
Well, what about you?

1128
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,430
That's crazy! Why the hell would I do that?

1129
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,149
Mr. Sekine.

1130
00:52:02,173 --> 00:52:02,538
Huh?

1131
00:52:02,929 --> 00:52:05,897
You've lost the Satsuki Cup for two years in a row.

1132
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:08,858
Both times to Mr. Yajima in the finals.

1133
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:11,624
If he were suddenly out of the picture...

1134
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:13,050
Then you would...

1135
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,093
Then I would what? Cut the crap!

1136
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,561
Yes of course I want to win!

1137
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,600
But that sure as hell doesn't mean I'm gonna
go around killing everyone who's ever beaten me!

1138
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:24,054
Besides, the police said it was a robbery! So back off!

1139
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:25,600
Let me walk you through it.

1140
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,054
Huh?

1141
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:29,796
First, the way the house was ransacked was inconsistent.

1142
00:52:30,306 --> 00:52:34,225
What he means is the robber didn't
touch anything that was connected to Karuta.

1143
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:38,741
The guy just killed someone. You really
think he's gonna be acting rationally?

1144
00:52:39,108 --> 00:52:40,163
Maybe not.

1145
00:52:40,608 --> 00:52:47,585
Or maybe the killer loved Karuta. So much so that he
couldn't bring himself to damage the cards in any way.

1146
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:51,491
You detectives sure do come up
with some wild ideas don't you?

1147
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,100
But, go ahead and feel free to
make up whatever story you like.

1148
00:52:55,263 --> 00:52:55,874
Uh...

1149
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,507
Guess away!

1150
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,710
Doesn't change the fact that I'm innocent. Crap!

1151
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,970
Th-There's one more thing!

1152
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,267
Yeah? What's that?

1153
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:04,853
That floor of the hallway. It creaks.

1154
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,525
Or maybe you don't remember. It's actually pretty loud.

1155
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,626
Okay?

1156
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,478
So loud in fact...

1157
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:14,642
I don't think anyone could
enter without Mr. Yajima knowing.

1158
00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:17,947
And yet, but body showed no signs of any struggle.

1159
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:22,369
I see. You're trying to say the intruder
must have been an acquaintance of Yajima's.

1160
00:53:22,595 --> 00:53:27,447
But you're wrong there. Even during
practice, a deep concentration is essential.

1161
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,119
In that state, hearing anything
but the reader is next to impossible.

1162
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,533
And that is the simple truth. Yajima
didn't notice until it was far too late.

1163
00:53:35,663 --> 00:53:36,712
Wrong again.

1164
00:53:37,087 --> 00:53:40,455
The blow that killed Mr. Yajima
was in the middle of his head.

1165
00:53:41,478 --> 00:53:45,205
If he didn't notice anyone coming
in and he continued to play...

1166
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:49,462
The wound would've been on the
back of his head. Or perhaps the side.

1167
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:52,985
In other words, unless Mr. Yajima knew his killer,

1168
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,595
he would never have had the wound he did.

1169
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,814
So here are the facts as they
stand. He wouldn't have a solid alibi,

1170
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,150
he'd have to know Yajima and about Karuta...

1171
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:05,767
Moreover, it must have been someone
who would benefit from his demise.

1172
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,931
Hmm... It sounds like I fit the bill perfectly.

1173
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:14,376
But, it's just speculation. There's no evidence.

1174
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,720
If you wanna pin this murder on me,
you're going to need a lot more than that.

1175
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:19,236
Hm?

1176
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,923
Excuse me, Mr. Sekine? It's time to go!

1177
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:23,736
Yeah, I'm coming!

1178
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:27,236
You heard the man. Your time's up, see ya.

1179
00:54:27,353 --> 00:54:29,572
One final question before you go.

1180
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:32,189
Oh, fine. What is it?

1181
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,908
You said something that bothered
me, although I'm not sure you remember.

1182
00:54:37,853 --> 00:54:39,800
Yajima was just beaten to death!

1183
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:43,920
There's no way you can call it off after
that! He would insist that we play on!

1184
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,939
Yajima was killed with a sword.

1185
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:51,478
We said so at the scene. Most people
would assume he had been slashed.

1186
00:54:51,603 --> 00:54:54,470
Not you. You used the word "beaten."

1187
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,767
The murder weapon was rusty and never left it's sheath.

1188
00:54:58,205 --> 00:54:59,892
The murderer would have known that.

1189
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,869
Just like you knew he was beaten to death.

1190
00:55:03,064 --> 00:55:05,986
That's because, I saw the body at the scene!

1191
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:06,869
We're done!

1192
00:55:06,946 --> 00:55:10,806
Too bad the body was covered, just before you arrived.

1193
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:14,494
There's no way you could've seen it... Not then.

1194
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:19,939
So maybe I didn't..! Must have seen something else!

1195
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:24,353
I guess I could tell from the way the blood
was spattered that he was beaten instead of cut!

1196
00:55:24,673 --> 00:55:28,392
Who cares? I told you that I
was innocent! Now leave me alone!

1197
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,259
Now that we got him on the
ropes, I wonder what he's gonna do?

1198
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,471
All we can do now is wait.

1199
00:55:35,678 --> 00:55:37,698
And focus on the contest hall.

1200
00:55:37,979 --> 00:55:41,884
Correct. I just checked on it.
There's gonna be trouble for sure.

1201
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,306
Boy, it sure is massive huh...

1202
00:55:44,672 --> 00:55:47,720
Wait, what's that building on the side of the cliff?

1203
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:49,376
It's called the Satsukido.

1204
00:55:49,884 --> 00:55:50,978
After his wife?

1205
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,791
That's right. It's a tower Mr. Achiwa had
constructed in remembrance of his late wife.

1206
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:57,892
It seems to go unused most of the year.

1207
00:55:58,142 --> 00:56:02,017
Says here that it's only used once
a year for the Satsuki Cup Finals.

1208
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:06,595
Mr. Achiwa is the reader and only he
and the finalists are allowed inside.

1209
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,330
Exactly, there's no live audience to witness the match.

1210
00:56:10,439 --> 00:56:15,970
They have a camera and microphones recording the whole
thing and then transmit it to an exclusive viewing hall.

1211
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,961
That's actually kind of rad.

1212
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:23,040
The temperature and humidity in the competition
hall, are kept stable by an HVAC system.

1213
00:56:23,407 --> 00:56:29,353
On top of that, the soundproof walls that surround
the building keep any outside noise from coming in.

1214
00:56:29,563 --> 00:56:31,744
It's all top of the line of course.

1215
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:36,585
And build exclusively for Karuta... There's
nothing like it anywhere else in the world.

1216
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,312
I'm getting hungry.

1217
00:56:45,453 --> 00:56:46,796
Let's go to the Buffet then!

1218
00:56:46,831 --> 00:56:48,648
I could really go for some cake!

1219
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:51,132
The kids and I are gonna go hit the town. Alright?

1220
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,649
Okay, have fun!

1221
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,148
Mm!

1222
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:54,711
We're ready to go Ran!

1223
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:56,399
Time to head out and see the city!

1224
00:56:56,424 --> 00:56:57,685
We'll be back later tonight!

1225
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,274
Bye!

1226
00:56:58,427 --> 00:56:59,571
We'll see you later!

1227
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,094
Sorry, I'm ready to go!

1228
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,391
Let's shop for souvenirs!

1229
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:05,078
Oh, Mrs. Hattori! Let's get started!

1230
00:57:05,211 --> 00:57:06,672
Such enthusiasm.

1231
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,735
But you're still not yet rested.
You must save some energy for the game.

1232
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,260
But, I'm fine! Really!

1233
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,540
No way, you've gotta be joking! You seriously
got a former queen to be your practice partner?

1234
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,570
Sure did!

1235
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:21,789
Awesome! You might actually stand a chance after all!

1236
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,438
Heh! Let's hope! But the only
way to know is with more practice!

1237
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,102
If you're looking to get some extra practice in, Hm?

1238
00:57:28,399 --> 00:57:30,660
I'd be more than happy to play a round with you?

1239
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,672
But even with my help, I'm not sure
you'll be able to make it to the finals.

1240
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:37,802
How dare you!

1241
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:38,555
Huh?

1242
00:57:39,203 --> 00:57:41,172
Get some rest, Kazuha.

1243
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,172
But I...

1244
00:57:42,314 --> 00:57:45,883
If you require practice, I'd be more than happy to oblige.

1245
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:50,352
Wait, you're Shizuka Ikenami! Did
you come to help teach her Karuta?

1246
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:53,375
No matter. I offer you my help as well.

1247
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:57,227
If you insist Ms. Ikenami... It
would certainly be my pleasure.

1248
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:04,086
Got any intel yet?

1249
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:09,469
After this, the President and Mr. Sekine are going
to Achiwa Hall to rehearse for tomorrow's competition.

1250
00:58:10,601 --> 00:58:14,289
They've got a solid police escort,
so they should be fine from here on.

1251
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:17,274
At least, until they're inside the hall, anyways.

1252
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:19,062
What about Momiji?

1253
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:23,125
Don't worry. Her house is in Kyoto,
so she's gonna head over with them.

1254
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:24,852
Huh?

1255
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,235
Just a sec.

1256
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,266
I tracked down the ID of the man in that picture.

1257
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,961
Definitely wasn't easy...

1258
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,461
Really? Who is it?

1259
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,844
Well, it might surprise you.

1260
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,602
I just sent you the details.

1261
00:58:38,071 --> 00:58:39,325
Let me know if you got it.

1262
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,567
Thanks! One more thing.

1263
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:40,961
Hm?

1264
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,711
What about the Karuta cards?

1265
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,461
Just got them imported to the analysis software.

1266
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,274
I should know which card he was holding in about an hour.

1267
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,344
The system's compiling the data now.

1268
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,492
That's great. Then give me a call
back as soon as the analysis is complete.

1269
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:55,164
Right...

1270
00:58:57,694 --> 00:58:58,735
Bye Conan.

1271
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:00,899
Huh...

1272
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,055
Shikao Nagoro...

1273
00:59:03,464 --> 00:59:04,180
What the?

1274
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:08,560
It's been a while since I've had so much fun. Thank you.

1275
00:59:09,477 --> 00:59:10,469
Let's go, Iori.

1276
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,289
Right.

1277
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:14,110
You know, you really do have some courage.

1278
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:14,594
Huh?

1279
00:59:14,906 --> 00:59:18,688
Honestly, I'm impressed an amateur
would even think to play at this level.

1280
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,344
It almost makes sense. My name means autumn leaf,

1281
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:25,383
while Kazuha is a leaf in it's most simple form.

1282
00:59:25,547 --> 00:59:26,961
But.. But I...

1283
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,805
That's quite enough young lady.

1284
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:33,516
And I promise I won't be going easy on
you! That's a mistake I've made once before.

1285
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:37,805
I took an amateur lightly, and
I underestimated their talents.

1286
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,156
It was just awful. I was so embarrassed.

1287
00:59:42,553 --> 00:59:45,685
So that's why... I'm going to face
with you with everything I've got!

1288
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,805
Ugh... Good! I want you to!

1289
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,867
Please, I think that's enough Karuta talk for one day.

1290
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,985
In any case, are you sure it's okay that you're here?

1291
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,071
The President must be worried about you.

1292
00:59:56,102 --> 00:59:59,571
Your concern is touching...
But I am fine exactly where I am.

1293
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,844
Honestly, I feel safe anywhere.

1294
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:04,769
Now that I know Heiji Hattori will be watching over me.

1295
01:00:04,828 --> 01:00:06,625
Just what do you mean by that?!

1296
01:00:06,742 --> 01:00:09,380
Goodness, of course, I imagine you wouldn't know.

1297
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:11,774
Heiji's become my new private bodyguard.

1298
01:00:12,047 --> 01:00:13,150
What?!

1299
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,110
He was keeping watch at my house all evening. I'd
wager the poor dear didn't even get a wink of sleep!

1300
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:22,016
I simply cannot wait for the contest tomorrow.

1301
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:23,780
Best of luck to you little Miss Leaf.

1302
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,102
Heiji, I must have underestimated you!

1303
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,492
Hey, it's okay! You're way stronger than she is!

1304
01:00:31,517 --> 01:00:32,344
Heiji!

1305
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:35,586
I don't know what kind of relationship
you think you have with this girl,

1306
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,453
but she's dead meat in this Karuta contest!

1307
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,852
Do you hear me? Dead meat!!

1308
01:00:42,378 --> 01:00:44,047
Well said indeed.

1309
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,596
What is it?

1310
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,588
I don't know, but I just felt a
chill shoot straight down my spine!

1311
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,753
Um... Did you catch a cold or something?

1312
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,932
No, it's way worse than that.

1313
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:57,909
Like something demonic..!

1314
01:00:58,106 --> 01:00:58,823
Oh...

1315
01:00:59,649 --> 01:01:00,236
Huh?

1316
01:01:00,312 --> 01:01:00,901
Oh..!

1317
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,753
Hey, here they come.

1318
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:04,862
President Achiwa.

1319
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,542
Momiji Ooka.

1320
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,010
And Sekine.

1321
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,612
They're all here.

1322
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:24,124
Woah!

1323
01:01:24,218 --> 01:01:24,831
Aah!!

1324
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,698
Ugh... Another explosion?!

1325
01:01:32,915 --> 01:01:34,463
That was Sekine's car!

1326
01:01:39,346 --> 01:01:41,745
All right, how's Mr. Sekine doing?

1327
01:01:41,944 --> 01:01:45,824
The last we heard from the hospital,
he still hasn't regained consciousness.

1328
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,784
His chance of recovery is 50-50.

1329
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:53,557
And Miss Ooka was also caught in the
explosion. Was she brought to the hospital as well?

1330
01:01:53,635 --> 01:01:55,213
It seems she wasn't hurt.

1331
01:01:55,409 --> 01:01:59,940
But she and her driver went to the hospital
to get checked out. Just to be on the safe side.

1332
01:02:00,674 --> 01:02:03,280
We've had two bombing attacks in as many days.

1333
01:02:03,331 --> 01:02:07,120
Frankly, Mr. Achiwa, I think it's
time you fill us in. Wouldn't you agree?

1334
01:02:07,299 --> 01:02:07,854
Huh?

1335
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:10,221
The evidence all leads to one conclusion.

1336
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,760
The bombing at Nichiuri was likely an
attempt to target the Satsuki Association.

1337
01:02:15,161 --> 01:02:16,361
Hmm...

1338
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,968
Excuse me, sir.

1339
01:02:17,992 --> 01:02:18,330
Hm?

1340
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:20,862
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

1341
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,323
H-How did you get your hands on that picture?

1342
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,464
That hardly matters. It's time to stop hiding things.

1343
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:31,956
We've given you the benefit of the doubt, but this
is the moment for you to come clean. Let's hear it.

1344
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:37,424
I guess it is... Some time ago,
there was a Karuta Club in Kyoto.

1345
01:02:37,948 --> 01:02:41,737
A small group of 20 or so
exceptionally talented players...

1346
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,385
They would gather each month to learn and train.

1347
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:48,713
And the one leading that club,
was a master named Shikao Nagoro.

1348
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:50,510
He was quite skilled.

1349
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:55,135
Many assumed it was only a matter of
time before he became a champion himself.

1350
01:02:55,632 --> 01:02:58,581
The problem was that he was solely fixated on winning.

1351
01:02:58,886 --> 01:03:02,596
His style of Karuta was not exactly
what any player would call refined.

1352
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:05,260
Son of a... Hey!

1353
01:03:05,506 --> 01:03:08,120
Give me that card! I was faster, damn it!

1354
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:11,432
Why the hell was I penalized! What are you, blind?!

1355
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,667
It was five years ago...

1356
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:18,838
Nagoro... He wanted to play in a competition,
just so he could go up against my late wife.

1357
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,987
The condition was the losing side would close their club.

1358
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:25,110
Seriously? All this over a card game?

1359
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:29,010
But Satsuki certainly wasn't obligated
to accept the challenge, was she?

1360
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,088
Mr. Nagoro went straight to the media...

1361
01:03:31,253 --> 01:03:35,221
He made a number of statements that would
have made it difficult for Satsuki to refuse.

1362
01:03:36,057 --> 01:03:39,893
He said our Association would
avoid the challenge out of fear...

1363
01:03:40,073 --> 01:03:44,920
So what you're telling us is that, your wife
accepted this challenge under duress, is that right?

1364
01:03:45,026 --> 01:03:47,573
Then what? I assum Satsuki was the victor?

1365
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,213
It was never meant to come to pass, I'm afraid.

1366
01:03:50,238 --> 01:03:50,792
Huh?

1367
01:03:50,944 --> 01:03:54,713
Everything was set up, but
Mr. Nagoro himself never arrived.

1368
01:03:55,503 --> 01:03:59,456
As a result, Satsuki was declared the victor by default.

1369
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:04,385
In the end, Nagoro was labeled as a coward
who brought shame to the world of Karuta.

1370
01:04:04,617 --> 01:04:07,878
Even though he was the one who
started this whole media circus...

1371
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,901
He vanished, never to be seen again.

1372
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,479
Interesting, if he disappeared what
happened to the rest of the Nagoro club?

1373
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:18,424
Once their President disappeared, their club disbanded.

1374
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,221
Without a force to lead them,
most of their players scattered.

1375
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:26,674
All right sir, come clean with us. All of this
is based on some grudge against your association?

1376
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:27,823
It's possible.

1377
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:32,620
Back when this rivalry began, the most
outspoken proponent of closing the Nagoro Club...

1378
01:04:32,712 --> 01:04:35,018
Was the recently deceased Mr. Yajima...

1379
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,549
Huh?

1380
01:04:35,574 --> 01:04:36,354
Excuse me?

1381
01:04:36,658 --> 01:04:40,792
The Satsuki Association wanted to settle
things peacefully without a big fuss.

1382
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:43,307
But it seems little was meant to go our way.

1383
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:46,612
So then, what happened ot the members of the Nagoro Club?

1384
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:51,182
After all they'd been through, we were glad
to offer them membership to our organization.

1385
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:53,690
However, only two chose to accept.

1386
01:04:53,885 --> 01:04:56,167
And let me guess just who those two are...

1387
01:04:56,346 --> 01:04:59,292
Yes... Momiji Ooka and Mr. Sekine.

1388
01:04:59,823 --> 01:05:02,420
The very same ones caught up in the bombing incident?

1389
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,807
Yes. Each were devoted to him.

1390
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:09,268
Momiji Ooka was Nagoro's most
dedicated student. She was his protege.

1391
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:13,924
In fact, Momiji and her master
both favor the exact same cards.

1392
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:17,292
When one with a maple leaf appears
on the board, they would never miss.

1393
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:19,456
She and Sekine were without a doubt,

1394
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:21,283
Nagoro's fiercest disciples.

1395
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:24,995
Why do you think Nagoro's students
are so well trained with the maple cards?

1396
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,220
I hear it's because Nagoro's first name is Shikao.

1397
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,495
As in, deer meat?

1398
01:05:29,533 --> 01:05:32,703
Exactly. "Momiji" is another
word that shares that meaning.

1399
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:37,026
I'm sure Nagoro can't have been very
happy about losing his most promising student.

1400
01:05:37,135 --> 01:05:40,026
Especially not to his rivals in the Satsuki Association.

1401
01:05:40,193 --> 01:05:42,440
So the question is, why seek revenge now?

1402
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:47,055
And more to the point. Why would he then
want to warn his targets about the bombing?

1403
01:05:47,323 --> 01:05:48,784
This is just speculation...

1404
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:51,635
But if he's been radio silent for five years now,

1405
01:05:51,893 --> 01:05:56,143
maybe that was less of a warning and more an
announcement of his return to the spotlight.

1406
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:57,885
If that's the case...

1407
01:05:58,133 --> 01:05:59,695
we should proceed
under the assumption,

1408
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,211
that this is Nagoro's attempt to
take revenge on the Satsuki Association.

1409
01:06:03,689 --> 01:06:04,268
Hm?

1410
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:06,554
Huh? Excuse me.

1411
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:07,921
What is it?

1412
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,913
Yes. We should establish a joint
investigation headquarters with the Kyoto Police.

1413
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:13,913
Right.

1414
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:14,609
What?!

1415
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:15,523
Huh?

1416
01:06:15,581 --> 01:06:18,460
Chief Inspector! Headquarters checked Mr. Sekine's phone.

1417
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,585
He got a strange email just moments before the explosion!

1418
01:06:21,793 --> 01:06:22,851
Well what did it say?

1419
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:25,000
It looks like the sender was anonymous. - Huh?

1420
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,101
But there was an image of a
Karuta card attached to the email!

1421
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:30,420
And what was the poem on that card?

1422
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,155
Ah! "Since I could bring no
offering, behold mount Tamuke..."

1423
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:37,680
"Here are brocades of maple
leaves, as a tribute to the gods..."

1424
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,440
That's one of Nagoro's cards!

1425
01:06:39,503 --> 01:06:40,249
Huh?

1426
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,179
What are you thinking, Heiji?

1427
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:44,585
Just give me a second.

1428
01:06:45,098 --> 01:06:46,773
I think Momiji's in danger.

1429
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,046
Mr. Iori?

1430
01:06:50,283 --> 01:06:51,905
Is this Mr. Hattori?

1431
01:06:52,223 --> 01:06:54,883
Listen, I need you to check Momiji's emails.

1432
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:57,570
See if there's anything from
an unknown address. And hurry!

1433
01:06:58,186 --> 01:06:59,148
Emails?

1434
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:00,929
What's wrong, Iori?

1435
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,163
It's a call from young Mr. Hattori.

1436
01:07:03,275 --> 01:07:06,145
Heiji is calling? Here let me see!

1437
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:09,413
Momiji! I need you to check your emails for me, okay?

1438
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,968
My emails? What's going on?

1439
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:15,874
You know, I was starting to think
you'd never call but I'm so glad you did!

1440
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:17,299
Uuh...

1441
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:17,601
Haha...

1442
01:07:17,626 --> 01:07:18,935
Hey... That's odd?

1443
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,382
Huh?

1444
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,476
There's an attachment.

1445
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,530
A Karuta card?

1446
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,038
Wow! How'd you know that Heiji?

1447
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,671
I need you to read me the poem.

1448
01:07:26,774 --> 01:07:27,694
Ah- hm...

1449
01:07:28,788 --> 01:07:32,215
"From Mimuro's mountain slopes, maple leaves are torn..."

1450
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,945
The Maple leaves..! Momiji, I need you to listen.

1451
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,600
you cannot go back home tonight!

1452
01:07:36,757 --> 01:07:39,148
Come straight to the Osaka Police Department!

1453
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:40,468
You hear me?

1454
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,780
I can't do that, my dear. Not even for you.

1455
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,257
Huh?!

1456
01:07:44,577 --> 01:07:47,327
The Satsuki Cup is tomorrow, and I must prepare.

1457
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:51,077
Momiji, I don't think you
understand! Your life may be in danger!

1458
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,952
Nothing bad will happen to
me. After all Heiji, I have you!

1459
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:55,496
Ugh..!

1460
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,851
You're going to protect me.

1461
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,296
I know you will.

1462
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,163
Huh?

1463
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:01,905
I haven't forgotten the promise we made.

1464
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:03,365
What promise?

1465
01:08:03,734 --> 01:08:04,515
Bye now!

1466
01:08:04,964 --> 01:08:05,663
Wha-!

1467
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:08,515
Damn it! She hung up on me!

1468
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,648
In any case, if she received one
of those threats we need her secure.

1469
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,460
Hmm...

1470
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,550
Then let's move. I want a full
security detail on Miss Ooka immediately!

1471
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,218
Yes, sir!

1472
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:23,312
Hmm... It would appear Mr. Yajima is
the only one that a card wasn't sent to...

1473
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:28,093
That actually isn't the truth. There was a
threat card found where Yajima was murdered.

1474
01:08:28,299 --> 01:08:32,499
It would appear, that Nagoro is
the actual murderer of Mr. Yajima.

1475
01:08:32,851 --> 01:08:35,819
Before he left the scene, he
left his favorite card on the body.

1476
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:40,671
Sekine saw the card when he arrived later,
and attempted to conceal Nagoro's involvement.

1477
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:43,632
So what you're saying is he
knew that Nagoro was the killer...

1478
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:46,921
And moreover, the presence of
that Karuta card would implicate him.

1479
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:50,163
So Sekine staged a robbery, and ransacked the house.

1480
01:08:50,327 --> 01:08:53,116
All to cover up the crime his former master had committed.

1481
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:53,859
Hold on...

1482
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,882
Are you suggesting Sekine was at the
crime scene even before the police arrived?

1483
01:08:58,023 --> 01:09:00,734
Yes, it's the only thing that ties the theories together.

1484
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,077
As to evidence...

1485
01:09:02,915 --> 01:09:04,038
We called in an expert.

1486
01:09:04,796 --> 01:09:07,890
Using the direction and pattern of the
blood stains, on the cards and the carpet...

1487
01:09:07,929 --> 01:09:08,296
Good.

1488
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:12,179
She has determined precisely how the
cards were lined up at the time of the murder.

1489
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,726
Take a look at the screen.

1490
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:19,390
The cards on the right were already on the
floor. So they have Mr. Yajima's blood on them.

1491
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,180
As for the cards on the left...

1492
01:09:21,264 --> 01:09:26,140
Some were clean and others were smeared with
blood as the killer attempted to mix them in.

1493
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:31,150
And some are slightly bent. Judging by
that as well as the other bloodstains...

1494
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,804
The card in Mr. Yajima's hand was...

1495
01:09:34,525 --> 01:09:35,562
Number 32!

1496
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,398
That's a Harumichi!

1497
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:41,910
"High in a mountain stream, there
is a barrier built by the wind..."

1498
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:44,554
"Yet it is only maple leaves that cannot escape..."

1499
01:09:44,832 --> 01:09:48,984
Okay, so one of Nagoro's favorite
cards was found at the crime scene too!

1500
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:52,457
Look at this. These are the
cards that accompanied each crime.

1501
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:56,085
From the upper left, found at Nichiuri TV.

1502
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:57,804
Yajima's residence.

1503
01:09:58,184 --> 01:09:59,534
Sekine's email.

1504
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:02,007
And the one Momiji just found.

1505
01:10:02,984 --> 01:10:06,984
Only a single word, "Momiji" appears in all four cards.

1506
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,485
Good work. They're all part of the
cards Nagoro has a preference for.

1507
01:10:10,757 --> 01:10:15,961
Hmm... So our killer, either shares
that proclivity, or must be Shikao Nagoro.

1508
01:10:17,461 --> 01:10:21,915
I didn't want to believe Nagoro would be
capable of such things, but it must be him.

1509
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,399
What worries me is there are 6 maple
cards Nagoro always used to win...

1510
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,571
So we better keep our eyes open.

1511
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,875
What do you mean by that?

1512
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,165
He means there are still two cards left.

1513
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:37,352
If Nagoro is using his favorite Karuta Poems
as a calling card before every single attack,

1514
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:40,800
then I have no doubt in my mind
he's got a plan ready for the last two.

1515
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,080
There may be more after Miss Ooka?

1516
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:46,615
I'm certain that he's got 2
more victims waiting in the wings.

1517
01:10:46,704 --> 01:10:47,790
Time's a factor.

1518
01:10:48,032 --> 01:10:50,547
Nagoro has already begun to exact his revenge.

1519
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:55,480
Well done! You boys are truly incredible. I'm
certain you'll bring this murderer to justice!

1520
01:10:55,524 --> 01:10:59,133
Mm. But in order to do that,
we're gonna need more information.

1521
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:02,618
So just what happened between you and Mr. Nagoro?

1522
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,184
I... I already...

1523
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,555
Something happened.

1524
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:07,681
Do you want to help us or not?

1525
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,829
I do but...

1526
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:12,704
Fine... I couldn't say before, but I trust you.

1527
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,086
Come by my hotel this evening.

1528
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:19,269
... and I'll fill you both in on
what exactly happened five years ago.

1529
01:11:20,968 --> 01:11:22,665
Okay, you guys wait here!

1530
01:11:23,189 --> 01:11:24,938
I'll run this inside to Momiji.

1531
01:11:25,016 --> 01:11:25,702
Okay!

1532
01:11:25,727 --> 01:11:26,374
Not a problem!

1533
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:27,383
Sounds good!

1534
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,360
Ma'am. The police called just a moment ago.

1535
01:11:30,616 --> 01:11:33,399
They wanted your permission to
increase security around the house.

1536
01:11:33,577 --> 01:11:35,344
Then I will trust their judgement.

1537
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,165
Excuse me?

1538
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:36,480
Huh?

1539
01:11:36,813 --> 01:11:40,172
I'm glad to hear you're okay. I
stopped by to drop off your wallet!

1540
01:11:40,313 --> 01:11:42,696
Ah! I'm so glad you came!

1541
01:11:43,448 --> 01:11:46,391
I'm in your debt! Truly, thank you so much!

1542
01:11:46,461 --> 01:11:47,321
It's okay!

1543
01:11:48,056 --> 01:11:50,540
Here you go. Really I'm just happy to help.

1544
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,110
Ah! So sweet! The lucky charm in here means so much to me.

1545
01:11:55,282 --> 01:11:59,250
I wasn't sure I'd do well in the competition
without it. But now I'm certain I'll win!

1546
01:12:00,579 --> 01:12:02,615
Though I suppose I shouldn't have mentioned that.

1547
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,375
I certainly don't want you to feel
as though you're aiding the enemy.

1548
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,524
Uh- no!

1549
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,844
I do hope your friend doesn't hurt
her fingers from practicing too hard.

1550
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:12,696
Such pretty nails!

1551
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:16,110
The manicure is more about keeping
them protected than anything else.

1552
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,977
You have to make sure they're cared for to play well.

1553
01:12:19,172 --> 01:12:21,204
So I do my best to keep them like this.

1554
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,680
Well, they're beautiful!

1555
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:23,730
Oh and...

1556
01:12:24,032 --> 01:12:27,114
I had to look inside your case
for your contact info, so...

1557
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:27,469
Ah...

1558
01:12:27,813 --> 01:12:29,422
I may have seen something...

1559
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:32,618
Ah! I'm going to bet you mean this photograph, don't you?

1560
01:12:33,589 --> 01:12:35,344
Because it kind of looks like...

1561
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:36,985
It's little Heiji!

1562
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:37,957
Thought so...

1563
01:12:38,165 --> 01:12:41,336
It's from a Karuta contest I
entered when I was just a child.

1564
01:12:41,407 --> 01:12:43,820
It was Heiji who beat me in the final round.

1565
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,461
I was crying... When Heiji saw he walked over and said...

1566
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,370
Hey, don't cry.

1567
01:12:51,664 --> 01:12:55,188
Because the next time we meet,
I'm going to take you for my bride.

1568
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:57,329
Uh... Really?

1569
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,711
Really.

1570
01:12:59,665 --> 01:13:00,633
I promise.

1571
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,133
Huh?!

1572
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:03,688
He proposed to her?!

1573
01:13:03,922 --> 01:13:07,071
And that's the moment sweet Heiji became my husband to be.

1574
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:10,336
But you can't be serious, you were only little kids!

1575
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:11,786
A promise is still a promise.

1576
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:12,243
Uuh...

1577
01:13:12,376 --> 01:13:16,555
When a man says something like that, they shouldn't
be able to just change their minds the next day.

1578
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,094
Ah...

1579
01:13:17,555 --> 01:13:21,625
I wish I could Ran, but I can't
read the mind of a girl I really like!

1580
01:13:22,392 --> 01:13:23,571
I guess you're right...

1581
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:25,290
"A swift stream..."

1582
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:29,797
"Though it becomes divided by a boulder...
Will one day join together again..."

1583
01:13:30,891 --> 01:13:31,469
Huh...

1584
01:13:31,524 --> 01:13:32,883
I've always believed.

1585
01:13:32,945 --> 01:13:37,782
Even though Heiji and I were so
far apart, our hearts were still one.

1586
01:13:39,516 --> 01:13:41,188
Tell Miss Leaf something for me.

1587
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,516
Uh... Miss Leaf?

1588
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:46,102
I was taught... When I choose a Karuta card to go after...

1589
01:13:46,281 --> 01:13:48,234
Never let anyone take it from me.

1590
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:50,334
Momiji...

1591
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,282
Ran?

1592
01:13:51,754 --> 01:13:52,161
Ran!

1593
01:13:52,185 --> 01:13:52,493
Huh?!

1594
01:13:52,774 --> 01:13:53,387
Yeah?

1595
01:13:53,532 --> 01:13:55,243
What is going on with you?

1596
01:13:55,385 --> 01:13:58,565
You've been acting weird ever since
you came back from looking around the city.

1597
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,500
Sorry.

1598
01:13:59,749 --> 01:14:01,169
How are you feeling, Kazuha?

1599
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:03,508
Huh? Okay, I guess...

1600
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:08,896
Heiji's mother told me that if I want a real chance at
winning the competition. I have to pick a favorite card.

1601
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:11,997
But there are so many... It's hard to decide.

1602
01:14:12,485 --> 01:14:14,337
I think you're over complicating it.

1603
01:14:14,361 --> 01:14:14,911
Huh?

1604
01:14:15,825 --> 01:14:18,240
The Hyakunin-Isshu's full of love poems.

1605
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:20,411
So why don't you stop thinking about winning,

1606
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,919
and pick a poem that really speaks to you?

1607
01:14:24,511 --> 01:14:25,919
That speaks to me...

1608
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,868
For me... I would pick this one!

1609
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,399
Oh, that's Meeting on the Path! By Murasaki Shikibu.

1610
01:14:33,894 --> 01:14:37,915
It's about friends who have to part
ways only a little while after they meet.

1611
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:42,305
Mhm, yeah. The minute I see
Shinichi, he runs off somewhere.

1612
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,899
And there's so much I want to say to him.

1613
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:47,618
That's true. I guess, for me...

1614
01:14:48,355 --> 01:14:49,493
Maybe..

1615
01:14:51,664 --> 01:14:53,212
“I promised myself..."

1616
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,282
"No one would ever know of my love for you."

1617
01:14:56,763 --> 01:14:59,344
"But in the end, my face gave me away..."

1618
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:02,067
I think it describes your feelings perfectly.

1619
01:15:02,445 --> 01:15:04,055
That's a great pick, Kazuha.

1620
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,407
Even Momiji saw how much you care for him.

1621
01:15:06,686 --> 01:15:09,726
Not that she thinks I'm gonna
be much of a challenge anyway.

1622
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:10,138
Urk...

1623
01:15:10,162 --> 01:15:12,329
She acts like they're already engaged.

1624
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,610
You saw how she's all over him!

1625
01:15:14,769 --> 01:15:15,751
I guess so...

1626
01:15:16,469 --> 01:15:20,063
Of course she's all over him.
She thinks they're already engaged.

1627
01:15:20,314 --> 01:15:22,048
Can't let Kazuha know that though.

1628
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:24,360
What?

1629
01:15:24,568 --> 01:15:29,305
So Nagoro and Satsuki had another match, the
night before they were actually supposed to compete?

1630
01:15:29,436 --> 01:15:31,829
That's right. He came by when I was out.

1631
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,579
That article says he disappeared because he
was scared of actually competing against Satsuki.

1632
01:15:36,923 --> 01:15:39,899
... But he arrived the night
before, so that can't be the truth.

1633
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,130
And do you have any idea why?

1634
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:46,571
I don't... And unless we can find a way to
ask him, I suppose we'll never really know.

1635
01:15:46,711 --> 01:15:52,469
My wife believed he wanted to use our Association's
cards to defeat her, thus adding insult to injury.

1636
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,219
Was that the deck they used?

1637
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:58,985
I thought those cards were being kept in a museum
when they weren't being used for the Satsuki Cup?

1638
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:03,782
At that time, no one had ever attempted
to steal them. So we just kept them at home.

1639
01:16:04,009 --> 01:16:07,024
How could they have had a match
without someone to read off the poetry?

1640
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:10,014
Well, you see all those cassettes in the cabinet there?

1641
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:13,868
That's how even the best used to
practice Karuta back in the old days.

1642
01:16:14,217 --> 01:16:16,274
And then? How did the match turn out?

1643
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,196
Satsuki beat him out right. - Hm...

1644
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:21,594
Seems line Nagoro never stood a chance against her.

1645
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:24,501
I was coming back home just as they finished the match.

1646
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,899
As soon as I opened the door, I remember
Nagoro went pale and fled in a panic.

1647
01:16:29,071 --> 01:16:32,173
Neither I, nor anyone else, has seen him since that day.

1648
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:35,454
After he disappeared, why didn't
you tell the police any of this?

1649
01:16:35,485 --> 01:16:39,587
Honestly, I was worried it might leak
to the media and the other club members.

1650
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:44,743
The rest of them would have been far from happy if
they'd known we used those cards for a private match.

1651
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,329
I thought it best to keep the whole thing quiet, frankly.

1652
01:16:47,587 --> 01:16:50,641
Not what I would have done, but fair enough I suppose...

1653
01:16:50,844 --> 01:16:53,020
It's not that I don't trust the police but...

1654
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:53,586
Huh?

1655
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:54,817
You detectives always seem at least a step ahead.

1656
01:16:54,842 --> 01:16:56,657
Something's wrong with this picture.

1657
01:16:57,735 --> 01:17:00,782
Is it just that Achiwa had a different car back then?

1658
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,516
The two of you must capture Nagoro before it's too late.

1659
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:06,657
Yeah, we'll close this case.

1660
01:17:08,649 --> 01:17:10,481
Two cubes isn't gonna do it.

1661
01:17:10,505 --> 01:17:11,000
Huh?

1662
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,704
I'm gonna need two more...

1663
01:17:13,197 --> 01:17:15,313
My brain is craving something sweet.

1664
01:17:16,055 --> 01:17:17,001
Uuh... Mhm!

1665
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:18,587
She heard that?

1666
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,571
Hmph.This girl...

1667
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,087
I'm no good at using "Kakoite" or "Watarite" yet.

1668
01:17:25,438 --> 01:17:27,127
And I can't find a rhythm...

1669
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:28,743
If I can't get better...

1670
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:31,548
She's gonna take Heiji away from me, I know it!

1671
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,610
Hey, Kazuha!

1672
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:33,458
Huh?

1673
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,954
Looks like you're out for blood.

1674
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,170
Aah! Heiji!

1675
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,891
All geared up for a fight, huh?

1676
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,243
Why don't you just shut up?

1677
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:44,352
Aren't you supposed to be watching over
Momiji? Why don't you run on back then?

1678
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,696
What is up with you?

1679
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:50,368
I came all the way back here to give my old
lady a break, so why are you being so mean to me?

1680
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:52,310
I used to beat you all the time!

1681
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:56,391
Oh, I'm way better than I was in grade
school! I'd wipe the floor with you.

1682
01:17:56,451 --> 01:17:57,696
Hey, I was wondering...

1683
01:17:57,804 --> 01:18:02,063
Do you remember anything strange about the
Karuta contest you entered when you were a kid?

1684
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:05,411
Like specifically, about the girl in the finals?

1685
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:07,570
Actually, I think I do! That's it!

1686
01:18:07,837 --> 01:18:09,266
I was winning left and right!

1687
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,258
Hold on a sec, did you remember something after all?

1688
01:18:12,409 --> 01:18:16,930
Yeah, I won in the finals over some girl
and she just starting crying like crazy!

1689
01:18:17,161 --> 01:18:18,946
I think that girl was Momiji!

1690
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:20,587
Wait, really?!

1691
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,055
Anything else that comes to mind?

1692
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:22,428
Huh?

1693
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:23,712
Don't think so?

1694
01:18:23,777 --> 01:18:26,790
Like maybe making a promise to little Momiji or something?

1695
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,915
I think I might have said, "Better
luck next time!" or something...

1696
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,240
Doesn't matter. Just got back to her.

1697
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:32,630
Hm?

1698
01:18:32,655 --> 01:18:34,454
You're supposed to be her bodyguard right?

1699
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,150
I'm pretty sure the police are gonna...

1700
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,227
Just go, okay?

1701
01:18:37,899 --> 01:18:41,977
If she gets hurt before the
contest, then I won't be able to win.

1702
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:45,602
Fine. I guess I'll go then...

1703
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:46,602
Mom.

1704
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:47,883
Good luck with training.

1705
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:48,508
Hm.

1706
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,219
Uuh...

1707
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,164
"I promised myself..."

1708
01:18:52,688 --> 01:18:55,251
"No one would ever know of my love for you..."

1709
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:58,883
"But in the end, my face gave me away..."

1710
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,751
"And people asked me, 'what's wrong?'"

1711
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:07,040
Master Nagoro.

1712
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:10,774
Please guide me in this competition,
as you have always done before.

1713
01:19:17,571 --> 01:19:19,280
My most precious Satsuki...

1714
01:19:20,016 --> 01:19:21,211
Watch over us...

1715
01:19:29,563 --> 01:19:34,938
"These plum blossoms in Naniwazu..."

1716
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,297
"Once sheltered in winter..."

1717
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:42,422
"But now that spring crosses the land..."

1718
01:19:42,817 --> 01:19:46,844
"At long last they have bloomed..."

1719
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:56,297
"These plum blossoms... At long last they have bloomed..."

1720
01:19:56,746 --> 01:19:57,594
Hm...

1721
01:19:59,649 --> 01:20:01,149
"From Mount Yoshino..."

1722
01:20:03,094 --> 01:20:05,055
She did it! She got the card!

1723
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:08,196
Good think she wore that
uniform! It makes her easy to spot!

1724
01:20:08,453 --> 01:20:09,164
Uh-huh!

1725
01:20:09,368 --> 01:20:11,469
Isn't that an Aikido uniform?

1726
01:20:12,126 --> 01:20:15,220
Something just came up. He had to go help out Heiji!

1727
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,899
Otherwise he'd be here for sure!

1728
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:18,125
Hey, you guys!

1729
01:20:18,469 --> 01:20:22,047
Why don't send Conan that picture we
took, of Genta at the souvenir shop?

1730
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:22,684
Hmm...

1731
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:23,954
They were so mad!

1732
01:20:26,876 --> 01:20:28,352
Sounds like it started.

1733
01:20:28,431 --> 01:20:29,091
Guess so.

1734
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:33,383
With security as tight as it is now,
there's no chance Nagoro can get in.

1735
01:20:33,475 --> 01:20:35,352
That's right. We're ready for him.

1736
01:20:35,894 --> 01:20:37,725
No one will be able to make it through the gate.

1737
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,961
Unless they registered as staff beforehand.

1738
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:43,502
We did thorough background checks.

1739
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:45,677
We took every possible measure.

1740
01:20:45,701 --> 01:20:46,165
Huh?

1741
01:20:46,878 --> 01:20:47,698
What's wrong?

1742
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,821
Uh, it's probably nothing...

1743
01:20:50,586 --> 01:20:51,227
Huh?

1744
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,368
What's this?

1745
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:54,665
Oh, it's from Mitsuhiko.

1746
01:20:55,813 --> 01:20:59,539
What's Genta doing? Grabbing
food like that with his bare hands..

1747
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:02,766
I see.

1748
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,770
"As the dew..."

1749
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:08,844
"Promises the thirsty..."

1750
01:21:28,219 --> 01:21:30,508
Momiji... She's the first to move up.

1751
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:32,086
Did Kazuha win yet?

1752
01:21:32,196 --> 01:21:33,420
No, not yet.

1753
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,579
Hey! Look that's her!

1754
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:37,626
It is! It's Kazuha!

1755
01:21:37,696 --> 01:21:38,743
Aw yeah!

1756
01:21:38,837 --> 01:21:40,274
Keep on going Kazuha!

1757
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:44,391
She got through the first round. Not a bad start at all.

1758
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,227
Mr. Sekine! Are you alright?

1759
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:39,555
Thank you for the match.

1760
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:42,395
Who would have thought she'd make it to the finals?

1761
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,454
I'm just surprised to find a
player with that much raw talent.

1762
01:22:48,008 --> 01:22:49,258
Hooray!

1763
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:50,836
You think she'll win?

1764
01:22:50,942 --> 01:22:52,047
No question!

1765
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:55,485
It's really happening! She's on her way to victory!

1766
01:22:56,123 --> 01:22:57,985
She's so caught up in the moment...

1767
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:01,688
I wonder if she's thinking of what
she'll say to Heiji if she wins...

1768
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,505
So she's still in! That's great to see.

1769
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:07,788
Looks like she's up against Momiji in the finals.

1770
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:08,415
That's right.

1771
01:23:08,766 --> 01:23:09,150
What?!

1772
01:23:09,232 --> 01:23:09,852
Huh?

1773
01:23:10,143 --> 01:23:12,571
You're telling me, Mr. Sekine is awake again?

1774
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:15,493
Uh-huh... Yes I understand.

1775
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:19,099
I'll leave security here to the
Kyoto Police and be there soon.

1776
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:21,040
Sekine regained consciousness?

1777
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:25,024
Yeah that's right, and it turns out
Heiji's prediction was right on the money.

1778
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:28,133
I still don't see why Sekine went to Yajima's...

1779
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:32,165
Sounds like Yajima had been asking a
lot of questions about Nagoro recently.

1780
01:23:32,766 --> 01:23:34,063
Sekine found out...

1781
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:39,461
I suppose he thought if he kept a close eye on
Yajima, he might be able to track down his former mentor.

1782
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:44,477
So you think Sekine realized something had
gone wrong and stormed in only to find the body?

1783
01:23:44,616 --> 01:23:45,563
It's likely...

1784
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:50,063
I'll be sure to get all the details from
Mr. Sekine as soon as I'm back in Osaka.

1785
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:53,255
All right. Kyoto will handle things while you're gone.

1786
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:53,704
Good.

1787
01:23:54,086 --> 01:23:56,149
Hey, hold on. I'll go with you!

1788
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:02,140
Hmm... This is the last one.

1789
01:24:02,406 --> 01:24:06,360
Can't imagine why he wants it
here but... At least it's over with.

1790
01:24:07,624 --> 01:24:08,093
Huh?!

1791
01:24:11,196 --> 01:24:12,251
Is there a fire?

1792
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:14,360
If there was, the alarms would be going off...

1793
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,610
Think it's another bomb?

1794
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:17,297
There's no way. You've got to be kidding!

1795
01:24:17,836 --> 01:24:19,172
What's going on out there?

1796
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,258
Hey, what's out in the west forrest?

1797
01:24:22,352 --> 01:24:25,360
Oh uh, nothing but an old storeroom I think, sir.

1798
01:24:25,446 --> 01:24:27,290
Are there any security cameras?

1799
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,602
Nothing outside the facility is covered.

1800
01:24:29,797 --> 01:24:30,597
Damn it all...

1801
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:33,460
You think it's another explosion?

1802
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:34,790
It is... Come on!

1803
01:24:39,555 --> 01:24:42,290
That's the Satsukido. We'll be there shortly.

1804
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:44,516
Wow...

1805
01:24:46,094 --> 01:24:47,751
There's a smell in the air...

1806
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:48,799
Ah...

1807
01:24:49,046 --> 01:24:50,851
We've just had the elevator refitted.

1808
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:55,188
Some of the lubricant smell must still
linger... I'm sorry, does it bother you?

1809
01:24:55,315 --> 01:24:59,149
No, it's fine. I was just
curious. This is all so new to me.

1810
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:02,876
I'm incredibly excited and, I'm
sure I can't be the only one...

1811
01:25:03,032 --> 01:25:07,586
To tell the truth, I never thought I'd get
this far, and my heart's beating out of my chest...

1812
01:25:07,611 --> 01:25:09,883
But I'm sure you're used to all this...

1813
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,929
I promise my heart is beating just as hard as yours.

1814
01:25:12,953 --> 01:25:13,350
Huh?

1815
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:19,782
I'm in love with Heiji. I can't wait to tell him
everything I feel, but I don't know what he'll say.

1816
01:25:20,688 --> 01:25:23,993
I won't lose... I can't lose...

1817
01:25:25,586 --> 01:25:27,641
You don't want to get any closer than this.

1818
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:29,407
What's going on?

1819
01:25:29,432 --> 01:25:29,876
Inspector!

1820
01:25:30,141 --> 01:25:30,872
Oh.

1821
01:25:30,896 --> 01:25:31,855
Another bomb?

1822
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,649
Yes, sir. One victim...

1823
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,344
The body's in bad shape...

1824
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,524
We won't be able to identify it
until we get back to the morgue.

1825
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,672
So the bomb was set here...

1826
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:43,524
The question is exactly how, and when?

1827
01:25:43,612 --> 01:25:47,719
Based on early evidence, we think it's
possible the victim brought the bomb in himself, sir

1828
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,461
He what?

1829
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,946
Nagoro accidentally blew himself up?

1830
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,094
Sir!

1831
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:53,688
Hm?

1832
01:25:54,926 --> 01:25:57,149
Yes, this is Inspector Ayanokoji.

1833
01:25:59,094 --> 01:25:59,641
Ah...

1834
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,469
What's wrong?

1835
01:26:00,973 --> 01:26:03,071
Hattori, take a look at that.

1836
01:26:03,174 --> 01:26:05,344
What is it? A ring?

1837
01:26:05,463 --> 01:26:06,829
Probably the victim's.

1838
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,461
There you are. What have you found?

1839
01:26:09,523 --> 01:26:12,555
Take a look a the ring in this
tree. We think it may be the victim's.

1840
01:26:12,615 --> 01:26:13,993
It's rather bulky...

1841
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:16,594
Yeah, they're not usually so big.

1842
01:26:16,929 --> 01:26:18,969
A big ring? Wait...

1843
01:26:21,836 --> 01:26:22,844
... It's Kaieda!

1844
01:26:22,914 --> 01:26:26,547
Huh? Wait, you mean Achiwa's secretary? Togo Kaieda?

1845
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:30,883
Yeah, I'm positive! In pictures, he
was always wearing it on his thumb!

1846
01:26:31,594 --> 01:26:33,927
If that's his ring, is Kaieda our murderer?

1847
01:26:33,951 --> 01:26:34,422
No...

1848
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:40,391
No, because If we hadn't found this ring, then we would
be absolutely sure that the body over there is Nagoro's!

1849
01:26:40,464 --> 01:26:45,032
Now I see... This bomb was supposed to
make it look like Mr. Nagoro had died.

1850
01:26:45,057 --> 01:26:45,493
Huh?

1851
01:26:45,646 --> 01:26:46,375
Hold on...

1852
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,641
If the real murderer wanted to
make it look like Nagoro was dead...

1853
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:54,571
Then what about the other two maple leaf cards?
They've probably already been sent out to the targets!

1854
01:26:54,672 --> 01:26:56,266
We already know one.

1855
01:26:56,407 --> 01:26:58,663
I got another call from Inspector Otaki.

1856
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:03,204
And he told me that he had Mr. Achiwa's
secretary go over his emails again.

1857
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:06,209
A Karuta card had arrived in the mail this morning.

1858
01:27:06,391 --> 01:27:08,499
Which means there's only one card left.

1859
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:09,172
Ugh...

1860
01:27:09,843 --> 01:27:11,141
One card left...

1861
01:27:11,181 --> 01:27:13,141
And only the finals to play.

1862
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,040
That's it!

1863
01:27:15,164 --> 01:27:15,649
Huh?

1864
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:20,180
If Mr. Achiwa already received
his card, there's only one card left.

1865
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:24,969
The only reason there would still be one
card is if he hadn't decided who to send it to!

1866
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:29,196
Oh no, Inspector! Get someone to
check Kazuha Toyama's phone, hurry!

1867
01:27:29,283 --> 01:27:32,172
Huh? Yeah! But tell me what's going on?

1868
01:27:32,235 --> 01:27:35,024
That's why there's only one card not accounted for!

1869
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:39,180
The killer held onto it because he didn't
know who was gonna make it to the finals!

1870
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,876
You're saying...

1871
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,297
His targets..!

1872
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,555
Are the finalists in the Satsukido!

1873
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,141
I am sorry that it had to be you.

1874
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:47,922
Huh?

1875
01:27:48,647 --> 01:27:53,649
I know there is such pressure in a match of this
caliber, but play to the best of your abilities.

1876
01:27:54,101 --> 01:27:55,836
We'll do our very best.

1877
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,610
Ready, set... Go Kazuha!

1878
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:05,383
Time to show them just how skilled you are.

1879
01:28:09,016 --> 01:28:10,149
What have you got?

1880
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:12,071
Did you find the card?

1881
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:15,946
Yes, she just got it. About 15 minutes ago.

1882
01:28:16,454 --> 01:28:18,215
A poem was sent to Kazuha.

1883
01:28:18,243 --> 01:28:21,440
Tell them to cancel the finals right now! Get moving!

1884
01:28:21,465 --> 01:28:22,440
Come on, Kudo!

1885
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:23,477
Where are you going?

1886
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:24,844
We'll take the bike!

1887
01:28:25,345 --> 01:28:27,836
What? Sir, you want me to cancel the finals?

1888
01:28:27,919 --> 01:28:29,336
Yes, sir. Right away!

1889
01:28:29,493 --> 01:28:31,196
One moment, I'll give them a call!

1890
01:28:31,821 --> 01:28:32,547
Huh?

1891
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,922
Huh?

1892
01:28:39,219 --> 01:28:42,586
Just an earthquake. I'm certain
it's not big enough to worry about.

1893
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:43,594
Let's...

1894
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:47,743
Hey, why'd it cut out?

1895
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,470
Do you think maybe it's broken?

1896
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:50,422
Oh, come on.

1897
01:28:50,463 --> 01:28:51,516
It's a black out?

1898
01:28:51,601 --> 01:28:53,258
No, the lights are on.

1899
01:28:53,844 --> 01:28:55,524
Hurry! It's started!

1900
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:57,586
Yeah! Hang on tight!

1901
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:04,685
How are we gonna get to the Satsukido?!

1902
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,641
Just trust me! I've got an idea.

1903
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:07,950
That's never good!

1904
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:13,012
I've never seen that water gleam...

1905
01:29:13,036 --> 01:29:13,899
Thought so...

1906
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,047
Miss Leaf didn't even try...

1907
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:18,946
She won't bother going for the cards I'm good at.

1908
01:29:20,266 --> 01:29:21,391
In this dire distress...

1909
01:29:24,126 --> 01:29:26,360
Damn, that's no ordinary fire.

1910
01:29:26,915 --> 01:29:29,655
There must be some kind of
accelerant fueling the fire, Inspector.

1911
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,516
Have the Firefighters arrived yet?

1912
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:34,969
The roads in the garden are so narrow that
there's now way for the engines to get through...

1913
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:38,325
It's only a matter of time
before the tower goes up in flames!

1914
01:29:38,405 --> 01:29:38,930
Yes, sir.

1915
01:29:39,204 --> 01:29:40,618
Then the game is up...

1916
01:30:07,086 --> 01:30:10,047
Hey, do you still think that Nagoro is the killer?

1917
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:14,045
No, only one person could have
re-registered Kaieda as staff!

1918
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:15,891
Even though he quit the association!

1919
01:30:16,106 --> 01:30:18,526
Only one person could have given him the bomb..!

1920
01:30:19,009 --> 01:30:20,797
President Kensuke Achiwa!

1921
01:30:21,118 --> 01:30:24,524
I think he's planning to blow himself
up and take the two girls with him!

1922
01:30:24,761 --> 01:30:27,172
Not if I have anything to say about it!

1923
01:30:28,171 --> 01:30:30,219
The card's in a tough to reach spot...

1924
01:30:30,495 --> 01:30:35,227
And Momiji knows it's the poem I love...
No way is she gonna make this easy...

1925
01:30:35,325 --> 01:30:38,610
Hmph. She's going after this card for sure.

1926
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:42,352
Well, she can't have it. My card, my win.

1927
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:47,016
I have to get it... I have to! No matter what it takes.

1928
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,836
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

1929
01:30:52,985 --> 01:30:55,688
Get this stupid pounding out of my head!

1930
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,547
Hey, Kazuha!

1931
01:30:57,094 --> 01:30:58,532
Looks like you're out for blood.

1932
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,243
All geared up for a fight, huh?

1933
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,080
A moment, please.

1934
01:31:03,273 --> 01:31:03,805
Hm.

1935
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:09,352
I'm not supposed to fight. It won't help.

1936
01:31:10,196 --> 01:31:14,071
The hum of the air conditioner,
the rustling of my kimono...

1937
01:31:14,506 --> 01:31:16,360
The soft tap upon the cards...

1938
01:31:16,961 --> 01:31:18,071
The beat of my heart...

1939
01:31:18,649 --> 01:31:24,743
These sounds that fill my mind. All of
them are a part of me. They make me who I am.

1940
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:28,696
Thank you, sir.

1941
01:31:30,037 --> 01:31:31,876
I will find the real sound!

1942
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:39,946
Of the pine trees growing there, I come back to you...

1943
01:31:52,688 --> 01:31:54,770
We were supposed to believe all these crimes,

1944
01:31:54,794 --> 01:31:58,227
were Nagoro's attempt to take
revenge on the Satsuki Association.

1945
01:31:58,472 --> 01:32:00,922
That's what Achiwa wanted us to think!

1946
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:04,383
Nagoro and Satsuki were set to play
a match over the fate of their clubs.

1947
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:07,446
But instead Nagoro showed up the
night before and they played then!

1948
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:11,274
Achiwa told us that Satsuki won that match...

1949
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:14,105
But there's something that's been bothering me about it.

1950
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:16,140
It was the picture in the article wasn't it?

1951
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:23,336
Yeah. The article said Mr. Achiwa always washes his
car, before one of Satsuki's games for good luck...

1952
01:32:23,555 --> 01:32:25,251
But the car was dirty!

1953
01:32:25,899 --> 01:32:28,649
He didn't have to take the time to wash it as usual.

1954
01:32:28,821 --> 01:32:31,399
Because he knew Nagoro wouldn't show!

1955
01:32:31,531 --> 01:32:34,227
Cold and unpitying was my love...

1956
01:32:34,586 --> 01:32:37,320
Nice try, but I know I was faster this time.

1957
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:40,321
No, you may have been close, but I was faster!

1958
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:45,047
In fact, I think you'd know
that better than anybody! Hands off.

1959
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:45,813
Hm...

1960
01:32:47,313 --> 01:32:51,079
When this competition began I never
imagined this is how it would play out...

1961
01:32:54,532 --> 01:32:57,641
But if Satsuki actually lost
that match from five years ago,

1962
01:32:57,889 --> 01:32:59,680
that sounds like motive to me!

1963
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,657
Me too! To protect the honor
of the club, he silenced Nagoro!

1964
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:08,730
When Yajima saw footage of the
contest, he must have realized,

1965
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,790
what had really happened, and what Mr. Achiwa had done!

1966
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,555
So what evidence was hidden in those Karuta cards!?

1967
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:19,490
If Mr. Achiwa grabbed the cards after they
had been splattered with Nagoro's blood...

1968
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:20,868
There'd be fingerprints!

1969
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:23,938
I didn't realize until Mitsuhiko sent me that picture!

1970
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:27,899
But I'm pretty sure that
Mr.Achiwa's prints are on those cards.

1971
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,977
That's why Yajima wanted to do a
Karuta broadcast with the Association!

1972
01:33:33,001 --> 01:33:36,422
... so footage of the cards they
played with could be used as evidence!

1973
01:33:37,049 --> 01:33:42,024
It's also why the bombing and Yajima's
murder occurred at approximately the same time.

1974
01:33:42,251 --> 01:33:43,071
Of course!

1975
01:33:43,196 --> 01:33:44,743
There's one other thing bothering me though!

1976
01:33:45,383 --> 01:33:48,797
Why bring the crime to his own
hall, or the finals for that matter?!

1977
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:54,196
What if Nagoro's body is buried at
Satsukido? What if it has always been there?

1978
01:33:54,597 --> 01:33:57,055
That really would be the perfect place, wouldn't it?

1979
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,024
Achiwa had this whole thing
planned out from the beginning!

1980
01:34:01,272 --> 01:34:05,321
Even if he managed to pull of the
perfect crime and frame Mr. Nagoro...

1981
01:34:05,565 --> 01:34:08,454
It would all be for naught if
the body was discovered later!

1982
01:34:10,586 --> 01:34:11,544
Ah, there it is!

1983
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:11,975
Yeah!

1984
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:18,282
I dislike nothing so much as the breaking light of day...

1985
01:34:18,446 --> 01:34:20,302
The depths of the hearts...

1986
01:34:20,326 --> 01:34:21,094
A fake!

1987
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:23,329
The fire's so high up already!

1988
01:34:23,495 --> 01:34:24,485
Not good!

1989
01:34:24,844 --> 01:34:27,571
We've gotta put it out... But what can we do?!

1990
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:31,954
That's on you Kudo! I need you to
figure out how to extinguish the fire!

1991
01:34:32,577 --> 01:34:34,274
What are you doing?! Wait!!

1992
01:34:34,677 --> 01:34:36,508
Here we go!

1993
01:34:49,641 --> 01:34:50,610
Go!

1994
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,243
What's going on?!

1995
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:56,141
Hup!

1996
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,090
Come on, just a little more!

1997
01:35:04,710 --> 01:35:06,954
There isn't much time! I gotta hurry!

1998
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,899
The whole tower's on fire!

1999
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:10,480
Stay right where you are!

2000
01:35:10,618 --> 01:35:11,422
Heiji?!

2001
01:35:11,447 --> 01:35:13,071
What the heck are you doing here?!

2002
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:17,909
The waterfall's changed direction!

2003
01:35:17,938 --> 01:35:18,750
It's a miracle!

2004
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:19,702
It's almost out!

2005
01:35:19,726 --> 01:35:21,540
What the hell is going on up there?

2006
01:35:25,235 --> 01:35:27,370
Looks like I made it just in the nick of time.

2007
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:28,688
Nice work there, Kudo.

2008
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,602
Heiji! How did you manage to get up here?!

2009
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,800
You both should go back inside, it's dangerous.

2010
01:35:34,825 --> 01:35:37,420
Wait, Conan?! What is going on?

2011
01:35:37,579 --> 01:35:39,083
How'd you even get here?

2012
01:35:39,107 --> 01:35:42,657
Well, maybe you're better to
answer one of those, Mr. Achiwa.

2013
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,086
What are you talking about?

2014
01:35:44,243 --> 01:35:46,305
Get behind me and stay back.

2015
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,680
What? Heiji, tell me what's going on...

2016
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,680
I found the cards, but I bet you
don't want me looking at them do you?

2017
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:56,836
Just hold on! What is he talking about, Heiji?

2018
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:01,243
Mr. Achiwa here is the only one who
can finally put this case to rest...

2019
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:02,024
Huh?!

2020
01:36:02,299 --> 01:36:07,438
One year ago. That's when it all
started. When Momiji won the match here.

2021
01:36:07,955 --> 01:36:10,685
You'd seen those tactics in play only once before,

2022
01:36:10,727 --> 01:36:13,030
and her stack of victory cards
looked at lot like those that

2023
01:36:13,055 --> 01:36:15,953
Mr. Nagoro had taken during his match with your late wife.

2024
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:19,126
Master Nagoro did more than teach me offensive Karuta...

2025
01:36:19,172 --> 01:36:20,912
He taught me his favorite cards!

2026
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,227
But even so... What you're
suggesting is almost impossible.

2027
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:26,618
Almost, doesn't make it impossible.

2028
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:30,493
There are black smears on the side
of the Associations prized cards.

2029
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:35,946
And it just so happens that Mister Yajima, one of
the murder victims, was the first person to notice.

2030
01:36:36,013 --> 01:36:38,266
What could be so important about that stain?

2031
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:43,165
Because in that stain is the fingerprint of whoever
grabbed the card with Nagoro's blood spattered on it.

2032
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,477
That mark is Master Nagoro's blood?!

2033
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:50,500
It was believed Nagoro disappeared five
years ago, but in truth he was actually murdered.

2034
01:36:51,626 --> 01:36:52,240
... No...

2035
01:36:52,365 --> 01:36:54,868
And that fingerprint could only have come from...

2036
01:36:55,463 --> 01:36:56,876
Mr. Nagoro's killer.

2037
01:36:57,688 --> 01:37:01,704
Hmph... Excellent reasoning
boys. I supposed I should confess.

2038
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:06,704
But in return, I ask only that you not
submit the Association's cards as evidence.

2039
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:08,469
Please... The cards.

2040
01:37:08,494 --> 01:37:10,480
So that's the true end to the story.

2041
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:10,973
Huh?

2042
01:37:10,997 --> 01:37:13,290
There was one thing I didn't understand.

2043
01:37:13,477 --> 01:37:15,040
But now it makes sense.

2044
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,079
The fingerprints on these cards
aren't yours, are they, Mr. Achiwa?

2045
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:22,024
No, they are... I'll swear to it. They're mine.

2046
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:22,950
That's right.

2047
01:37:22,974 --> 01:37:23,383
Huh?

2048
01:37:23,553 --> 01:37:27,196
This time, you and Mr. Kaieda were
behind everything that's happened.

2049
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:31,727
But Mr. Nagoro's murder five years
ago was someone else... wasn't it?

2050
01:37:32,969 --> 01:37:34,665
Satsuki was the killer.

2051
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:39,399
Hmm...

2052
01:37:44,844 --> 01:37:48,352
As soon as I saw my Satsuki... I knew what she'd done.

2053
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:52,579
Nagoro challenged her to a match, and she lost.

2054
01:37:56,735 --> 01:38:00,665
They'd played the old way, using
one of my cassettes as the reader.

2055
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,219
It was the shame that forced her hand...

2056
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:08,071
Satsuki had practiced with those
cassettes nearly every day for so many years.

2057
01:38:08,274 --> 01:38:11,570
There were dozens of possible patterns of cards and poems,

2058
01:38:11,607 --> 01:38:14,977
But still, she had a talent, and
practically knew each of them all by heart.

2059
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,915
She started this game with a grand advantage, and yet..!

2060
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,641
Nagoro was able to defeat her so easily.

2061
01:38:21,899 --> 01:38:25,454
He was so much more gifted
than we ever could have believed.

2062
01:38:25,946 --> 01:38:28,852
I can only imagine the fear she felt in that moment...

2063
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:33,836
She must have thought of the humilitation
she knew she would have to face the next day.

2064
01:38:34,376 --> 01:38:39,040
So she took his life, because my Satsuki
could never have born the weight of that loss...

2065
01:38:39,156 --> 01:38:42,797
Where once she was beautiful and radiant, she grew hollow.

2066
01:38:43,352 --> 01:38:47,602
She abandoned her duties to the
Association... She fell ill and...

2067
01:38:47,758 --> 01:38:50,485
Two years after that day, she died...

2068
01:38:51,672 --> 01:38:52,938
This is the truth.

2069
01:38:53,596 --> 01:38:55,243
I hope that you can understand...

2070
01:38:55,399 --> 01:38:55,821
Huh?!

2071
01:38:55,977 --> 01:38:56,453
Huh?!

2072
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,157
Don't!

2073
01:38:57,216 --> 01:38:58,080
Stop this!

2074
01:38:58,414 --> 01:39:00,094
This is all Nagoro's fault.

2075
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:04,375
If he hadn't humiliated her that day,
then none of this would have ever come to pass.

2076
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,848
That wasn't what he wanted...

2077
01:39:05,872 --> 01:39:06,280
Huh?

2078
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:09,938
I know the real reason he went to
challenge Satsuki the day before...

2079
01:39:10,243 --> 01:39:10,583
Ah...

2080
01:39:10,607 --> 01:39:13,110
I asked him about the rivalry a long time ago...

2081
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:17,469
I needed to know why he held such a
strong grudge against Satsuki's Karuta Club.

2082
01:39:18,172 --> 01:39:22,313
A grudge? I suppose that's how it looks from the outside.

2083
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:26,180
This is the only way I'll have a
chance to truly play against her...

2084
01:39:26,532 --> 01:39:30,399
To win so that she might acknowledge
what a capable player I've become.

2085
01:39:31,784 --> 01:39:34,040
To hear praise from my first love.

2086
01:39:35,367 --> 01:39:36,827
His... first love?

2087
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:37,704
That's right.

2088
01:39:37,844 --> 01:39:42,461
The only reason he started playing to begin
with was because of his admiration for Satsuki.

2089
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:45,079
Then, he discovered he was sick.

2090
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:48,055
That in a year his vision would be gone completely, and...

2091
01:39:48,367 --> 01:39:51,626
I think that's why he started
playing as aggressively as he did...

2092
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,922
He was so sure he didn't have much time left.

2093
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:58,321
So Nagoro only wanted to impress her the night before.

2094
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,118
He'd always planned to let her win the actual game.

2095
01:40:01,594 --> 01:40:06,055
Master Nagoro wanted a reason for the
Satsuki Association to care for his students.

2096
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,430
He knew in the end he wouldn't
be able to care for them himself.

2097
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:14,438
The truth is Satsuki had no idea...
So she ended up killing Mr. Nagoro.

2098
01:40:17,376 --> 01:40:18,454
Please no...

2099
01:40:22,633 --> 01:40:23,579
... Satsuki.

2100
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:25,430
What have I done?

2101
01:40:33,415 --> 01:40:35,211
Wh-What's happening?!

2102
01:40:35,868 --> 01:40:36,797
Kazuha!

2103
01:40:37,113 --> 01:40:37,680
Woah!

2104
01:40:40,735 --> 01:40:41,532
Kazuha!

2105
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:42,321
Ugh...

2106
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:43,309
Are you okay?!

2107
01:40:43,333 --> 01:40:43,774
Yeah!

2108
01:40:44,377 --> 01:40:46,196
I don't know if I can stand..!

2109
01:40:51,294 --> 01:40:53,344
Hurry up! Get on the elevator!

2110
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,925
Momiji! Come on!

2111
01:40:54,993 --> 01:40:55,970
O-Okay!

2112
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,438
All right, we gotta get out of here.

2113
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:59,829
I'm staying here. Please go without me...

2114
01:40:59,854 --> 01:41:01,012
I won't leave you!

2115
01:41:01,036 --> 01:41:01,370
Huh?

2116
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,907
I'm not just gonna let you die!

2117
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,614
Momiji!

2118
01:41:04,638 --> 01:41:04,945
Huh?

2119
01:41:05,032 --> 01:41:06,422
You have to climb on!

2120
01:41:06,610 --> 01:41:07,461
A-All right..!

2121
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:09,490
Kazuha!

2122
01:41:09,586 --> 01:41:09,958
Huh?

2123
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:11,227
Climb up here!

2124
01:41:12,469 --> 01:41:13,821
Hurry! Ugh!

2125
01:41:15,391 --> 01:41:16,743
Almost!

2126
01:41:17,899 --> 01:41:18,711
I gotcha!

2127
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,370
Huh?!

2128
01:41:20,906 --> 01:41:22,056
No! No..!

2129
01:41:27,782 --> 01:41:28,555
Come on..!

2130
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,469
Stay up just a little longer!

2131
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:34,420
Woah! Ah!

2132
01:41:37,388 --> 01:41:38,899
Aah!!

2133
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,602
Haah!! Gah!

2134
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:53,836
Woah!

2135
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:55,329
Gah!

2136
01:42:02,907 --> 01:42:03,688
Ah!

2137
01:42:05,336 --> 01:42:07,094
Hang on! I'll be right there!

2138
01:42:07,264 --> 01:42:08,977
That was too close for comfort...

2139
01:42:09,587 --> 01:42:10,758
Hattori!!

2140
01:42:15,376 --> 01:42:18,696
It's all coming down! We gotta go! Get out of here!

2141
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,422
Ugh... Mm...

2142
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,501
Huh?! No, wait!

2143
01:42:26,751 --> 01:42:28,352
Don't just leave us here!

2144
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,141
Huh..? Heiji!

2145
01:42:30,305 --> 01:42:31,305
Hurry, get on!

2146
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:32,946
This one's alright.

2147
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:35,040
Hattori... Kazuha...

2148
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:37,321
You've gotta get out of there!

2149
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:45,000
Heiji, look!

2150
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:46,446
Yeah, I know.

2151
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:47,122
Hm...

2152
01:42:47,146 --> 01:42:48,782
Heiji, what are you doing?

2153
01:42:48,993 --> 01:42:50,461
I'm gonna need you to hang on tight!

2154
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:54,407
You are not planning to jump
across that gap! You are not!!

2155
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,829
I sure as hell am!

2156
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,672
Ah! No way!

2157
01:42:57,812 --> 01:43:00,282
Look how far that is! We'll never make it!

2158
01:43:01,126 --> 01:43:02,204
Listen to me!

2159
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:04,391
Let's just jump for the lake! That's safer right?

2160
01:43:04,469 --> 01:43:05,165
You can't!

2161
01:43:05,231 --> 01:43:08,696
If we hit it from this altitude,
the water would be like concrete.

2162
01:43:10,734 --> 01:43:12,414
Now hang on tight, Kazuha!

2163
01:43:12,633 --> 01:43:14,118
I won't let you die here!

2164
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:16,344
We got one shot!

2165
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,258
We're not gonna die!

2166
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:29,133
Not here, and not today!!

2167
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:34,336
Wait... is that them?!

2168
01:43:34,544 --> 01:43:36,188
There's something I have to tell you!

2169
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,370
I've been waiting a long time!

2170
01:43:40,758 --> 01:43:41,961
A motorcycle...?!

2171
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:48,501
Here we go!!!

2172
01:43:58,890 --> 01:44:00,430
Heiji!

2173
01:44:00,848 --> 01:44:02,540
Kazuha!

2174
01:44:14,422 --> 01:44:15,141
Kazuha.

2175
01:44:15,826 --> 01:44:16,469
You okay?

2176
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:18,188
Yeah.

2177
01:44:19,883 --> 01:44:22,422
I think we've cheated death enough times for one week.

2178
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,711
Hmph, those two are something else.

2179
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:31,370
Honestly, I wasn't sure we were gonna make it.

2180
01:44:31,438 --> 01:44:32,727
And if we didn't?

2181
01:44:32,786 --> 01:44:33,251
Huh?

2182
01:44:33,319 --> 01:44:35,485
What was it that you wanted to say to me?

2183
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:37,907
Uuh! I dunno what you're talking about..!

2184
01:44:38,075 --> 01:44:41,993
When we were in the air. You said
you had something you needed to tell me.

2185
01:44:42,188 --> 01:44:43,325
Maybe you were hearing things.

2186
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:46,977
No way! My hearnings pretty sharp
after all that Karuta training.

2187
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:49,571
Come on! What is it Heiji, tell me!

2188
01:44:49,596 --> 01:44:51,133
Hey wait a- woah!

2189
01:44:51,883 --> 01:44:52,751
Tell me what it is!

2190
01:44:52,776 --> 01:44:54,030
Look, I said wait a second!

2191
01:44:54,055 --> 01:44:55,887
You said you had something to say Hattori, so say it!

2192
01:44:55,911 --> 01:44:56,790
I-It's not like it...!

2193
01:48:41,573 --> 01:48:43,415
Thanks for coming out to see us off!

2194
01:48:43,564 --> 01:48:45,845
Really, we're the ones who should be thanking you!

2195
01:48:45,969 --> 01:48:48,539
By the way, what ever happened to your Karuta Club?

2196
01:48:48,861 --> 01:48:52,970
Oh yeah! The school was so impressed
that we made it all the way to the finals,

2197
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:55,275
turns out we don't have to shut down after all!

2198
01:48:55,525 --> 01:48:58,704
Thought I still can't believe
I lost in the very last round...

2199
01:49:01,196 --> 01:49:02,571
Kazuha... Uh.

2200
01:49:02,697 --> 01:49:03,611
Come here.

2201
01:49:03,755 --> 01:49:04,337
Huh?

2202
01:49:04,546 --> 01:49:05,845
What's that about?

2203
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:08,564
I dunno, must be some kind of secret.

2204
01:49:09,134 --> 01:49:09,767
Really?

2205
01:49:09,798 --> 01:49:13,243
Yeah, but it's okay. I got the card I really wanted!

2206
01:49:13,306 --> 01:49:16,197
I'm so glad you chose a poem that really spoke to you.

2207
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:20,978
Not quite. It wasn't just the poem.
It was the name of it's author too!

2208
01:49:21,379 --> 01:49:22,822
Taira-no-Kanemori.

2209
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:24,410
And it just so happens,

2210
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:27,837
his name begins with the same
exact character as Heiji's does!

2211
01:49:27,962 --> 01:49:31,439
So in my eyes, that card read simply as Heiji's name!

2212
01:49:32,228 --> 01:49:35,251
I think I wanna send a picture of the poem to Heiji later.

2213
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:37,759
I wanna telll him that's how I really feel...

2214
01:49:37,993 --> 01:49:39,689
You're going to send him a poem?

2215
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:41,548
Perhaps confess your love?

2216
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:43,939
Isn't that against the rules?

2217
01:49:44,306 --> 01:49:45,165
Momiji?

2218
01:49:45,397 --> 01:49:47,103
Did you hear all of that?

2219
01:49:47,751 --> 01:49:50,181
You aren't the only one with good ears, you know?

2220
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,486
Hey, Momiji!

2221
01:49:51,776 --> 01:49:53,907
I didn't think we'd run into you here.

2222
01:49:54,156 --> 01:49:56,790
I came to confess to you my deepest feelings.

2223
01:49:57,166 --> 01:50:00,900
Though I remember well, that beautiful
day you told me the truth of your own.

2224
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:03,040
Huh? What do you mean?

2225
01:50:03,322 --> 01:50:05,782
This picture is all the proof I need.

2226
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,462
They're pinky swearing!

2227
01:50:07,493 --> 01:50:09,439
That's pretty solid evidence...

2228
01:50:09,598 --> 01:50:12,829
If you break a pinky swear you have to swallow needles.

2229
01:50:12,854 --> 01:50:15,634
Hold on just a sec! What kind of promise did I make you?

2230
01:50:15,782 --> 01:50:18,724
That next time that we met, you'd
take me as your bride, of course?

2231
01:50:18,748 --> 01:50:19,501
Huh?!

2232
01:50:20,265 --> 01:50:23,681
Why do his embarrassing moments always get recorded...

2233
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:28,345
It's old, but this picture is
proof of the promise you swore to me.

2234
01:50:29,418 --> 01:50:32,697
Oh, I remember now. That makes way more sense!

2235
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:34,750
What I actually said was,

2236
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:40,720
"Don't cry, you've just gotta practice some more! If
you don't, next time I'm gonna take you for a ride!”

2237
01:50:41,072 --> 01:50:41,743
Uh...

2238
01:50:42,329 --> 01:50:43,266
Really..?

2239
01:50:43,751 --> 01:50:45,130
That's what you said?

2240
01:50:45,282 --> 01:50:48,368
I was going easy on her, I just
wanted her to know next time I wouldn't.

2241
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,728
Heh... It was probably stupid...

2242
01:50:51,106 --> 01:50:53,197
Iori, we're leaving.

2243
01:50:53,621 --> 01:50:54,689
Of course, ma'am.

2244
01:50:55,445 --> 01:50:57,970
Fine. I shall let you go this day.

2245
01:50:58,476 --> 01:51:02,064
But keep in mind. I never give
up a card once it's in my sights.

2246
01:51:02,599 --> 01:51:04,423
Don't you ever forget that.

2247
01:51:05,298 --> 01:51:06,032
Kazuha.

2248
01:51:06,225 --> 01:51:06,814
Huh?

2249
01:51:07,181 --> 01:51:07,580
Huh?

2250
01:51:07,892 --> 01:51:08,532
Hmph!

2251
01:51:10,051 --> 01:51:13,126
Wait, does that mean you're looking for a rematch, Momiji?

2252
01:51:20,111 --> 01:51:21,236
Hey, Sonoko?

2253
01:51:21,447 --> 01:51:24,314
You know a lot about the Hyakunin-Isshu, isn't that right?

2254
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:27,173
Yeah, my family plays Karuta every New Year's!

2255
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:30,370
I sent Shinichi a picture of
the card "Meeting on the path.

2256
01:51:30,634 --> 01:51:33,392
He sent back a poem about a stream divided.

2257
01:51:33,556 --> 01:51:36,837
It was beautiful but I totally forgot what it means.

2258
01:51:36,925 --> 01:51:40,798
"Even though in this moment I am
separated from the one who has my heart..."

2259
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,978
"One day, I know, that we will meet again."

2260
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:45,146
It's a love poem that Emperor Sutoku.

2261
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:46,243
How sweet!

2262
01:51:46,436 --> 01:51:48,157
H-Hold on! Sonoko!

2263
01:51:48,867 --> 01:51:50,829
And you better remember that...

2264
01:52:08,923 --> 01:52:09,650
Zero.
